Questions of law raised by the conflict in Iraq, some of them novel and very hard questions, have been argued in the English courts and on applications to the European Court of Human Rights since soon after the conflict began.  Until now, however, such arguments have taken place on the basis of assumed facts or limited written evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The claims have been advanced on two legal bases.  The first is the general law of tort under which a person who has suffered injury as a result of a civil wrong can claim damages from the wrongdoer.  Because the relevant events occurred in Iraq, the Iraqi law of tort is applicable to these claims.  But the claims are subject to a doctrine known as Crown act of state which (in broad terms) precludes the court from passing judgment on a claim in tort arising out of an act done with the authority of the British government in the conduct of a military operation abroad. </p>

	  <content>

Following his capture he was taken to a temporary camp which was used as a prisoner collection point.  Mr Alseran has alleged that the conditions in which he was held at this camp were inhuman and that he was assaulted by British soldiers who made the prisoners lie face down on the ground and ran over their backs.  The MOD has disputed these allegations and also required Mr Alseran to prove that the soldiers who captured and allegedly assaulted him were British (and not US) soldiers.  From the temporary camp Mr Alseran was taken to a prisoner of war internment facility near the port of Umm Qasr which became known as Camp Bucca, where he was interned for several weeks before being released. </p>

That approach was based on a wrong understanding by the MOD of the Geneva Conventions.  The correct approach would have been to consider whether there was evidence that the individual claiming civilian status was a combatant or had taken part in hostilities.  If – as in Mr Alseran’s case – there was no such evidence, then there was no power to intern him, whether as a prisoner of war or as a civilian internee.

On this basis it was lawful for British forces to arrest Mr Al-Waheed, as there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that he may have been involved in bomb-making and was therefore a threat to security.  However, following extensive interrogation, the review committee decided on 22 February 2007 that he had no connection with his brother-in-law’s activities and did not pose a threat to security and should therefore be released.  That decision was revoked the next day for reasons which do not stand scrutiny.  In consequence, Mr Al-Waheed was detained without any legal basis from 23 February 2007 until he was ultimately released on 28 March 2007, a period of 33 days.  His detention during this period violated article 5 of the European Convention and also gave </p>

It was originally going to encompass three claims arising from different phases of the Iraq conflict, but one of the claims was settled before the trial began.  A difficulty arose in the run-up to the trial when the claimants and their witnesses from Iraq were refused visas by the Home Office to enter the United Kingdom to attend court.  I invited argument on whether that refusal infringed the right to a fair trial and, if so, whether there was a legitimate basis for it.  Shortly before the argument on this question was due to be heard, entry clearance was granted and visas were issued.  In the event, seven Iraqi witnesses including the two claimants, Mr Alseran and Mr Al-Waheed, gave oral evidence at the trial.  (Another Iraqi witness who had come to the UK to give evidence did not in the event testify as her evidence was ultimately not challenged by the MOD.)  The MOD adduced evidence from three witnesses of fact in the case of Mr Alseran and from 14 witnesses of fact in the case of Mr Al-Waheed.  In addition, the parties adduced evidence from medical experts in a variety of disciplines and also from experts on the subjects of Iraqi law, conditions in Iraq and the Iraqi legal system.  The relevant parts of the proceedings were translated simultaneously from and into Arabic. </p>

In the event the Supreme Court handed down its judgments on 17 January 2017.  By that time the second trial of lead cases was imminent.  In these circumstances I heard argument on the implications of the Supreme Court’s decisions as part of the second trial.

Because the alleged mistreatment includes mistreatment of a sexual nature, which carries a heavy stigma in Iraq, these claimants have been granted anonymity and have been referred to as “MRE” and “KSU”.  At the trial of their claims in March/April 2017 both MRE and KSU gave oral evidence.  Two other Iraqi witnesses who had come to the UK to give evidence for them did not in the event testify, in one case because the witness was taken ill and in the other case because her evidence was not challenged by the MOD.  The MOD adduced evidence at this trial from no fewer than 34 factual witnesses.  Between them, the parties relied on evidence from 14 medical experts in eight different specialisms.

It is in the nature of a war between states that the participants will kill and injure each other’s citizens and deprive them of their liberty in ways that are unlikely to be lawful under the local law of the enemy state.  The law of the state whose armed forces carry out such actions may set constraints on what its armed forces may legally do.  There are also constraints which operate at the international level established by the Geneva Conventions and other rules of the body of international law now known as international humanitarian law.  But the need for such international law arises precisely because the courts of states on opposite sides of an armed conflict cannot be expected to enforce each other’s domestic law in accordance with the ordinary rules of private international law which apply in peacetime. </p>

In such a situation too the domestic tort law of the host state is unlikely to be apposite to the conduct of hostilities and the detention of suspected insurgents by foreign armed forces. </p>

She did not doubt that there is a rule of law which prevents UK courts from reviewing certain decisions of high policy taken by the executive in the conduct of foreign relations.  The question as she saw it was “whether a different type of rule, affording a tort defence even though the subject matter is entirely suitable for adjudication by a court, also exists”: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Mohammed </span>case<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2017] UKSC 1, [2017] AC 649, at para 22. Although she described its foundations as “very shaky” (ibid), Baroness Hale concluded that such a rule does indeed exist.  She based this, first, on the fact that the existence of the rule “is long-established both in the case law and in academic commentaries and texts” and, second, on her view that there are good reasons for the rule, at least in the context of military operations abroad (para 31). </p>

However, the question seems to me to have been decided by the express statement included in the order “for the avoidance of doubt” that “the conduct and/or policy in question do not have to be lawful in international law”.  I see no reason to read this statement restrictively.  The word “conduct” is broader than “act” and, as I read it, encompasses not just the particular act complained of by the claimant, such as the act of detaining him, but the conduct of the military operation in the course of which that act occurred.  Furthermore, the “policy in question” encompasses any policy pursuant to which the act was done – whether it be a detention policy applicable at a particular location, or more widely, or a policy decided at the highest level such as the policy decision to invade Iraq.  Thus, I understand the Supreme Court to have declared that the application of the Crown act of state doctrine does not depend on establishing that either the allegedly wrongful act or the wider military operation of which the act formed part or the policy decision to engage in that operation was lawful in international law. </p>

As noted by Lord Sumption in a passage quoted earlier (see paragraph 46 above), the use of armed force abroad involves acts which would normally be civil wrongs under English law or any system of municipal law.  In the old case of <span style="font-style:italic">Buron v Denman</span> (1848) 2 Exch 167, for example, there was no legal basis in English law or in any system of law for the acts of the defendant, Captain Denman, in destroying the claimant’s property and freeing his slaves.  However, the fact that the acts were ratified by the Crown was held to provide a defence.  The same would have been true if the acts of the defendant had been authorised by the Crown in advance.

While decisions of “high policy” such as whether to deploy armed force abroad are not judicially reviewable (unless an Act of Parliament requires it), the separation of powers under the UK’s constitution does not in itself prevent courts from judging the legality of lower level policies adopted by the executive which apply to its treatment of foreign subjects abroad.  Foreign policy is no longer regarded as a complete “no go” area for the courts and a court does not “turn a blind eye to executive lawlessness beyond the frontiers of its own jurisdiction”: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett</span> [1994] 1 AC 42, 67 (Lord Bridge).  There are many cases in which the lawfulness of such policies has been challenged and has been treated as a proper subject matter for the courts.  Examples are the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Hussein v Secretary of State for Defence</span> [2013] EWHC 95 (Admin); [2014] EWCA Civ 1087 and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Al Bazzouni) v Prime Minister</span> [2011] EWHC 2401 (Admin), [2012] 1 WLR 1389, referred to later in this judgment.

On the orthodox conception of public law, what a court is doing in such cases is determining whether the policy or practice in question is within the scope of the government’s legal powers – whether those powers are conferred by statute or are powers which at common law are regarded as the prerogative of the Crown.  Where the policy or act in question is found to be outside the scope of those powers (<span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>), it is treated as having no legal effect. </p>

Thus, if the general law of tort was not qualified by the doctrine of Crown act of state, the English courts would be required to treat as civil wrongs acts which are inherent in the government’s exercise of its power to conduct foreign relations and deploy armed force.  But this principle of consistency does not preclude the courts from determining that a particular government policy of a kind which is judicially reviewable is unlawful and <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> and from treating as civil wrongs acts done pursuant to such a policy which are outside the scope of the government’s powers.

There is nothing incoherent or irrational about a court passing judgment on a claim in tort brought by an individual who alleges such mistreatment.  Likewise, acknowledging that a government decision to engage in a military operation abroad entails the use of lethal force and detention on imperative grounds of security does not require the courts to accept that, for example, such lethal force may be deliberately targeted at civilians or that such detention is permissible when there are no imperative reasons of security capable of justifying it.

English law does not distinguish between different degrees of illegality or regard some kinds of unlawful governmental act as more unlawful than others.  There is only one standard of legality applied by our courts.  Even if, however, the touchstone was not legality but a narrower conception of what is contrary to fundamental aspects of public policy, any such conception would have to include, amongst such fundamental principles, the right to liberty, which has for centuries been seen as a cornerstone of the British constitution.  Even on this view of the Crown act of state doctrine, therefore, a policy which authorised the arbitrary detention of individuals in breach of article 5(1) of the European Convention would fall outside its scope.

The key question is what is meant by the words “within their jurisdiction”.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Skeini v United Kingdom</span> (2011) 53 EHRR 18, paras 130-142, the European Court interpreted this phrase much more broadly than its previous case law had indicated and held that article 1 applies not only where a contracting state exercises effective control over foreign territory but also where the state exercises physical power and control over an individual who is situated on foreign territory.  In justifying this decision, the Court departed from its previously expressed view that the Convention must be applied on an all or nothing basis and cannot be “divided and tailored”.  The Court held that, where a state exercises control over an individual, the state is required to secure those Convention rights which are relevant to the situation of the individual.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Ministry of Defence</span> [2014] AC 52 the UK Supreme Court recognised the judgment of the European Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Skeini</span> case as providing a “comprehensive statement of general principles” for the guidance of national courts (see paras 27, 46). </p>

In this court the MOD has accepted that any individual detained by British forces in Iraq was, while they were so detained, within the jurisdiction of the UK for the purpose of article 1 of the European Convention such that the UK was bound to secure to that individual rights under articles 3 and 5.  All the mistreatment alleged by the present claimants occurred while they were in the custody of coalition (or multinational) forces.  The only disputes about whether acts fell within the scope of the European Convention, and therefore within the scope of the Human Rights Act, are disputes in the cases of Alseran, MRE and KSU about whether the armed forces responsible for their detention – and who allegedly mistreated them while so detained – were armed forces of the UK or the US.  That is a question of fact. </p>

But they do not include internment or preventive detention where there is no intention to bring criminal charges within a reasonable time.  Such internment or preventive detention has always been regarded as legitimate in wartime – most obviously where enemy combatants are captured and made prisoners of war.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts agreed that in interpreting the Civil Code an Iraqi judge is not limited to the literal meaning of the text but tries to discover its spirit and intention.  (This does not apply to the interpretation of criminal laws, including the Criminal Procedure Code, where a more literal approach is adopted.)  Although the only binding source of law is the code itself, the experts also agreed that the opinions of jurists have an important role in its interpretation.  Professor Al-Dabbagh attached more weight than Professor Hamoudi to the opinions of Egyptian scholars, although both agreed that the commentary of Sanhuri on the Egyptian Civil Code has particular authority.  There is no doctrine of precedent in Iraqi law but the experts agreed that decisions of the Court of Cassation, which is the highest court in Iraq, may be persuasive – particularly where there is a consistent line of decisions or the decision is one of the full court. </p>

It is equally clear that a sexual assault gives rise to liability under article 204, even if not article 202.  As well as alleging that they were the victims of assaults, the claimants also complain about the conditions in which they were held during their detention.  However, neither of the experts addressed the question whether detaining a person in conditions which fall below some standard of adequacy is capable of founding liability under article 204 of the Civil Code (and, if so, what the relevant standard is).  In these circumstances counsel for the claimants accepted in the course of the second trial that the claimants have not established that holding a detainee in inhuman or otherwise inadequate conditions is a wrong which renders the perpetrator liable to pay compensation under Iraqi law. </p>

Moreover, his reliance on the concept of a peremptory norm / <span style="font-style:italic">jus cogens</span> seems to me to involve a category mistake.

Article 13 of this statute contains a definition of “war crimes” which includes “grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949” and “other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflicts, within the established framework of international law”.  Professor Hamoudi argued that, unless such violations of international humanitarian law were already crimes under Iraq’s domestic law, prosecutions for war crimes under the statute would have been unlawful because Iraqi law prohibits criminal prosecution on an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> basis.   </p>

	      </authorialNote>  However, that article drew from the argument the opposite conclusion to that drawn by Professor Hamoudi.  In Professor Bassiouni’s view, the Iraqi statute establishing the special tribunal violated principles of legality precisely because crimes defined in the statute were not part of Iraqi law when the acts in question were committed.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Ibid, pp362-3, 365 (point 11), 373-4. </p>
	      </authorialNote>  Professor Bassiouni mentioned an argument that international crimes, being <span style="font-style:italic">jus cogens</span>, “penetrate national law” and cannot be derogated from, but he did so in the course of drawing a distinction between the formal and substantive aspects of principles of legality.  Professor Bassiouni argued that, even though the formal aspects were not satisfied, the Iraqi statute nevertheless satisfied the substantive aspects of the principles of legality because war crimes and crimes against humanity were international crimes of which members of the former regime could be taken to have had prior notice.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Ibid, pp374-6. </p>
	      </authorialNote>  This argument expressly acknowledged that the Geneva Conventions, although they had been ratified by Iraq, were not part of Iraq’s domestic law.  Professor Bassiouni explained that Iraq “adheres to a rigid positivistic approach” and is also a dualist state, where treaties must be incorporated in national legislation and published in the Official Gazette before they can be considered applicable domestically.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

He argued that this legislation incorporated AP I into Iraqi domestic law – and by implication also incorporated the Geneva Conventions which it supplemented.  The latter implication does not seem to me to follow.  I cannot see how the enactment of an instrument which is intended to supplement another can obviate the need to enact the original instrument.  Nor can I accept Professor Hamoudi’s suggestion that AP I itself incorporates the Geneva Conventions merely because its preamble – which is not part of the substantive agreement – records the parties as “reaffirming further that the provisions of the Geneva Conventions ... must be fully applied in all circumstances to all persons who are protected by those instruments”.  In any event, Law 85 of 2001, by its terms, does no more than record Iraq’s accession to AP I.  It contains no words which purport to make the provisions of AP I – let alone the provisions of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 – enforceable in Iraqi courts as part of Iraq’s domestic law. </p>

In the exercise of these powers, the CPA could have issued a legislative instrument which gave authority under Iraqi domestic law to coalition forces to detain people for security reasons.  There is an issue, however, as to whether the CPA did so.  This issue is relevant in Mr Al-Waheed’s case.

In that case Mr Al-Jedda accepted that the revised version of Memorandum 3 took effect on 27 June 2004 and also that it conferred a power of detention for imperative reasons of security on British forces.  Mr Al-Jedda argued that this power lapsed when Iraq’s new Constitution came into force on 20 May 2006, either because Memorandum 3 was not preserved by the new Constitution or because the power under Memorandum 3 to detain for security reasons was inconsistent with a constitutional right not to be interned without trial.  Underhill J rejected those arguments and found that the new Iraqi Constitution did not make Mr Al-Jedda’s detention unlawful: see [2009] EWHC 397 (QB).  He therefore dismissed the claim.

First, the doctrine of precedent which requires a lower court to follow a decision of a higher court in the English legal system applies only to decisions on matters of law and not to decisions on matters of fact; and, as mentioned earlier, questions of foreign law are treated in English courts as questions of fact.  So findings made in a previous case, based on the evidence adduced in that case, that the revised version of Memorandum 3 had the force of law and conferred a power on British forces to detain for security reasons would not have the status of a binding precedent: see Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins, <span style="font-style:italic">The Conflict of Laws</span> (15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edn, 2012), vol 1, para 9.004; <span style="font-style:italic">Lazard Brothers &amp; Co v Midland Bank</span> [1933] AC 289.

Professor Al-Dabbagh did not accept this and adhered to the view expressed in the experts’ joint statement. </p>

Professor Hamoudi argued that there is nothing in article 1 of the Official Gazette Law nor in the old or new Iraqi Constitution to prevent a law from taking effect before it has been published in the Official Gazette if the law itself stipulates an earlier date for its entry into force.

I thus accept Professor Al-Dabbagh’s view that the words “unless stipulated otherwise” cannot sensibly be interpreted as dispensing with the requirement of publication which these provisions establish.  Rather, that proviso is to be understood as merely qualifying the presumption that a law takes effect immediately upon its publication in the Official Gazette and as allowing a law to stipulate that it will come into force at a <span style="text-decoration:underline">later</span> date, where it is thought desirable to give citizens and the legal community some time to learn about the new law after it has been published but before it takes effect.  Professor Al-Dabbagh gave a number of examples of laws which stipulated that they would come into force a specified time after their publication.  These included the Civil Code, which (pursuant to article 1382) came into force two years after it was published in the Official Gazette, and the Criminal Code of 1969, which (pursuant to article 505) also came into force two years after its publication.  By contrast, Professor Hamoudi did not identify any example (other than laws issued by the CPA) of a law which specified a date for its entry into force which preceded its publication. </p>

I regard his further suggestion that section 1(2) of Memorandum 3 had the effect of incorporating into Iraqi law the entire corpus of international humanitarian law as untenable.  It is plain from its wording that section 1 of Memorandum 3 was in the nature of a recital explaining the purpose of the instrument.  It was not itself executing that purpose.  Section 7 was doing that by giving effect in Iraqi law to certain requirements of Geneva IV.  However, the provisions of Geneva IV to which it gave effect did not include the power of internment for security reasons contained in article 78. </p>

Since Memorandum 3 in its revised form cannot, in my view, be read as enacting the power of internment for security reasons set out in Resolution 1546 into Iraqi law, it follows that under the internal law of Iraq (as opposed to international law) national contingents of the MNF had no right to detain people for reasons of security.  Their only power of detention under Iraqi law was the power conferred by section 5 of Memorandum 3 to detain persons suspected of having committed criminal acts who were not considered security internees. </p>

I agree that section 6 is obviously drafted on the assumption that such a power exists and that, if this assumption is wrong, compliance with the requirements of section 6 would be ineffectual in that it could not render lawful internment which had no legal basis.  But I do not accept that section 6 is capable of being interpreted as creating a power to intern, particularly in view of the literal approach to interpretation which applies in the field of Iraqi criminal law.  Put shortly, the fact that Memorandum 3 was drafted on a false premise cannot make the premise true. </p>

They were transported on these lorries and then on buses to Umm Qasr, near the border with Kuwait.  Here a prisoner of war internment facility had been established, which was initially known as Camp Freddy and was later renamed Camp Bucca when US forces took over the running of the camp.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The administrative process for registering prisoners brought to Camp Bucca involved entering their details on a computer database known as AP3 Ryan.  As part of the process, a digital photograph was taken of the prisoner and the prisoner was allocated an “Internment Serial Number”.  As well as being recorded on the database, this number was printed on a plastic bracelet which the prisoner was required to wear on his wrist.  Each prisoner was also given a “prisoner of war identity card” bearing his photograph as well as his name and Internment Serial Number.  Mr Alseran has kept his identity card, as have Mr Waheed, Mr Al-Aidan and Mr Mhalhal.  All their cards show the “date issued” as 1 April 2003, and in each case this is also the date of issue of the Internment Serial Number recorded in the AP3 Ryan database.  I regard this as solid evidence that 1 April 2003 was the date on which they were admitted to Camp Bucca. </p>

Professor Katona, also carried out cognitive testing and found Mr Alseran to have significant cognitive impairment.  The experts agreed that this is not related to his detention and may be the result of a head injury which he sustained in a road traffic accident in 2012. </p>

However, identification evidence of this kind, particularly when given so long after the relevant events, needs in my view to be treated with very great caution.  The witnesses’ descriptions of what they claimed to have recognised as the British flag were in any case vague.  For example, Mr Alseran described it as a cross which was orange or red, and Mr Waheed gave a similar description.  Counsel for the MOD suggested that the symbol which they recall may be the red cross emblazoned on the side of military medical vehicles.  Furthermore, the evidence from both trials – including the recollections of soldiers who testified at the second trial, many photographs, and several hours of video recordings from the archives of the Imperial War Museum put in evidence by the MOD – has shown that very few British soldiers who took part in the invasion of Iraq had the Union Jack displayed on their uniforms or their military vehicles.  In particular, the evidence indicates that the Royal Marines did not have the Union Jack on their uniforms.  As I am about to describe, the British forces who were operating in the area where Mr Alseran was captured were Royal Marine Commandos (supported by two squadrons of armoured vehicles).  In the circumstances I attach no weight to the evidence of the witnesses who claimed to have recognised the British flag. </p>

The MOD admitted in its defence that this number indicates that the person issued with it was captured by UK forces.  The MOD’s Joint Warfare Publication 1-10 on Prisoners of War Handling, March 2001 edition, which was applicable at the time, explains how to interpret the number.  The initial letters “UK” signify that the capturing nation was the United Kingdom.  The next two letters “DF” stand for Detention Facility.  There is then a unique number allocated to the prisoner.  The letters “IZ” mean that the prisoner owes his allegiance to Iraq.  The final letters “CM” stand for “Civilian Male”.  The Internment Serial Numbers issued to Mr Waheed, Mr Al-Aidan and Mr Mhalhal likewise all began with the letters “UKDF” and ended with the letters “IZCM”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In trying to establish how long Mr Alseran and other prisoners were detained for and the exact dates on which they were (a) captured, (b) admitted to Camp Bucca and (c) released, a key source of information is the contemporaneous records of detainees kept by the MOD.  Two main types of record were created.  First, as already mentioned, when prisoners arrived at Camp Bucca, their details were entered in a computer database known as AP3 Ryan.  The information about a detainee held in this database would be updated subsequently, in particular to record details of the person’s release.  The second main type of record created by the MOD comprises spreadsheets containing lists of detainees generated on various dates.  These lists record details such as the Internment Serial Number, name and date of birth of each listed detainee and include the detainee’s date of capture and (if applicable) date of release.  The MOD has been unable to explain how these spreadsheets were compiled. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Regrettably, when the MOD stopped using the AP3 Ryan system in 2008, inadequate steps were taken to preserve the records held on it, despite the fact that this litigation was already in prospect.  Some copies of the raw data were kept but it appears that only one laptop which runs the AP3 Ryan software was retained.  Until recently this laptop was in the possession of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (“IHAT”) and it is now held by an organisation which has taken over the remaining caseload of the IHAT called Service Police Legacy Investigations.  When disclosure of documents was given in these proceedings, the MOD did not disclose the existence of the data stored on this laptop and disclosed only print-outs of data which had come from the AP3 Ryan database but is now held on a system called the Defence Archive System (“DAS”).  Because the DAS does not run the AP3 Ryan software, the data stored on the DAS is displayed in a different format which is much harder to interpret and has some fields missing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It was only during closing submissions at the trial of MRE and KSU that the inadequacy of the MOD’s disclosure of these records began to emerge.  After the end of the trial, I circulated a note to the parties seeking answers from the MOD to a number of questions regarding its records of detainees held at Camp Bucca.  This led to the provision of further information and ultimately, in July 2017, to the restoration by the MOD of a working version of the AP3 Ryan database.  This was created with the assistance of Mr Kerry Maddison who had been the System Administrator of AP3 Ryan from 2003 until it was decommissioned in 2008.  It was constituted by loading data held on the DAS into the appropriate version of the AP3 Ryan software, which Mr Maddison had retained.  From the restored database screenshots were taken and disclosed by the MOD of the records of each of the detainees who has given evidence or featured in the evidence given at these trials.  The claimants made further written submissions regarding this material. </p>

Lists of detainees compiled on various dates confirm that Mr Alseran and the other witnesses who were interned at the same time as him were “held from” 1 April 2003 at “Umm Qasr”.  (It is apparent that “Umm Qasr” was used in the records to denote Camp Bucca which was situated in the vicinity of Umm Qasr). </p>

The place of capture is obviously wrong.  As for the date, it is striking that for the first several hundred detainees on these lists the “date of capture” is given as 28 March 2003 in every single case.  No earlier date of capture is shown.  These detainees include MRE and KSU, the claimants in the second trial, who (as discussed in part IV below) were registered at Camp Bucca on 26 March 2003.  The same lists also show the detainee’s “date of release”, where applicable, and in some cases the date of release shown is earlier than 28 March 2003, with the earliest date of release being 25 March 2003.  Thus no reliance can be placed on the date of 28 March 2003 where this is shown as the date of capture in these lists. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The information fields in the AP3 Ryan database include one for “capture event”.  For Mr Alseran and each of the other three witnesses in his case who were detained with him, the number of their “capture event” is recorded as “1” and the title of the event as “UK capture 1”.  A screenshot from the recently reconstituted version of the AP3 Ryan database shows that 1,754 detainees were recorded under this capture event and that no date has been entered for it.  Furthermore, the “place of capture” shown for this capture event is Umm Qasr.  It is clear that “capture event 1” does not refer to an actual event in which hundreds of prisoners were all captured at or about the same time in Umm Qasr.  As noted in part IV, KSU and two others captured with him were recorded under this capture event although they were captured on a different date and at a totally different location from Mr Alseran.  In the section for “capture information” within the “detainee personnel details” recorded for Mr Alseran and for each of the other three witnesses interned with him (and for KSU and the two others captured with him), the “capture date” has been left blank; but in each case the details of where they were held show a date and time of capture of 28 March 2003 at 23:41 with a reference under “Event ID” to capture event 1.  I think it reasonable to infer that, in the first few days after Camp Bucca was opened, all or at least a very large number of detainees whose capturing nation was recorded as the UK were entered under “capture event 1” on the computer system, without attempting to establish their actual date and place of capture, and that where dates of capture are shown for individuals recorded under this “event”, they were all given an essentially arbitrary date of capture of 28 March 2003.  But whether this theory is correct or not, no reliance can reasonably be placed on the “date of capture” shown for Mr Alseran in the MOD’s records.  It is therefore necessary to determine his date of capture from other evidence. </p>

He said that he was given no food on the day of his capture, but on the following morning he was provided with a carton containing canned food, water, juice, biscuits and some other food stuffs.  Mr Alseran said that, once he had finished eating, soldiers collected the food cartons and that this was the only time that food was provided during his detention at Al-Seeba.  If this is right, it suggests that, unless the prisoners were subsequently starved, Mr Alseran may in fact only have been at the Al-Seeba camp for two days. </p>

Mr Al Aidan said that he cannot remember the exact period of detention at Al-Seeba but thinks that it was two or three days.  Both he and Mr Waheed also recalled that the prisoners were not given any food until the second day.  Mr Al Aidan said that on the afternoon of the second day he was taken with a group of other detainees to clean the camp by picking up empty bottles of water and food cartons and putting them in a bag.

Mr Alseran did not know this man at the time but said that he later got to know him when they were detained in the same compound at Camp Bucca and that this man was Mr Mhalhal.  Mr Mhalhal gave evidence that he stayed at Al-Seeba for what he thinks was around five days before the prisoners were taken to Camp Bucca.  Although Mr Mhalhal is not a claimant in this litigation, in December 2014 he instructed Public Interest Lawyers to bring a claim on his behalf in the Administrative Court seeking an investigation of allegations that he had been ill-treated.  In connection with that claim, Public Interest Lawyers prepared a factual summary of his case based on a telephone conversation with him (conducted through a translator).  This factual summary describes Mr Mhalhal’s capture and his being hit on the nose with a rifle butt in similar terms to his evidence given in this case.  However, it also states that, after being hit, he lost consciousness and woke up “in the hospital” at what he was told was Camp Bucca. </p>

I accept that the factual summary was a superficial document, based only on one (translated) telephone conversation.  It contains a number of patent inaccuracies.  I also accept that Mr Mhalhal must have been detained at the Al-Seeba camp – and in all probability received treatment in a military medical vehicle at that camp – before being transported to Camp Bucca.  Nevertheless, his failure to recall the Al-Seeba camp at all when the factual summary was prepared suggests to me that he is unlikely to have spent nearly as long there as he now claims. </p>

Mr Alseran recalled there being three lorries which stopped along the way to pick up more prisoners and estimated that there were between 60 and 70 prisoners in all three lorries.  Even if that estimate is not very accurate, the number of prisoners brought to the Al-Seeba camp was plainly large.  In my view, the explanation which makes best sense of the evidence is that Mr Alseran, Mr Waheed and Mr Al Aidan were all captured on the first day of Operation James, which was Sunday 30 March 2003.  Mr Mhalhal must have been captured the following morning, 31 March 2003, because I see no reason to doubt his evidence that he was captured in the market at Abu Al-Khasib as he was walking to work, and the description of the assault on Abu Al-Khasib in <span style="font-style:italic">“Target Basra”</span> indicates that 31 March was the first morning on which British forces were in control of the town.  I have already found that the prisoners were transported from the prisoner collection point at Al-Seeba to Camp Bucca on the night of 31 March/1 April 2003. </p>

Mr Parker nevertheless expressed the opinion in his witness statement that he would be extremely surprised if British soldiers had mistreated Mr Alseran and the other prisoners as alleged by running over their backs.  Mr Parker said that he had never heard of any allegations of such conduct and that there is no way that soldiers would have got away with it.  He explained how mistreatment of prisoners was outlawed and that any report or complaint of mistreatment (or failing to stop mistreatment by others) would be investigated and subject to disciplinary action. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross-examination Mr Parker was referred to some particular incidents of proven mistreatment of detainees by British soldiers in Iraq.  One which occurred in May 2003 involved physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by soldiers from the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Armoured Brigade (for which Mr Parker was the Chief of Staff) at Camp Breadbasket.  Soldiers involved were ultimately convicted at a court martial, but the abuse only came to light when one of the soldiers took photographs to be developed at a shop in his local town after returning to the UK.  Another incident, which occurred at Al-Amarah in 2004, involved a vicious beating of children by a number of soldiers which was filmed by a soldier who was shouting encouragement to beat the children as he did so.  This incident only came to light in 2006 when it was discovered by a British national newspaper.  Despite these examples, Mr Parker maintained his view that it is almost impossible for misconduct by soldiers to be kept secret as sooner or later word of it will get out and there will then be an investigation.  In the light of the way in which the two incidents to which Mr Parker was referred came to light, I am bound to say that this view seemed to me to rest on nothing more solid than understandable professional pride and a measure of wishful thinking. </p>

Mr Alseran said that the abuse occurred on the first day at Al-Seeba (during the afternoon) and again on the second day.  Mr Al-Aidan said he thought it happened about four times during the first night – each time with a different soldier – and then again a number of times on the second night.

I am sceptical of this evidence which I think that he may well have made up to try to assist Mr Alseran.  But if there had been collusion between them or if Mr Alseran had fabricated his allegations of mistreatment, I would expect Mr Alseran to have made similar claims.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Alseran did not keep any record of how long he spent at Camp Bucca and in his evidence was understandably vague about the length of time for which he was detained, which he estimated as “approximately maybe two months or less”.  He said that on at least two occasions during his detention he was taken to a tent for questioning.  From the nature of the questions he remembers being asked, it is apparent that the main purpose of the questions was to determine whether he was a member of the Iraqi army or had any links to the Saddam regime.  When his particulars of claim were originally served in 2013, Mr Alseran’s recollection was that he was interviewed on three occasions – the first around ten days after his arrival at the camp, the second after about a month and the third immediately before he was released.  However, when he made his witness statement which was signed on 28 April 2016, he thought that he was only questioned twice, once after about ten days and the second time just before his release from detention.  At the end of the latter interview, Mr Alseran was told that he would be released.  He recalled that his cousin, Hussein Waheed, was released at the same time as him.  They were taken by bus to Basra and each given $5 to pay for a taxi home. </p>

He believed that he was questioned four times before his release.  Mr Waheed confirmed that he and Mr Alseran were released at the same time and were taken to Basra on the same bus.  Hasan Al-Aidan said that he was released after only one interview, which he recalled as taking place on about the tenth day of his detention.  Najeh Mhalhal stated that he could not be sure how long he was detained at Camp Bucca but thought he was questioned around three times before he was released.  Mr Mhalhal recalled that on the last occasion the soldier in charge (whom he referred to as “the General”) looked at him and said “tomorrow happy bus baby”.  The interpreter then told him that he would go home the next morning.  Mr Mhalhal said that he was released with Mr Alseran, although Mr Alseran does not now recall whether or not Mr Mhalhal was released at the same time as him. </p>

It is not apparent, however, what the source of this information was.  The equivalent letter issued to Mr Al-Aidan said only that he was released “in April 2003”.  Similarly, the letter issued by the Red Cross to Mr Waheed stated that he was released “in May 2003” without giving a more precise date.  The letter issued to Mr Mhalhal said that he was released on 5 July 2003, which is plainly incorrect. </p>

On the tab labelled “capture/hold/release”, in his “detainee personnel details”, the release date shown is 16 May 2003.  However, the details of where and when he was held shown on the same tab and on the tab labelled “prisoner location history” record that Mr Al-Aidan was released on 7 April 2003 and give the “event ID” as “18”.  The tab for “prisoner release event 18” shows a release date of 16 May 2003 but the “release description” states that “this release event is now no longer in use!!!!!!”.  The number of prisoners released in release event 18 is shown as 28 and their details are recorded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It is unlikely that Mr Al-Aidan’s recollection is so inaccurate that, although he thinks that he was released after about ten days, he was in fact detained at Camp Bucca for nearly seven weeks until 16 May 2003.  An additional reason to doubt the reliability of this date is the error message in the description of release event 18 on the reconstituted database.  On the other hand, the date of 7 April 2003 shown in the details of where Mr Al-Aidan was held broadly fits with his recollection.  The accuracy of this information is also supported by the fact that lists of detainees created on 15 and 20 April 2003 record Mr Al-Aidan’s date of release as 7 April 2003.  It is unlikely that lists would have been compiled on those dates showing that Mr AlAidan had been released a few days earlier if he was in fact still detained.  I accordingly find on the balance of probability that Mr Al-Aidan was released in “release event 18” on 7 April 2003. </p>

The details of where and when he was held also indicate that he was released on this date and give the “event ID” as “48”.  The tabs for “prisoner release event 48” show the date of this event as 7 May 2003, the number of prisoners released as 306, the “release reason” as “end of hostilities” and the “release mode” as “by coach”.  In this case – unlike in the case of release event 18 – there is no error message in the description of the event and I infer that the details of the event contained in the reconstituted database are accurate, as they are consistent with other information.  I also note that this release event is 30 numbers after release event 18 in which Mr Al-Aidan was released and that its date is 30 days after 7 April 2003, which I have found was the release date of Mr Al-Aidan.  It seems plausible that a new release event was created on the system for detainees released on each day during the relevant period.  Lists of detainees created on 8 May, 22 May and 27 June 2003 do not show any date of release for Mr Alseran.  However, lists created on 27 July 2003 and during the next few months show his date of release as 7 May 2003. </p>

However, in the record for release event 55 the description of the event states: “12 PWs released on AP3 following 100% check of internment facility.  PWs found not to be in facility.”  A witness statement made in connection with the <span style="font-style:italic">Hassan</span> case in October 2007 by Mr Kerry Maddison, the System Administrator for AP3 Ryan from 2003 to 2008, considered a similar entry made on the database for the detainee who was the subject of that case, Tarek Hassan.  Mr Maddison explained why the entry should be interpreted as meaning that the detainee was <span style="text-decoration:underline">recorded on AP3</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Ryan</span> as having been released on the date shown on the system as the release date.  Thus, it appears likely that Mr Mhalhal was in fact released before 14 May 2003 but, presumably as a result of an administrative error, this information was not entered on the AP3 Ryan database at the time and it was only when he was found to be absent when a check was carried out on 14 May 2003 that his release was recorded on AP3 Ryan.  Mr Mhalhal could well have been released, therefore, on the same day as Mr Alseran, as he claims that he was. </p>

The extent of this admission was not entirely clear, as the MOD elsewhere in its defence continued to put Mr Alseran to proof that he was captured by UK forces, but on any view the admission encompassed Mr Alseran’s detention at Camp Bucca.  At the start of the trial the MOD applied for permission under CPR 14.1(5) and 17.1(2) to amend its defence in order to withdraw this admission.

The Commander’s Diary kept by the Commanding Officer of the Queen’s Dragoon Guards, who had been responsible for setting up the facility, records that orders for their redeployment were received on 3 April 2003.  They were replaced at Camp Bucca by a battalion of the US Military Police.  The hand over was completed on 7 April 2003 when a US officer (Colonel Ecke) took command of the facility.  However, although US forces assumed responsibility for guarding and maintaining all the prisoners detained at Camp Bucca, a small UK contingent remained at the camp whose responsibilities included deciding whether UK captured prisoners should be released or continue to be detained. </p>

The draft report was sent to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Mercer, who was probably the author of some amendments shown in tracked changes on the copy disclosed by the MOD.  This report describes the system that was established by the UK authorities for screening prisoners at Camp Bucca to assess whether they were civilians who should be released.  (I will explain this system in more detail later when I consider Mr Alseran’s claim that his detention was unlawful.)  The report states that, after the US arrived to take over the camp, the UK retained the lead for the screening process, although US personnel were “integrated ... into the process”.  The US then adopted the idea and the process was expanded to allow more processing to occur each day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Major Christie’s report makes it clear that, although there was liaison between them, the UK and the US each operated their own policy with regard to the screening and release of prisoners.  The policies diverged when on 24 April 2003 the US announced that it would be commencing the release of military prisoners of war on a parole scheme while continuing the screening process for people claiming civilian status.  To minimise the potential for disruption and unrest among the detainees which it was feared would otherwise result from the operation of different national policies, the UK decided to commence its own programme of early release.  An internal email sent within the MOD on 25 April 2003 indicates that this included a relaxation of the screening process for detainees who claimed to be civilians whereby an initial assessment was to be made on the papers only to see whether there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual was a security threat or a criminal; only if such grounds were identified would a screening interview be conducted. </p>

Under the arrangements in place at the time of Mr Alseran’s release the processing of prisoners for release was being conducted by US military police and it is likely that he was issued with a release form similar to the forms given to Mr Waheed and Mr Mhalhal.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the decision whether to release him remained with the UK authorities and that the MOD was right to admit that Mr Alseran’s detention at Camp Bucca until 7 May 2003 was attributable to the UK. </p>

The purpose for which the treatment was inflicted and the motivation behind it are also potentially relevant factors: ibid.  Treatment has been held by the European Court to be “inhuman” because (amongst other things) it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering.  Treatment has been held to be “degrading” when it was such as to arouse in its victims feeling of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them: see <span style="font-style:italic">Jalloh v Germany</span> (2007) 44 EHRR 32, para 68; <span style="font-style:italic">A v United Kingdom</span> (2009) 49 EHRR 29, para 127.

In the present case the context of Mr Alseran’s capture and detention was a war.  That context cannot excuse cruelty or brutality but account needs to be taken of the acute stress and constant danger under which soldiers are operating in combat conditions.  In that context, kicks and blows inflicted on Mr Alseran at the time of his capture may have involved more violence than was strictly necessary to detain him.  But the evidence does not justify a finding that the force used was motivated by any purpose other than to prevent his escape and protect the soldiers’ safety.

But I have found that they were in fact held at the Al-Seeba camp for no more than around 36 hours, as they were brought there in the middle of the day on 30 March and evacuated to Camp Bucca during the night of 31 March / 1 April 2003.  The failure to feed the prisoners on the first day and to provide them with blankets during the night was regrettable and potentially in breach of article 20 of Geneva III, which requires that the evacuation of prisoners of war “shall always be effected humanely and in conditions similar to those for the forces of the Detaining Power”.  But there is no evidence to suggest that these deprivations were the result of anything other than logistical difficulties encountered in the rapid advance on Basra.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The main impetus for the Pictet theory is the perceived need to interpret Geneva IV in a way which avoids a gap in its protection of civilians.  As mentioned, the persons protected by the Convention are defined very widely: with certain specified exceptions, they comprise all those “who at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals” (article 4).  This language seems deliberately broad.  Amongst other things, the definition of protected persons is not limited geographically in any way and would appear to embrace any person who is in the physical power of a party to the conflict wherever that person is situated.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="24">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the specific provisions of the Convention focus on two classes of protected person: (1) enemy nationals (and certain other “aliens”) in the national territory of a party to the conflict; and (2) all persons in “occupied territory” (apart from nationals of the occupying power and of any “co-belligerent” state<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">25</span>).  This division is reflected in the structure of part III of Geneva IV, which deals with the “status and treatment of protected persons”.

Section II, as already mentioned, applies to “aliens in the territory of a party to the conflict”, while </p>

There is no separate section that applies to persons in territory of an adverse party to the conflict when such territory is not occupied.  Professor Sassòli argues that, on a systematic interpretation of Geneva IV, sections II and III are sub-divisions of section I which are intended, between them, to cover the whole ground.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="25">

For example, article 50 requires the occupying power to facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.  This includes an obligation, should local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, to make arrangements for the education of children who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend.  It seems unrealistic to require an invading army to fulfil such an obligation during the active combat phase of an armed conflict and unreasonable to interpret the Convention as imposing on state parties obligations which they cannot fulfil. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">To this objection, defenders of the Pictet theory give two answers.  One is to argue that the positive obligations of Geneva IV applicable in occupied territories are not obligations of result but of means.  They point out that some of the obligations of the occupying power set out in section III of part III – in particular, those under article 55 to ensure food and medical supplies for the population and under article 56 to maintain public health and hygiene – are qualified by the words “to the fullest extent of the means available to it”.  Professor Sassòli argues that similar qualifications are implicit in the language of other provisions – for example, in article 50 when it uses the terms “facilitate” and “make arrangements”.  Hence section III does not impose obligations which it is impossible to comply with. </p>

On this approach obligations bite as and when it becomes materially possible to comply with them.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="26">

There is an ambiguity in some formulations of the test as to whether the actual exercise of authority by the invading forces is necessary or whether the ability to exercise authority is sufficient.  The former interpretation would be unsatisfactory, as it would allow a state which invades territory to avoid the duties of an occupying power by declining to exercise authority within the territory.

There is nothing which prevents occupation from being limited geographically to a very small piece of territory.  Nor need it be of long duration.  But a certain level of stabilisation in the situation is necessary.  Thus, it is apparent that the test of occupation would not be satisfied if a patrol penetrates into enemy territory without any intention of staying there (to take Pictet’s example) or if the area is one in which fighting between hostile armies is going on.  Nor can it be said to follow simply from the fact that a person of enemy nationality is taken prisoner that this person is in occupied territory.

That was the view in 1946 of the Nüremberg International Military Tribunal.  It was argued before that Tribunal that the Hague Regulations did not apply, for example to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, because of the “general participation” clause in article 2 of the Hague Convention of 1907, which provides that the Regulations apply only if all the belligerents are parties to the Convention.  Several of the belligerents in the Second World War were not parties to the Hague Convention.  The Tribunal did not regard that fact as relevant, however, on the basis that “by 1939 [the Hague Regulations] were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war”: see International Military Tribunal, Judgment of 1 October 1946, pp79-80.  The International Military Tribunal for the Far East expressed the same view in 1948.  It has since been endorsed twice by the International Court of Justice, with specific reference to article 42: see <span style="font-style:italic">Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</span>, advisory opinion of 9 July 2004, para 89; and <span style="font-style:italic">Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DRC v Uganda)</span>, judgment of 19 December 2005, para 172. </p>

That inference is reinforced by article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which requires a court to take into account in interpreting a treaty “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”.  In interpreting the Geneva Conventions, article 42 of the Hague Regulations is manifestly such a relevant rule.

As noted earlier, the object of the Convention, expressed in article 4, is to provide protection to “those who at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict ..., in the hands of a Party to the conflict ... of which they are not nationals”.  That object is achieved by reading section I of part III of Geneva IV as applicable to all such persons, wherever situated.  I have mentioned that section I is entitled “provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories”.  It is not necessary to interpret this description as restricted to actions done by parties to the conflict within their own national territories and in occupied territories (as suggested by Professor Sassòli).  In its natural meaning the description encompasses all protected persons who are in the territory of a party to the conflict whether they are protected because they “find themselves” in the hands of that party or of an adverse party.  Nor is there anything in the content of the provisions of section I to indicate that it is intended to be of narrower scope.  To interpret it more narrowly would, on the other hand, defeat the object of protecting all those persons who are defined in article 4 as “persons protected by the Convention”. </p>

Nevertheless, there are good reasons why an invading force might consider it necessary to take civilians into its custody before it has established sufficient control over territory to become an occupying power: for example, to evacuate them from an area for their own safety or to detain civilians who are participating directly in hostilities or otherwise pose a threat to the security of the invading force.  It would not make sense for the Convention to forbid such measures, whilst allowing them in occupied territory. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The solution seems to me to be that the forcible removal of people from an area and their temporary detention for this purpose do not constitute internment.  That is implicit in Geneva IV, which contains separate provisions dealing with forcible transfers, deportations and evacuations of protected persons from those relating to internment (see in particular article 49).  Furthermore, although the term “internment” is not defined in the Geneva Conventions, the “regulations for the treatment of internees” contained in section IV of part III of Geneva IV, as well as the ordinary meaning of the term, imply that it is a form of detention which is potentially of some significant duration.  For example, article 92 requires medical inspections of internees to be made at least once a month; article 94 provides for the encouragement of intellectual, educational and recreational pursuits, sports and games amongst internees; article 98 states that all internees shall receive regular allowances, sufficient to enable them to purchase goods and articles; article 101 confers rights to present petitions and complaints with regard to the conditions of internment; and article 102 provides for the election by secret ballot every six months of a committee to represent the internees.  Such provisions are incapable of application to detention of an inherently transient nature.  In addition, article 83 prohibits the detaining power from setting up places of internment in areas particularly exposed to the dangers of war.  It is consistent with that principle that internment should not be permitted in territory over which an invading army has not yet established sufficient control for the territory to be considered occupied. </p>

Once in occupied territory, they may be interned if the requirements of article 78 are met. </p>

It seems to me, however, that the standard of evidence required must take account of the context in which the relevant decision has to be made.  A soldier who has to decide whether to capture an individual found in a combat zone cannot afford to take risks which may imperil the safety of his own side’s forces.  Nor will the soldier often have the leisure to interrogate the individual (nor the ability to do so if they do not speak the same language).  Soldiers in this situation must in principle be entitled to take a precautionary approach.  If there is reason to suspect that the individual, although not wearing military uniform, might nevertheless be an enemy combatant or might otherwise present a security risk if left in the location where they are found, then that must, in my view, be a sufficient basis for exercising the power of detention provided by article 27 of Geneva IV. </p>

At the time of capture or as soon as possible afterwards, a capture tag was meant to be completed for each prisoner recording the date, time and place of capture, the capture unit and the circumstances of capture.  A second key document was a capture report which was also required to be completed by the capturing unit and retained by the soldiers who escorted the prisoner until their arrival at the prisoner of war camp.  However, according to the draft report dated 7 May 2003 prepared by Major Christie, most prisoners arrived at Camp Bucca without any documentation indicating where they had come from, who had captured them and in what circumstances the capture occurred.  Major Christie estimated that capture tags were present in only perhaps 10% of cases, and that most of these tags were left blank or filled in with too little information to be useful. </p>

That said, the prisoners arriving at the camp included old men and young boys, who to his mind were highly unlikely to be combatants.  Major Frend, an army lawyer who also gave evidence to the Baha Mousa inquiry, said that it soon became clear that many of those being brought into Camp Bucca were not prisoners of war but were just in the wrong place at the wrong time as troops pushed forward. </p>

Any consideration of the adequacy of the process must, however, take into account the context in which the determinations had to be made.  That context was that, in the first days and weeks after the invasion of Iraq began, several thousand prisoners were taken, many of whom (as already mentioned) claimed to be civilians.  A report of a visit to Camp Bucca by Colonel Mercer and others on 19 and 20 April 2003 noted that, of 2,200 “UK captured PWs”, about 900 claimed to be civilians and were having to be screened.  This problem had not been encountered in previous conflicts, such as the Gulf War, and had not been foreseen.  The problem was compounded by the fact that, as mentioned earlier, prisoners typically arrived at Camp Bucca with little or no documentation.  Nor was it feasible to carry out investigations and collect evidence within a reasonable timescale in a country where law and order had broken down. </p>

It had the advantages of speed and simplicity.  It also gave the detainee an opportunity to be heard and to address any matters which appeared to justify their detention.  It is true that the panels were composed entirely of soldiers (albeit that one member was an army lawyer).  In the <span style="font-style:italic">Mohammed (No 2)</span> case a majority of the Supreme Court held that the system for reviewing detention in Afghanistan failed for this reason to provide sufficient guarantees of impartiality.  However, Lord Sumption (who gave the leading judgment) accepted that “it may be unrealistic to require military detention in a war zone to be reviewed by a body independent of the army” (para 105).  In my view, that was the position during the invasion and occupation periods of the conflict in Iraq.  Having heard and read in the course of these trials extensive evidence about the conditions and logistical difficulties encountered by UK forces during those periods, I am satisfied that to have sought to impose such a requirement would not have been realistic – particularly given the numbers of detainees involved. </p>

I note that in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hassan</span> case itself the applicant’s brother was released nine days after he was captured and the European Court did not find that the process of screening him and then arranging his release had involved undue delay.  But equally there must come a point at which detaining a prisoner without assessing whether there is a lawful basis for doing so renders the detention arbitrary whatever the extenuating reasons for the delay.  It is hard to say exactly where that point is.  But I draw some guidance from the ICRC Commentary on article 75(3) of Additional Protocol I, which discusses the similar requirement to inform a person who is detained “promptly” of the reasons for his detention.  In the view of the ICRC, “it is difficult to determine a precise time limit, but ten days would seem the maximum period.”  A period of ten days from arrival at the camp likewise seems to me a reasonable maximum time limit to apply to the reviews of internment at Camp Bucca. </p>

Mr Alseran’s recollection that his first interview took place around ten days after his arrival at Camp Bucca cannot by itself be treated as reliable.  But the likelihood that he was interviewed within that timescale is supported by the fact that Hasan Al-Aidan, who was detained at the same time as him, was – as I have found – released on 7 April 2003, and therefore after six days at Camp Bucca. </p>

It would have been difficult to explain to a detainee at Camp Bucca who was interviewed by a screening panel that, because the panel had a doubt about whether he was indeed a civilian, he was not going to be released since he could not be allowed to relinquish the privilege of being imprisoned regardless of whether he posed any security risk.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The treaties do not define a “belligerent act” nor what constitutes taking part in hostilities.  Some assistance is provided by interpretive guidance published by the ICRC in 2009 following a series of expert meetings on the notion of direct participation in hostilities under international humanitarian law.  This is interpreted as requiring a specific act which meets three cumulative criteria: (i) the act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or military capacity of a party to an armed conflict or, alternatively, to inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm); (ii) there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part (direct causation); and (iii) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another (belligerent nexus).  It is arguable that, as article 45(1) of AP I refers only to participation and not to “direct” participation in hostilities, the requirement of a direct causal link between the act and the likely harm is not applicable.  But it seems to me that on any reasonable view the notion of taking part in hostilities must involve doing an act which is likely and intended to cause harm of the kind described in this guidance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Such an act, if done by a non-combatant who does not have the right to participate directly in hostilities, could in principle be treated as a criminal offence for which such a person when detained could be prosecuted by the detaining power.  By contrast, under customary international law a combatant entitled to prisoner of war status has immunity from such prosecution (see also article 43(2) of AP I).  The commission of a belligerent act would in any event be likely to justify the individual’s internment for imperative reasons of security under article 78 of Geneva IV, if the individual was not classified as a prisoner of war.  There is therefore a benefit, where a person has participated directly in hostilities, in being treated as a prisoner of war in case of doubt about the person’s status. </p>

If the answer was “yes”, it would have been right for the panel to proceed in accordance with the guidance given.  But if the answer was “no”, keeping the individual in detention could only be justified if there was either (a) positive reason to believe that the individual was a combatant or (b) other evidence that the person’s internment was necessary for imperative reasons of security. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There is a second, practical reason why the reliance placed in the screening methodology on article 5 of Geneva III was flawed.  The presumption under article 5 in favour of treating an individual as a prisoner of war applies only “until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal”.  Yet the only form of “competent tribunal” that was ever established by the MOD for individuals captured during the invasion of Iraq was the system of screening panels.  When the system was devised, the intention was that, where a panel had a doubt about the status of an individual, their status would be determined by a full army board of inquiry at which evidence would be adduced.  Thus, the screening panels were intended only to make an initial assessment pending a fuller review.  (For this reason they were referred to at the time by some of those involved as “article 4½” tribunals.)  However, no boards of inquiry were ever held.  The reason was that the logistical difficulties involved in investigating cases and collecting evidence proved insuperable.

Depending on the account given, in order to investigate the claim the investigators would normally be required to travel to interview witnesses or organisations (such as an employer or records office). There was the primary problem of language and the lack of translators. Each investigator required not only an interpreter but an interpreter who could be trusted. Secondly, any investigation was potentially hazardous. It could take the military police to a remote location where there might be a danger of ambush or kidnap and they would therefore need full security in order to carry out the investigation. Those who have visited Basra know that there are parts of Basra you should not visit for long, and certainly not without proper security. Alternatively, it might be the wrong or a false address or indeed the witness might not agree to speak for fear of reprisal. There was also the possibility of revenge against a family given the ignominy of capture. Added to this was the geographical spread of Iraqi forces, and those captured reflected this trend. Many of Saddam’s forces in the south of Iraq were drawn from the north of Iraq. … Iraq is larger than France and, given the distances involved and the security problems, it was almost impossible to travel from the south to the north of Iraq. In such circumstances, it is hard to envisage how any such claims might be properly investigated at all.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="32">

Article 50 is not intended to be used to resolve doubt about whether a person who falls into the hands of an adverse party to the conflict is a prisoner of war.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">37</span>  If that were the case, there could potentially be a direct contradiction, where the person has taken part in hostilities, between articles 50 and 45(1) of AP I (and with article 5 of Geneva III).

Nor was there any evidence that he had committed any belligerent act or taken part in hostilities.  Nor did he claim or appear to be entitled to the status of prisoner of war.  In these circumstances there was no basis on which Mr Alseran could properly have been interned as a prisoner of war.  Equally, there were no facts which could be said to make it necessary to intern Mr Alseran for imperative reasons of security and there is no evidence to suggest that any such reasons were positively believed to exist at the time of his screening interviews. </p>

Had the correct legal test been applied, he would probably have been cleared for release when his detention was first reviewed.  I have found that the first review should have taken place, and probably did take place, within ten days of his admission to the camp.  I conclude that his detention between 10 April 2003 and the date of his release from Camp Bucca on 7 May 2003 – a period of 27 days – was arbitrary and violated article 5 of the European Convention. </p>

He submitted that the effect of the authorisation given for military operations in Iraq was that UK soldiers conducting front line operations were authorised to capture and detain anyone they considered it necessary to capture and detain in order to achieve the military aim of the operation irrespective of whether such capture and detention was permitted by international humanitarian law.  Alternatively, he argued that it was sufficient that those conducting front line operations honestly believed that they were acting in accordance with international humanitarian law, and that it could not have been intended that, should it later be held by a court that there was no lawful basis under international humanitarian law for detaining an individual, this would mean that the soldiers who detained him lacked authority from the Crown to do so. </p>

There is nothing in the wording of the relevant directives and orders which provides any support for them.  Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how the directives and orders authorising Operation Telic could have articulated any more clearly the instruction that all military operations, including detention operations, must be conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law.  The statements to this effect could not reasonably be understood as mere words of ambition or encouragement.  They are couched in the language of command and obligation and were plainly intended to limit the authority of those conducting operations on the ground.  Nor did the relevant directives and orders say anything to suggest that British soldiers were authorised to act in a way which they believed was in accordance with international humanitarian law even if in fact it was not.  To the contrary, emphasis was placed on the need for commanders to acquaint themselves with the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols, taking legal advice if necessary, to ensure accurate compliance. </p>

It is only to be expected that the UK government and military authorities would seek to ensure compliance with the UK’s obligations under international law as well as with obligations under domestic law in the conduct of military operations.  As discussed above, the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols specify and limit the circumstances in which during an international armed conflict or period of occupation a party to the conflict or occupying power is permitted to detain people, whether as prisoners of war or as civilian internees or as criminal detainees.  It would be most surprising if the MOD had authorised British soldiers to detain people in circumstances where such detention was not permitted by international law, and equally surprising if the MOD had authorised British soldiers to detain people provided only that the soldiers thought that international humanitarian law permitted such detention even though on a proper understanding it did not. </p>

His claim in tort based on that use of force is therefore precluded by the Crown act of state doctrine.  On the other hand, the MOD did not suggest that the mistreatment of prisoners, such as I have found took place at the Al-Seeba camp, was authorised by the Crown.  To the contrary, such mistreatment was wholly inconsistent with UK military policy and with the directives for Operation Telic, mentioned earlier, which repeatedly emphasised the requirement to treat prisoners humanely.  Accordingly, the assault sustained by Mr Alseran at the Al-Seeba camp gave rise to a claim in tort which is not barred by the Crown act of state doctrine. </p>

His detention during that period was also not within the scope of the authority to detain conferred on UK forces by the Crown and therefore gave rise to liability in tort. </p>

At the time of their capture, MRE and KSU were employed on a commercial cargo ship which was moored in the Khawr Az Zubayr (“KAZ”) waterway, several miles north of the port of Umm Qasr.  As explained in part I of this judgment, because they allege mistreatment of a sexual nature which carries a heavy stigma in Iraq, an order has been made for the names of these claimants (and of their relatives and fellow crew members) to be anonymised.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">MRE was born in Old Basra in November 1965.  He was therefore 37 years old at the time of the invasion and 51 years old at the time of the trial.  He was the youngest of 11 children.  His father worked in local government and he describes his family as middle class.  He stayed in high school until he was about 23 years old, prolonging his schooling so as to avoid having to serve in the Iraqi army during the war with Iran.  He obtained a vocational qualification in mechanics.  After leaving school and doing some military service after the war with Iran had ended (though less than he was meant to do), he worked as a mechanic and then for a company that restored and maintained boats.  In around 2000, MRE was hired to work as a mechanic on a ship.  This job only lasted for around two months as the ship was sold after only one voyage.  But as a result of this experience he fell in love with the sea and he then managed to find full-time employment as an engineer on the cargo ship.  During the two years or so that MRE worked on the cargo ship, the ship only made two voyages – both to the Emirates.  For the rest of the time, the cargo ship was at anchor in Iraq because the owner had no work for her.  MRE was not married and lived on board the ship, apart from occasional visits to see his brother in Old Basra.  His responsibilities when the ship was at anchor were to carry out maintenance, cleaning and repairs. </p>

He was born in South Basra in July 1975 and was therefore 27 years old at the time of the invasion and 41 years old at the time of the trial.  His father was a self-employed electrician and handyman, and KSU was the youngest of five children.  His family was poor and he only completed one further year of education after primary school before he had to leave school to earn his living.  He first worked in a restaurant and then joined the police force as an alternative to military service.  After seven years in the police working mostly as a guard, he left because the pay was so low.  By this time KSU was married and had a wife and children as well as his parents to support.  He started working as a construction worker but found this work too tiring.  He then bought two big water tanks and scraped a living selling purified drinking water to people in his neighbourhood. </p>

KSU worked shifts of approximately ten days at a time alternating with ten day periods at home with his family.  He and TUV were employed as guards, to protect the ship against thieves.  When KSU was living on the cargo ship, he also did the cooking.  There was a fourth permanent crew member, GRX, who was the owner’s nephew and who worked as a cleaner and oiler.  At the time of the invasion TUV was 25 years old and GRX was 24 years old. </p>

The prisoners were made to lie face down on the deck and their hands were tied tightly behind their backs with plastic cuffs.  The claimants allege that excessive force was used in handcuffing them.  In particular, MRE alleges that his right arm was pulled back with such force that his shoulder made a sound and he felt as though it had been dislocated.

This person told him to spread his legs and then shone the torch between his legs and lifted his penis.  The “doctor” then signed for MRE to turn around and bend over before inspecting his buttocks, again using the torch.  While all this was happening, a bald soldier was taking pictures of MRE with a camera.  MRE said that, when he was made to bend forwards, he was terrified that he was going to be raped, but this did not occur.

KSU said that the soldier who said he was a “doctor” took a firm hold of his penis and made him turn to the left and then pulled him by his penis and made him turn to the right.  The “doctor” then pulled KSU’s penis down to make him crouch down before pulling his penis up to force KSU to stand back up.  KSU said that, while this was happening, a group of soldiers were standing very close behind him, only around a metre away, and laughing at him.  According to KSU, when he was told to get dressed and bent down to put his underwear on, he felt a hot sting on his left buttock which caused him to cry out in pain. </p>

MRE said that his turn came last.  He gave evidence that, when his turn came to have a sandbag put over his head, a big soldier who seemed to be in charge came towards him and slapped him in the face and boxed him on his mouth and cheek.  According to MRE, the soldier kept saying “Don’t look at me” but MRE did not understand at the time what the soldier was saying and only realised what the soldier had meant afterwards.

He could also see what seemed to be people wearing military uniforms coming across the desert from the city of Umm Qasr towards the port.  He said that on the day of their capture the crew also saw small military speedboats going up and down the waterway.  One of the boats slowed down as it passed them and an Arab person on board spoke to them through a megaphone from around 40 metres away.  He said: “Stay put, we are coming to you”.  TUV also said that in the days before their capture he saw and heard helicopters flying overhead and on the day of their capture a helicopter “froze” in the air above them for a few minutes. </p>

The 539 ASRM post-operation report records significant movements of craft heading north on the KAZ on 24 and 25 March 2003.  In particular, on 24 March the second battle group of 539 ASRM moved up river to Az Zubayr port.  The fact that the claimants and TUV all recall seeing numerous small military boats on the waterway in the day or so before the cargo ship was boarded therefore tends to suggest that they were captured on or after 24 March 2003. </p>

More informative is the fact that the prisoner of war identity cards issued to the claimants and TUV in each case show the date on which the card was issued as 26 March 2003.  From this I infer that 26 March 2003 was the date when the claimants were registered at Camp Bucca.

The officer who was in charge of establishing the theatre internment facility at Umm Qasr, Colonel Pittman of the Queen’s Dragoon Guards, was part of a small advance party which arrived at the site where the camp was to be set up on the night of 21-22 March 2003.  He gave evidence, which was supported by contemporaneous documents, that the main logistic convoy bringing construction equipment and material, medical supplies and food from Kuwait arrived late on 23 March.  There were some 1,200 soldiers and 207 vehicles involved in establishing and securing the site.  The plan was to build up to thirty compounds which could each hold 500 prisoners.  According to Colonel Pittman, the first six compounds and the processing unit for receiving prisoners were ready within 48 hours – in other words, by the morning of 26 March 2003.  Until these compounds were ready, a secure facility was created to hold the prisoners who had already started to arrive. </p>

Their recollections differed, however, as to when and where the process took place.  All three witnesses remembered that on arrival at the prison camp they were taken to a place where there were metal shipping containers.  There they had to wait in line and were each given a blanket, spoon, plate and cup and possibly also a carton of food.  KSU and TUV remembered speaking to some of the other prisoners who included some men who said they had worked on one of the offshore oil terminals, probably Al Bakr port.  TUV said in his witness statement that the registration process took place in one of these shipping containers on arrival.  KSU, on the other hand, recalled that the process took place later in an olive green tent which was a 10 to 15 minute walk from their accommodation tent.  MRE also described the processing as taking place in a tent outside the detention area.   When their particulars of claim were originally served in 2013, KSU and MRE both stated that the registration process took place on the second day of their detention at Camp Bucca.  But in their evidence at the trial KSU said it took place after a few days and MRE said that he could not remember whether it happened on the day of their arrival at the camp or a day or two later. </p>

Furthermore, there is a significant piece of evidence which indicates that the date when the claimants were captured must have been earlier than 25 March 2003.  MRE and KSU both recalled that on their first night at Camp Bucca there was a sandstorm which caused the tent in which they were sleeping to fall down on top of them.  TUV also described the sandstorm, although he remembered it as occurring on the second night.  They all recalled that, on the morning after the sandstorm, they were taken to another tent where they stayed for the remainder of their detention.  Documents disclosed by the MOD refer to a major sandstorm occurring on the night of 25/26 March 2003. </p>

If, as I think likely, MRE and KSU are correct in recalling that the sandstorm occurred on their first night at Camp Bucca, this would put the timing of their capture as the evening of 24 March 2003.  The explanation for the “date of capture” entered on KSU’s capture card could be either that the claimants got the date wrong when they completed the card or (and perhaps more likely) that they took the “date of capture” to refer to the date on which they were interned at Camp Bucca. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">First, although the claimants’ allegations of mistreatment were not documented until after these proceedings were begun in 2010, I am sure that they are not bogus allegations which have simply been made up.  Their evidence had the hallmarks, including minor differences between their accounts of the kind to be expected, of evidence based on recollection given many years after the occurrence of traumatic events.  What, if anything, is surprising is the extent to which the claimants have described many things which match independent evidence of which they would not have been aware when making their witness statements.  Another feature of their evidence consistent with its honesty is that, while complaining in strong terms about their alleged mistreatment, both claimants also referred to various small acts of kindness shown to them by some of the service personnel they encountered at various times. </p>

There is substantial evidence, including the expert evidence given by Dr George on conditions in Iraq, that being a victim of any form of sexual abuse is associated in the claimants’ culture with a high degree of shame and social stigma.  I see no reason to suppose that MRE and KSU would have chosen to expose themselves to such stigma by falsely alleging mistreatment of a sexual nature.  Nor do I see any reason to think that the distress which they each showed at times when giving their evidence in court about what happened to them on board the big ship was other than genuine.  It is notable that all the many doctors who have examined them, including the psychiatrists instructed as expert witnesses by the claimants and by the MOD, have considered them to be truthful (even if not always accurate) historians. </p>

The gastroenterology experts instructed by the claimants and by the MOD, Dr Anton Emmanuel and Professor Paul Ciclitira, agreed that these symptoms are attributable to a combination of hiatus hernia, oesophageal reflux, functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.  MRE already had some gastroenterological symptoms before his detention but Professor Ciclitira’s own notes of his interview with MRE do not justify his opinion that the symptoms were already present then to the same degree as experienced since.  Overall, the evidence is clear that MRE’s gastroenterological problems have become considerably worse since his detention.  I accept as soundly based the opinion of Dr Emmanuel that, whilst the hiatus hernia and reflux are unlikely to be caused by the circumstances of MRE’s arrest and detention, his functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome have probably been exacerbated by his psychological condition.  His psychological distress may also contribute to the extent to which he experiences some of his symptoms. </p>

MRE still has symptoms of pain and discomfort in moving his right shoulder and lifting his hand above shoulder height.  His shoulder exhibits some loss of muscle bulk and weakness of rotation.  The experts believe that there was straining and possibly some tearing of the muscle and ligament when the injury occurred that led to a painful arc syndrome which has never been treated. </p>

They would have expected MRE to have some back pain initially, which may have been quite acute for a few days and probably led to stiffness caused by pain inhibition.  However, MRE has complained of continued symptoms of back pain which on his account have got worse since 2010.  The experts do not believe that he is malingering but physiologically the injuries suffered in 2003 cannot explain his current back pain.  The position is complicated by the fact that the kind of back pain which MRE describes with no obvious cause is very common in the general population. </p>

While in detention, both eyes were painful, blurry and watery, with the left eye being worse than the right.  His left eye had a burning sensation and a red discharge.  This lasted until he was treated by a doctor who gave him eye drops about a week after his release.  MRE says that, ever since then, he has had episodes when his left eye has become red and sore, requiring him to use eye drops.  He says that this problem occurs every two weeks or so and that, very occasionally, he has had a similar problem with his right eye.  Experts in ophthalmology instructed by the claimants and by the MOD, Dr Halliday and Dr Nourredine, confirmed that MRE has a corneal scar on his left eye and that, assuming no previous history of eye injury, it is likely that MRE suffered from a corneal laceration to his left eye when the sandbag was placed over his head caused by an unidentified sharp object (such as a shard of glass) that was in the bag.  This laceration, together probably with corneal abrasion due to sand or dirt entering his eyes, would have resulted in the moderately severe level of pain that he described.  This pain settled, however, within at most two weeks. </p>

The ophthalmology experts agreed that the treatment he was given after his release would have cured this infection within a week.  The experts were unable to find any eye abnormality which would account for his left eye regularly becoming red and sore in the way that he has described since then.

The claimants’ expert, Dr Surenthiran, also noted a scar around 2cm long on MRE’s forehead which, in his opinion, is consistent with the alleged injury. </p>

These allegations were deleted when the particulars of claim were amended in January 2017.  Counsel for the MOD suggested that MRE had changed his evidence after disclosure of a photograph taken at the time of his registration at Camp Bucca which shows no apparent mark on his face.  They submitted that, given the evident element of catastrophising that appears to be involved, the court ought to regard MRE’s evidence as too unreliable to justify a finding that he was subjected to a deliberate assault. </p>

MRE’s allegation also draws support from KSU’s recollection of seeing an injury to MRE’s head on their first night at Camp Bucca and being told by MRE that he had been hit by the British forces with a weapon.  It is notable that KSU mentioned this unprompted when he was interviewed by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team in February 2015 and was asked by the investigator: “Tell me what happened on that first night in the tent”.  On the other hand, although MRE’s claims to have been hit on the head have been consistent, his initial report to Leigh Day that he was also punched savagely in the face is unsupported by KSU’s evidence and clearly inconsistent with the photograph taken of MRE within a day or so of his arrival at Camp Bucca. </p>

In his evidence at the trial MRE said that he was jogging towards the area where the detainees had to stand in line for food when he was kicked, whereas he had reported to Dr Abdullah (some four years earlier) that he was “standing in line with other detainees to take a lunch” when he was kicked.  Counsel for the MOD also emphasised the evidence of the orthopaedic experts indicating that the problems with his knee of which MRE still complains have no obvious physiological origin and submitted that the court should be slow to accept that any injury was deliberately inflicted given the “very high degree of psychological overlay” which must be involved in MRE’s continuing perception of pain and disability. </p>

But this does not mean that the injuries to which MRE attributes his continuing symptoms were never in fact suffered.  To the contrary, the medical evidence supports MRE’s claim that he suffered such injuries including an injury to his right knee while he was in detention.  I do not regard the inconsistency about whether MRE was standing or jogging when the injury was sustained as undermining his evidence that the cause of the injury was a deliberate kick from a soldier.

Memories of this kind are particularly susceptible to suggestibility and bias.  MRE undoubtedly believes that he was captured by British forces, and it is easy for him to think in these circumstances that he saw British flags.  The evidence of TUV is even more dubious as he did not know what the British flag looked like at the time of his capture and detention, and red, blue and white are of course also the colours of the US flag.  I also mentioned earlier in discussing Mr Alseran’s case that the photographic and other evidence indicates that none of the Royal Marines in the invasion force wore flags on their uniforms; and on the claimants’ case, as I will explain soon, the forces who boarded their ship were probably Royal Marines.  Moreover, in all the photographs which do show British soldiers with a Union Jack on their uniform the flag is on the left shoulder – and not on the chest where MRE said that he noticed it on the uniform of the Arabic speaking soldier.  What is consistent at least with MRE’s claim to have seen the British flag on the small boat is evidence that some boats operated by 539 ASRM on the KAZ chose to fly the Union Jack (and not, as was usual practice, the white ensign) so as to reduce the risk of being misidentified by US forces, particularly from the air.  However, there is other evidence, which I will come to later, which makes it unlikely that the small boat on which the claimants were carried was one of those boats. </p>

MRE stated that, when they were leaving the big ship to be taken back to Umm Qasr, this soldier said to them: “You are detained by the British forces on behalf of the United Kingdom”.  KSU gave evidence to similar effect.  TUV also stated that this soldier told them that they were detained by British forces, but he recalled this as being said shortly after they had come on board the big ship rather than just before they left the next morning.  Counsel for the MOD noted that the claimants’ own evidence showed that their ability to communicate with the soldier who spoke broken Arabic was poor and suggested that they may have misunderstood what the soldier was trying to tell them.

The numbers issued to KSU, TUV and GRX all had the prefix “UK” which, as mentioned earlier, signifies that the capturing nation was the United Kingdom.  Likewise, their “detainee personnel details” entered on the MOD’s AP3 Ryan computer system in each case identified the capturing nation as the United Kingdom.  There is less reason to be confident in their cases, however, that the designation was accurate than there was in the case of Mr Alseran.  Mr Alseran was brought to the camp as one of a large group of prisoners, all of whom were captured in the same area at around the same time, presumably by forces from the same nation, and transported to Camp Bucca together.  Moreover, by the time they arrived at Camp Bucca on 1 April 2003 the registration process was in place and there is convincing evidence that they were registered as soon as the camp opened on the morning of their arrival.  There seems very little possibility in these circumstances that their capturing nation might have been wrongly identified.  By contrast, MRE and KSU were brought to Camp Bucca as part of a small group of only four prisoners.  They arrived some six days before Mr Alseran when the camp was still being set up and I have found that they were not registered until the day after their arrival.  In the meantime they had mingled with many other prisoners.  It is not clear what, if any, documents relating to their capture came with them.  KSU and MRE both said that the soldier from the capturing unit who spoke broken Arabic told them that he had a file of their papers.  But even if that is correct, it remains unclear whether these papers were brought to Camp Bucca.  Even if they were, there is no evidence that any papers which identified the capturing unit were examined or linked to the claimants when they were registered. </p>

A screenshot from the reconstituted database shows that a total of 2,097 prisoners were recorded under capture event 2.  It appears that, in the same way as all prisoners recorded as captured by UK forces in the first few days of the war were entered in the database under “capture event 1”, all prisoners recorded as captured by US forces were entered under “capture event 2”.  Reflecting the information entered on the database, the Internment Serial Number issued to MRE when he was registered at Camp Bucca began with the letters “USUS”, signifying that he was captured by US forces. </p>

The fact that MRE was recorded as having been captured by the United States may, as counsel for the claimants suggested, simply have been an administrative error.

I referred earlier to evidence of the deployment of British forces on the KAZ.  According to witness evidence adduced by the MOD from (amongst others) Lieutenant General Jim Dutton, Commander of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, the task of capturing Umm Qasr was originally assigned to 15 Marine Expeditionary Unit (“15 MEU”), a unit of the US Marine Corps.  However, on 23/24 March 2003 15 MEU left Umm Qasr to move north and 42 Commando Royal Marines moved to Umm Qasr to take over responsibility for security of the area.  539 ASRM was responsible for patrolling the KAZ north of Umm Qasr at that time.  Sergeant Major Cochrane, who was a Boat Group Commander in 539 ASRM, described their mission in evidence as being to patrol and dominate the waterway between Umm Qasr and Al Zubayr.  This role is confirmed by the 539 ASRM post-operation report dated 14 April 2003.  The claimants also relied on a diary of key events published in the issue for May/June 2003 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Globe and Laurel</span>, the official journal of the Royal Marines.

Major Ben Richardson (then a corporal) from 9 ASRM spent just under two weeks patrolling the KAZ on board a LCVP.  He had previous experience of carrying out offensive boardings.  He said in evidence that, whilst they might have investigated a vessel that was acting suspiciously, there were no troops embarked on any of the landing craft – for example, there were only four or five men on board his LCVP – and they did not have the personnel needed to carry out an offensive boarding operation.  Lieutenant Colonel David Ethell was a captain at the time who commanded the tactical headquarters for 539 ASRM.  He confirmed that there were no embarked troops during this phase of the operation and that 539 ASRM did not have the capability in terms of manpower and equipment to carry out an offensive boarding of a high-sided vessel.  He said that typically such an operation would have been carried out by special forces. </p>

As with all the evidence based on recollection so long after the relevant events, this evidence needs to be treated with caution.  There are also, as I have indicated, many discrepancies on points of detail between their accounts.  Nevertheless, I agree with the submission made by counsel for the MOD that, unlike the evidence of seeing British flags which may have been consciously or unconsciously influenced by knowing the significance of whether their captors were British, the witnesses’ recollections of these other matters are unlikely to be affected by any bias because they did not at the time and do not now have knowledge of the different types of equipment, boats and warships used by British and US forces. </p>

On each side of the seating area there were black leather chairs which looked like bus chairs.  A drawing that he made shows the seats facing forwards.  KSU described the medium-sized boat as approximately 9 – 10 metres in length and 3 – 4 metres wide.  He said that in the middle of the deck were two rows of seats similar to aircraft seats with a small gangway between them.  He stated that the seats were enclosed in a room with windows and a roof.

A video played in court included footage taken inside the cabin which showed several rows of black leather seats, all with arm rests, and a gangway down the middle.  The video also gave a good impression of how fast the boat can travel.  Information published in <span style="font-style:italic">Jane’s Fighting Boats</span> indicates that the Mark V SOC is powered by twin jet engines and has a speed of 45 knots.

The LCVPs were 15.5 metres long and just over 4 metres wide.  However, such landing craft are rectangular in shape with a ramp which lowers at the front so that vehicles can drive on and off the boat rather than having a pointed bow as shown in MRE’s drawings.  Nor did the LCVPs have enclosed seating or look anything like a “tourist boat but in military style”, as described by the claimants and TUV.  The LCVPs had a small wheelhouse at the stern with a large “welldeck” at the front for carrying vehicles or up to 30 personnel.  When used for carrying personnel, there were normally three rows of benches which ran from front to back.  These landing craft were also much slower than the Mark V SOC.  There were two types of LCVP in operation.  As discussed further below, both had a “planning speed” of 15 knots and the maximum speed achievable by either craft was 24 knots in the case of the Mk 5 LCVP when operating in optimum conditions in a “light role”. </p>

The characteristic feature of such ships is that they contain a large, hangar-like compartment at the waterline.  By taking on water, the stern of the ship can be lowered so that this compartment is flooded thus enabling landing craft and other boats to enter the ship and dock.  The US Navy order of battle for “Operation Iraqi Freedom” shows that the US fleet included two amphibious task forces, each of which contained seven ships of this general type.  Photographs of some of these ships show that the stern door extends across the full width of the landing dock compartment and is split into two sections: a lower section hinged at the bottom and an upper section hinged at the top.  In some of the photographs the top section looks like a metal grill. </p>

Article 22 of Geneva III precludes the internment of prisoners of war at sea but there is also an obligation not to detain prisoners of war in an area where they may be exposed to danger (see articles 19 and 23).  The UK detention policy envisaged that prisoners of war captured at sea or during the initial stages of an amphibious operation might need to be held temporarily on board a ship until they could be transferred to a prisoner of war handling facility onshore.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="35">

He gave evidence that, throughout his tenure, no detainees of any nationality were brought to the UK maritime facility.

Major Fidler explained that external factors such as sea state (if it is above sea state 2) and tidal flow have an effect on speed.  He said that the water in the northern Gulf is very warm, including at night, which prevents the engine from cooling down and operating efficiently and adversely affects the speed of the craft.

They accepted that Sir Percivale, which at midnight on 24/25 March 2003 was around 250km from Umm Qasr as the crow flies, was too far out to sea to be within range.  They plotted the distance to HMS Ocean at that time as 107km and the distance to Sir Bedivere as 103km.  They also analysed all the disclosed ships’ logs and found that the sea conditions on the night of 24/25 March 2003 were extremely calm with virtually no wind and a sea state of either category 1 or category 2 (indicating a maximum wave height of half a metre).  The tide data showed that the boat which took the prisoners to the big ship would have been travelling with the tide before 21:57 and against the tide after that time.  The evidence suggests that the boat had a light load.  The claimants’ representatives argued that in these circumstances, if the boat was a Mk 5 LCVP, it is reasonable to assume that it could have travelled at a speed approaching the maximum speed in a light role of 24 knots. </p>

At a speed of 18 knots, the journey would have taken more than 3 hours and at the planning speed of 15 knots it would have taken some 3 hours 40 minutes.  I think it unrealistic to suppose that a LCVP undertaking this journey would have maintained the maximum speed possible, particularly given the evidence of Major Fidler about the reduced engine efficiency when operating in warm waters.  Moreover, the distance calculations are on any view understated because they assume travel in a straight line, whereas a boat proceeding down the KAA waterway and then out to sea would not be travelling in a straight line.  Taking these factors into account, it seems to me reasonable to assume that to reach either HMS Ocean or Sir Bedivere in a LCVP would have taken at least 3 hours. </p>

He estimated that the journey to the big ship took about an hour and a half to two hours.  KSU’s recollection was that they were transferred to the medium-sized boat after only a short journey of perhaps 15 minutes, but he too recalled stopping at the port for what could have been around 45 minutes or an hour, as though the capturing troops were expecting someone to meet them.  KSU thought it took a long time, perhaps an hour or more, to travel to the big ship.  TUV similarly recalled the journey to Umm Qasr as taking only around 15 minutes and then waiting on “stand by” for maybe an hour.

MRE said that in the morning the four prisoners were taken back to Umm Qasr in a boat which looked like the first small boat they had been on after they were captured.  He said that they sat near the bow and got wet.  He thought that the journey took about two hours.  KSU thought that they were taken back to Umm Qasr on the mediumsized boat, but he too recalled sitting near the bow and getting wet, which seems inconsistent with a boat that had enclosed seating.  All three witnesses recalled the soldiers putting some kind of plastic sheet to cover them.  TUV said in his witness statement that the four prisoners were taken back to Umm Qasr in a small speedboat, which was accompanied by two other similar small boats.  He described the floor of the boat as made of rubber.  He also said that the sea water splashed over them and they got wet; and that the soldiers then put them under a waterproof nylon sheet to protect them from the water. </p>

They also argued that this is inconsistent with their captors being US forces.  There is evidence that a US ship, the USS Dubuque, was used by US forces to hold prisoners captured on water.  The USS Dubuque Command History for 2003 states that 106 prisoners of war were held on the ship from 21-29 March and from 1821 April 2003.  Counsel for the claimants submitted that it can in these circumstances be inferred that, if the crew of the cargo ship had been captured by US forces, they would have been taken to USS Dubuque and detained there. </p>

There is no evidence explaining the US detention policy, but I see no reason to assume that prisoners captured by US forces in the vicinity of Umm Qasr, including any prisoners taken on the waterway north of Umm Qasr, would have been detained on USS Dubuque.  There is no firm evidence of where USS Dubuque was located at the relevant time but Captain Stacey recalled that it was well to the south of HMAS Kanimbla (which was also equipped to handle prisoners) and he therefore thought it unlikely that prisoners would have been taken there from the area north of Umm Qasr.  Furthermore, the detention records and much other evidence shows that many prisoners captured by US forces were interned at Camp Bucca.  Some indication at least that those prisoners could have included the claimants is provided by the article published in the <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times</span> on 28 March 2003, mentioned earlier, which reported that US Navy Seals had taken at least a dozen Iraqi prisoners off abandoned boats in the waterways near Umm Qasr and had handed them over to British Royal Marines at Umm Qasr for detention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">There are many features of the evidence discussed above which suggest that MRE and KSU were captured by US forces (specifically, US Navy Seals possibly operating with Polish special forces under US command) and were held overnight on a US navy ship.  However, the evidence is by no means consistent.  Moreover, there are potentially ineradicable difficulties in trying to resolve the inconsistencies and come to a definite conclusion about the identity of the capturing forces in the absence of any reliable documentary record 14 years after the relevant events.  I am also conscious that the court has not received any evidence from the US military and that such evidence might have disproved (or proved) their responsibility for detaining the claimants.  Apart from any consideration of restraint in avoiding unnecessary criticism of acts attributable to a friendly foreign state, a court should be very slow for reasons of basic fairness to make findings which impute misconduct to a non-party who has had no involvement in the proceedings and no opportunity to rebut the imputation.  It would, in my opinion, only be right to do so if it was necessary in order to decide the dispute between the parties to the litigation. </p>

In the case of TUV, the question only arose when he made his witness statement in late 2016.  In these circumstances, as in the case of Mr Alseran, the estimates given by the claimants and their witnesses of the length of their detention must be regarded as very unreliable.  I think there is also likely to be a natural tendency to over-estimate the duration of an experience which was obviously deeply stressful and unpleasant and which may well have felt subjectively at the time (and may feel in hindsight) to have lasted longer than it actually did. </p>

Reverend Mercer and other witnesses confirmed that the claimants’ descriptions match the desert combat uniforms worn by British forces.  Neither MRE nor KSU recalled seeing any soldiers at Camp Bucca wearing any different uniform. </p>

British soldiers must also have stopped working in the kitchen by that time.  If MRE and KSU had remained in detention for many days after the handover, I think it likely that they would have remembered seeing soldiers who were wearing different uniforms from the British army uniform.  TUV stated that later in his detention he came to recognise the different uniforms and vehicles of the British and American forces.  This suggests that, unlike MRE and KSU, TUV remained at Camp Bucca for some time after the US Military Police took over the duty of guarding prisoners. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimants’ evidence also fits with other evidence about the timing of the release process.  The MOD relied on a witness statement made for the purpose of the Baha Mousa inquiry by Mr David Frend, who was present in Iraq in 2003 as a military lawyer.  Major Frend (as he then was) said that he first went to Camp Bucca on 29 March 2003.  He left the camp on 11 April.  For most of his time there his daily “bread and butter” work consisted in sitting on the panels which were established to try to determine which detainees were civilians who should be released immediately.  He said that these hearings started on 30 March 2003, at which point there were around 2,000 detainees in Camp Bucca.  The evidence of Major Christie, another military lawyer, indicates that efforts were made to give priority to those who had been captured first, although this was logistically difficult.  MRE and KSU were among the earliest prisoners detained at Camp Bucca, arriving some six days before Mr Alseran, for example.  I see no reason to doubt the evidence of MRE and KSU that they were released on the first occasion when they taken for questioning.  I have found earlier that Hasan Al-Aidan, who was interned at Camp Bucca at the same time as Mr Alseran on 1 April 2003, was released on 7 April 2003 and that Mr Alseran was probably first taken for questioning by, at the latest, 10 April 2003.  It seems unlikely in the circumstances that MRE and KSU would have had to wait any later than this before being questioned. </p>

The letter is dated 22 April 2013 and includes the statement (as translated): “Thank God we heard that you were fine from your friends [KSU], [GRX], and [MRE]”.  It appears from the evidence of both KSU and TUV that there was some communication between their families while they were in detention.  The best explanation of what was written in this letter seems to me to be that, by 22 April 2013, KSU, MRE and GRX had all been released and KSU’s family had contacted TUV’s family to tell them this information and to let them know that TUV, although still detained, was OK. </p>

As discussed earlier, whether or not he was in fact captured by UK forces, KSU was registered at Camp Bucca as a UK captured prisoner (as were TUV and GRX).

Nevertheless, it is apparent that, while Camp Bucca was a UK facility, the UK authorities took responsibility for implementing and operating the system of screening detainees including US captured detainees.  The draft report dated 7 May 2003 prepared by Major Christie states that, after the US arrived to take over the camp, “the UK retained the lead for the screening process but … integrated US JAG officers and SNCOs into the process.  The US then adopted the idea.”  I infer from this that, at the time when MRE was released on 10 April 2003, the practical responsibility for screening detainees and deciding whether or not they should be released remained with the UK. </p>

MRE recalled that there were three members of the panel – a female soldier who was sitting in the middle and conducted the questioning, flanked by two men.  He described the female soldier as wearing a brown T-shirt and trousers of light desert colour with camouflage, both of which were part of the uniform he had seen throughout his detention at Camp Bucca.  He also recalled that on the sleeve of her uniform there was “a sort of leather bracelet which had a circle like a medallion and on it a crown like the crown of the Queen of England”.  Reverend Mercer identified this as an accurate description of a leather wristband with a crown emblem which is part of the insignia of a British Warrant Officer. </p>

It is apparent from his evidence, however, that it must have been at least several days before he was released.  He said, for example, that he saw a doctor the next day who gave him some painkillers but that, when these ran out after a while, he did not go back to ask for any more because there was always a big crowd of people who wanted to see the doctor when he came each day to the compound and MRE did not want to wait or fight to see him.  It might also be expected that MRE would have noticed if the soldier who kicked him in the knee was wearing any different uniform from the soldiers who had previously been guarding the prisoners.  In fact, as discussed earlier, MRE only remembers ever seeing soldiers wearing one type of uniform during his detention and his description of that uniform matches the uniform worn by British soldiers.  Accordingly, although I have found that responsibility for guarding the detainees was taken over by US Military Police three days or so before the claimants were released, it is probable that the incident in which MRE was kicked occurred before that time and that the soldier who assaulted him was British. </p>

The other four techniques were forcing prisoners to stand in stress positions, subjecting them to noise, depriving them of sleep and depriving them of food and drink.  On 2 March 1972, the then Prime Minister, Mr Edward Heath, made a statement in Parliament that the five techniques would not in future be used as an aid to interrogation in any circumstances.  A similar unqualified undertaking was given by the British Attorney-General to the European Court.  In its judgment the Court concluded that “recourse to the five techniques amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, which practice was in breach of article 3”: see <span style="font-style:italic">Ireland v United Kingdom</span> [1978] 2 EHRR 25, para 168.  Although this conclusion related to the practice of the five techniques in combination, the European Court has since suggested that hooding alone amounted to a breach of article 3: see <span style="font-style:italic">El-Masri v Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</span> (2013) 57 EHRR 25, para 209. </p>

They did so and on 1 April 2003 the ICRC indicated that it intended to make a formal complaint about the UK’s treatment of prisoners, one particular concern being the hooding of prisoners.  As a result of these various concerns, orders were given that hooding was to cease for all purposes.

The Divisional Court was satisfied that there was convincing evidence that “the United Kingdom Government’s consistent policy has been that hooding is neither to be used nor condoned by UK personnel in any circumstance, including during transit or for security reasons” (para 80).  The Divisional Court concluded that, although it was conceivable that in certain factual circumstances hooding might not be unlawful, the exception contemplated in the guidance was unworkable and that, in circumstances where “[t]he Government’s policy is, for good reason, to prohibit hooding, [the guidance] should be changed to omit hooding from the ambit of the exception” (see paras 90-94). </p>

As the lessons of Northern Ireland, the Baha Mousa inquiry and the <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Bazzouni</span> case do not seem to have been fully absorbed by the MOD, I consider that the court should now make it clear in unequivocal terms that putting sandbags (or other hoods) over the heads of prisoners at any time and for whatever purpose is a form of degrading treatment which insults human dignity and violates article 3 of the European Convention.

If it were seriously to be suggested that allowing prisoners to see particular installations or equipment or activities would have put British military personnel at risk, the relevant concern would need to be specifically identified and substantiated.  No attempt has been made in this case to do that.  Even where a genuine concern of that kind exists, it is difficult to see how it could ever be necessary or proportionate to deprive a captured person of sight by covering their entire head with a bag when there are other acceptable means of addressing the risk such as covering the windows of vehicles, taking a different route or, if absolutely necessary, briefly blindfolding the prisoner.  In any case such considerations are entirely academic in the present case as there is no evidence of anything that the claimants might have seen on the journey from Umm Qasr port to Camp Bucca apart from several miles of sand. </p>

I therefore infer that the claimants must have been hooded for at least that length of time.  The experience had a particularly traumatic effect on MRE.  As mentioned earlier, there is evidence that dirt or sand inside the sandbag put over his head, including a sharp object such as a shard of glass, got into his left eye, causing a small scratch on the cornea (although not one which has damaged his eyesight) and an eye infection which persisted while he was detained at Camp Bucca.  He also suffered fear and anxiety from having his head completely covered with a bag.  The psychological effect of the experience is manifested in two symptoms from which MRE still suffers.  One, which is a recognised feature of posttraumatic stress disorder, is that he periodically experiences “flashbacks” accompanied by feelings of acute anxiety which may be described as “panic attacks”.  He said in evidence, and I accept, that when these episodes happen the memories that overwhelm him are predominantly of the three occasions during his captivity when he felt that he was going to die.  These were: the occasion when the soldiers came on </p>

The second relevant symptom is that his left eye regularly becomes red and sore.  As mentioned earlier, the expert ophthalmologists who examined MRE could find no physiological cause for these episodes, which appear to be psychosomatic.  But the fact that his psychiatric condition is expressed in this particular way seems likely to reflect the traumatic impact of the original experience. </p>

But I accept his evidence that having a sandbag put over his head and then being forced to the ground and made to shuffle forwards on his knees before being shoved and kicked into a vehicle caused him to feel terrified and humiliated.  He said in his evidence: “I could not understand why they would do such a thing to another human being.  They were treating me like I was an animal.”  It is difficult to disagree with that description. </p>

In particular, MRE was hit on the head with what must have been a rifle butt, an assault which has caused him some permanent disability.  Applying the criteria identified in part IV at paragraphs 230–231, I have no doubt that this constituted inhuman treatment.  The rough treatment of KSU would not on its own have crossed the article 3 threshold but it was so closely connected with the hooding that I regard it as part of the same episode which amounted to a violation of article 3 as well as an assault.</p>

Indeed, MRE said in evidence that afterwards other soldiers apologised to him and he was told that the soldier who had kicked him would be disciplined.  It was a simple assault which caused a minor injury and in my view fell below the threshold of severity required for a breach of article 3. </p>

Each compound was intended to hold up to 500 people and was surrounded by barbed wire fencing.  Colonel Pittman, who was the second in command while British forces were running Camp Bucca and who gave evidence at the second trial, estimated that the size of each compound was around 150 metres by 75 metres.  Within each compound there were two large marquee tents.  The sides of the tents could be rolled up and were kept rolled up most of the time.  Colonel Pittman said that within each tent the ground was covered with domestic carpet.  Each prisoner was provided with a blanket but no other form of bedding.  Mr Alseran, MRE and KSU all said – and I accept – that, because of the number of prisoners in the compound where they were held, they would sometimes have to sleep on the sand outside the tented area. </p>

This was similar to the food rations issued to the British troops but many detainees objected to it because it was not the kind of food that they were used to eating.  Some of the detainees started a hunger strike to protest about the food.  After this, the British soldiers agreed to allow the detainees to cook their own food and the quality improved.  (As mentioned earlier, KSU worked as one of the cooks.)  After these arrangements were implemented, food was prepared in a central area and distributed to each compound twice a day (except for Sundays, when the prisoners continued to receive ration packs). </p>

There were daily latrine patrols in which the faeces were taken out, the sand was burned with diesel and the pits were limed.

He said that detainees were, however, given the same amount of water as British troops.  Colonel Pittman recalled the water ration being 2 litres a day.

The requirement to treat protected persons humanely has been described in the ICRC Commentary as the basic theme of the Geneva Conventions: see Commentary on the Geneva Conventions of 1949, vol III, ICRC, 1960, p140.  This requirement is stated in article 13 of Geneva III, article 27 of Geneva IV, article 75 of AP I and article 4 of AP II.  A question on which I invited argument at the second trial was whether the specific provisions of the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of internees referred to above are intended to spell out in concrete form what humane treatment requires in the context of internment, such that a failure to comply with those provisions gives rise to an inference of inhuman treatment.  That in turn might found an inference that there was a breach of article 3 of the European Convention, much as the European Court in assessing conditions of detention has treated failure to comply with certain specific requirements relating to personal space and other aspects of detention as creating a presumption that article 3 has been violated: see <span style="font-style:italic">Ananyev v Russia</span> (2012) 55 EHRR 18, paras 143-159. </p>

It is clear that a basic purpose of the Geneva Conventions is to seek to ensure that prisoners of war and other persons protected by the Conventions are treated humanely.  There can also be no doubt that the specific requirements relating to the treatment of internees referred to at paragraph 512 above are intended to further that basic purpose.  But when regard is had to the nature and degree of detail of the requirements, they cannot reasonably be understood as defining the obligation of humane treatment such that – to take two examples – a failure to set up a canteen at which food and other articles can be purchased or a failure to encourage intellectual pursuits also constitutes a breach of the more fundamental obligation to treat prisoners humanely.  Still less can any transposition automatically be made to what constitutes a breach of the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment established by article 3 of the European Convention. </p>

It is in the nature of those standards that they cannot be reduced to a check list of specific requirements.  There are too many variables.  For example, conditions which would not constitute inhuman treatment if a person was detained in those conditions for a few days might become so if the detention lasted for several months.  It seems to me that, while the specific provisions of the Geneva Conventions are a helpful reference point, what is ultimately required is a broad evaluative judgment.  It is necessary to ask: having regard to all the circumstances – including the logistical difficulties faced by the detaining power at the relevant stage of the conflict and the length of the claimant’s detention – were the conditions in which the claimant was detained, either in a particular respect or considered overall, calculated to cause such intense suffering or hardship as to deny, to a seriously detrimental extent, the claimant’s most basic needs as a human being? </p>

The Manual adopts this approach but also recognises, realistically, that in the modern era when merchant ships frequently operate under flags of convenience the fact that another state’s flag is flown does not prevent a ship from being considered enemy in character on the basis of other criteria, including ownership: see part V, section I, paras 112 and 117. </p>

But even if not, in circumstances where the ship was anchored in an Iraqi inland waterway and manned by an Iraqi crew, I think it clear that the boarding party was entitled to treat the ship as an Iraqi merchant vessel. </p>

As merchant seamen are referred to in article 4A(4), they fall into one of the categories of person who are classified under the Geneva Conventions both as prisoners of war (if they are captured) and as civilians.  The significance of being a civilian is that, pursuant to article 51 of AP I, civilians enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations and must not be the object of attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.  Being a “civilian” within the meaning of article 50, however, does not give a person protected status under Geneva IV, since <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> categories of prisoner of war are excluded from the ambit of Geneva IV (see paragraph 246 above).

The investigation of the facts at this trial indicates that there was no such evidence.  That must also have been the conclusion reached by the assessment panels which interviewed MRE and KSU, as the decision made was to release them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in">Although unlawful under Iraqi law, the capture and initial detention of MRE and KSU was in accordance with international humanitarian law.  They were, however, entitled under international humanitarian law and article 5 of the European Convention to have their cases assessed and a decision whether to intern or release them made promptly following their arrival at Camp Bucca on 25 March 2003.  Making all due allowance for the wartime conditions, such an assessment should have taken place within, at most, ten days of their internment.  In fact, their cases were not considered until 10 April 2003 – when the decision was made that they should be released.  In the result, MRE and KSU were unlawfully detained for six days.  Their detention during this period therefore violated article 5 of the European Convention and also gave rise to a claim in tort (as the British government did not authorise detention which was in breach of international humanitarian law and the Human Rights Act). </p>

At the time of the trial he was aged 53.  He is more highly educated than the other claimants in these lead cases, having a degree in Mathematics from Basra University.  After graduating from university, he was conscripted for six years’ compulsory military service, as all Iraqi men were at the time.  He served in the Gulf War in 1990-91 as part of an air defence unit, and saw two of his friends die and a fellow officer sustain severe injuries when his unit was struck by a missile. </p>

By this time Iraq was badly affected by economic sanctions and the only work he could find was in Tikrit in the Salahadin Province to the north of Baghdad.  Mr Al-Waheed worked as an interior decorator in the mansions of government officials, specialising in elaborate cornice work.  In 2000 he managed to get a more secure job in the state-owned electricity company, as a computer programmer controlling the gas turbine generators.  By then he had been married for ten years to his first wife, with whom he had five children. </p>

One of the houses (“Alpha 418”) was Nazhat’s family house and the aim of the raid was to arrest her brother, Ali Jaleel (referred to as “Bravo 418”), and to search the house for any illegal weapons and exploitable information.  At least 30 soldiers were involved in the operation.  They were commanded by Mr Gareth Fulton who served in the Yorkshire Regiment from 2005 to 2013 and was a Lieutenant at the time.  Mr Fulton and three other men who took part in the operation were called by the MOD as witnesses at the trial.  The other men called as witnesses were: Major Ben Sawyer, then a Captain in the Royal Logistic Corps and an expert in IED disposal; Mr David Turner, then a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers who was second in command of a search team of six men who searched Alpha 418; and Mr Gareth Raper, then a Lance Corporal in the Yorkshire Regiment who was the first soldier to enter the house. </p>

Operation Saddlers was no exception.  On their way to the target houses the military convoy, consisting of Snatch Land Rovers and Warrior light armoured vehicles, came under attack from small arms fire and Rocket Propelled Grenades (“RPGs”).  An IED also exploded behind one of the vehicles but caused no damage.  On the return journey to the military base at Basra Airport the convoy again came under attack from small arms fire and RPGs.  Fire was returned, with four hits claimed.  The convoy was also delayed by a major obstacle in the road.  As a result, the return journey, which would normally take about 30 minutes, took over two hours.  The convoy arrived back at the Basra Airport base between 0315 and 0330 on 12 February 2007. </p>

Criminality, political assassinations and sectarian killings, all of which were rampant in 2006, receded somewhat and – certainly as compared to elsewhere in the country – a relative calm prevailed.  Yet this reality was both superficial and fleeting.  By March-April 2007, renewed political tensions once more threatened to destabilise the city, and relentless attacks against British forces in effect had driven them off the streets into increasingly secluded compounds.  Basra’s residents and militiamen view this not as an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat.  Today, the city is controlled by militias, seemingly more powerful and unconstrained that before.” </p>

This records the times of the sessions and a very short summary of what Mr Al-Waheed said (to the effect that he was only visiting his wife at the time of his arrest and knew nothing of any evidence recovered from the house). </p>

On inspecting Mr Al-Waheed, Dr Moy noted “extensive linear bruising over shoulders and upper arms”.  He also marked this bruising on a body diagram.  Dr Moy remembered the bruising as a pattern of lines in multiple directions.  It gave him the impression that Mr Al-Waheed might have been hit with an implement such as a stick.

In the hallway there was an unknown male standing near the door to room 1.  Lance Corporal Raper needed to get to room 1 (which had another, locked entrance from the street through which soldiers had been trying to break in – marked in the plan as “entry point 1”) so he moved the male into room 7.  Once the male was moved, Lance Corporal Raper entered room 1 by pushing the door down using his body.  He said: “I cannot state whether the door was locked or not.  The door came open easily.”  He stated that, once he had gained entry to room 1, he saw the IED. </p>

He said that, several minutes after the Alpha was secure, he went into the Alpha.  He said he found a soldier – whom I will refer to as Lance Corporal “L” – with the Bravo (target person) in room 7 and the IED in room 1.  He explained the comment he had made in his first statement about the unknown male being seen in the same room as the IED by saying that he recalled speaking to Raper and L individually in the house.  Lance Corporal Raper told him about the IED find and Lance Corporal L told him he had detained the Bravo.  Lieutenant Fulton stated that, as Raper and L were working as a pair, he had presumed (incorrectly) that the Bravo was found in the same room as the IED.  He said he could not recall why he had written in his first statement that the unknown male was sat down messing about with the IED, but confirmed: </p>

He said he now thinks that he did not in fact enter the building through the door marked “entry point 2” on his plan as recorded in those statements and it was actually more likely that he entered through “entry point 1”.  He said he remembers that Private P entered the property first and that he and others followed behind.  He believes that when he entered what he now thinks was room 1 he did indeed see a man sitting on the sofa with a very large IED in front of him in the centre of the room; on seeing the soldiers, the man ran into room 3 (the hall) and then into room 7.  Mr Fulton agreed that what he said in his statements at the time is more likely to be accurate than his memory now of what happened some nine years ago and said that the difference has caused him some anxiety.  Nevertheless, he said he has wrestled with the question of what happened and his memory is that he saw Mr Al-Waheed moving out of the room where the IED was found. </p>

At the same time it is obvious that his memory cannot be better nine years after the relevant events than it was when he made a statement on 8 March 2007, three weeks after the strike operation, for the purpose of clarifying exactly what he had and had not seen when he entered the target house.  Mr Fulton’s current memory of events is also completely inconsistent with the other contemporaneous statements.  His testimony is, in my view, a textbook example of a false memory created in trying to make sense of something that happened a long time ago.  What Mr Fulton has clearly wrestled with is how he could have written in his first statement made immediately after the operation that the detainee was seen “sat down messing about” with the IED if neither he nor anyone else had in fact made such an observation and if the detainee was not even found in the same room as the IED.  Mr Fulton has evidently convinced himself that he could not have written that the detainee was “sat down messing about” with the IED unless he had witnessed it. </p>

It certainly had that effect at first, as it led to the belief that Mr Al-Waheed had been caught “red handed”.

This assessment was based principally on the fact that Mr Al-Waheed was arrested in a house in which an IED was found and on his “actions on arrest”.  Those actions are not specified in the report, but I think it likely that they refer to the claims in Lieutenant Fulton’s first statement that Mr Al-Waheed had run out of the room where the IED was found, having been seen “messing about” with the device.  The assessment was also thought to be supported by Mr Al-Waheed’s “technical knowledge and military experience” and the fact that in the second interrogation session he mentioned that he had nothing to do with IED making before the interrogator mentioned the topic – which was taken to indicate that he had something to hide. </p>

Mr Al-Waheed maintained that he was only visiting his wife when he was arrested; that the house belonged to his brother-in-law, Ali Jaleel Hamadi, whom he had only known for around three months since his marriage and had only met on a few occasions; that he hated terrorists for killing his cousin, who had worked as an interpreter for the MNF, and for ruining his country; and that his brother had worked as an interpreter for the British forces but had left when their cousin was killed. </p>

There was also an obligation to notify the DIRC where it became apparent to either the officer in command of the detention facility or any member of the DIRC or the officer who originally interned an individual that internment might no longer be justified for imperative reasons of security.  The DIRC had then to convene an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> meeting as soon as reasonably practicable to review the internment of that individual. </p>

As recorded in the minutes of the meeting, the legal officer told the committee that Mr Al-Waheed had been detained during an operation which involved searching an Alpha for a Bravo.  The Bravo was not present, but the detainee was found in a room “messing around with” an IED.  He fled the room before being restrained by British troops.  The committee discussed the information presented and concluded that Mr Al-Waheed was caught “red-handed”.  They voted unanimously to intern him on the basis that it was necessary to do so for imperative reasons of security. </p>

By this time the inaccurate information about the circumstances of Mr Al-Waheed’s arrest had been corrected, as the RMP had taken the additional statements from Private P and Lance Corporal Raper mentioned earlier and had also spoken to Lieutenant Fulton to clarify the position.  According to the minutes of the meeting, the Chief Intelligence Officer explained that Mr Al-Waheed’s detention was not based on any intelligence and rested solely on his proximity to an IED which was found in the same property as him.  Initially it had been believed that Mr Al-Waheed had been found in the same room as the IED.  However, this was now not the case and it transpired that he had just been in the same property.  The Chief Intelligence Officer stated that it was the opinion of JFIT having interrogated Mr Al-Waheed over the last ten days that he was nothing more than a person “in the wrong place at the wrong time”.  The committee was also told that Mr Al-Waheed’s brother had come to see the legal officer and had said that Mr AlWaheed had just recently married and was visiting his new wife at her family home. </p>

In this email the senior legal officer (who had been one of the two committee members in the minority who had voted on 22 February 2007 to continue Mr Al-Waheed’s internment) questioned whether the committee had at that meeting been given an accurate summary of the evidence bearing on whether or not Mr Al-Waheed had been found in the same room as the IED.  The senior legal officer recalled the Chief Intelligence Officer as having told the committee that the witnesses had now changed their stance as to what they did and did not see.  He observed in his note that the committee had accepted this at face value and no detail of who or which witnesses had changed their statements was gone into.  The senior legal officer said that he would like to go into such detail now so that the committee could consider the evidence and decide “if there was in fact a change in perception to be made”. </p>

By this time Lieutenant Fulton’s second statement had been obtained which confirmed that Lieutenant Fulton had not been in the house when Mr Al-Waheed was detained, that he had not seen Mr Al-Waheed in the same room as the IED and that the assertion in his first statement that Mr Al-Waheed was found with the IED was erroneous.  The minutes of the meeting on 12 March 2007 record the senior legal officer outlining the background and noting that a new statement had now been obtained from Lieutenant Fulton which confirmed the change of evidence.  The committee nevertheless decided to put over the decision whether to release Mr Al-Waheed until the next DIRC meeting.  Two reasons for this were recorded in the minutes.  First, the committee was told that the ordnance recovered from the strike operation had been sent for forensic testing, but the results of the testing had not yet been received and it was thought that the forensic evidence could bear on the decision whether to release Mr Al-Waheed.  Second, three members of the DIRC who were present on 22 February 2007 when the decision had been made to release Mr Al-Waheed were absent.  According to the minutes, the GOC commented on “the need for continuity of decision makers” and “it was agreed to wait to make a new decision with a DIRC as originally constituted.” </p>

A second example is that, when asked to assess the severity of the pain that he suffered in detention on a subjective scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain it would be possible to experience, he assessed the pain from the beating he allegedly suffered at 9 and the pain from his haemorrhoids at 10.

However, he had recently happened to meet someone who lived across the street from Nazhat’s old house and who had seen him being brought out of the house at great speed by the soldiers.  This person recalled that Mr Al-Waheed had a helmet on his head, goggles and something on his ears but no bag on his head.

I am also sure that Mr Al-Waheed was not hooded, as he originally claimed, and think it unlikely that he had a helmet put on his head – although he is undoubtedly correct in stating that blacked out goggles and ear defenders were placed on him, which was the standard practice in such operations.  Mr Al-Waheed’s evidence about hooding and wearing a helmet is, I think, a good illustration of how his memories of what happened have been shaped by his physical feelings as he now remembers them (difficulty in breathing and weight on his head) and external influences (what he has seen on television or been told by someone else). </p>

(I am equally sure that Nazhat’s sister would have told Abdulmajeed if she and Nazhat had themselves been beaten by soldiers.)

Although I do not find that the force used was unlawful, I reject the MOD’s assertion that this was probably done for his own safety.

It is equally plain that this bruising and also swelling on Mr Al-Waheed’s upper back and arms must still have been clearly visible two days later when these injuries were referred to in the statement taken by the RMP and photographs were taken of the injuries.  Although those photographs have not been found, the earlier photographs taken of Mr Al-Waheed at Basra Airport suggest that he had been hit in the face.  The blood in his right ear noted by Dr Thomson at that time (although Dr Thomson failed to note any other signs of injury) and the blood found in a sample of Mr Al-Waheed’s urine taken on his arrival at the Shaibah detention facility are also consistent with beating. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The obvious occasion when such a beating could have been inflicted is during the journey from the house to Basra Airport following Mr Al-Waheed’s arrest.  That accords not only with Mr Al-Waheed’s evidence but, much more reliably, with his brother’s evidence of what Mr Al-Waheed told him when he first visited Mr AlWaheed in detention.  There is no need for me to reach any positive conclusion about the implement used, which Mr Al-Waheed could not see because he was wearing blacked out goggles.  I am not persuaded by Mr Fulton’s evidence that soldiers would have put themselves in danger if they had hit someone with their rifle butts, particularly if they were seated and the person struck was lying on the floor at their feet.  As Mr Fulton demonstrated in court, the rifle could not fire unless the safety catch was first removed and the trigger was then pressed.  The SA80 rifle also has a short barrel and an overall length of just over 30 inches (or approximately 78 cm).  I do not accept the suggestion that there was too little room to wield the weapon within the confines of the vehicle.  But it is also possible that some other implement was used.  I accept that such a beating is unlikely to have taken place while the vehicle was travelling at speed over bumpy roads.  I have mentioned, however, that the journey to Basra Airport, which was normally around 30 minutes, took over two hours and that the convoy was delayed because of (amongst other reasons) a major obstacle in the road.  There must therefore have been significant periods of time when the vehicle was stationary. </p>

Mr Al-Waheed was the only male found in a house in which a large quantity of explosives and a partly assembled IED were discovered.  In the soldiers’ eyes, he might well have been responsible for killing and injuring their comrades.  It is a matter of public record that in the week before the operation two British soldiers had been killed by IEDs in separate incidents in Basra.  One of those incidents had occurred only two or three days earlier on 9 February 2007.  In that incident one soldier, Private Luke Simpson, was killed and an officer sustained serious injuries when an IED detonated close to their vehicle.  Like the soldiers who arrested Mr Al-Waheed, they were both members of the Yorkshire Regiment.  Mr Fulton said that he knew the officer who was severely injured in the explosion very well and that some of his men would have been likely to know the soldier who died, Private Simpson.  Mr Fulton also explained that no distinction was drawn by the British soldiers between different insurgent groups, all of whom were known simply as “the enemy”. </p>

Facebook messages which L has posted, including one posted on 9 February 2014, the seventh anniversary of Private Simpson’s death, show that he was very close to Private Simpson.  Documents disclosed during the trial by the MOD also show that Lance Corporal L was suspected of involvement in an assault on civilians when stationed in the Falkland Islands on 15 March 2008.  The incident was investigated by the RMP but no charges were brought.  The claimant relies on this incident and on Facebook messages discussing fights in which Lance Corporal L was involved to suggest that he had a propensity to violence. </p>

I bear in mind that, when Mr Al-Waheed was interviewed on the afternoon of 14 February 2007, less than three days had elapsed since his arrest.  Even if he had not been assaulted by British soldiers as he claims – and even more so if he had – the circumstances of his arrest and initial detention must have been traumatic.  Since his arrest, he had also been repeatedly interrogated by British soldiers and had hardly any sleep.  After being brought to Basra Airport, he was subjected to “tactical questioning” (probably involving, as I shall find, ‘harsh’ interrogation methods) between 0426 and 0630 that morning.  Then, following his arrival at the Shaibah detention facility in the afternoon of 12 February, he had been interrogated 11 more times.  This included interrogations at intervals throughout the night of 12/13 February.  On every occasion when he had been taken from one place to another – including, I infer, when he was taken to be interviewed by the RMP – he was subjected to sensory deprivation.  To put it at its lowest, these were not propitious circumstances in which to ask Mr Al-Waheed whether he had any complaint to make that he had been ill-treated by his captors and invite him to make a statement giving details of any such complaint.  Nor is it necessary to have studied guidance on the difficulties of interviewing vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to appreciate that a prisoner in Mr Al-Waheed’s position is likely to have been extremely wary about making allegations to British soldiers – whatever assurances the RMP gave him of their independence – about how other British soldiers had recently ill-treated him. </p>

Dr Moy’s estimate when he examined Mr Al-Waheed was that the bruises were no more than three days old.  It would be a cruel coincidence if, within the day or so before he was arrested and detained by British forces, Mr Al-Waheed happened to have been the victim of a deliberate beating by someone else.  Nor does the evidence give any credence to such a possibility.  Amongst other things, Mr Al-Waheed was interrogated extensively by British intelligence officers about his associations and his movements in the period before his arrest.  In later interrogation sessions, he was assessed by the interrogation team not only to be answering all questions fully and truthfully but as willing to provide any information required.  Yet nothing emerged to indicate that he had been the victim of an assault by a third party shortly before his arrest, nor to indicate any circumstances in which such an assault could possibly have occurred. </p>

It was suggested that Mr Al-Waheed had been slow to reveal to his interrogators things that he knew about Ali Jaleel.  After the interrogators started using a friendly approach, however, and asked him to think about anything that might be pertinent, he told them about an occasion around seven weeks earlier when he was visiting his brother-inlaw’s house and came across a box that Ali Jaleel had left on top of an oil tank in the garden.  Mr Al-Waheed said that he was curious and, on looking inside, he found a wooden box which had a small plastic tube running out of the top and back into it.  He also found two carrier bags which were full of a putty type substance.  Mr Al-Waheed told the interrogators that he later asked his wife about these items and she told him to stay out of Ali’s business and not to ask.  He said that his wife had previously warned him to stay away from Ali’s business. </p>

I cannot conceive that within a few hours of such a beating Mr Al-Waheed would have been staying overnight in his brother-in-law’s house.  Nor can I see any reason why, if Mr Al-Waheed had been beaten by members of the Mahdi Army, he would have withheld this information from his interrogators (whilst nevertheless telling them about the box that he had found in the garden).  Had he indeed been beaten in order to warn him off, it would have been to his obvious advantage to disclose this fact in order to demonstrate that he was not a terrorist and to establish his innocence. </p>

It also seems to me that a practice which prevented detainees who were already defenceless from being able to see (or hear) exactly what was being done to them or by whom was not only calculated to make the detainees feel more vulnerable but also – by dehumanising them and giving their captors a cloak of invisibility – to increase the risk of physical abuse. </p>

Cases in which violations have been found, however, have involved far longer periods than the period of 13 days during which Mr AlWaheed was segregated from other prisoners.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Shahid v Scottish Ministers</span> [2015] UKSC 58, [2016] AC 429, the Supreme Court held that segregation (albeit not complete) from other prisoners with a total duration of four years eight months did not violate article 3, although there was found to be a violation of the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article 8.  International reports referred to in the judgment of the Supreme Court at paras 78-80 express concern about the potentially harmful effects of (total) solitary confinement exceeding 14 or 15 days.  Even by that standard, the period of Mr Al-Waheed’s segregation was not excessive. </p>

Increasingly in these interrogation sessions as time went on, a “friendly” approach was adopted.  Judging by the video recordings of the two later interrogation sessions which I have seen, Mr Al-Waheed developed a reasonable rapport with the interrogation team.  Nor did his evidence suggest to me that his segregation from other prisoners was a matter which caused him distress – certainly in comparison with other aspects of his treatment about which he complains. </p>

The policy of sensory deprivation adopted at the north compound also in my view involved such a violation.  Being deprived of sight and hearing is calculated to cause feelings of disorientation and anxiety.  The suggestion was again made that the policy was justified for reasons of “operational security”.  But the MOD did not adduce any evidence to explain what these reasons were nor why this measure was allegedly necessary.  It was certainly not necessary to prevent escape, since prisoners were handcuffed and guarded whenever they were taken out of their cells.  In the absence of evidence giving any different explanation, the inference that I draw is that the measure was used as a form of conditioning of internees, to make them more pliable when questioned.  That is not a legitimate purpose. </p>

The MOD policy in relation to the questioning of internees at the Shaibah detention facility at the time of Mr AlWaheed’s detention was that during the period of questioning internees should not be deprived of sleep and, specifically, should be allowed at least four hours uninterrupted sleep in each 24 hour period.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="42">

When he was first interrogated at 14.38 on 12 February 2007, he must have been awake for at least the previous 30 hours.  During the following 30 hours he was interrogated ten times, including regularly throughout the night.

Memorandum 3 was drafted on the basis that there was a power of internment where this was necessary for imperative reasons of security pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1546.  However, I have found that UN Security Council Resolution 1546 was not part of the domestic law of Iraq and that British forces had no power to intern people for security reasons under Iraqi law.

The Supreme Court held that in such a context article 5(1) should be read so as to accommodate, as a permissible ground, detention in accordance with a power of internment in international law conferred by a resolution of the UN Security Council.

Furthermore, analysis of a swab taken from Mr Al-Waheed on arrival at Basra Airport had produced a reading of one bar for RDX – an insignificant amount, which meant that he had not been close to an explosive.

That explanation was independently supported by information which Mr Al-Waheed’s brother had given to the legal officer when he visited the Basra Airport base to plead for Mr Al-Waheed’s release.

I do not consider that there was a reasonable basis for that decision.  There had been no relevant change of circumstances since the decision to release Mr Al-Waheed was made two days earlier.  In particular, no new information had come to light in the meantime which had not been available to the committee on 22 February 2007.  The decision to keep Mr Al-Waheed in custody appears to have been based on a concern of the senior legal officer that the committee may have been misled when it was told that it was now clear that Mr Al-Waheed was not seen in the same room as the IED.  However, the committee had not been misled.  The only occasion on which the committee was misled was at the first review meeting on 13 February 2007, when it had falsely been told that Mr Al-Waheed was found “messing about” with the IED.  By the time of the 22 February meeting, it had been established that this report was untrue. </p>

To the contrary, the second statement obtained from Lieutenant Fulton, which was available to the DIRC on 12 March 2007, merely confirmed that the committee had indeed taken its decision to release Mr Al-Waheed on a correct factual basis.  The reasons given on that occasion for keeping Mr AlWaheed in detention despite this confirmation were misconceived.  The first reason recorded in the minutes was that the ordnance found in the house had been sent for forensic testing which might produce evidence to link Mr Al-Waheed to the ordnance.  Internment cannot, however, be justified on the basis that, although no evidence exists which implicates the internee in militant activity, such evidence might be obtained in future.  The second reason given was that the composition of the DIRC was different in that three members of the committee which had taken the original decision to release Mr Al-Waheed were not present.  This reason was even more spurious than the first.  No doubt continuity of decision-makers is desirable other things being equal, but the fact that some of the people who previously decided that he ought to be released are not available cannot be a good reason for keeping someone in custody without any evidential basis. </p>

The majority agreed with the view of Lord Sumption that the system had two critical failings.  These were, first, that it lacked independence and, second, that it made no provision for the participation of the detainee.

But the more substantial reason for rejecting this argument is that the power conferred by the UN Security Council on the UK to intern persons was a power to do so only when it was necessary for imperative reasons of security.  There was no power to intern an individual in the absence of such necessity.  There is nothing to suggest that the UK government intended to confer on individual officers and on the review committee charged with taking decisions regarding internment any authority which exceeded the UK’s powers under international law.  The grant of any wider authority would in any event have been unlawful under UK domestic law because – for reasons indicated above – detention which was not necessary for imperative reasons of security was contrary to article 5 of the European Convention and was therefore unlawful by reason of the Human Rights Act.  By the same token, the UK government could not lawfully authorise internment in accordance with a process which was incompatible with the standards of fairness required by article 5 and hence by the Human Rights Act. </p>

It follows that any claim in tort in relation to his arrest and the initial period of his detention is barred by the doctrine of Crown act of state but that a claim in tort in respect of his detention after 22 February 2007 is not. </p>

It was also his opinion that a claimant only has the knowledge required to start time running when he knows with certainty that he has sustained a particular injury as a result of the defendant’s act – which may only be on receipt of a medical diagnosis.  On this basis the claimants argued that, in relation to the psychiatric injuries for which they are claiming compensation, time only began to run when they saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed their condition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">A further point on which the experts disagreed is how article 232 applies to a case of unlawful detention.  In Professor Hamoudi’s opinion, the three year limitation period begins at the time of imprisonment, provided the claimant knows who has imprisoned him.  In the opinion of Professor Al-Dabbagh, it is also necessary for the claimant to know that the imprisonment was unlawful.  On this point too, I accept Professor Hamoudi’s view as correct.  The text of article 232 identifies two matters only of which knowledge is required – injury and the identity of the person who caused the injury; it does not state that the injured person must also be aware that the act which caused the injury was unlawful.  Professor Al-Dabbagh did not give any convincing reason for implying such an additional requirement.  Moreover, he accepted that, in a claim for injury caused by, for example, a physical blow where the defendant asserts that he was acting in self-defence, time begins to run when the blow is struck and not when a court rejects the plea of self-defence and finds that the act was unlawful.  I am unable to see a relevant distinction between such a case and one in which there is an issue about whether the claimant’s detention was lawful. </p>

The question debated at the trial of the preliminary issues was whether as a matter of Iraqi law article 435, properly interpreted, refers to (a) an impediment rendering it impossible for the claimant to sue in Iraq or (b) an impediment which makes it impossible for the claimant to sue in the jurisdiction in which the claim is in fact brought.  I accepted the view of the claimants’ expert that, properly interpreted, article 435 is concerned only with the possibility of bringing proceedings in Iraq.  I therefore concluded that, as a matter of Iraqi law, the primary limitation period of three years was suspended as a result of the fact that CPA Order 17 rendered it impossible for the claimants to claim their rights in Iraq: see <span style="font-style:italic">Iraqi Civilian Litigation v Ministry of Defence</span> [2015] EWHC 116 (QB). </p>

The Court of Appeal did so on the ground (not argued in this court) that CPA Order 17 is a purely procedural bar to bringing proceedings in Iraq which must be disregarded by the English court because it is not itself a law relating to limitation within the meaning of sections 1(1) and 4 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 nor is it a substantive rule of Iraqi law.

Lord Sumption (with whom the other Justices agreed) rejected the reasoning of the Court of Appeal.  He held that, although CPA Order 17 is a procedural rule which has no legal effect in an English court, an English court is not giving legal effect to CPA Order 17 in finding that it is impossible for a claimant to sue in an Iraqi court; it is simply recognising what the position is as a matter of fact.

But he saw the important question as being one of English law (not argued in the courts below) about the effect of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act.  He reasoned that applying the foreign law of limitation to proceedings in England in accordance with that Act “necessarily involves a process of transposition” (see para 13).  Thus, the relevant facts to which the law must be applied are facts applicable to the actual proceedings brought in England and not to some hypothetical proceedings that the claimants have not brought, and in this case could not have brought, in Iraq. </p>

Under Iraqi law, as under Egyptian law, the test is one of practical possibility.  Both rules, in the view of Sanhuri, can be equated with the rule of French law according to which a limitation period does not run against a person who has been prevented from acting (<span style="font-style:italic">contra non valentem agere non currit praescriptio</span>). </p>

At the same time, suspending the limitation period risks compromising the principles of legal certainty and stability on which the law of limitation is based.

	      </authorialNote>  The experts referred to a number of judicial decisions in which it was held that absence abroad did not suspend the limitation period because the claimant could have appointed an attorney to pursue the case on his or her behalf.  Thus, in one case the Court of Cassation held that even being sentenced to death <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> was not a lawful excuse because the claimant could have instructed an Iraqi lawyer to represent him by going to a public notary in the country where he was residing.  Similarly, in another case the fact that a retired person was travelling abroad was not considered a lawful excuse for failing to bring a claim for payment of a pension because the law allowed such a claim to be made by an attorney. </p>

Accordingly, if such difficulties are so severe that they do not give a reasonable person a practical opportunity to claim his right, the limitation period will be suspended for as long as the difficulties are of such severity.  However, if it is hard but not impossible for a reasonable person in the circumstances of the claimant to commence proceedings, then there is no lawful excuse under article 435. </p>

The experts agreed that fear of severe consequences (such as physical harm or imprisonment) for the claimant or a member of his family if suit is brought can suspend the limitation period.  However, they disagreed about whether the relevant standard is a subjective one based simply on what the claimant actually believes (as Professor Al-Dabbagh maintained) or whether the standard is objective, based on what a reasonable person in the circumstances of the claimant would fear (which was Professor Hamoudi’s view).  In support of his view, Professor al-Dabbagh drew an analogy with duress and gave the example of a threat of black magic, which could create sufficient fear to be a lawful excuse in an uneducated person living in a rural area but not in an educated city dweller. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that this disagreement really came down to whether fear can itself be regarded as a personal impediment, similar to an illness, or whether the relevant impediment is regarded, not as the claimant’s fear, but as the circumstance which gives rise to that fear.  I also consider that, in accordance with the principles agreed between the experts, the claimant’s fear cannot itself be regarded as a personal impediment unless it is of a truly pathological nature which deprives the claimant of capacity to make a claim.  Subject only to this, I think that Professor Hamoudi must be right in regarding the relevant impediment as whatever causes the claimant’s fear rather than the claimant’s state of mind.  I also accept Professor Hamoudi’s view – on which he was not challenged – that the extent of the impediment is in principle to be measured by reference to the actual facts and not by reference to what the claimant honestly but mistakenly believes the facts to be. </p>

Dr George described how difficult and dangerous this journey was and how costly the visa application process.  The prospect of obtaining a visa, even if applied for, may be judged by the fact (mentioned in paragraph 27 of this judgment) that, for the first of these trials, the claimants and their witnesses were refused visas to travel to the UK to attend court even though all their expenses, including return flights, were being funded by Leigh Day, and visas were only granted after judicial review proceedings had been issued to challenge the refusal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The MOD also relied on a witness statement from Mr Benjamin Sanders, an official at the MOD, who expressed the opinion that there was a general awareness among the Iraqi population of the possibility of bringing claims for compensation against the British Army.  However, I do not consider that Mr Sanders had either any relevant expertise or any factual basis for giving this opinion.  In so far as his opinion was based on the existence of an Area Claims Office at the British base in Basra, there is no evidence that any attempt was made to publicise the existence of that office.  Nor, for those Iraqi citizens who did become aware of the Area Claims Office, did its existence indicate that it was possible to bring court proceedings against the MOD in England.  The evidence shows that, of a total of 3,262 claims made to the Area Claims Office, the vast majority were claims for compensation for damage to property; and Mr Roberts, who gave evidence about this, could not recall any claim for compensation for alleged ill-treatment or unlawful detention.  Although Mr Sanders confidently asserted that there was extensive media reporting in Iraq of the Baha Mousa and Al Sweady inquiries, the sole basis for this assertion proved to be a small number of English language media reports in Al-Jazeera.  Mr Al-Attabi said that the only case which became a matter of public knowledge was that of Baha Mousa.  He said that he learnt about this case “from conversations at the courthouse” and that the first time that he had seen any media reports in Iraq of compensation claims brought by Iraqi citizens in the English courts was in 2016 in anticipation of the first of these trials. </p>

In analysing the claimants’ case on this issue, it is necessary in my view to distinguish two kinds of impediment to the bringing of their claims.  One kind of impediment consists in the practical difficulties for an Iraqi citizen of suing the MOD for compensation for allegedly unlawful detention and/or ill treatment in the English courts.  The other kind of impediment consists of lack of knowledge of the possibility and means of bringing such a claim. </p>

They did not establish a continuing relationship through which claims could be made.  The position changed in January 2006 when Leigh Day entered into a referral agreement with PIL under which Leigh Day agreed to take on claims for damages on behalf of clients of PIL.  From that time an avenue was open – at first via PIL and later directly from Abu Jamal – through which it was possible for an Iraqi citizen who had a personal injury claim to sue the MOD for damages in the English courts with the benefit of a conditional fee agreement.  This avenue was closed at the end of 2010 when, as mentioned earlier, Leigh Day decided that (except in the most extreme cases) they would no longer consider any potential claim where the incident giving rise to it had occurred more than three years previously.  It reopened in August 2012 when Leigh Day again began to accept new cases. </p>

Despite a request made by Mr Al-Waheed in writing with the help of an interpreter, the identity cards were not returned when he was released.  Their loss caused real problems because, without them, Mr Al-Waheed could not register his children for school.  To try to get the documents back, Mr AlWaheed visited the Basra Airport base in June 2008, despite the dangers of doing so.  He was told that, before the British authorities would accept a complaint about the missing property, he would have to provide evidence to show that he had made a complaint to an Iraqi court.  Mr Al-Waheed found out from a friend who was a lawyer that this would require him to obtain evidence from his wife, Nazhat, and her family and for the police to inspect her house.  Because his relations with Nazhat’s family had completely broken down by this stage, he did not pursue the matter further.  This episode indicates, however, Mr Al-Waheed would not have been inhibited by fear or by his psychological condition from making a claim against the British forces following his release if he had known that this was a practical possibility. </p>

I have found that it became possible to do so from January 2006 when Leigh Day began to accept instructions from Iraqi claimants who were referred to them by PIL.  Accordingly, time started to run then for bringing a claim.  It follows that, in these cases, the limitation period expired in January 2009.

Pursuant to articles 9 and 10 of the Iraqi Criminal Procedure Code, a person who has suffered harm as a result of a crime which is also a civil wrong is entitled to claim compensation for the civil wrong in the criminal proceedings.  Furthermore, a written criminal complaint is deemed to include such a claim unless it clearly indicates otherwise.  However, in Professor Hamoudi’s view, it is only where a civil claim is made or deemed to be made under these rules that the commencement of the limitation period is interrupted by criminal proceedings.

Professor Al-Dabbagh did not explain how conceptually the commencement of criminal proceedings can satisfy the requirements of article 437 if no claim asserting a right to compensation under the Civil Code is made or deemed to be made to the criminal court.  I can see that if the victim of an alleged crime makes a complaint to the judicial authorities which is deemed to include a civil claim, but states that she does not wish to have the civil claim decided by the criminal court and expressly reserves the right to pursue it in the civil courts after the criminal case has been decided, the view could be taken that a claim has been made which interrupts the limitation period.  This may be the explanation of decisions of the Court of Cassation to which Professor Al-Dabbagh referred holding that civil proceedings begun within three years of the final judgment of the criminal court were not barred by limitation.  In each of these cases the claimant had in the criminal proceedings reserved the right to claim compensation before the civil court.  But if, for example, a criminal investigation is triggered by a third party reporting an alleged crime and the victim does not make any civil claim in the course of the criminal proceedings, I am unable to see how it can be said that the limitation period has been interrupted. </p>

He argued that such persons (or at any rate members of the RMP) were authorised to investigate crimes in Iraq by section 2(4) of CPA Order 17.  While section 2(1) of CPA Order 17 gave MNF personnel immunity from Iraqi legal process, section 2(4) recognised the right of their Sending States to “exercise within Iraq any criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction conferred on them by the law of that Sending State over all persons subject to the military law of that Sending State”.  Professor Al-Dabbagh characterised this provision as giving the RMP “jurisdiction to operate in Iraq as an investigative authority”.  It is plain from its wording, however, that section 2(4) of CPA Order 17 merely allowed the RMP to exercise within Iraq powers conferred on them by UK law to investigate whether British military personnel serving abroad have committed offences under UK criminal law.  Section 2(4) did not itself grant any investigative powers to the RMP, let alone any powers to investigate whether criminal offences had been committed under Iraqi law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I also do not accept that, as a matter of Iraqi law, knowledge that criminal proceedings have been concluded is necessary in order for the limitation period to recommence.  In support of that view Professor Al-Dabbagh referred to a decision of the Egyptian Court of Cassation quashing a judgment in which it had been held that the limitation period began when the defendant was convicted of a criminal offence.  In the court’s view, it could not necessarily be inferred that the victim actually knew when the criminal court reached its decision that damage had occurred and who had caused it – as required by the Egyptian equivalent of article 232 of the Iraqi Civil Code – in circumstances where the victim was not represented in the criminal proceedings. </p>

This is not the position, however, in Mr Al-Waheed’s case.  I have already concluded that Mr Al-Waheed had the knowledge required by article 232 from the time when he suffered injuries at the hands of British soldiers.  There was nothing further that he needed to know which depended on the outcome of the RMP investigation.  Nor would knowledge that the investigation had been terminated (if, contrary to my view, Mr Al-Waheed was unaware of that fact) have taken him any further forward.  I can therefore see no basis for arguing that, until Mr Al-Waheed was informed of the fact that the investigation had been terminated, time did not begin to run. </p>

Section 2(1) of the 1984 Act provides that section 1 does not apply to the extent that its application would conflict with public policy in any case.  Moreover, pursuant to section 2(2), the application of section 1 is deemed to conflict with public policy to the extent that it would cause “undue hardship” to a party to the proceedings.  The claimants rely on both limbs of section 2.  It was argued on their behalf that they would suffer undue hardship if Iraqi limitation law were to be applied; alternatively, that to apply Iraqi limitation law would in any event conflict with public policy. </p>

I mention this not because I think that there is any question of applying the English law of limitation.  As I will explain later, the result of disapplying the Iraqi limitation period would not, in my view, be to require English limitation law to be applied.  The result would simply be that the claims are not time-barred.  I have referred to the English statute of limitation because, in considering the arguments that the Iraqi law is contrary to English public policy, it is useful to have in mind how far the relevant Iraqi law differs from the corresponding English law and the extent to which it is similar. </p>

The claimants in this case claimed damages for personal injury caused by sexual abuse allegedly committed by the first defendant in Uganda on various dates between thirteen and twenty years before the action was commenced.  The claims were governed by Ugandan law which had a three year limitation period running from the date when the cause of action arose or (if later) the date when the claimant reached the age of 18.  The proceedings in England were begun some seven years after the youngest of the three claimants had reached the age of 18, and the claims were therefore all time-barred under Ugandan law.  Wilkie J held that the application of section 1 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 would not cause undue hardship to the claimants.  A significant factor in his conclusion was that there was an alternative route open to the claimants to seek redress from the defendant, including financial redress, by way of a complaint to the Ugandan Human Rights Commission (see para 65). </p>

That could be the defendant, complaining of undue hardship on the basis that the claim is stale and either there is no applicable limitation period under the foreign law or the foreign limitation period is unduly liberal.  But where, as in the present cases, the party asserting undue hardship is the claimant – arguing that the foreign limitation law is unduly restrictive, it is only the impact on the claimant of applying the foreign law that can be taken into account.  The court cannot take account of whether disapplying the foreign law would prejudice the defendant because that is not part of the statutory test.  Hence the statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Harley v Smith</span> that the exercise is not a balancing exercise between the interests of the claimant on one hand and the defendant on the other. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the requirement of showing “undue” hardship impliedly recognises that the application of a time limit may often be said to cause hardship to a party who is thereby deprived of the opportunity of pursuing a claim (or who is forced to defend a stale claim), but that the existence of such hardship is not by itself a sufficient reason to disapply the time limit.  Moreover, the case law makes it clear that the English courts are not so parochial as to treat any limitation law which differs from our own as contrary to English public policy.  Hence the further statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Harley v Smith</span> that it is not sufficient to amount to “undue hardship” that the foreign limitation period is less generous than that of the English jurisdiction.  Private international law is founded on principles of comity and mutual respect and on the recognition that in many areas of law different approaches may be reasonably taken.  That is obviously true in the field of limitation law, which involves striking a balance between allowing claimants to assert their legal rights and protecting defendants against stale claims.  Different legal systems may legitimately strike this balance in different ways.  An English court should for this reason be very slow to substitute its own view for the solution adopted by a foreign legislature. </p>

One is the nature and scope of the relevant foreign limitation law.  Does it afford a reasonable opportunity to a potential claimant who is aware of it and acts with reasonable diligence to bring a claim?  The other is the conduct and situation of the individual claimant.  To what extent (if any) is the delay in bringing the claim attributable to the fault of the claimant?  These two aspects need to be considered in conjunction with each other to determine whether the application of the foreign limitation period would cause the claimant undue hardship in the circumstances of the particular case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Applying these principles, I start by considering the length and degree of latitude afforded by the relevant Iraqi limitation period.  As noted earlier, the three year primary limitation period under Iraqi law is more or less identical to the primary limitation period in English law.  Just as in English law, this time limit is not absolute and there is an exception where its operation would lead to injustice.  However, whereas in English law the court is given a broad discretion to extend the time limit where in the court’s opinion it would be equitable to do so, balancing the comparative prejudice to the claimant and to the defendant, the law of Iraq adopts a different approach and treats the limitation period as suspended by a lawful excuse when there is an impediment which makes it impossible for the claimant to claim his right.  The Iraqi law gives less protection to the claimant than section 33 of the Limitation Act in so far as what can count as a lawful excuse is narrower than the range of factors which can be taken into account under section 33; but at the same time the Iraqi law is more favourable to the claimant in that the suspension of the limitation period depends only on the claimant’s situation and the impact of the delay on the defendant is not weighed in the scale. </p>

More importantly, in all four cases the effect of the Iraqi law is that the claimant had a period of three years during which I have found that it was – not just in theory but in practice – possible for ordinary Iraqi citizens to bring a claim for compensation against the MOD in England with the assistance of Leigh Day.  From one point of view, this can be regarded as a reasonable opportunity to pursue a claim. </p>

However, a very significant factor, in my view, is that the claimants are not confined in this litigation to claims in tort under Iraqi law.  They also have parallel claims arising out of the same facts under the UK Human Rights Act.  As discussed in the earlier parts of this judgment, the claims under the Human Rights Act are not on all fours with the claims in tort.  Thus, not every application of force which constitutes an assault giving rise to liability in tort amounts to inhuman or degrading treatment under article 3 and, conversely, there can be a breach of article 3 – for example, through imprisonment in inhuman or degrading conditions – which does not necessarily involve an assault.  Similarly, there is not a complete symmetry between the claims for wrongful detention based on article 5 and in tort.  Nevertheless, as the analysis in this judgment has shown, there is a very high degree of overlap between the tort claims and the claims made under the Human Rights Act in these proceedings. </p>

I accept that, for this reason, applying the Iraqi rules of limitation has the result of causing some hardship to the claimants.  However, when account is taken of all the relevant circumstances identified above including the length of the delay in bringing these claims, it cannot in my opinion be said that this hardship is disproportionate or excessive. </p>

However, the fact that a claim in tort involves an alleged infringement of either of these or any other fundamental human rights is not in itself regarded in our own law as necessitating a longer or more generous period of limitation.

They rejected this approach “on the fundamental ground that it fails to take into account the manner in which considerations of public policy are intended to operate under our recommendations in this report”: see Law Commission Report No 114 (1982), para 4.40.  To explain their approach, the Law Commissioners gave an example of an action brought in England to recover a debt due under a contract governed by Ruritanian law, where Ruritanian law prescribes a period of one week within which to commence proceedings but the action is not commenced until seven years have elapsed from the date <span style="font-size:11pt">on </span>which the debt fell due.

Accordingly, if the court concludes that in the case before it application of the foreign limitation law would conflict with public policy, the effect of section 2(1) is that section 1 will not apply <span style="text-decoration:underline">to that extent</span>.  In other words, section 1(a), which would otherwise have required the court to apply the foreign limitation law, will not apply.  But that does not affect the negative aspect of section 1, contained in subsection (b), which provides that the law of England and Wales relating to limitation shall not apply.  I find it difficult to see that, at least in a case where the complaint is that the foreign limitation period is too short, public policy could ever be said positively to require English rules of limitation to be applied.  As the Law Commission’s Ruritanian example illustrates, if the court disapplies the foreign limitation law, it will have decided that in the circumstances of the particular case treating the claim as barred by that law would cause undue hardship to the claimant or would otherwise conflict with public policy, whether or not the claim would have been time-barred under English law.  If on the other hand the court applies the foreign law, the English limitation law is likewise irrelevant. </p>

As mentioned earlier, the effect of CPA Order 17, which was enacted into Iraqi law by the Coalition Provisional Authority established by the US, the UK and their coalition partners, has at all relevant times been to make it impossible for the claimants to bring proceedings against the MOD in Iraq by conferring immunity from suit in Iraq on British forces (and other MNF personnel).  This has meant that the only jurisdiction in which a claim for compensation for alleged injury can be brought against the MOD is England and Wales.  I have found earlier that it was in practice impossible for an ordinary Iraqi citizen to bring proceedings against the MOD in this jurisdiction claiming damages for personal injury unless they could find an English law firm willing to represent them under a conditional fee agreement.  I also found that the only law firm shown to have been willing to act for Iraqi claimants on this basis at any material time is Leigh Day.  Furthermore, the only way in which in practice potential claimants could find out about and make contact with Leigh Day </p>

I have also found that whether or when a potential claimant heard about Abu Jamal was essentially a matter of luck depending on who they knew or happened to speak to and that it was not through any fault of the present claimants that they did not hear about Abu Jamal or discover how they might, through him, be able to bring a claim for compensation in England sooner than they did. </p>

But there is nothing which prevents a court from taking this factor into account in exercising its discretion under section 7(5)(b) of the Human Rights Act.  It is, in my view, an important consideration that, on my findings, the claimants could not reasonably be expected to have discovered the only means by which they could in practice bring these claims any earlier than they in fact did.  I am satisfied that each of the claimants acted promptly and reasonably as soon as he made that discovery.  In the case of Mr Al-Waheed, there was a delay after he first contacted Abu Jamal (some time in 2011) until his claim was referred to Leigh Day (in January 2013); but that was because Leigh Day were not accepting instructions during this period so that it was in practice impossible for Mr Al-Waheed to bring proceedings until January 2013.  In short, the delay in bringing proceedings was not the result of any fault or lack of diligence on the part of these claimants. </p>

When the plea of evidential prejudice was introduced on 20 May 2016, shortly before the trial, the MOD asserted that it had been “unable to trace any witnesses who were involved with the claimant’s arrest and detention”.  There is no evidence to suggest, however, that the MOD had, at any stage of the proceedings, made any serious attempt to trace any such witnesses or otherwise to investigate Mr Alseran’s allegations. </p>

Although the response did not state exactly when the exercise of trying to identify and contact such individuals was begun, it was apparent that this had been left to the very last moment before the start of the trial in June 2016.

I am quite unable to accept that it was impossible for the MOD to trace any of the several hundred British service personnel who were involved in that operation.  It is apparent from the number and range of witnesses from whom evidence was adduced by the MOD at the second trial that it would have been possible for the MOD to find individuals who served in the Royal Marines.  Indeed, one of the witnesses from whom a statement was obtained for that trial was Lieutenant General Dutton, who was in command of 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, and actually described in his statement how forces under his command approached Basra through Abu Al-Khasib.  As it was, the only witness of fact from whom the MOD adduced evidence in Mr Alseran’s case was the Chief of Staff of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Armoured Brigade, whose area of operation did not include Abu Al-Khasib. </p>

Equally, if through the use of such endeavours the MOD had found and adduced evidence from one or more such witnesses, it would have been possible to make an informed assessment of the extent to which the quality of their evidence was likely to have been diminished by the delay in bringing the proceedings.  As it is, the lack of any adequate effort by the MOD to investigate Mr Alseran’s claim means that the MOD cannot show that it has suffered evidential prejudice.

In his first statement Mr Clough said that he had made contact with approximately 35 individuals in connection with the claims of MRE and KSU.  In his second witness statement he reported that, since making his first statement, he had identified over 70 further individuals as having potentially useful information in relation to the claimants’ allegations and that the Government Legal Department had made contact with at least 38 witnesses. Mr Clough also said that the MOD and Government Legal Department had between them been in contact with approximately 150 individuals in order to obtain witness evidence in these cases.

In support of that case, the MOD adduced evidence from a wide range of witnesses who were involved in different aspects of Operation Telic.  These included witnesses who served in 539 ASRM, which the claimants suggested was likely to have been the unit which captured them; witnesses who were present in Umm Qasr port at the relevant time; witnesses who were involved in boarding vessels south of Umm Qasr; witnesses who were serving on ships which the claimants suggested could have been the large military ship on which they were detained overnight; and witnesses who were able to give evidence about the specifications of warships, boats and equipment used by British forces.  This evidence was extensive and largely uncontested.  I do not consider that, in the areas which it covered, the cogency of this evidence was significantly reduced by the passage of time. </p>

Accordingly, there was no witness who was able to address the claimants’ allegations that they were mistreated by British soldiers when they came ashore at Umm Qasr port on the morning after their capture or MRE’s allegation that he was kicked in the knee by a soldier during his detention at Camp Bucca.  There is no evidence to indicate, however, that the MOD made any attempt to investigate those allegations, which were very much secondary to the claimants’ main complaint about the serious ill-treatment suffered on the big ship.  Moreover, if the claims of MRE and KSU had been issued within a year of the acts complained of instead of some six and a half years after the expiry of the one year period, and the proceedings had then followed the same timeline as the actual proceedings, there would still have been a lapse of almost seven years from when the relevant events occurred before the MOD began its search for witnesses.

This documentary evidence includes: statements from soldiers who took part in the house raid in which Mr Al-Waheed was arrested, made immediately after the raid or during an investigation carried out by the RMP very shortly afterwards; contemporaneous medical records; photographs taken of Mr Al-Waheed on the night of this capture; records of his interrogations including video recordings of two of the interrogation sessions; internal emails sent by British military personnel in which Mr Al-Waheed’s case was discussed; records of meetings of the Divisional Internment Review Committee at which Mr Al-Waheed’s internment was reviewed; and documents evidencing the conditions in which detainees were held at the relevant time, as well as the policies applicable to their detention. </p>

The memories of these witnesses were naturally affected by the passage of time but I think it unlikely that their memories would have been much better if the proceedings had been commenced and the trial had taken place four years earlier – which would still have been over four years after the relevant events.  Studies of memory as well as common experience show that the accuracy and completeness of a person’s recollection of events declines steeply to begin with and then much more gradually.  As in most cases where there is a good documentary record, it seems to me that the contemporaneous documents would always have provided much better evidence of what occurred than testimony based on subsequent recollection. </p>

In the present cases, however, it has not been shown that the MOD has suffered significant evidential prejudice as a result of the claimants’ delay in bringing the proceedings.  In these circumstances it seems to me legitimate to take into account in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to extend time the fact that a refusal to do so would prevent the claimants from obtaining any redress for proven violations of their fundamental human rights not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment and not to be unlawfully and arbitrarily detained. </p>

This is subject, however, to section 14(3)(b) of the Act, which provides that nothing in Part III “authorises questions of procedure in any proceedings to be determined otherwise than in accordance with the law of the forum.”  A distinction is thus drawn between questions of substance governed by the applicable law (in this case the law of Iraq) and questions of procedure, which are governed by the law of the forum (i.e. the law of the jurisdiction in which the claim is being heard – in this case England and Wales).   </p>

Those cases decide that the question whether a particular kind of injury gives rise to liability in tort is a question of substance governed by the applicable law.  On the other hand, the availability and provision of a remedy for a particular kind of injury – for example, the question whether the remedy of damages is available and, if so, the assessment of those damages – is a question of procedure governed by English law as the law of the forum.   </p>

Applying the distinction mentioned above, I held that: (1) it is a question of substance governed by the law of Iraq whether mental distress caused by the defendant’s conduct or motive in the commission of a tort is a type of injury for which the defendant can be held liable; but (2) if it is, assessing any damages payable as compensation for such an injury is a matter of procedure governed by English law: </p>

As Lord Rodger said in <span style="font-style:italic">Ashley v Chief Constable of Sussex Police</span> [2008] AC 962 at para 60: “battery or trespass to the person is actionable without proof that the victim has suffered anything other than the infringement of his right to bodily integrity.”  See also <span style="font-style:italic">Watkins v Secretary of State for Home Department</span> [2006] 2 AC 395, para 68.

After the first hour an additional sum is to be awarded, but that sum should be on a reducing scale so as to keep the damages proportionate with those payable in personal injury cases and because the plaintiff is entitled to have a higher rate of compensation for the initial shock of being arrested.  As a guideline we consider, for example, that a plaintiff who has been wrongly kept in custody for 24 hours should for this alone normally be regarded as entitled to an award of about £3,000.

In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Governor of Brockhill Prison ex parte Evans (No 2) </span>[1999] QB 1043, owing to an incorrect interpretation of the statutory provisions governing the calculation of her release date, the claimant was kept in custody for an additional 59 days when serving a two year sentence of imprisonment for robbery and other offences.  The Court of Appeal increased the amount of damages awarded by the judge for this period of unlawful detention from £2,000 to £5,000, and this decision was upheld by the House of Lords: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Governor of Brockhill Prison ex parte Evans</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">(No 2)</span> [2001] 2 AC 19.  In determining the appropriate amount of damages, the Court of Appeal took account of the fact that, as a result of the period when she was lawfully imprisoned, the claimant “would have already made the necessary adjustments to serving a prison sentence”: see [1999] QB 1043, 1060.

Gilbart J put this claimant’s case at the top of the lowest <span style="font-style:italic">Vento</span> band and awarded £7,200 for injury to feelings, as well as further sums for physical pain and suffering and false imprisonment. </p>

They pointed out that, according to the United Nations Development Programme, Iraq ranks 121<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> out of 188 countries in its Human Development Index and has gross national income <span style="font-style:italic">per capita</span> of US$11,608.

Counsel for the MOD submitted that to award damages for nonpecuniary harm assessed at UK levels would overcompensate the claimants, as a sum of money which is equivalent to, say, a month’s average income in the UK would be equivalent to several times that for an Iraq civilian.  Borrowing words of Lord Bingham MR (albeit used in a different context), they cautioned against awarding these claimants sums of money which in their country would be “so large as to bear no relation to the ordinary values of life”: <span style="font-style:italic">John v MGN Ltd</span> [1997] QB 586, 611.  They invited the court not to award English levels of damages for non-pecuniary injuries but to make a deduction to take account, albeit in a rough and ready way, of the very different economic and social conditions pertaining in Iraq.   </p>

But once it is accepted that the quantum of damages is to be decided in accordance with English law, there is no scope for reducing the amount of any award by reference to the claimant’s economic or social circumstances.  When awarding damages as compensation for pain and suffering, mental distress or other harm of a non-financial nature, English courts do not have regard to whether the claimant is rich or poor, nor to the standard or cost of living in the place where the claimant habitually resides.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="48">

	      </authorialNote>  Damages are not reduced if the claimant lives in a deprived region of the country, nor increased if the claimant lives in London on the ground that living costs there are higher.  Nor if, for example, a foreigner visiting the UK is injured in a road traffic accident and is awarded damages for pain and suffering, are the damages scaled down because the claimant comes from a poor country or bumped up because the claimant comes from a country with a significantly higher gross national income <span style="font-style:italic">per capita</span> than the UK (such a Norway or Monaco).

This was an appeal to the Privy Council from an award of general damages made by a court in Malaya (as it then was) in a personal injury case.

(3) That to the extent to which regard should be had to the range of awards in other cases which are comparable such cases should as a rule be those which have been determined in the same jurisdiction or in a neighbouring locality where similar social, economic and industrial conditions exist.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">This authority, however, does not assist the MOD’s argument.  It says nothing to suggest that, if the claimant had come from a locality where the social and economic conditions were different from those in Malaya, it would have been appropriate to increase or reduce the damages awarded to him for that reason.  The judgment merely recognises that the level of damages awarded by the courts in a particular jurisdiction can be expected to reflect the general economic and social conditions in that jurisdiction.  That is indubitable.  As Lord Woolf MR, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Heil v Rankin</span> [2001] QB 272 noted, the decision as to what is the fair, reasonable and just equivalent in monetary terms of an injury “has to be taken against the background of the society in which the court makes the award” (para 38).  Lord Woolf illustrated this point by referring to decisions of the courts of Hong Kong.  As the prosperity of Hong Kong expanded, the courts by stages increased their tariff for damages so that it approached the level in England: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chan Pui-ki v Leung On</span> [1996] 2 HKLR 401, 406-408.  The Privy Council in the <span style="font-style:italic">Jag Singh</span> case was doing no more than recognising this reality.  Awards made in Singapore as “a neighbouring locality where similar social, economic and industrial conditions exist” were relevant when assessing damages in accordance with the law of Malaya only in the same way that awards made in Scotland or Northern Ireland, for example, could be taken into account by a court assessing damages in accordance with the law of England and Wales.   </p>

There is no basis in principle or authority for reducing the damages awarded on the ground that the claimants in the present cases reside or that their injuries were suffered in another country, namely, Iraq.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Reasoning backwards from this conclusion, what the MOD’s argument in my view supports is the case for assessing damages not in accordance with the law of the forum but in accordance with the law applicable to the tort.  The justification for applying the law of the forum to procedural questions even when a claim is governed by foreign law is that litigants cannot reasonably expect courts to conduct proceedings differently or to make different procedures available just because the parties’ rights are governed by foreign law.  For example, if an English court has to decide a personal injury claim governed by the law of Texas, the English court cannot reasonably be expected to arrange a jury trial just because that is how the case would be decided in Texas.  Considerations of efficiency and convenience dictate that rules of procedure should be applied in all cases irrespective of their subject matter.  By contrast, questions about the existence and extent of the rights and liabilities of the parties ought in principle to be decided by applying the same rules of law irrespective of where the proceedings are brought.  As stated by La Forest J in a decision of the Canadian Supreme Court, the purpose of classifying a rule as procedural or substantive is “to determine which rules will make the machinery of the forum court run smoothly as distinguished from those determinative of the rights of both parties”: <span style="font-style:italic">Tolofson v Jensen</span> [1994] 3 SCR 1022, (1994) 120 DLR (4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>) 289, 321.   </p>

It is also now the approach that applies in the UK.  For claims arising out of events occurring after 11 January 2009 which fall within the ambit of the Rome II Regulation, article 15(c) provides that “the nature and assessment of damage” is a matter for the law applicable to the obligation (and is no longer treated as a matter of procedure governed by the law of the forum).  Had the events giving rise to the present claims, therefore, occurred after 11 January 2009, an English court assessing damages would be required to apply Iraqi law as the law applicable to the tort and would seek to reflect, as accurately as possible with the help of expert evidence, the level of damages that would be awarded by an Iraqi court.  Although no such expert evidence has been adduced, in the light of the social and economic conditions in Iraq it is reasonable to expect that the amount of damages for non-pecuniary harm awarded by an Iraqi court would be lower than the amount that an English court applying English law would award.   </p>

The claims are therefore governed by the 1995 Act.  As discussed above, that Act, as it has been authoritatively interpreted, requires the court to assess damages in accordance with English law.  It follows that, if the claims in tort made in these cases had succeeded, the damages would have to be assessed in just the same way and by applying the same principles as would be applied in a case where liability in tort has arisen under English law.   </p>

If the Court considers that a monetary award is necessary, the Practice Direction states that it will make an assessment “on an equitable basis, having regard to the standards which emerge from its case law”: see para 14. The case law of the European Court shows that awards for mental suffering are by no means confined to cases where there is medical evidence that the applicant has suffered psychological harm and that compensation may be awarded for injury to feelings variously described as distress, anxiety, frustration, feelings of injustice or humiliation, prolonged uncertainty, disruption to life or powerlessness.  The case law also shows that the Court will often be ready to infer from the nature of the violation that such injury to feelings has been suffered.  Applicants who wish to be compensated for non-pecuniary damage are invited by the Court to specify a sum which in their view would be equitable: see Practice Direction, para 15. </p>

This may require account to be taken of moral injury.  As stated by the Grand Chamber in <span style="font-style:italic">Varnava v Turkey</span> [2009] ECHR 1313 at para 224, in some situations “the impact of the violation may be regarded as being of a nature and degree as to have impinged so significantly on the moral well-being of the applicant as to require something further.”  The Court further explained: </p>

Its guiding principle is equity, which above all involves flexibility and an objective consideration of what is just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, including not only the position of the applicant but the overall context in which the breach occurred.  Its non-pecuniary awards serve to give recognition to the fact that moral damage occurred as a result of a breach of a fundamental human right and reflect in the broadest of terms the severity of the damage; they are not, nor should they be, intended to give financial comfort or sympathetic enrichment at the expense of the Contracting Party concerned.” </p>

Any attempt to glean guidance, however, from the size of awards made by the Court in individual cases faces three major difficulties.  The first is that the Court deals with cases from 47 different countries and it is part of its practice normally to take into account “the local economic circumstances”: see Practice Direction, para 2.  Accordingly, as pointed out by Lord Reed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Sturnham</span> case [2013] UKSC 47, [2013] 2 AC 254, para 38, any comparison of awards needs to take into account the relative value of money in the contracting states, as well as the effect of inflation if the award was made some time ago: see also <span style="font-style:italic">D v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</span> [2015] EWHC 2493 (QB), [2015] 1 WLR 1833, paras 33-35.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, with one exception, the European Court has not established or sought to establish in its jurisprudence scales of awards for particular types of case.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="49">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> The one publicly stated exception concerns cases involving excessive delay in proceedings, in breach of article 6, where the court has established “scales on equitable principles for awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 41, in order to arrive at equivalent results in similar cases”: see <span style="font-style:italic">Scordino v Italy (No 1)</span> (2007) 45 EHRR 7, para 176.   </p>
	      </authorialNote>  The Court hardly ever refers to amounts which it has awarded previously in other cases and, when awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the Court generally gives little or no explanation of how it has arrived at a particular figure.  Sometimes it is apparent from the judgment that the amount of the award has been influenced by a particular factor – for example, the Court’s view of the seriousness of the violation or that the applicant was at fault.  In other cases there are no such clues.  Given this approach, any attempt to extrapolate from individual awards necessarily involves a process of reconstruction or rationalisation which involves explaining the levels of awards made in particular cases by reference to features of the case and contrasts with other cases which are not mentioned by the Court.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The third difficulty is more fundamental.  Such a process of reconstruction assumes that there is a latent order or logic underlying awards made by the European Court which has not been articulated but is waiting to be discovered.  But that could only be the case if, in making awards of compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the judges of the Court were basing their decisions on comparisons with awards made in other cases.  Given the Court’s approach, however, of assessing such compensation on an “equitable basis” by reference to such sum as the applicant requests and the Court thinks fair in the individual case, there is no good reason to suppose that this is so.  Indeed, there is good reason to think that it is not.  As Lord Carnwath, who has himself sat as an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> judge of the European Court, explained in the <span style="font-style:italic">Sturnham</span> case at para 105: </p>

First, this type of analysis does not reflect the practice of the European Court itself.  Rather than adhering to the principles applied by the European Court in awarding compensation under article 41, therefore, such an approach is inconsistent with those principles and hence with section 8(4) of the Human Rights Act.  Second, because most of the Court’s awards are not intended to have any precedential effect, extrapolating from them involves an attempt to find a level of coherence and consistency underlying the awards which simply is not there.  The likelihood is that any pattern detected will, like the interpretation of Rorschach blots, lie in the eye of the beholder.   </p>

Rather, awards made by the Court under article 41 should be regarded simply as illustrations of the principles identified earlier and as a cross-check to ensure that the amount of any  damages awarded would not, as best as can be judged, be likely to be perceived by the European Court as inadequate or as excessive. </p>

In a few of the 19 cases discussed the breach of article 3 involved torture or inhuman and degrading treatment of the applicant by police officers or other agents of the state.  In most of the cases, however, the breach of article 3 consisted in a failure by the state to protect the applicant from ill-treatment or in a failure by the state to carry out an effective investigation into allegations of ill-treatment.  The facts of the <span style="font-style:italic">Commissioner of Police</span> case itself fell into a third of these categories.  The judge sought to identify a range of awards for “relevant” article 3 violations.

This was <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Jedda v United Kingdom</span> (2011) 53 EHRR 23, referred to earlier in this judgment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">At first sight this case may seem to be comparable with the present cases in that it involved the unlawful detention of an individual by British forces in Iraq.  The Court stated, however, that in determining the amount of compensation it had regard to factors raised by the UK government (see para 114).  Those factors were that the applicant was detained because he was reasonably believed to pose a grave threat to the security of Iraq, that the English court had held that his detention was in compliance with Iraqi law, and that the allegation that he was engaged in terrorist activities in Iraq was subsequently upheld by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.  I therefore think it clear that the Court reduced the compensation awarded in this case by a substantial (though unspecified) amount on account of the applicant’s conduct (see the eighth principle identified above).  By contrast, in the present cases I have found that the claimants were not detained in compliance with Iraqi law (nor, during the relevant periods, in compliance with international law) and, although there was in each case a reasonable suspicion which justified their initial capture or arrest, none of the claimants was engaged in terrorist activities or posed any threat to the security of Iraq.  In these circumstances, no analogy can be drawn with the <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Jedda</span> case. </p>

The distinction is between “cases where the violation of the Convention right has an outcome for the claimant which constitutes or is akin to a private wrong, such as trespass to the person, and cases where the violation has no such consequence.”  As Laws LJ observed, this distinction was drawn by Lord Bingham in the <span style="font-style:italic">Greenfield</span> case when he contrasted the breach of article 6 which was the subject of that case with violations of articles such as article 3 and article 5: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Greenfield) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2005] UKHL 14, [2005] 1 WLR 673, para 7.  A breach of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 would not give rise to a claim for damages in tort in English law.  In many cases, however, mistreatment which violates article 3 will do so.  Similarly, unlawful detention will in many cases give rise to liability in tort as well as to a breach of article 5.  In such cases the same basic right – to bodily integrity or to liberty – is protected both by the law of tort and by the Human Rights Act.  There is a powerful argument of principle that where, in such cases, a victim is being compensated under section 8 of the Human Rights Act for the defendant’s unlawful act, he or she should receive similar compensation for the harm suffered to that which would be awarded on a parallel claim in tort.  To award less compensation would be to treat the breach of a fundamental human right guaranteed by the Convention as less serious than breach of the equivalent right protected by the common law of tort.  Unless some good reason is shown for taking a different approach, the amount of compensation awarded for the same injury caused by the same wrongful conduct should in principle be the same in each case.  This principle seems to me to carry particular weight in the case of non-pecuniary damage for which any amount awarded in compensation can only be symbolic of the value which our society attributes to harm of the relevant kind.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Taking into account the practice of the European Court in relation to the award of compensation under article 41 does not require an English court to ignore this principle.  That is so, first of all, because it is the practice of the European Court to take into account domestic scales of damages.  The Practice Direction referred to earlier states that, when making an award under article 41, the Court “may decide to take guidance from domestic standards”, though it is “never bound by them” (para 3).  Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Z v United Kingdom</span> (2001) 34 EHRR 97 at paras 120 and 131, the Grand Chamber of the Court described the rates of compensation applied in domestic cases as “relevant” but “not decisive”.  On any view, the English court is entitled to treat as relevant in assessing damages standards or rates of compensation which the European Court would itself regard as relevant.  Secondly, while section 8(4) of the Human Rights Act requires the court to take into account the principles applied by the European Court in determining the amount of an award, it does not require the court to take into account only those principles and to ignore other relevant considerations.  In a case where the unlawful act for which damages may be awarded under section 8 is also a tort, an English court would in my view be failing in its duty if it did not have regard to the level of damages which would be awarded as compensation in tort and ask whether it is necessary to award a similar sum to afford just satisfaction to the claimant or whether there is a good and sufficient reason which makes it just and appropriate to award a different sum. </p>

There are other cases, however, where the claimant is not seeking an essentially public law remedy of this kind and which fall into the category described by Laws LJ as “cases where the violation of the Convention right has an outcome for the claimant which constitutes or is akin to a private wrong” (see paragraph 931 above).  In these cases, where the violation alleged is not continuing but purely historic, the concern is self-evidently not to bring the infringement of the claimant's human rights to an end as the infringement has already ended.  In these cases the only remedy which the court can provide is an award of damages to compensate the claimant for the injury caused by the infringement.  The question of compensation is therefore of primary, if not sole, importance.  To decline to award damages, or to make an award which affords only partial reparation, would be to deny the claimant an effective remedy, contrary to principle and to the UK’s obligation under article 13 of the Convention to afford an effective remedy to everyone whose Convention rights are violated.   </p>

What is required is not the selection of an arbitrary figure but the application of principles which at least enable the reader of the judgment to discern the factors which led the Court to fix the sum awarded.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In seeking to formulate a principled approach, I regard three considerations as paramount.  The first is transparency: the parties and the public are entitled to a reasoned judgment from which it can be seen how the sum awarded in each case has been arrived at.  Second, objectivity: although the assessment of damages inescapably involves an exercise of judgment, justice requires the adoption of an approach which is based on external standards and not simply on the intuition of the individual judge.  The third paramount consideration is predictability, which is of special and vital importance in the present cases.  As noted in part I of this judgment, in addition to these four lead cases there are a further 628 outstanding claims in this litigation.  There is a very strong public interest in facilitating the settlement of these claims.  It would be not merely undesirable but a denial of justice if the parties had to bring each case to court in order to discover what compensation will be awarded for the claimant’s injuries.  To do so is in any event impracticable as the court does not have the resources to hold trials in all these cases and as, on the evidence of the present cases, the costs of a trial would be likely substantially to exceed the sums awarded.  For the purposes of settlement the parties need to be able to predict with a reasonable measure of accuracy the amount which is likely to be awarded in a particular case.   </p>

It represents an accumulated body of wisdom developed through the common law method of building on the past experience of generations of judges who have decided a vast number and range of cases.  Standards forged in this way reflect a collective sense of what level of compensation is fair having regard to the general standard and cost of living in our society.  Just as importantly, they also embody a collective judgment about what level of compensation is fair and appropriate for a particular kind of injury relative to the levels awarded for injuries of other kinds.  There is no “right” amount of compensation for, say, the loss of an eye.  But a system of law that aspires to be rational and coherent seeks to ensure that the damages awarded for such an injury are greater than those awarded for injuries which have a less detrimental impact on the victim’s quality of life and smaller than those awarded for even more drastic injuries.

Balancing these factors, the approach that I have thought it equitable to follow in assessing damages for nonfinancial injury is to award a figure that is around half the amount that would be recoverable on a claim in tort to which English law applied. </p>

Although Mr Alseran alleged that this happened on more than one occasion, I have not found it proved that there was more than one incident of such abuse.

That is because the shock and distress of being captured, taken to a prison camp and interned there are bound to have been much greater than the additional distress suffered as a result of being held at the camp for longer than was permissible under international humanitarian law.  It is also reasonable to regard the moral injury caused by detaining a person for an hour or a day or a week without any legal justification at all as significantly greater than the injury caused by erroneously keeping someone who had been lawfully detained in detention for an equivalent additional period.   </p>

In each of the four lead cases I have found that the claimant was lawfully detained to begin with but was then kept in detention for a further period without any legal basis in breach of article 5 of the European Convention.  Amongst the large number of unresolved claims in this litigation there may well be more cases of this kind.  I think it appropriate in these circumstances to establish a rate of compensation to be awarded in such cases.  Although an attempt could be made to fine tune awards to take account of the circumstances of each individual claimant, I consider it preferable in the interests of certainty and fair in what is in any case an unscientific exercise to treat all claimants equally.  Furthermore, where there was a lawful period of detention of a week or more followed by a period of unlawful detention of under, say, two months, I think it reasonable to apply the same daily rate for each day that the claimant was wrongly detained.

To select a suitable rate, I have relied on the <span style="font-style:italic">Evans</span> case mentioned earlier (see paragraph 890 above) for guidance, making an adjustment upwards for inflation since that case was decided and downwards in accordance with my general approach of discounting the sum that would be awarded on a tort claim governed by English law by around one half.  The rate of compensation that I think it appropriate to apply in cases of this kind is £100 per day.

All that can be said is that his psychiatric injury was a consequence of the whole sequence of traumatic events which Mr Alseran experienced, starting with the shock of being captured by armed soldiers while in bed at home at night and including periods of detention in harsh conditions at Al-Seeba and at Camp Bucca which were lawful.

The expert psychiatrists who examined him also agreed that he probably had a major depressive illness following his release, though that has since abated.  However, although MRE identified the episode in which he was hooded as one of three occasions during his captivity when he felt that he was going to die, it was far from being the only traumatic event that he experienced.  The two other events which on his own account caused him at least as much fear and distress were his capture and violent treatment by the soldiers who boarded his ship at night and the ordeal that he suffered when he was forced to strip naked on the warship where he was held overnight.  It has not been established that British soldiers were responsible for these incidents.  I have also held that the initial and longer part of MRE’s detention at Camp Bucca, which he undoubtedly found very stressful, was lawful.

First, like MRE, KSU was hooded with a sandbag at Umm Qasr dock and during the journey from there to Camp Bucca on 25 March 2003.  I have also accepted his evidence that, after the sandbag was put over his head, he was forced to the ground and made to shuffle forwards on his knees before being shoved and kicked into the back of a Land Rover.  For the suffering, humiliation and distress caused by this breach of article 3, he will be awarded the same compensation as MRE of £10,000.  (In his case no additional physical injury </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I have found that following his arrest in the early hours of 12 February 2007, while he was being transported in a Land Rover to the British military base at Basra Airport, Mr Al-Waheed was repeatedly beaten on the upper back and arms by British soldiers with one or more implements which were probably rifle butts.  He was also punched in the face and sustained a painful injury to the middle finger of his right hand.  The physical injuries caused by this beating fall within the general category described in chapter 13 of the Judicial College Guidelines of “minor injuries”, defined as injuries where there is a complete recovery within three months.  I think it likely that Mr AlWaheed had made a complete recovery within around 28 days which, in terms of duration of symptoms, would put his injuries at the top of bracket (b).  The top of this bracket is £1,090.  Such an award, however, would be appropriate for a single minor injury.  The guideline states that “cases where there is significant pain or multiple injuries albeit full recovery within three months may fall outside this chapter.”  Not only did Mr Al-Waheed receive multiple injuries, but the beating to which he was subjected evidently lasted for a significant period of time (being inflicted over the course of a journey which lasted more than two hours) and must have caused severe pain.  In these circumstances on a claim in tort I would have made an award of £5,000 as damages for the pain and suffering caused by his injuries. </p>

The mental distress which he suffered must also have been exacerbated by the fact that the beating was prolonged as well as by the fact that he could not see his assailants, thus creating anxiety as to when and where the blows would land.  If awarding damages for mental distress in tort, I would have placed this case towards the top of the middle <span style="font-style:italic">Vento</span> band and would also have made an award of aggravated damages (of £5,000) to reflect the malevolent nature of the soldiers’ conduct. </p>

Had I been awarding damages in tort, I would have placed the harm attributable to each violation towards the lower end of the middle <span style="font-style:italic">Vento</span> band.  In making my assessment, I have also used as reference points the sums that I am awarding for other mistreatment in these cases.  On this basis the sum awarded for the injury caused by each of these three violations of article 3 will be £5,000, making a total award under this head of £15,000. </p>

However, I have also held that after the review committee had voted to release him on 22 February 2007 his continued detention for a further 33 days until 28 March 2007 was unlawful and violated article 5 of the Convention.  Applying the same rate of £100 per day as in the other cases, Mr AlWaheed will therefore be awarded damages of £3,300. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">979.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>As with the other claimants, I do not think it possible to attribute Mr Al-Waheed’s psychiatric injuries specifically to the violations of his Convention rights which have been established.  Mr Al-Waheed experienced a series of shocking events, which began when in the middle of the night soldiers burst into the house where he was staying and arrested him at gunpoint.  As mentioned, I have held that his arrest was lawful, as was Mr Al-Waheed’s detention for the following 10 days in the north compound of the Divisional Temporary Detention Facility at Shaibah and his interrogation during that time.  In addition, I think it clear from Mr Al-Waheed’s evidence that factors which contributed very significantly to the post-traumatic stress disorder and depression from which he has suffered were his wife’s miscarriage, the feud with her family after he was released from detention and his subsequent divorce.  It cannot be said that those events flowed from any breach of Mr Al-Waheed’s Convention rights.  The cause of his arrest and the subsequent rift with his wife’s family was the fact that her brother had been engaged in terrorist activities.  In these circumstances I conclude that the necessary clear causal link between the violations found and Mr Al-Waheed’s psychiatric condition has not been shown. </p>

In particular, it has not been established that the lower back pain or other joint pain from which Mr Al-Waheed suffers is a consequence of the beating that he received.  These complaints as well as other physical symptoms may well be linked to his psychiatric condition but I have rejected his claim for damages for that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Al-Waheed made a claim for loss of earnings on the basis that, although he has remained in the same employment with the state electricity company since his detention, he has allegedly been prevented by his mental health problems from achieving the promotions and level of earnings that would reasonably have been expected.  This claim also fails because of my conclusion that Mr Al-Waheed has not established the necessary clear causal link between the proven violations of his Convention rights and his psychiatric condition.  In any event, the evidence of Mr AlWaheed’s earnings indicates that they have been increasing since 2007 and that he has been the highest paid employee in his department.  I consider the evidence insufficient to show that he has not been promoted or that he has suffered any identifiable loss of income as a result of his psychiatric or other medical conditions. </p>

As I explained at the start, there are more than 600 outstanding claims.  Although there is no assumption that the four cases which are the subject of this judgment are representative of the rest, some of the central conclusions reached – on issues such as whether it was lawful to detain the claimants, whether the conditions in which they were held and certain practices to which they were subjected amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment, whether their claims are time-barred and how any damages should be assessed – are likely to affect many other cases in the litigation.  It is therefore not unreasonable to hope that the resolution of these issues will enable the parties to make a realistic assessment of the likely outcome of most of the remaining claims. </p>
