	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the circumstances set out below, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) seek to recover contribution, under the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 1978, or indemnity, in contract, in respect of some of the liability which they inherited by statutory subrogation from the former British Coal Corporation (British Coal).  From the late 1950’s/early 1960’s, British Coal (National Coal Board, as it was then constituted) started to employ contractors to execute work connected with major developments in their underground mines.  Over the period up to 1994, between five and six thousand men may have been so employed at any one time.  The main purpose of such work was to enable new production faces to be opened up, an essential feature of any systematic mining of coal.  The nature of the work was essentially tunnelling, which is an everyday part of civil engineering construction.  In addition to underground work executed in existing mines, shaft sinking and the opening up of new mines were also included in the work which was contracted out.  The practice of using contractors in this way was spread across coalfields, although some areas were more reluctant than others to make use of their services.  The decision whether or not to employ contractors for any particular project was determined by policy which emanated from the Mining and Projects Department of British Coal.  The terms of contractors’ employment were then determined by the Purchasing and Supplies Department as supplemented by instructions issued by Area organisations into instructions issued by colliery managers.  As Dr Jones, who became the last Head of Mining for the former British Coal, was to say:</p>

In the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths and Others </span>v <span style="text-decoration:underline">British Coal Corporation</span>, judgment in which (“the original judgment” <span style="font-weight:bold">[bundle P]</span>) was delivered on 27 January 1998, British Coal was found liable to compensate a selection of miners and former miners in respect of damage caused to their respiratory systems following work underground in the course of their employment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since judgment was delivered as above, the numbers of claimants have swelled dramatically, such that claims numbering in excess of 550,000 have been made.  In financial terms, this has led to a potential liability amounting to something in excess of £3.5 billions.  In these proceedings, the DTI seek to recover contribution and or alternatively indemnity from the independent contractors in respect of the compensation which they have paid to men who at some stage in their lives worked for contractors and also for British Coal.  The broad grounds asserted are that the Contractors were in a number of particular respects also at fault, so far as those men were concerned, and that such fault contributed, at the least, to some of the injury of which complaint is made.  It is implicit in the nature of these proceedings that British Coal was itself, as the DTI accepts, concurrently in breach of its duty of care to those same workmen.  British Coal does not, nor could they, seek to challenge in these proceedings any of the relevant findings in the original judgment.  The basis of this necessary precondition to the DTI’s right to proceed against the contractors is to be found fully set out in that judgment.  Throughout the proceedings and this judgment, the Contractors are referred to as the Third Party – modern nomenclature (part 20 defendant) does not readily lend itself to a clear understanding of the true characteristic of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">conventional</span> third party.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the original judgment, and realising the possible extent of the claims which would be forthcoming, the DTI entered into a scheme with the Claimants’ solicitors, the intention being to enable the vast majority of those claims to be disposed of administratively, and without further reference to the Court, save for the purposes of review of the operation of that scheme.  This scheme, the Claims Handling Agreement (CHA)), was subsequently approved as a reasonable basis for settlement of the claims by the Court in its role as manager of the Group Litigation, of which the original claims and the present claims were and are both a part.  The Agreement was the product of much careful, detailed and technical negotiation by the original parties to the litigation and their legal and professional advisers including, as will be seen, a team of medical advisers.  As has appeared in practice, some parts of the scheme have been found not to be meeting the intentions of the parties as they would have wished, the consequence has been that it has been amended from time to time to reflect those needs, and has been further approved by the Court.  In all essential respects, however, the scheme has met, and is still meeting its objectives, although from the point of view of many claimants it has appeared that the active participants, namely the DTI and the Claimants’ solicitors, have introduced unnecessary delays in the process.  This is a separate issue, which is one of those reviewed by the Court on a regular basis and need be of no more concern in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim by the DTI is that the Contractors were as much in breach of the relevant duty of care towards their workmen, also in many of the same respects, as British Coal had been found to be towards its workmen in the proceedings which led to the original judgment and thus it makes its claims. These are founded both in contract and also for contribution under the provisions of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.  The claim in contract is also founded on two bases.  First, there are alleged breaches of the express terms of the specifications within the contracts under which the contractors performed their works. Secondly, the Defendants, rely on express indemnity clauses to be found in the relevant general conditions of contract as they were from time to time.  The Contractors’ answers to these claims have been to deny they were in breach of contract and that, if they were at fault at all, it was of so limited and infrequent occurrence that it is not a case where it would be just or equitable that they should be ordered to make either contribution or afford indemnity.  The Contractors also contend that, in acting as they did, they did no less than the contracts, when properly construed, required of them.  Insofar as the claim for indemnity is concerned, it is they the Contractors, not the Defendants, who are entitled to claim indemnity by relying upon the indemnity clauses in their favour contained in those same conditions of contract.  The Contractors also raise other arguments of substance.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular, the Contractors rely on the existence of the detailed and elaborate statutory scheme which was at all material times embodied in the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 and subordinate legislation which makes meticulous and detailed provision for management of coal mines, as well as every aspect of safety of any individual who goes underground for the purposes of his work.  It was within such a regime that the Contractors were required to operate.  Apart from this, the Contractors were under contractual obligations to British Coal which were largely uniform, albeit the specifications of individual contracts would of necessity differ as to detail according to the work which was the subject of the contract.  It was said that the terms of the contracts left little, if any, scope to the Contractors to perform their work in any other way than British Coal determined, that was “the British Coal way”.  It was accepted by the Third Party that they were, nevertheless, not relieved from having to comply with their common law obligations towards their workmen.  It was further accepted that, despite these statutory and contractual provisions and restraints, the common law duties of the employer were ‘non-delegable’.  </p>

The grounds upon which reliance was placed for this position were that, in certain limited respects, the CHA did not reflect the principles of common law governing the assessment of damages.  This consequence flows, it was argued, from various of its provisions which enable some claimants to be excessively compensated while, in other respects, there is scope for double recovery by claimants who have claims both in these proceedings in respect of COPD and in the other major occupational health claims brought against the former British Coal relating to vibration white finger (VWF) and, possibly, deafness.  In addition, in other particular respects, the awards of damages to individual claimants are excessive, and therefore unreasonable, because the respiratory specialist (RS) who performed the medical assessment (MAP) on those men, has either misunderstood or misapplied the criteria written into the CHA or has failed to take properly into account, evidence in the individual case, or information which was contained in his medical records or revealed by the tests which were performed for the purposes of the assessment.  </p>

All Lead Claimants also worked for a substantial part of their working lives for British Coal and have already been compensated under the provisions of the CHA.

The historical scope of these proceedings falls within this timescale.

One of the questions to arise in these proceedings will be the extent to which the statutory obligations, to which the Defendants were subject could also be applied to the Contractors, while working in British Coal mines.  </p>

It is the Third Party’s case that in certain identified respects, the CHA results in over-generous compensation to claimants and that, as the result of lack of clarity of instructions issued to RSs and the claims assessors non-respiratory co-morbid conditions which could impact on overall disability were ignored.  As well as this generic challenge, it is also disputed that RSs properly assessed the disability of each lead claimant with the result that there have been “overpayments” as compared with compensation which should have been payable at common law and which should not, therefore, have occurred.</p>

The introduction to the CHA is instructive in this respect.  Thus:</p>

In summary, the procedure set out in the CHA provided broadly for two methods of pursuing claims according to whether a claimant had provided a medical report on joining the scheme, or he had not.  Thereafter, if IRISC was able to make an offer on the basis of the information contained within the report, subject to being satisfied in respect of the employment record among other matters, it would do so.  If not so satisfied, then the claimant would have to proceed to the MAP.  In such a case the Claimant has then to complete a Claims Questionnaire(CQ) and submit to examination by a specially appointed Respiratory Specialist (RS) who would be required to follow the procedure contained within Schedule 7 to the CHA.  The procedure is detailed, as will appear from relevant the sections which are reproduced later in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Guidance Notes to the RSs contained within the CHA also provide that the assessments are to be based on the test of “balance of probability” both as to the presence of one of the relevant conditions and as to the presence, or otherwise, of disability and co-morbid conditions “and the contribution they may or may not make to overall disability”.  At a later stage of this judgment, it becomes necessary to examine, in some detail, the contents of the Medical Assessment Process (MAP) forms in respect of all the Lead Claimants, whose claims have been settled by IRISC.  All these assessments are now challenged as to their validity by the Third Party.  Validity, that is, both in terms of the findings as to relevant disability, but also as to the percentage factor by which the appropriate level of compensation, which is determined by the assessment of disability, is to be allocated.  There are two scales which are of importance: <span style="font-style:italic">Impairment of Lung Function</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Disability Rating Scale</span>.  The first is the <span style="text-decoration:underline">classification</span> of impairment of lung function, whatever its cause, into mild, moderate and severe.  The measure here is as follows:</p>

This enables IRISC to make an ‘expedited offer’ based either on chronic bronchitis (CB) alone or COPD on the basis of a tariff of general damages set out in the agreement.  This tariff provides a range of awards from £1,750, where the claimant has between 5 and 9 years’ underground work and his FEV<span style="font-size:8pt">1</span> is 90 per cent or less of predicted, to £2,050 when employment exceeds 10 years.  The tariff is graduated so that with an FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:11pt">1</span> of only 20 per cent of predicted with more than five, but less than 10 years work, underground, the award will be £8,250 but, where the employment exceeds 10 years, the figure will be £14,500.  In none of these cases will an offer which is made, and accepted, carry with it any entitlement to special damages.

In deceased claims, further examination of medical documents relating to those deceased was also performed.  The consequences of these re-examinations were to be that there were challenges to every assessment which had been made by the RSs who had taken part in the MAP of the claims in respect of all eight Lead Claimants.  The Defendants led evidence from the RS who examined and reported by way of the MAP form on each such Claimant.  Dr Stenton was also called to give oral evidence on behalf of the Third Party.  There was extensive examination of the workings of the CHA and the steps taken to amend it, to audit its operation, both generally and also with respect to the individual RSs.  The evidence in respect of the individual Claimants and the estates’ claims will be examined in the section of the judgment entitled <span style="font-weight:bold">Medical disputes</span> (Chapter 8).</p>

The provisions contained in this schedule are comprehensive, detailed and complex.  Fortunately, they need not detain us, since no issue arises in connection with them in these proceedings. The Third Party raised no issue in respect of the amounts contained in these tariffs It will be remembered, however, that in the original judgment, there was much discussion about how the apportionment of damages should be achieved.  The need for this arose out of the diversity of factors such as the numbers of years underground, the impact of limitation in respect of employment before 6 June 1954, respirators, smoking and job factors (by which an attempt was made to reflect the fact that different categories of underground employments in different coalfields would have undergone varying exposures to harmful (tortious) dust).  It is implicit from this last variable that illness resulting from exposure to respirable dust, which was at or below the irreducible minimum, would not, therefore, yield any entitlement to compensation.</p>

The figures contained in the table are in turn derived from the PXR data which were obtained by the Defendants for those same areas and periods as part of their long running research programme into the causes of lung diseases in miners.  Thus, a percentage figure is arrived at which is then applied to the provisional award in order to arrive at the final award.  Provision is also made in respect of the different jobs (job factors) which a claimant may have performed when underground since these will have affected his cumulative exposure.  The PXR data are <span style="text-decoration:underline">averages</span> for all men, surface as well as underground.  This data took no account of the different exposures to which the men will actually have been exposed by reason of their jobs.  The inevitable result of this process of averaging is that some men will be compensated where no relevant injury was caused.  Others will have been under-compensated because their exposure was greater than the norm.  Yet others will be over-compensated because their actual exposure was less than the norm.  In order to reach a figure which would be fair to a claimant, this is then converted into factors as follows:</p>

That a scheme was in the end formulated, it had taken some 18 months or so from the date when the original judgment had been given, is testament to the endeavours of all those involved to reach a just settlement.  As a matter of history, the scheme was put before me and approved on 24 September 1999.  At a later stage the scheme was again subjected to judicial scrutiny in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tasker</span> v <span style="text-decoration:underline">British Coal,</span> a case in which the Court's approval had been sought in the case of a miner who was under disability.

That in most respects, the statement was not controversial, makes it unnecessary to refer to it in substantial detail.  Important factors to be taken into account, however, were the numbers of claims which were anticipated would be made under the scheme, although in the event these were substantially under-estimated by a factor greater than five.   There was then the recognition that, in order to process the quantity of claims expected, there would have to be a recruitment of large numbers of qualified RSs who, alone, would by virtue of their experience be able to conduct the MAP in a manner which would be fair to all parties.  The process could not permit each party to appoint their own specialist; there were or are not enough RSs with the appropriate qualifications for that to have been done.  The RS concerned is required to conduct his examination and report with the concept of fairness to both parties uppermost in his mind.  The nature of the examination and report were that they were to be made in the context of a claimant suffering from a long term disease process with the requirement that both a retrospective, as well as a prospective, estimate of its likely progression should be made.  The nature of the effect of COPD, that is breathlessness, is one which can be caused or contributed to by other medical conditions which have to be isolated and separately apportioned as to their assumed effect.  This is a crucial element in framing the opinion and report of the RS.  There are further issues such as handicap on the labour market and the need for care and assistance which the RS may have to consider since his decision may trigger awards which are schemed in the CHA in respect of one or more of these heads of claim.  Finally, there are the reciprocal concepts of loss of expectation of life in the live Claimant and the shortening of life in the case of a deceased miner both features having to be assessed in the appropriate case.  An additional factor, which had to find its way into the agreement, was the need to ensure consistency of approach as between one specialist and another.  </p>

So it is that the CHA made provision that at specific levels of disability the Claimant will be entitled to claim compensation for a change in jobs, the provision and use of care services or incur expenses or as the case might be. This provides another example where the schemed nature of these awards may work for, or against, an individual claimant in so far that his award of compensation may be the same as, more than or less that a comparable common law award of damages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another area of concern (challenge) arose out of the changes made to the Guidance Notes to RSs in respect of the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.  These changes had been made in the light of experience in the operation of the CHA and demonstrate its dynamic quality.  It will be recalled that as the form had originally been devised, unless there were special circumstances, the RS was expected to look for corroboration of chronic bronchitis in the Claimant’s medical records.  There was also a section in the MAP form, which the specialist was expected to complete, to confirm that corroboration did exist.  In practice, this requirement had been found to work injustice against those men who were of firmer character than some, who accepted cough and the production of sputum as facts of underground mining life and did not attend their general practitioner presenting with these as complaints frequently, or at all.  So the requirement was dropped from later editions of the form and in the instructions to RSs.  This led to anxieties on the part of the DTI that chronic bronchitis was being over-diagnosed and by the Third Party that the claim for contribution against them was unreasonably inflated to the like extent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to these points, when consideration came to be given to the MAP forms on the individual Lead Claimants, it was the case for the Third Party, supported by evidence from Dr Stenton, that there were examples of erroneous diagnosis or assessment in each and every one of the cases, such as to demonstrate that the process was flawed both as devised and in its operation.  This last aspect will be considered when the individual cases are discussed below.  It is, however, necessary to consider whether, if the challenges are found to have been well made, they would afford any ground for reducing the extent of the Defendants’ claim for contribution.  The reason for the existence of this apparent anomaly would lie in the fact that it is not the reasonableness of the individual settlement that matters, but whether the scheme which is represented by the CHA does represent a reasonable attempt, when viewed as a whole, to provide a settlement of the liability of the DTI to the cohort of claimants in the BCRDL.  One consequence which would flow, if the Third Party is held liable to make contribution, and also entitled to make individual challenges to assessments, would be that in all cases it the Third Party would be able to reopen the assessment process and delay the attempt by the DTI to enforce the Third Party’s potential and consequent liability.  How far that should be a consideration must await discussion and decision later in this judgment.</p>

Alternatively, the question may be whether or not the Defendants can be permitted to rely on the assessment of claims under the CHA for the purposes of recovery of damages for breach of contract or indemnity, if statutory contribution is not a remedy available to the Defendants.

In this litigation, the nature and effect of the CHA is of fundamental importance.  It has provided the basis of compensation to many thousands of miners or ex-miners and will continue to do so, until all cases within the scheme have been disposed of.  It is also the basis, in the sense of quantification in money terms, of the current claims for compensation for disability caused by the fault of one or other of the parties.  The stance adopted by the Third Party has throughout been an ambiguous one, which would have fallen foul of the expression that “you cannot both approbate and reprobate”.  The uncertainty revealed by the above quotation from leading counsel’s submissions was embarrassing to the Court as well as to the Defendants.  The purpose of this section of the judgment is to examine the question whether the Third Party is to be held to be bound by the terms of the agreement and what the consequences of such a decision would be. It will not have escaped attention that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">overall</span> reasonableness of the CHA was not put in issue. Nor yet was it put in issue that it was reasonable of the original plaintiffs (claimants) to have entered into some scheme for the non-forensic assessment of the compensation to which they were held to be entitled by the original judgment.

In the re-amended document, the Third Party attempted to set out its stall in relation to the question of the reasonableness of the CHA.  The original pleading had merely “not admitted” that the CHA provided for a reasonable settlement for the purposes of the Defendants’ claim for contribution under the Act of 1978 and thus provided no clue what was its real position in regard to it.

In summary, these complaints amounted to criticism of the way in which respiratory specialists had been instructed to carry out the MAP examination in the Notes for Guidance or they had recorded their findings after their examination.  One way of interpreting this submission is that is not the Third Party’s case, in law, they could not be bound by the CHA because they had not been parties to it.  Implicitly, it seems to have been recognised that if the scheme of the CHA had met the criterion of reasonableness, as they would see it, they would have been (query: content to have been) bound by it, whether or not they would have wanted that solution.  Specifically, it was said that, a diagnosis that an individual miner was suffering from chronic bronchitis ought not to have been made in the absence of contemporaneous corroboration in the medical records (as the original Notes for Guidance had required), alternatively there ought not to have been any uncritical acceptance of the statement by a claimant that that was what he suffered from symptoms which would justify the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.  Furthermore, it would have been quite unacceptable for any respiratory specialist to have proceeded to his diagnosis “by giving the benefit of the doubt” to the claimant.  It should be noted that it has never been part of the scheme either in theory or in practice that a claim should be determined on such a basis.  In two instances (see below, Chapter 8) the Third Party made such a suggestion. </p>

As to non cardio-respiratory conditions which were disabling, but which did not impact on a claimant’s overall respiratory disability, it was contended that account was not taken in the MAP of the existence of such a condition when it impacted on overall, as opposed to respiratory, disability.   The consequence of this was that under the provisions of the CHA, there was over-compensation for any financial losses which were attributable to such a condition.  It will be recalled that the Notes for Guidance also covered this point.  Furthermore, if the RS raised no comment in regard to such a matter, the evidence was that it was a matter which should have been noted by the assessor at IRISC.</p>

His case simply was that there were challenges, in four only out of the eight lead cases, in which his contention was no more than that the diagnoses in those four had not been properly made in accordance with the Guidance Notes in the CHA.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will assist in gaining an understanding of the problem, and its solution, if it is explained more particularly why it was decided to approach the disposal of individual claims in the way in which it was provided in the CHA.  In the light of the massive numbers of claims which had already been made and which were anticipated, there was an overriding necessity to reduce the amount of <span style="text-decoration:underline">litigation</span> which would otherwise have been generated.  Secondly there was a need to have regard to resource implications (provision of judges, courts, legal teams), not just in terms of the administration of any scheme which would have been necessary to dispose of the claims, but also to have regard to the availability of RSs in the mining areas in which claimants lived. Since many claimants were quite seriously ill, they would have to be examined by RSs who needed to be able to access the examination facilities which are located, reasonably conveniently to the claimants, in or near the traditional mining areas.  It should be noted that domiciliary visits are also provided for those claimants who are too ill to travel.  These problems obviously do not arise with the deceased claims, since they could be assessed, as they have been, by RSs from parts of the country remote from the mining areas.   As a matter of certainty, based in part on the experience of the Court in reviewing progress of settlement of claims under the CHA, it would not have been remotely practicable to have preserved the common law situation in which each party would instruct its own expert.  Similarly, the fact that there are centralised facilities both for documenting employment histories and obtaining medical records favour a centralised method for assessing compensation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Any attempt to dispose of such a volume of cases through conventional common law procedures would also have introduced the inevitability of delay in ensuring that compensation reached the neediest first and that, thereafter, there was a reasonable basis for prioritisation of claims, including the ability to make interim payments in situations where, at common law, such would either not have been possible or would have been unworkable.  A further great advantage of the scheme provided by the CHA was the ability of the parties to devise a computer based system (as to which see later) for analysing and systematising the various elements in the claims for the complicated process of making assessments of compensation which could be operated by lay assessors.  The assessors, employed by IRISC had received a training which would enable them, in a reasonably expeditious manner, to collate the essential medical details after they had become available through the MAP.  Undoubtedly also, and importantly, the fact that compensation under different heads was schemed within the CHA enables a degree of demonstrable consistency in the individual awards to be achieved.  Fairness as between miner and miner is manifest by reference only to the provisions in this respect that are contained in the agreement.  However, in respects which become clear, when discussion takes place in regard to the awards made to the Lead Claimants in this litigation, the Third Party argue for the scheme compensation to be compared with common law standards for awards of damages on an individualised basis, and to be judged accordingly.  The argument proceeded along the lines that provided, in any given case, the award did not exceed what would have been awarded at common law, that award could form the basis of a claim for contribution.  If, however the award, as calculated under the scheme exceeded the common law figure, then the Defendants were limited to the common law amount in terms of their recovery of contribution.  No allowance could be made for the fact that in some cases under the scheme, awards might be reduced as compared with common law while in others they might exceed such amounts. </p>

It was quite simply irrelevant.  This submission lies uneasily with the qualified respect (see paragraph 65, above) which was accorded to the CHA as a concept for handling all the claims which have arisen.  The Third Party submitted that what was missing from the Defendants’ formulation was any reference to the concept of the objective reasonableness of the settlement under scrutiny and recognition of the necessity that the sum recovered would have been no more than that which could have been recovered if the action had proceeded as one at common law.  The Defendant's approach, it was said, ignored that completely.  Inconsistently with their main submission, as I think, the Third Party expressly did not dispute that it would have been reasonable to have employed <span style="text-decoration:underline">a</span> (different form of) CHA as the basis of settlement of group litigation, provided always the damages would have been the same as those which would have been awarded at common law.  What this argument fails to recognise is that short of an action at common law, it is wholly impracticable for compensation awarded under a scheme to replicate in all its essentials what would have been the amount of compensation if a common law action had been brought.  Unless, therefore, the result of the application of the scheme was always to reduce the claim below common law damages, it would always fail for lack of reasonableness.</p>

Albeit because of the schemed features in the agreement, there are differences which are bound to affect the amount of recovery in the individual cases.  What such a scheme may do, as this one does, is to provide a reasonably expeditious means of disposing of claims economically, consistently and fairly, without any disproportionate expenditure in costs.  The costs, which are recoverable from the DTI, are fixed by the agreement.  Provision is also made so that, ordinarily, no additional costs may properly be recovered from any claimant.  As already noted, there will be some cases, where the amount of compensation awarded will be in excess of the sums recoverable at common law, but this is far from being inevitably the case.  Examples of both features will appear in various guises during the course of this judgment.  </p>

Such a power is inherent in its constitutional function as a court of justice.  Every civilised system of government requires that the state should make available for its citizens a means for the just and peaceful settlement of disputes between them as to their respective legal rights.  The means provided are courts of justice to which every citizen has a constitutional right of access in the role of plaintiff to obtain the remedy to which he claims to be entitled in consequence of the alleged breach of his legal or equitable rights by some other citizen the defendant.  Whether or not to avail himself of this right of access to the court lies exclusively within the plaintiff’s choice; if he chooses to do so, the defendant has no option in the matter; his subjection to the jurisdiction of the court is compulsory. So, it would stultify the constitutional role of the High Court as a court of justice if it were not armed to prevent its process being misused in such a way as to diminish its capability of arriving at a just decision of the dispute.</p>

The overwhelmingly distinctive feature of the current litigation is the uniquely large volume of claims which have to be attenuated by means of a settlement process either by the Court or by way of an administrative scheme.  It is this feature which was the driving force behind the creation of the CHA.  It is also this feature which required the Court, in the exercise of its inherent power to manage this group litigation, to give its approval to the CHA, so that other business in the Courts would not be incommoded by the existence of the large number of claims which needed, and still need, whether by means of adjudication or mediation, disposal under the auspices of the CHA.  There was, and is, a wide public interest in the removal of this mass of litigation from the public to the private arena.  What must be of concern to the Court at this stage is, that if the Third Party is found to be under any liability in these proceedings, how the resulting issues in regard to awards in individual cases are to be resolved between the present parties.  An equally pressing consideration is that if it be held that “settlement” for the purposes of statutory contribution can only mean settlement in an individual case, the Third Party will have the right as between themselves and the Defendants to challenge the validity of many tens of thousands of awards which have already been made and those which are still awaiting.  The Defendants might be inhibited from settling any outstanding claims where there is contractor involvement because of the difficulty of establishing their right to claim contribution in an amount which will match, or be reasonably consistent with, the amount which would have been determined under the CHA.  If the Third Party are not to be bound into the settlement process as represented by the CHA, there would, for example, be no practical alternative mechanism available to compel the further attendance of any claimant to re-attend for examination the purposes of some new or modified form of MAP.  Unless such was done, the exercise of assessment might have to be conducted, in a less than satisfactory way, as a paper exercise.  Even were that to be adopted as a method of proceeding towards settlement, the obvious imperfections and injustice to the Defendants would be apparent.  The Defendants would be bound by the MAP and IRISC assessment, there would be no means of making a medical assessment so far as the Third Party was concerned, the consequence could be seen to be completely unfair to, as well as probably unsatisfactory for, both parties.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, it may be said that the Defendants should have seen this problem before it has reached its present acute form.  On the other hand, until the third Party had become involved in these proceedings, they had no standing to make any representations in regard to the method or content of the CHA.  It is interesting to note that at the hearing, 28 July 1999, at which the Court gave its approval to the CHA the Third Party were present and named as a Defendant in the proceedings which had been brought by means of an application.  However, so far as the Court is aware, the Third Party was never invited to make any contribution to any of the terms of the CHA nor did it at any stage apply for a review of the agreement on the grounds that it was inappropriate or unfair in any respect.   Indeed, given the Third Party’s historical open reluctance to “sign up to” the CHA, this is why the parties are where they now are.  In my judgment, there is a need for early finality to the scope for numberless disputes about individual awards to individual claimants, which arguably may necessitate the Court, in the exercise of its inherent powers, to impose a pragmatic solution on the parties if it should find that (1) the Third Party is liable at all and (2) the CHA is found to be deficient in any of the respects contended by the Third Party so that a degree of fairness is imparted to the proceedings, tempered by the need to advance the litigation.</p>

That question is the weight, if any, which should be given to the fact, that for reasons which seemed good to the Claimants’ representatives and the Defendants, they entered into the CHA as a means of evaluating and disposing economically the claims to which, once a qualifying medical condition had been diagnosed, there was no answer in law.  Consistent with the duty of the Court to deal with cases brought before it in ways which are just and proportionate (see part 1.1 CPR as above), it should do what it can to encourage parties only to litigate what cannot be reasonably disposed of by other means, whether those be by way of arbitration, mediation, administrative scheme or howsoever.  </p>

This was a contract case in which one party had settled its case against another contracting party which was the sub-purchaser and then sought to recover its losses from its suppliers.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">I think, though (the settlement) is not conclusive, that the fact that it is admittedly an upper limit would lead to the conclusion that, if reasonable, it should be taken as the measure.  The result of the judge’s conclusion is that the plaintiffs must prove their damages strictly … and if that involves … a very complicated and expensive inquiry, still that has to be done.  The law, in my opinion, encourages reasonable settlements, particularly where, as here, strict proof would be a very expensive matter.  The question, in my opinion is: what evidence is necessary to establish reasonableness?  I think it is relevant to prove that the settlement was made under advice legally taken. … .  The plaintiff must, I think, lead evidence, which can be cross-examined to, as to facts which the witnesses themselves prove and as to what would probably be proved if, as here, the arbitration had proceeded, so that the court can come to the conclusion whether or not the sum paid was reasonable.  … .  (The defendant) might in some cases show that some vital matter had been overlooked. …   if there is evidence at the end of the matter of the kind which I have indicated, on which the court can come to a conclusion that this was a reasonable settlement in the circumstances, then I think that it should be the measure.  Parties, as Bowen LJ said, have been held to contemplate litigation in the sort of circumstances which have arisen here.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">Before the court can award a sum as damages, there must be evidence on which it can act.  Therefore, in a case such as this, the plaintiffs must call evidence to establish their case.  |If the evidence which they call satisfies the judge … that the settlement was a reasonable one, the damages awarded will be the amount of the settlement and the costs reasonably incurred.  … the duty of the judges at the trial is to determine the damages, and the facts proved before him might be quite different from those known. at the time of the advice to settle for so much.  The trial judge must make up his own mind on the facts he finds proved before him. … .  It is a matter for consideration that the settlement was arrived at under advice, the more so as the party settling may be quite uncertain whether he can recover anything against someone else.  If, upon the evidence, the judge is satisfied that the damages would be somewhere around the figure at which the plaintiffs have settled, he would be justified in awarding the settlement figure. …  The position is much the same, though perhaps not quite so strong, as in a case in which damages have been assessed in a suit between other parties involving the same facts.  The judgment is not binding, but the court will not lightly disregard it in the absence of fresh evidence or new factors.  [p326]  The question is not whether the plaintiffs acted reasonably in settling the claim, but whether the settlement is a reasonable one; and, in considering it, the court is entitled to bear in mind the fact that costs would grow everyday the litigation continued.  That is one reason for saying there is sufficient for the purposes of the plaintiffs if they satisfy the judge that somewhere around the figure of settlement would have been awarded as damages.</p>

Nevertheless, for reasons which have been set out at length, above, I have been satisfied that the awards of compensation made under the provisions of the CHA are “somewhere around” the figure which would have been awarded as damages as if the case had proceeded at common law.</p>

In my judgment, there are a number of cogent reasons why the Third Party, which as noted above, was not a party to the drafting of, let alone a signatory to the CHA, should, nevertheless, be held to be so bound.  This occupational health litigation, by which I include the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span> case, is unparalleled in its complexity and scale.  The numbers affected by the original judgment exceed by a large margin numbers involved in any previous group action.  My decision is that it is within the power of the Court to impose a method of settlement (in a non statutory sense) which reduces to proportions which are manageable, both by the Court and the parties, the task of assessing the compensation to which the claimants have been held to be entitled, subject only to proof of the existence of a relevant physical condition, qualifying employment and, otherwise, as to amount.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The CHA is, however, not merely a private agreement between parties to litigation.  It has received the approval of the Court through the exercise of the procedural powers available to it as manager of group litigation.  It should, however, be recognised that it would always have been open, to any properly interested party, such as the Third Party, to invite the Court to revisit the agreement in order to ensure that in the light of experience or for other demonstrable reasons, it achieved its stated aims; see preamble quoted earlier in this Chapter.  Moreover, the evidence has satisfied me that in the respects identified by the Defendants in submission, and identified elsewhere in this judgment, the sums awarded may in some instances have resulted in under-compensation being awarded as compared with awards which would have been assessed under common law principles.  An obvious case would be one where an expedited award has been made without any corresponding right to claim special damages.  There will also be cases where the schemed claims for additional assistance or household expenses will be less, because of their schemed nature, than they would otherwise have been.  Equally, in some cases, the award may exceed such a basis of assessment but this does not have to be fatal.  In other words, the settlements are both individually and collectively “somewhere around the figure at which” the Court might have arrived had it proceeded along strict common law lines; that would meet the test of a reasonable settlement; see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Biggin’s</span> case, above.  As some settlements will exceed and some be reduced from those which would have been awarded at common law, there is no reason to suppose that, if a final accounting were done, it would be found to be significantly different from the exact or true figure reached if each case had been separately litigated.  It is certain that the expenditure of time, energy and costs by multi-disciplinary professionals will be but a tiny fraction of what they would otherwise have been.</p>

That loophole enabled a third party, against whom a claim for contribution was made, to assert that in a case where the defendant made a settlement with the original claimant, when he had not in fact been under any liability, to avoid any liability to contribute.

It will also become clear that the Defendants were liable in respect of the same damage as that for which the Third Party still stand to be found liable.  If so found, they will they also be liable in respect of any claims which have been instituted by the date upon which the CHA ceased to have effect (31 March 2004).</span>

There was an extended debate on this question during final submissions.  By the end of those submissions, it was far from clear to me what separated the parties on this question. It should be assumed, for present purposes, that for work which was performed in headings by the Third Party they will have been guilty of some fault.  This can be expressed, in general terms, as failure to use best practice in relation to dust suppression techniques, and also fault on the part of the Defendants, through the failure of their deputy to comply with his duties under Regulation 9 of the Managers and Officials Regulations and the duties described and assigned to him, outlined in the Deputies’ Handbook; <span style="font-weight:bold">V1/3</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What may be surprising is that, as late as 1992, British Coal was still referring to its booklet F4040 which had been produced in anticipation of the introduction of interim standards and the gravimetric sampler so long ago as 1969.  Moreover, the fact that specifications referred to “approved levels” and “permitted amounts” produced an unhappy echo of the gravely erroneous concept of “approved faces”, a topic which was covered in detail in the original judgment [see below].  The booklet F4040 is to be found as Appendix 3 to the original judgment.  PI [Production Instruction] 1969/5 is a document which was produced at about the same time as the booklet and specified the procedure for sampling with the gravimetric device.  Neither the booklet, nor the PI made any provision which was directly applicable to contractors.  The booklet did, however, state ambiguously that it was the “aim of the National Coal Board to minimise dust and to attain Approved Dust Conditions in every working place”.  The concept of minimising dust and attainment of “Approved Conditions” were not identical and have, in my judgment therefore, to be construed as having cumulative effect.

No estoppel was asserted.  The existence of this culture also enabled the Third Party to advance submissions to the effect that they were not, by the contracts, required to minimise dust but were merely required to work so that the concentration of dust did not exceed the “approved level” or “permitted amount”.  If there was a further obligation, it was to be found in the Manager’s Scheme which ought to have been provided under RDR.  It was said that all the contractor could be required to do in order to comply with the contract was “to co-operate with the manager in (his) efforts to ensure the requirements of the Regulations are fulfilled”; 3:130:8-14.  It was submitted that the primary obligation on the Contractors was to observe those (approved or permitted) levels, in contradistinction to working so as to minimise the giving off of dust.

The main thrust of the Defendants’ case on the alleged breaches of contract was to identify three separate respects in which the Defendants were entitled to base their argument in favour of their entitlement to indemnity.  First, it was said that the Third Party did not execute the works properly in accordance with the contract, notably by minimising dust.  Secondly, the Third Party was guilty both of negligence and breach of statutory duty.  The third basis asserted was that insofar as British Coal is held to have been in breach of statutory duty as the results of acts or omissions on the part of the contractors, the Defendants are again entitled to an express contractual indemnity.</p>

It is unnecessary to address this aspect of the case in more than summary form because of the nature of the Third Party’s submissions.  These accepted that the Contractors had not aspired to minimise dust, but, as noted above, they had relied on the culture, which they said was all pervasive in British Coal mines, that of meeting or not exceeding “approved levels” or “permitted amounts” as meeting their contractual obligations.  But the submission deserves, nevertheless, to be acknowledged and must be considered.  The Contractors were required to inform themselves of the statutory provisions, namely the Act of 1954 sections 55 and 74 as well as the PI 1969/5.  The contract then required the Contractor to use equipment and methods of work which would “ensure” compliance with the relevant sections of the Act and, by way of a cumulative requirement, ensure that the concentration of dust did not exceed the F4040 levels.  In this context the statutory obligation, it will be recalled, was one which fell to be performed by the Colliery Manager, and required him to minimise the giving off of dust of a character and in such quantity that it would be harmful to persons employed; section 74 of the 1954 Act.  It is only possible, sensibly, to construe this contractual provision by requiring the contractor to do nothing that would imperil the manager meeting his obligation (it being, according to the statute, his alone) to minimise the giving off of respirable dust.  If he failed to do so, the Manager would still remain liable for the breach, but this would not affect the right of the Defendants to seek indemnity, just as happened in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bielak</span>; see below. The only sensible manner in which minimisation of dust be achieved would be by the Contractor himself so carrying out his operations that he minimised the dust which was given off by those operations, the “dust make”.  The approach of the Third Party to the construction of the contract provisions, involved the disregard of the express language of the contract and impermissibly rewriting it in the manner which they suggested in their closing submissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The meaning of the contractual provision in relation to ventilation was not seriously in doubt.  The scheme of the contracts was that the design of ventilation was as specified by the Defendants.  The Defendants would supply the bagging or ducting together with any necessary auxiliary fan and would be generally responsible for the provision of ventilation to the headings.  It was always for the Defendants to specify what form the auxiliary ventilation was to take, that is whether it was to be forcing, extract or overlap.  Because it was the Defendants’ statutory duty to ventilate the mine in accordance with the scheme for the mine, which was specifically the duty of the manager assisted by the ventilation officer working directly under him, it was a matter of absolute practical necessity that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">design</span> should be that of the Defendants.  Installation, maintenance and moving up ventilation ducting in the heading were matters always the contractual responsibility of Contractors.   There were isolated occasions when the Contractors would be required to devise a purely local scheme.  Historically, these occasions appear to have been restricted to the Bentley phase IV works and Stillingfleet.  These were of so unusual occurrence that they raise no generic issue and need not be further considered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Throughout much of the hearing, there was an issue how far Contractors were free to devise and use their own methods of work.  In the end, it became increasingly obvious that, in the vast majority of cases, the Contractors were free to use their own methods, and I so find.  There were exceptions, as where the specification might stipulate whether the heading was to be driven either by bore and fire or by machine.  The contractors were always free to include methods of work, in their tenders, which were alternatives to those stipulated in the specification.  In general, however, in the case of a bore and fire heading, the Contractor was free to choose whether to bore wet or dry and the types of drills he would use and what firing pattern he would employ.  Similarly, in mechanised headings, it would be for the contractor to determine what type of machine would be used for driving the heading and what method should be employed for loading out muck, that is whether by machine or by hand and what types of conveyor he would use as well as the dust suppression equipment which should be fitted to them.  On occasions the specification would require the use of Eimco machines for mucking out.  The Eimco machine might be supplied by the Defendants or by the contractors themselves.  In either event, after RDR, the Third Party was invariably required to maintain the machines within the scheme of maintenance which was to be included in the Manager’s Scheme for the mine.    </p>

Such a statement would not only cover the machinery and methods of work, but also the sequencing of operations which were the subject matter of the contract.  The significance of these incidents of the contractual relationship between the parties is that, as the Defendants submitted, the Third Party was required to comply with, and adopt methods of work which would ensure that they complied with, as well as to co-operate with the Colliery Manager in complying with all relevant statutory provisions while, at the same time they were free to adopt what methods of work they chose to achieve those ends.  </p>

The invitation, which was implicit in this submission, was that the Court should hold that, if such was done, the Third Party could or should not be found to have been in breach of contract.  This argument has to be rejected.  If it were to be accepted, it would involve a misreading or misunderstanding of RDR, in at least two respects, quite apart from a re-writing the contract itself.  First, the Third Party had no input to the Manager’s Scheme, except insofar as its own scheme for maintenance of plant was taken into the former.  Secondly, there was nothing to prevent Contractors from <span style="text-decoration:underline">improving</span> on the manager’s scheme if by doing so they were still enabled to minimise dust.  What the Contractors could not do, without, at the least, being at risk of a finding of breach of contract, was fail to comply with those provisions of the Manager’s Scheme which were applicable to their operations and which were capable of being complied with by them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that both forms of the General Conditions required the Third Party to provide supervision which was appropriate to the work in hand.  To take but one example of the way in which this might work in practice, there was much evidence given to the effect that men would return to the face of the heading too soon after firing had taken place, with the result that they would be unnecessarily exposed to the dust and fume, as the product of explosion, which had been released by firing into the atmosphere of the heading.  It should have been one of the duties of the heading (Contractors’) chargeman to ensure that at least the minimum time lapse before return to the face was observed before the men returned to the face of the heading.  If this was not done, there is scope for a finding of breach of contract on that account.   It does not assist the Third Party, on the contractual issue, that the deputy may also have been present at the time and did nothing to prevent the Contractors’ men making an early return.  That he may also have done so himself, would change nothing in this respect.  The fact that he may also have been in breach of his statutory duty is irrelevant to the breach of contract by the Third Party.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The final contractual analysis is that, in a case where Contractors have not minimised dust, so that the Manager of the Mine is thereby put in breach of his statutory duty, the Third Party becomes under a <span style="text-decoration:underline">contractual</span> duty, which is co-extensive and co-terminus with, the statutory duty of the Defendants.  In such a case, the Defendants would become contractually, or vicariously liable, to the Claimant in respect of the Manager’s breach.  Under Clause 14(1) of the 1963 Conditions the Third Party becomes liable to indemnify the Defendants for loss and expense which they have suffered “to the extent that” such breach had caused the Defendants to suffer loss or damage.

The facts were that the plaintiff had been employed by the first defendants, a company which has since become a part of the Cementation Group.  The circumstances of the accident are not relevant for the purposes of ascertaining the form or construction of the indemnity, which was included in the contract documentation in that case.  However, in order to follow the decision of the Court, a short summary of the facts is required.  The work involved the use of an Eimco mechanical shovel the motive power to which was supplied by compressed air (provided by the NCB) delivered by means of a flexible hose.  A clip which should have secured a join in the coupling of the hose to the machine was imperfectly fixed by an employee of ATC (the first defendants), with the result that it blew off and dislodged a quantity of “muck” some of which struck and injured the plaintiff.  As an issue of fact, Bristow J held that the defective coupling had been made by ATC.  Under section 84(1) of the Mines and quarries Act 1954, the NCB was under an obligation to ensure that all apparatus was so constructed and maintained that it obviated the risk of bursting or explosion.  The facts of the accident (as described) meant that the NCB was thereby put in breach of its statutory duty.  There was no corresponding breach of statutory duty by ATC because the statute was not directed at them.  But in causative terms the incident was wholly the fault of ATC.  Both defendants submitted to judgment in favour of the plaintiff and the matter proceeded by way of a claim for contractual indemnity by the NCB against ATC.  In the circumstances, it is plain that the only relevant fault was that of the contractors which had had the effect of putting NCB in breach of its statutory duty.  The similarity between the Conditions of Contract as they were in that case and the 1969 or 1989 Conditions is readily apparent.  Bristow J, see p9 of the transcript, held:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Third Party submitted that the true meaning of “act or omission”, where those words appear in Clause 14(ii)(c) of the 1963 Conditions or Clause 27(4) of the 1989 Conditions, was that it was not just <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> act or omission but must have been one which was culpable, if it was to be caught by the clause.  This argument has to be rejected because (a) it does violence to the plain and natural meaning of the words and (b) would render the clause superfluous having regard to the other stipulations in the contract.  Moreover, it was said that the Defendants could not rely on this clause to claim indemnity where they had themselves been guilty of relevant fault.  Given the extensive findings made against the Defendants in the original judgment, it was not open to them now to deny that they had been at fault, so as to incur liability to each of the claimants in this litigation.  Indeed, they could hardly do so because their claim for contribution could only proceed on the basis that they were liable to each claimant.  The inclusion of the phrase “to the extent that” (see clause 14 of the 1963 Conditions and clause 27 of the 1989 conditions) meant that the indemnity was not available to the Defendants unless they could demonstrate that the sole cause of the claimant’s injury was fault on the part of the Third Party.  If it was not, then the Defendants’ claim for contribution must fail.  If it was (solely the fault of the Third Party), then there was no liability on the part of the Defendants in respect of which they could claim to have suffered any loss or incurred any expense.  The claim for indemnity would fail on either basis.</p>

The Defendants’ submission stressed the contractual obligations on the part of the Third Party which stipulated that they were obliged to take steps both to ensure adequate supervision in the headings and to minimise dust.  Under conditions 14(iii) and 27(4) of the 1963 and 1989 form of contracts respectively, British Coal was required to indemnify the Third Party for liability incurred by them due to neglect or breach of statutory duty caused by British Coal (provided that such matters did not arise out of neglect of breach of statutory duty on the part of the Contractors). </p>

In that respect the failings of the contractors have to be taken into account and weighed against the Defendants’ own many failings.  On the facts, if they are so found, the Contractors had arguably not complied with the provisions of their contracts and that feature should bear upon apportionment since the parties had by those contracts allocated how responsibility between the parties should lie. As the Court was constrained to point out to Mr Evans, however, there is to be set against that consideration the many respects in which the Defendants had not only been found to have been negligent/in breach of statutory duty in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span> but, in simple terms, it was because of their own concurrent fault that the Third Party had, over many years, been able to carry on its work in ways which involved not only breaches of contract, which went unnoticed or uncorrected by the Defendants, but also by the same token significant breaches of its own statutory duties.

It would have been altogether surprising if there had been complaint when British Coal were themselves only working to the same standard as the Contractors.  Inequality of bargaining power was an issue explored in the evidence, it became clear that the Contractors’ Association had some, perhaps only modest, impact on some of the terms which were on offer from the only potential employers in the industry.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A thread which ran throughout the Third Party case was that they were not only not obliged to comply with any relevant duty under the Act of 1954, insofar as it was directly enforceable against them, but that they were entitled to follow, with impunity, the culture of British Coal as it was to be found underground in mines owned and managed by them.  Both as a matter of contract (see last Chapter) and with regard to the employers’ duty towards his workforce, it was submitted that the Third Party was entitled to rely on the pervasive culture which existed within the Defendants’ organisation, namely that, after RDR came into force, it was sufficient if there was compliance with the Manager’s Scheme and the permitted amounts of respirable dust, or the previously “approved limits”, were not exceeded.  If both were achieved then there was no scope for adverse findings in respect of negligence or breach of contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The central question which is at issue here, and which needs to be highlighted, is whether the Third Party would, if sued by any of the individual claimants, have been held liable notwithstanding adherence to the culture, so called.  For the reason that they claimed that they were entitled to rely on the Defendants to fulfil the statutory duty, which fell upon them under section 74 of the Act, the Third Party contends that, in general, they ought not to be found liable to any of the Lead Claimants.  There is one possible exception, which is the case of Brown of which more later.  The Third Party therefore has, necessarily, to contend that it had no reason to doubt that the Defendants were at all material times compliant with their statutory and common law duties.  The Defendants’ submission was that unless the Third Party could argue that they were unaware of the risk of harmful exposure to respirable dust, compliance with approved levels or permitted amounts or not, there must be a finding of liability against them.  For the reasons which follow, the argument raised by the Third Party has to be rejected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is axiomatic, as well as accepted by the Third Party, that the duty owed to his workmen by an employer is non-delegable.  The Third Party sought to circumvent, or modify, this rule by contending that insofar as they complied with the practice in the industry of which the Defendants were not only the leading employer within the United Kingdom but had also established a world-wide reputation as an innovative owner of coal mines and employer of men, they were acting reasonably towards their workmen. The law required no more of them.  In support of this submission the Third Party also relied on the existence of the extensive statutory scheme, the Act of 1954 together with all the subordinate legislation made thereunder, which placed onerous duties on the Defendants which, if met, would have enabled the Third Party workmen to have been reasonably safe.  This topic is more specifically considered in the next chapter.  That such compliance cannot be assumed is simply illustrated by the proposition that the mere existence of the statutory regime is no guarantee that the party affected by it will comply with the obligations imposed upon it.  By way of example, in a heading, there will inevitably be occasions when the deputy, whose statutory duty it is, at all times, to protect the health and safety of men in his district by whomsoever they are employed (regulations 9, 17 and 18 of the Managers and Officials Regulations), will either not be diligent in fulfilling his statutory duty or that he would be absent from time to time while the Third Party was performing works there.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is much other material which ought to have presented itself to the reasonably careful employer as worthy of his consideration.  There is evidence that contractors were executing work for the defendants, including their predecessors, as far back at least as the mid 1950’s.  It is scarcely to be contemplated, let alone accepted, that contractors would come to an industry unaware of some of the important risks to which their workforce was likely to be exposed.  If they were aware of those risks they could not have been justified in the belief that there were none of which they needed to inform themselves.  Even if they were ignorant of the risks at the outset, a reading of the 1954 Act, if no more, would have provided a warning to a reasonably prudent employer that he should inform himself what sections 55 and 74 were intended to achieve and whence came the necessity for efficient ventilation and the need to minimise dust.  The reasonably careful employer would have sought to inform himself about the risks that were likely to affect his ability to perform his work without subjecting his workmen to unnecessary risk.  Section 74 would itself, at the very least, have put him on enquiry why it was in the Act at all.  His attention would have turned to the body set up to carry out inspections of the industry (HMI Mines and Quarries) and he would have come across the Annual Reports which are summarised in the original judgment <span style="font-weight:bold">pp 58 to 63.  </span>Any reasonable person reading those reports would readily have discovered the danger, which respirable dust represents for workers underground, and, more importantly, they would have learned that the Defendants’ means of dealing with it had been consistently insufficient over many years.  </p>

We believed that if the NCB and the Mines Inspectorate were satisfied with the conditions then we should be too. …  HMI never told us that we were doing anything wrong or that our men were in danger”.  He had no recollection of any of Cementation’s headings going into sanction.  Under cross-examination, Mr Keeble readily accepted that knowledge of dangers arising from exposure to airborne dusts was common, yet he continued to assert that the thought that any of their men might be in danger never entered his, or his company’s, mind.  He said, however, that work within the permitted limits, he believed was safe because he believed that the limits had been set with “some sort of medical certainty that statistically (they) would be safe rather than unsafe”.  Had he, or any other Cementation employee carried out even a cursory search of the available literature, he could not have justified holding to this erroneous belief.  In response to a question suggesting that Cementation relied on the sampling and standards and that the Defendants or the Inspectorate would inform them if there was anything amiss with the sampling or standards, Mr Keeble said that within the activities which they could control they sought to apply best practice “which was the same as British Coal’s best practice”; (30:116:20).  The reality of Mr Keeble’s position was that neither he, nor his company gave any positive thought to the question whether their workmen were exposed to any, let alone, any unnecessary risk from this source.</p>

Thyssen had no information, as long as they were not “admonished” (33:28:25) or the drivage was not put into sanction.  It was his belief, which he shared with Mr Keeble,  that the limits on dust “were actually regarded as a position that the dust was not harmful in the sense of the assessment of the law” (33:29:10).  At a number of points in his statement Mr Luthe had said that Thyssen did not monitor the ventilation and had no information about dust levels unless they happened to be in excess.

As such he was familiar with conditions under which Cementation employees worked underground.  His understanding of the relative positions of British Coal and his company’s men was that each owed parallel duties, albeit British Coal owed specific duties under the Act of 1954.  His further understanding was that exposure to dust carries its dangers but that, in the context of coal mines, the company relied on British Coal to fulfil its statutory duties.  Later, he said that the lead on safety was taken by British Coal and the colliery. At 24:75:17, Mr Homer said:</p>

It is the case that the Handbook made no mention of liaison between the dust control officials at colliery level and contractors who might have been working in a heading.  The point to emerge from this apparent omission was that in Mr Darrington’s opinion “overall responsibility for contractors’ heading from the aspects of ventilation and dust control were firmly with the colliery staff” (25:10:9).  He later said that ultimately it was the deputy’s responsibility to make sure that there was a sufficient supply of ventilation ducting in the heading and to ensure that it was kept up to the face of the heading.  This answer does not indicate, however, that if it was a Contractors’ heading, there would be no responsibility on the Contractors to move the ventilation ducting forward.

Like the great majority of the witnesses in the case, he had started underground as an employee of British Coal in 1955.  He remained in the nationalised industry until 1966 when he obtained employment with Cementation, for which company he worked until joining Amco in 1974, where he remained until retirement in 1999.  It was his evidence, given in statement form (<span style="font-weight:bold">C p179¶39</span>), that the general belief in British Coal was that Contractors could be forced to work more quickly than British Coal’s own men.  This was probably due to better supervision than would have been the case with British Coal.  Mr Bradley was not aware of any Amco heading going into sanction.  But there were occasions when it came close to doing so.  The problems were usually caused by driving through hard strata.  It was his view that the contractors’ foremen did have a responsibility for safety, although the deputy had a greater responsibility, since he was directly answerable to the colliery manager.  This truncated version of his evidence was much expanded during the course of his oral examination.  In answer to Contractors’ counsel he said that:  </p>

Occasionally a heading was stopped if contractors did not comply with instructions.  He knew that mine dust is a hazard and that there was no ‘safe’ level, so it had to be minimised.  He also accepted that Amco had a duty to make safety devices and protective equipment available to its workforce so as to minimise their exposure to dust.  He was almost the only witness to admit that he knew that, before RDR British Coal was not doing all that it ought to have done to minimise exposure of its workforce to inhalation of dust.  He refuted the suggestion that Amco subordinated the interests of the safety of its workforce to the achievement of yardage and gave examples why that was not so.  He was aware, however, that there was “an element” of yardage involved in the way in which contractors’ men would go about their work.  He was reluctant to concede that there was any culture which effectively removed the question of dust control from the responsibility of contractors.  It did emerge, however, that the culture did not really change until the introduction of toolbox talks, which only took place in early 1993, too late to have a significant effect on the outcome of this case; see </span>

On the other hand he volunteered that big improvements in safety came about when management took on that role themselves rather than leaving it to a “safety officer”.  It is an inescapable conclusion from this, that had a pro-active approach to minimisation of dust been embraced, significant improvements of the underground environment would have been achieved.

This fallacy was revealed, it was said, by the proposition that the obligation to minimise dust was “relevant to the manager who controls all aspects of work in the mine including systems for ventilation, dust suppression, plant maintenance and methods of working” so that “the concept of a contractor minimising dust is meaningless”.  The justification for this submission was that dust in a mine arises from a number of causes some only of which are within the Contractors’ ability to control.  Moreover the contracts did not require contractors to minimise dust but only required them not to exceed permitted amounts.  The duty which the Contractor owed to his own men was merely to take reasonable care to avoid exposing his workforce to any agent which he knew or ought to have known was likely to be injurious to their health and to conform to good mining practice.  </p>

Furthermore, the fact that the Third Party performed its work without complaint from the Defendants provides no sound basis for the conclusions either that they worked so as to conform to the contract or that they were not guilty of negligence towards their workmen, if  that was a consequence of their failure to minimise dust.  When it is recalled that the Contractors worked, as they did, in accordance with the same culture as that of British Coal, the absence of complaint by the Defendants cannot be determinative of the question whether the Contractors may not also have been guilty of negligence towards their workforce or not.  In the original judgment, British Coal have been held to have been guilty of negligence for the very same failures as those which they now assert against the Third Party.  When apportionment comes to be considered, while it may be a factor to take into account, that one of the parties may itself have been negligent, it is illogical to say that a party who follows that same procedure may not also guilty of negligence towards its workforce.  Nor, in my judgment, does it assist the Third Party to argue, as it did, that British Coal set the standard.  The standard which it set was, and has been held to be, insufficient towards its own workforce.  If it is the fact that the Third Party was ignorant of the risks to which it was exposing its workers, there was ample evidence, which has already been discussed, that they should have known that if they did not minimise dust their own workers would be similarly exposed to unnecessary risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Third Party further argued that in working as they did they conformed to good mining practice and therefore could not be found guilty of neglect. It was said on their behalf that all that the Third Party was required to do in order to fulfil its duty was to assess the risk, decide what steps should be taken and to know what steps others (the Defendants) were taking in that regard.  The Third Party submitted that the scope of the common law duty of care was modified by what the Defendants were required to do under statute and what it was known they would do in the sense that it was the manager who had the means to control all systems in the mine including the duty to minimise dust in the headings in particular through the Managers Scheme under RDR.</p>

Specifically, it was submitted that:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">Our response is that the third party followed the orthodox practice, which was dry drilling in coal or soft strata and wet drilling in stone.  That, we say, was the British Coal way.  It was put in this way, if my Lord recalls him, by Mr Jim White, who had been a senior British Coal employee and then became contractor's employee.  He described it as being "horses for courses".  That is, you have a mining practice which involves the use of one particular kind of tool in a particular kind of strata. You do dry drilling in the softer strata.  You use the wet drill in the hard strata and the stone.  So, what we say is, to the extent that we did this, the third party, we are only doing what the defendants would have done, and the method of work was no different from the defendant's own. But if that should have been changed and a change of practice or a change of tool should have occurred, then this should have been provided for in the manager's scheme, because this is something which is giving off dust.  But no manager's scheme was produced or known of, according to Mr Mitchell, that prohibited dry drilling.  There is no evidence that the defendant sought to stop that practice.  The evidence is that as practice, it was dictated by geological factors and without more, we respectfully suggest it does not bespeak evidence of fault on the third party that they followed the suit of the defendants in dealing with that.  We make a particular reference to Turmags and comment at the end of that last paragraph but one on  ‘No alternative drill with water suppression that could have been used in geological conditions where Turmags were otherwise used was ever identified by Mr Mitchell.’</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The argument that it was reasonable to expect the Third Party to follow the practice of British Coal remained.  It was submitted that there was no obligation on the Contractors to investigate the levels of dust to which their men were exposed.  That was for two reasons 1: the Defendants had the statutory responsibility to sample air in accordance with RDR and to analyse the results. 2: the Defendants expected the Third Party to work so as not to exceed the permitted amounts and they could be relied upon to notify the Third Party if those limits were exceeded.  As has already been seen, this submission takes no account of the fact that the Defendants statutory duty to sample did not relieve the Third Party of its obligation to consider what were the actual conditions under which its workforce was operating.  But more importantly it ignores the fact that it was publicly known, or should have been known to the Third Party, that as the annual reports of HMI, over a prolonged period, made plain British Coal was “not minimising dust”. It was part of the Third Party submission that whereas section 74 provided no assistance on how dust should be minimised, RDR did provide the practical solution to that problem.  The Third Party submitted that it was neither open nor possible for the Third Party to do what section 74 contemplated.  The obverse of this proposition was that given the all embracing prescriptive nature of the duties of the manager and his deputies, there was no scope for independent action (query, thought) by the Third Party when working to the manager’s scheme as it should have been enforced by the deputies.  It was, the submission continued “the Defendants’ world which is closely controlled by statute, by regulation, by officials; that does not absolve the Third Party of a duty … .  But it does help to identify the scope of the duty”.  In amplification of this submission, the Third Party advanced the proposition that the systems employed by the Defendants so far as dust suppression and ventilation were concerned were relied upon by them and could be regarded as reasonable and, implicitly, did not involve the contractors in breach of any duty of care.</p>

The distinction is indeed valid and sufficient for many cases.  The two categories are not, however, exhaustive: … The practice of leaving employees unprotected … had never been followed ‘without mishap’.  Yet even the plaintiffs have not suggested that it was ‘clearly bad’, in the sense of creating a potential liability in negligence, at any time before the mid 1930’s.  Between the two extremes is a type of risk which is regarded at any given time as an inescapable feature of the industry.  The employer is not liable for the consequences of such risks, although subsequent changes in social awareness, or improvements in knowledge and technology, may transfer the risk into the category of those against which the employer can and should take care.  It is … perhaps impossible to give a comprehensive formula for identifying the line between the acceptable and the unacceptable.  Nevertheless, the line does exist, and was clearly recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Morris v. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. [1956] AC 552.  </span>The speeches in that case show, not that one employer is exonerated by proving that other employers are just as negligent, but the standard of what is negligent is influenced, although not decisively, by the practice in the industry as a whole.  In my judgment, this principle applies not only where the breach of duty is said to consist of a failure to take precautions known to be available as a means of combating a known danger, but also where the omission involves an absence of initiative in seeking out knowledge of facts which are not in themselves obvious.  The employer is required to keep up to date, but the court must be slow to blame him for not ploughing a lone furrow.</p>

In large measure they succeeded.  The distinction is critical.  The fact that without new machinery or technology, those new standards could be met shows that more could and should have been done before that time to concentrate on the task of minimising exposure of miners to respirable dust.

Of course this may be strictly correct.  But British Coal went on to submit that the limited relevance of the evidence in relation to successive standards only lay in assisting the process of calculation of dust exposure of an individual plaintiff.  While it does, or may provide that assistance, it does also assist in determining whether or not British Coal’s approach to meeting their common law or statutory duty was likely to have been conducive to its discharge.  If the achievement of an arbitrary limit was thought by British Coal to be enough and that no more was required of them and the evidence shows that, in general terms, more could have been done to reduce exposure than was required merely to meet the standard, this will facilitate a finding that by aiming at the arbitrary standard they failed to meet their basic obligation to the work force.  Moreover there are obvious weaknesses in a system which permitted the validity of a single sample, if it met the standard, to govern the place   to which it related for the whole of the ensuing year.  With such a system close attention to the overriding and continuing obligation to reduce dust to the minimum was likely to be ignored, especially was this so if giving that attention was likely to impede production.</p>

Reliance on passages from their evidence was also placed on behalf of the Third Party although the emphasis was, obviously different.  A section of the Act of 1954 (s90) was also referred to which places an obligation on a person not negligently or wilfully to do, or omit from doing, anything likely to endanger health should be guilty of an offence. The relevance of this was that supervisors employed by Contractors were subject to the sanctions contained in the Act if they wilfully or negligently failed to enforce adequate suppressive methods in their heading.  It was not deputies alone who might fall foul of the statutory regime.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That the culture in the mines was, as the Third Party submitted in argument, not seriously in doubt.  That the Third Party went along with it, in the main, is also not capable of serious doubt, rather it was the case which they positively advanced as seeking to exculpate themselves from the forensic predicament in which I find that they were.  Given that none of the constituent members of the Third Party were other than established and large scale employers of specialist workers in the tunnelling industry contracted to British Coal, there can be no question but that “reasonableness” and “prudence” demanded more of them than mere adherence to the “British Coal way”.   Those contractors never came close, by intention, to a fulfilment of their duty of care.  “Prudence” and “reasonableness”, those being the qualifications for the fulfilment of the employers’ duty of care in a situation where the allegations of fault consist of omissions to take requisite steps to protect the workforce (see <span style="font-style:italic">Paris</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Morton</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Morris </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Thompson</span>) were qualities notably absent from any of the proved matters in this case.  There is no evidence that the Third Party ever sought or accessed the appropriate literature which was readily available to them, even if not within their own technical resources, within the industry of which they were constituent members.  There was, on a daily basis, a wholly unjustified belief that British Coal was fulfilling its common law, and even its statutory, duty to minimise dust.  The obligation assumed by contract to co-operate with British Coal in complying with its statutory duty under section 74 never triggered an interest in what compliance with that obligation might involve, even if, as to which ignorance could have been an excuse, they were not aware what this particular provision might require of British Coal, and which in turn should have affected the manner in which work was performed by the Third Party under their contracts.</p>

If the Third Party, as it should, had decided that precautions were required over and above what British Coal in general, or the Managers’ Schemes in particular, required there was no impediment either in fact or in law in the way of taking those additional precautions.  I hold that it had been their positive duty to have done so.  It remains to be determined whether on the facts, the conditions under which the Third Party workforce operated from day to day fell short of those which would have obtained had they complied with their common law and contractual duties.</p>

This was a piece of major legislation and was the first legislative attempt to reflect the findings in the Report of the Royal Commission on Coal Mines, 1938.  The Commission investigated, among many other matters, the incidence and causes of lung diseases from the inhalation of fine dusts.  It is of interest to note that there was discussion of the need for dust standards and of the means which, by then, were already available for suppression.  In particular, there was discussion of the need for wet percussive drilling and the advantages of rotary over percussive drills.  There was also recognition of the special need for precautions against dust resulting from shotfiring, especially in confined headings together with the possible advantages of the use of mist projectors; see p404 of the Report.  </p>

Regulation 8 forbids any person to fire a shot unless he is “competent” and “the holder of a shotfirer’s certificate”.  Regulation 15 forbids any person who is not a shot firer or trainee shot firer from being in possession of a detonator.  Regulation 21 requires the owner of the mine to equip the shot firer with a wooden tool for use in charging or stemming shot holes as well as a scraper for cleaning them out.  This last provision is to secure that the practice of directing a blast of compressed air into the shot hole to clear it of dust and muck (clearly a “dust” related provision) is not followed; see Regulation 28(2).  There is then a bundle of Regulations concerned with the charging of shot holes.  Only shot firers, or those under their supervision may charge a shot hole; Regulation 30(1).  Only a complete cartridge may be used to charge a shot hole: Regulation 31(2)(a).  No person may remove any of the external sheath when such is present, from a cartridge; Regulation 32(3).  Nor may a shot hole be overcharged.  Shot holes are to be stemmed “with sufficient suitable … stemming to prevent a blown out hole”; Regulation 33(1).

It was said that it was a consequence of the statutory system of responsibility in respect of health and safety underground that there could be only one system of work, namely that which was established and approved by the Defendants.  This statement draws strength from the above excerpts from the evidence of Mr Moses.  This was a feature which was explicit, not only in RDR which imposed duties on officials of the mine in respect of sampling, provision of respirators and the creation of a Manager’s Scheme, but also in the 1954 Act and all the Regulations and Orders made under it, to some only of which has reference been made above.  It represents the high water mark of the Third Party’s case.</p>

It will also be recalled that, over many years, and for reasons which to it seemed good at the time, British Coal had been averse to the extension of statutory regulation in regard to the control of dust.  This attitude serves in part to explain why the regulatory powers in section 74 of the Act remained unused.  Its importance in relation to the sampling of dust can best be assessed in two short extracts taken from the judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span>, thus:</p>

Many learned papers have been written on the subject and were referred to in evidence.  It is sufficient to observe that although the subject was obviously important, it was in a distraction both to British Coal as an operating entity and in this litigation.  The fundamental task which was of concern to British Coal, in this context, was reduction of the exposure of their workforce to harmful dust.  It was necessary that British Coal should have been able to evaluate the success or failure of the efforts made to achieve that purpose.  It was also relevant for the purposes of this litigation that the court should be informed by the results of the evaluation since that is one of the criteria by which liability will fall to be determined.</p>

Moreover, there are obvious weaknesses in a system which permitted the validity of a single sample, if it met the standard, to govern the place to which it related for the whole of the ensuing year.  With such a system close attention to the overriding and continuing obligation to reduce dust to the minimum was likely to be ignored, especially was this so if giving that attention was likely to impede production.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That was the position prior to RDR.  The Regulations make detailed and complex provision for the taking and treatment of samples and as to the consequences if the samples failed to meet the standard.  Monthly samples are to be taken in each working area and if the dust index and quartz content (the permitted concentrations of which are separately defined) revealed by the sample do not exceed the designated quantities or do not show a specified increase over the previous samples, only one sample need be taken on the next (monthly) sampling occasion.  If the sample is in excess of the permitted index, then 5 samples are to be taken over the ensuing 7 shift days.  Provision is made for different indices to be applicable for different workings in the mine and for coal and other dusts as well as for quartz.  So that there should be public knowledge of what the samples revealed, the manager of the mine has to ensure that the results of each sampling operation are displayed in the covered accommodation at the mine; see by way of interest the evidence of Mr Luthe (above).  If the readings exceed the permitted amount, the manager is required to notify the Inspector (of Mines) of the steps which he proposes should be taken to reduce the amount of respirable dust in the relevant working or he should discontinue that working.  If the next sample readings are still in excess of the relevant amount, the manager is required to discontinue that working.  These phases of control are known as “stage 1” and “stage 2” sanctions, of which more later.  </p>

On a proper reading of the Regulations, the manager is required to ensure that the samples, the taking of which is carefully prescribed, do not exceed the permitted amount, but he is allowed to continue the workings either absolutely or contingently if the reading is in excess.  The duty created by section 74 remains, namely, to minimise “the giving off of dust” and to disperse the dust which enters the air so as to render it harmless.  The Manager is also required to ensure an adequate supply of respirators to be made available.</p>

Contractors were excluded from any of the many and varied managerial and statutory functions in regard to the management of the mine.  This extended to the act of 1974 and included the way in which RDR was structured and operated.  Had it been otherwise, the risk that uncoordinated activities would have created danger would have been a real one.  In addition to the sampling provisions, briefly noted above, an important element within those regulations was the Manager’s Scheme.  Provision for this was made by Part IV of RDR, regulation 12, under which the Manager of a Mine is required to prepare a scheme for the prevention and suppression of dust.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was to be hoped that evidence would be forthcoming of the general nature of the schemes which were promulgated under this regulation.  It was the case, however, that of all the many thousands which must have been prepared between 1975 and 1994, fewer than ten such schemes appear to have survived or, at any rate, made available in this litigation.  One, which was only of value because it showed what could have been achieved in its detail comes from the period after privatisation at Wistow; see <span style="font-weight:bold">UK</span> file.  The others principally related to the Welsh Coalfield, and can at best be described as rudimentary; see e.g. <span style="font-weight:bold">I8 5587</span>.  These are to be seen by way of contrast with the model scheme which had been prepared by the Department of Energy and sent to the Defendants under cover of the letter 11 October 1974 enclosing a revised draft of RDR.  The model  manager’s scheme and the Notes for Guidance on Airborne Dust Legislation  will be found in <span style="font-weight:bold">Q pp 128 to 134</span>.  In comparison with the guidance which was made available to the Defendants, the managers’ dust suppression schemes which have survived represent a poor attempt to achieve an acceptable standard.  They were made the subject of a comparison by the Third Party’s expert engineer in <span style="font-weight:bold">E2 </span>at pp38 to 41 of his Supplementary Report.  The relevance of this consideration is that there was also evidence from the Defendants’ expert engineer, Mr Mitchell, that after RDR came into force managers’ schemes became the criteria under which Contractors working underground ran their operations.  In other words, contractors worked to the managers’ schemes and did not try to improve on them.  This gave rise to the suggestion, which was canvassed both in evidence and submission, that it was not open to contractors to do so.  I reject the notion that mere compliance with any manager’s scheme was sufficient to absolve Contractors from taking further measures to reduce the exposure of their workforce to excess concentrations of respirable dust.  In my judgment, they were free to adopt any measure which they chose, so long as it did not impinge <span style="text-decoration:underline">adversely </span>on the manager’s scheme and it had the intended effect of minimising dust.  Because of what the Third Party saw as the “culture”, the attempt was never made.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Among the many different Regulations, which are all to be found in volume <span style="font-weight:bold">Q/6</span>, the principal ones of concern in this litigation are the Coal and Other Mines (Ventilation) Regulations 1954 which, in addition to supplementing the provisions of section 55 of the Act make specific provision for the use of auxiliary fans.  Auxiliary fans are the principal if not the sole means by which headings, which are by their nature blind can be ventilated by the ventilation system in the mine.  It has to be recognised that such ventilation is part of the ventilation system of the Mine and subject, therefore to the Manager’s Scheme.  Importantly, by regulation 24, no auxiliary fan is to be placed in a mine unless the manager is satisfied that it cannot recirculate air and it will not be contaminated by dust.  By Regulation 25, the manager is required to fix the minimum quantity of air to be delivered through or extracted by the fan, he is also to secure that at least once per week a competent person is to measure the quantity of air being delivered or exhausted by such a fan.  It will appear that there was a systematic error of measurement of the quantity of air delivered by forcing fans; see section on tortious dust later.  An auxiliary fan is defined as one which is to be used below ground “wholly or mainly for ventilating a heading, drift or blind end;” regulation 33(1).  As has already been mentioned, all matters connected with the supply of ventilation, including the design of the means of ventilation, other than the installation, maintenance and moving the dusts or baggings to within the appropriate distance of the face of the headings, were the sole responsibility of British Coal.  </p>

In addition, and at the appropriate stage, issues of culpability will also have to be determined.  In the period of the employment of a claimant by British Coal, there is of course no problem, except as to apportionment between such period and the period of employment by the Contractors.

But this is not the only basis of liability which lies with British Coal since they would also have, what may be described as, their own “original liability” in respect of uncontested failures in regard to such matters as intake contamination, insufficient ventilation quantities and selection, for the purposes of contractual works, of the least optimal systems of auxiliary ventilation and the like and for which the Third Party had no direct responsibility.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In broad terms, so far as the creation and dispersal of dust is concerned, there is a comparison to be made between the old hand-got faces and bore and fire headings, on the one hand, and machine cut faces and mechanised headings, on the other.  In the former category, the outstanding comparison with the later machine headings and faces was the cyclical or periodic generation of dust, the quantity of which will have depended on the point in the cycle at which the “measurement” is taken.  In the latter, the generation of dust was more consistent, although peak concentrations may have been lower. Although peak concentrations will have existed for a substantial part of each shift, these will have been while machine cutting and loading out were taking place.   At times when arch setting was taking place, the principal source of dust will have been from intake contamination and inadequate ventilation quantities.  It is well to remind the reader that COPD is the result of a cumulative life time exposure to respirable dust, so that relevant exposure is the product both of concentrations of dust and the period of exposure.  Hence the importance of factoring into this question of apportionment, the fact that in south Wales, in particular, extended shift working was commonplace in addition to week-end working. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Ford’s paper (above) was more concerned with accurate measurement of dust levels than with absolute levels.  However, the fact that measurements were shown by his research both to have been inaccurate, because of measurement error, and unreliable, because of operator malpractice, clearly impacted on the ability of British Coal to have a true picture of dust conditions in headings, whether they were operated by themselves or by the Third Party.  The paper also demonstrates that mechanised headings experienced problems in containing dust levels which were as much due to conditions over which contractors had no control as those over which they did; see the tables above.  From this evidence it is possible to extract causes for which the Defendants were solely responsible and those where responsibility would be legally shared.  In the latter case, although the legal responsibility would be shared (concurrent liability), the extent to which the Defendants would be found liable would be influenced by the fact that their liability would be derived from the initial failure by the Third Party to have minimised dust in accordance with their contractual as well as common law duty.  In their closing submissions, the parties placed figures before the Court which, if taken at face value, suggested that it was possible realistically to allocate specific and proportionate levels of dust to the various acts and omissions which resulted in an excess of dust in headings.  These were no more than figures “plucked out of the air” and provided no real assistance to the Court in arriving at a distribution between dust for which the Defendants had liability and dust for which both the Defendants and Third Party had responsibility and, in both cases, how that responsibility should be shared.</p>

Excess (over the RDR permitted levels) dust was recorded at 60 per cent of force ventilated machine cut drivages, whereas with both exhaust and overlap ventilation only some 40 per cent of drivages exceeded the permitted levels.  What was also of significance was that mean dust levels were similar in both force and exhaust ventilated drivages at about 5 mg/m</span>

Other samplers, who were independent of the colliery management, carried out ‘check sampling’ on a ‘spot’ basis.  Large numbers of such checks have been carried out from 1961 up to the present day and these served repeatedly to demonstrate that, in general, the routine dust samples were consistently less than the check samples.  British Coal agreed that there was a tendency for dust suppression officers (who were frequently dust samplers) contrived to present a better picture of conditions underground than the reality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Ford also agreed that the problem highlighted in this passage was one which had existed for many years, the effect of which was that a number of loopholes existed in the Regulations and these were exploited.  A further weakness exposed by the Ford study, was the inaccuracy of ventilation measurements due to the type of measuring instrument employed.  The result was that, in force ventilated headings, there was an <span style="text-decoration:underline">over</span>-measurement of the airflow which led to a <span style="text-decoration:underline">shortfall</span> of design ventilation quantity possibly, to the extent of about one third.  This was a generic deficiency which had existed for a number of years which had not been discovered until the Ford investigation and the paper had been circulated to Areas sometime in 1991; see for example <span style="font-weight:bold">J p27¶5.1</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ventilation quantity, assuming that the duct has been properly maintained, is the clear responsibility of the Colliery Manager.  For the remainder of the points itemised in this extract from the paper, it can, I believe, be fairly said that none are ‘state of the art’ which should have been outwith the experience and capability of an experienced contractor to have controlled.  It is true that in the great majority of contracts, the Defendants specified what type (forcing, exhaust or overlap) was to be provided, it remained for the Contractors to install and maintain that ventilation themselves and they should not have needed supervision from an official of the mine to have produced the optimum result.</p>

This form of ventilation, he considered only to be suitable in machine cut drivages where there was a high emission of methane – which would be in only a significant minority of cases.  During the course of Dr Ford’s evidence a table was prepared, and subsequently agreed, which showed the proportions in which headings were ventilated in the period 1987 to 1993.

This change had been a long time coming.   An additional matter for consideration is the velocity of air movement at the face of headings where ventilation was either exhaust or overlap.  It was Dr Ford’s evidence that for a period of up to 15 years it had been known that if the velocity air was maintained at about 0.5 m/s that would prevent dust back up “under all operational conditions”.  There was no technical reason why this problem could not have been dealt with during that period; there was an uncomfortable suggestion that the expense of providing the necessary equipment was the explanation. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:-0.12in">   Because it could be argued that ‘uncertainties’ should be resolved in favour of defendants if there was to be a proper reflection of where the burden of proof lies, I have deliberately omitted from this quotation the words ‘making the fullest allowances in favour of the plaintiffs for the uncertainties known to be involved in any apportionment’.  But this may be no more than pedantry.  What is, I believe, beyond question or serious argument is the fact that apportionment cannot be satisfactorily achieved by reliance on numbers, whether they be of exposure to dust from day to day, to year to year, or over the whole period of employment.  No more can numbers suggest, let alone dictate, what impact a known and tortious dust exposure will have on the ventilatory capacity of any individual.  Nor yet is it possible to arrive at any measured extent by which dust at any given moment or over an extended period exceeded the non-tortious quantity – whatever that amount might be.  All these considerations must ineluctably impose on the court a solution sometimes praised, sometimes vilified and most often not fully understood that the solution has to be found as an answer to a ‘jury question’.  All that this expression means is that the reasoning underpinning the decision is not susceptible to precise quantification or analysis but it is one announced after paying careful attention to the evidence given, and argument made, in relation to such evidence as is available to the court.</p>

The circumstances in which the parties to this litigation find themselves, however, are not so compelling as they were in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths.</span>   But rejection of the Defendants’ claim on the basis of an insufficiency of proof is not a solution which, I consider, would properly reflect the underlying nature of this litigation.  In reality, and in order to succeed, if the Claimants had sued the Third Party alone in respect of the respiratory injury suffered during the period of their employment, they would have had to show that, in the light of the manifold breaches of duty on the part of their employers over the years, it was more likely than not that their respiratory injury had been caused thereby.  It would have been not merely an unmeritorious result if there was to be no recovery because the Court could not be sure just how much respiratory injury had been caused by those breaches of duty, it would, I consider, have led to a great injustice.  In my judgment, also, it would not have been a result which properly reflected the current state of the law.  Such an approach would ignore the fact that, by reason of the many generic and persistent breaches of duty by the Third Party towards the Claimants, there is an overwhelming case, in my judgment, for saying that the injury was caused, or facilitated. by that negligence, on the basis that:</p>

But what they had to do was prove that the Third Party’s wrongdoing had materially increased the risk that the Claimant himself, and perhaps others besides, would suffer injury as the result of the relevant (tortious) acts or omissions.  Given the findings of generic fault which will be made against the Third Party (see next section), there can be little doubt that any claimant, who could prove that he had suffered as the result of the exposure to the risk which had eventuated from those acts or omissions, would have recovered from the Third Party. </p>

These failures occurred by whatever means the heading was ventilated.  The reasons for this are understandable, but cannot be excused.  Time spent adjusting and maintaining the ventilation ducting was time not spent advancing the face of the drivage, by which the contractors commercial outturn on the job depended, as well as the bonus payments which the heading team might or might not receive.  But again, there would have been a shared responsibility between Contractors and the Defendants because of the failure of the deputy adequately to have supervised operations in the heading.</p>

In the former, the cycle of work was to drill the holes in the face for the shots to be placed, followed by stemming and firing.  In the smaller drivages in South Wales, more often than not after firing, the layflat ventilation bagging was either damaged or blown down and sometimes both.  If blown down, it was a matter of not infrequent occurrence that some part, at least of the bagging would have been buried by the muck which had been dislodged when the shots were fired, the consequence was that ventilation became temporarily obstructed and the bagging was damaged.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence of Mr Jessop, who opined that such was a physical impossibility, must be rejected (21:131:2).  This type of situation exemplifies the benefit that a respirator could have provided.   No real case was advanced why a respirator should not have been worn during the period of maximum dustiness, which was bound to exist until ventilation was restored, which was itself not an operation of the physically most demanding.  If a significant number of shots had been fired, they were almost always subject to a delay settings so that there was sequential detonation.  Thus there was the opportunity for the earliest shots to have brought the bagging down and for the effect of the later shots to have buried it.  This would inevitably have led to the quandary (“damned if you do and damned if you do not”) whether to move the bagging back from the face before firing the shots, which was impermissible under the Regulations, or for some one or more men to re-enter the face of the heading as soon as it was physically possible in order to free the end of the bagging and restore ventilation.  While in the heading at such times, peak concentrations of dust, as well as fumes, would have existed.  However, once the bagging had been freed from the muck, ventilation should have been quickly restored and the dust cloud would be driven back and away from the face.  Although for a limited period a man or men would have been exposed to peak concentrations of dust, there was no evidence to show what would have been the quantitative effect of that exposure of limited character as compared with the exposure during the remainder of the shift.  Firing would take place on a number of occasions per shift, but was only carried out when the deputy was present who alone had the authority to perform that operation.  There was some good evidence that, particularly in South Wales, the deputy would permit the Third Party’s men to return to the heading before the dust cloud had cleared, this would have enabled an early resumption of work in clearing the muck.  There would be shared responsibility for this, but the preponderance of fault would lie with the Third Party, as employer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Operations in headings were subject to the direct control of the Third Party, through their chargeman or foreman, subject always to the overriding obligation of the deputy to ensure the safety of men in his district, whether they were employed by contractors or British Coal.   The most obvious difference between the role of the chargeman and the deputy is that the former would always be present at the site of the work, whereas the latter may have had duties to perform elsewhere in his district so that he would not necessarily be present at the face of the heading throughout his shift.  On the other hand, the deputy had a power which he could exercise which, if he considered that an unsafe practice was being followed, enabled him to cut off power to all machines in the heading and stop all of them if he was not satisfied with safety precautions.  I entertain no doubt that there will have been many occasions when the chargeman did not insist on time consuming dust suppression techniques with a view to progressing the work, in the hope that he would either not be observed, or interrupted, by the deputy’s exercise of authority to stop the work.  The evidence satisfies me, also, that not all deputies took their safety duties equally seriously.  There were many occasions when work continued in the absence of suitable precautions with the deputy either unable or unwilling to exercise his authority.  In this type of situation, again there would be a shared responsibility, albeit not in equal proportions, for whatever the shortcomings may have been.</p>

There was no evidence that the Third Party gave independent thought to what, as reasonable employers, they should have done to protect their workforce.  If it were to be the case, as was accepted by the Third Party management, that after RDR came into force, they did no better than to attempt not to exceed “permitted amounts”, then by that admission, they failed to take reasonable steps to protect their workforce.  In closing submissions, it was said that the contracts required no more of the Third Party than that.  However, I am satisfied that was not the true position under the contracts; see above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All too frequently, ventilation fell too far behind, baggings, where supplied by the defendants in a defective condition, as sometimes they were, were either erected in that condition, rather than returned to the Defendants, or not repaired by the Third Party before being put into use.  Ventilation ducts were not erected in the most efficacious position.  On occasions, jigger picks with blunt pick points were used and not quickly replaced.  The evidence also satisfies me that there were frequent occasions when there were difficulties in obtaining supplies of sharp picks for the road heading machines.  But this, I do not find was commonplace for obvious reasons, as Mr Kulcsar observed, “that was donkey work”.  Loading out whether by hand or by Eimco was by its nature a dusty activity.  Much more could have been done to ensure adequate wetting of the muck pile and by the application and maintenance of sprays to the Eimco bucket, after these became available in 1975.  No reason was offered why water should not have been applied to these machines before the advent of RDR.  The application of water to muck piles or Eimco machines were, no doubt, activities which were time consuming and their adoption could also lead to working conditions deteriorating due to the presence of uncomfortable quantities of water and the additional weight that water would add to the muck.  A constant source of dust creation, which could readily have been prevented was the failure of the Third Party to ensure that when muck was tipped from the Eimco bucket onto the tail end of the outbye conveyor the bucket was first lowered as close as it reasonably could to the conveyor, or permitting the free fall of muck when hand filling was taking place.  Overloading the conveyor, by tipping too fast could lead to spillage and the unnecessary release of dust into the atmosphere and, I am satisfied, became another frequent and potent source of dust creation.  Other examples of dust generating activities, which should have been subject to suppressive measures, were the use of jigger picks without water sprays, drilling without any suppressive measures including the use of unsuitable drills (Turmags), which had no capability to receive suppressive equipment.  There were also occasions when the contract specified that a heading should be machine cut, whereas bore and fire would have produced less dust and been a more efficient method.  Contractors could, as on occasions they did, insist on a change of specification as to the method of drivage.  The negligence did not consist merely of a failure to require a change of method from driving the heading, but in continuing with an unsuitable method without taking extra precautions to protect the workforce.  There were also many occasions when road headers were used with either broken picks or defective water provision, or both.  Some machines were provided with interlocks, which prevented their use in the absence of water.  These, I find, were in the minority and only came into use within a few years of the end of the period of interest.   This was particularly the case when driving through hard rock.  But for this, only the defendants would have had a responsibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons which were expressed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span>, there is no prospect that the Court could arrive at a scientifically based division between the effects of the sometimes differing, sometimes similar, acts and omissions which gave the individual claimant a cause of action against both parties.  It is, however, necessary to indicate that, although in large measure, the acts and omissions of British Coal and the Third Party will have been joint, this is not the whole picture.  A number of the claimants, in addition to the period of training which all underwent with British Coal, also worked for that organisation for substantial periods.  Respiratory injury during those periods is the sole responsibility of British Coal, as they accepted.  By way of contrast, however, while employed by the Third Party in respect of operations which were performed under the contracts made between them, the liability of British Coal in this situation will not just have been joint, albeit the acts and omissions will have overlapped, because, as has been seen, the deputy had the personal statutory duty to ensure that the Third Party carried out their operations so as not to damage their workers health.  There is a further category of case in which there would be an additional basis of liability attaching solely to the Defendants, but not to the Third Party.  This is exemplified by the extent to which intake contamination was one of the most frequently recorded causes of headings going into stage 1 sanctions; see chart at page 116.  It is probable that water supply (cause 9 on the chart) was also a, but less frequent, cause of sanctions being incurred.  In many instances, amounting almost to routine, I have been satisfied that a major cause of poor dust conditions in headings was inadequate house-keeping by the Third Party – an elementary, but time consuming, precaution.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that a major part of the Third Party defence to these claims was the belief, wrongly held as I have found, that if Contractors conformed to British Coal practices that would have satisfied their obligations towards the Claimants.  That was a belief which British Coal did nothing to dispel.  Indeed, there was, in material respects, encouragement held out to the Third Party that such belief was justified.  Notably was this true in the respect that British Coal did not itself work to the minimisation of dust but to the illusory concept of “approved limits” or “permitted amounts”; see above.  Furthermore, and to the extent that the Third Party were in breach of duty towards their workmen and failed to comply with the terms of the contracts, as previously discussed, the deputies were to the like extent in breach of their statutory and common law duty towards the Third Party workmen.  As against these considerations, are the terms of those same contracts which were intended to protect British Coal from the consequences of the faults of the Third Party which caused British Coal to suffer financial loss and damage by the payment of compensation to their workforce under the CHA. The force of that consideration is somewhat mitigated, however, by the reference in the contracts to the anachronistic dust suppression document F4040 and practice of working so as “not to exceed permitted amounts”.  The obligation of the Third Party to carry out the works in accordance with the contract, including the provision of effective supervision, the stipulation that any breach of statutory duty on the part of British Coal caused by any act or omission on the part of the Contractors are all matters which have to be taken into account when deciding how liability should in the end be apportioned whether under the Act of 1978 or under the provisions contained in the contracts.</p>

A factor which must be given due weight is that it is the primary duty of an employer is to take reasonable steps to protect his employees from the risk of injury of which he knew or ought to have known.  On the findings which I have already made, in respect of the protection of their workforce from the inhalation of excess dust, the Third Party took little or no positive interest but instead relied on the assumption that if British Coal, or HMI Mines and Quarries, did not draw attention to any shortcomings on their part, no more could reasonably be required of them.  While it is true that in the aftermath of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, there was some evidence that Contractors devised health and safety policies, at least as paper exercises, there was little evidence that any of these policies filtered down to the headings or that, if they did, serious and constructive thought was given to the problem of how to limit with the inhalation of excessive dust by their workforce.  The long term failures by Contractors to consider independently the health of their workforce was as regrettable as were the manifold failings on the part of British Coal expressed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span>.

The principal matters for which British Coal had and continue to have an original liability may be identified as: intake contamination; ventilation quantities reaching the face of the heading due to inadequate main or auxiliary ventilation; and ventilation due to the type, that is the specification and use of forcing, exhaust or overlap in circumstances which may have been inappropriate or less than optimal.            </p>

While British Coal will have been liable in respect of the whole of the respiratory damage caused to him, the Third Party will only have been legally responsible for part.  In contrast, the Defendants liability was both original in the respects just identified, as well as vicariously liable through the deputies for the deficiencies on the part of the Third Party in regard to the manner in which they conducted their operations.  Does it follow, however, that they are both joint tortfeasors in respect of all the damage suffered by an individual claimant and that both will have contributed to “the same damage” for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Act of 1978?  It will not have escaped notice that the Defendants have paid compensation under the terms of the CHA to all the Claimants in respect of the total respiratory damage which each has suffered, subject to apportionment for smoking and tortious,  as opposed to “innocent”, dust.  In my judgment, they were undeniably correct to have done so because of (a) their original and (b) their vicarious or joint liability.  As to (a) this will have included the period during which the individual claimant was employed by British Coal, as well as during the period of Contractor employment owing to their breach of duty as owner and manager of the mine arising from matters over which the Contractors had no direct control and (b) liability for shortcomings on the part of the deputy in terms of supervision, breaches of the Managers and Officials Regulations and, particularly in South Wales, inadequate control of the shotfiring processes in a number of separate respects. </p>

The chart at <span style="font-weight:bold">paragraph 191</span> (above), was an early attempt to make some progress in this field.  That it makes a start on this path cannot be gainsaid.  But it went no further.  The reasons why no better progress was made, is attributable to the uncertain nature of the available core material.  It has to be remembered that the raw figures from which the chart was derived were non-specific on the question whether it related to a British Coal or Third Party heading, the cause could sometimes, but not always be attributed to the operator of the heading, sometimes the cause was not due to any identifiable fault on the part of either and the documents underlying the Barnsley Area study, from which the chart had been produced were themselves ambiguous.  Lastly, there was frequently more than one reason why a heading might go into sanction.  In such a case faults might be shared in unequal proportions for a number of causes.  Furthermore, the only years for which any figures were available were from 1975 onwards.  The earlier period was entirely non-specific.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the problems which presents itself, is how fairly to apportion the fact that over period of his employment, an individual claimant’s dust exposure will have varied not only from year to year, month by month but almost hourly day by day.  This variability of exposure, has therefore to be reflected over a longer time scale than days or months.  It is not necessarily the case that a man’s exposure to tortious dust will have been higher during the early years because of the change from bore and fire, with its cyclical production of dust, to mechanised headings with the more consistent production of dust.  Experience of dust on coal faces suggested that, in the period after the introduction of shearing machines to the coal face, and before pick face flushing was introduced, dust conditions had deteriorated as compared with conditions on faces worked in the traditional manner, whether as hand got or the use of jigger (windy) picks, as the principal method of coal extraction.  Apportionment, if it is to be a fair process, must reflect not only the differing periods of exposure as between British Coal and the Third Party, but ought also to reflect the different tortious contributions during periods of underground employment from both British Coal and the Third Party, as well as over the longer time scale.</p>

These methods will be discussed, hereafter.  But it is necessary first to dispose of a fourth possible, but entirely theoretical, method of apportionment was suggested during cross-examination of Mr Mitchell.  This had no evidential provenance, apart from the qualified admissions which Mr Mitchell felt constrained make in regard to it.  It was a method that was based on the theoretical workings of the Third Party legal team.  There was nothing improper about this exercise, but it tended to lose cogency for two reasons.  First, it was not based on expert evidence and was, as noted, merely theoretical.  Secondly, founded as it was on the PXR prevalence figures, which although based on the periodic results from that survey, for the reasons developed below, could not properly be approximated to the position of the individual Claimants in these proceedings.  The method was also insensitive to variations in actual exposure when, as happened from time to time, conditions sharply deteriorated.  In addition, it is apparent that the falling prevalence figures, which this theory incorporated, are at odds with what is known to have been happening in actual conditions underground.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the years after the introduction of RDR, there was a steady contraction in the mining industry, which was accelerated in the aftermath of the year-long strike in 1984.  It was following this period that a scheme for early redundancy was introduced.  The consequence was that the prevalence figures for the periods, both before RDR and after, were based on two colliery populations which were significantly different from one another.  It can readily be seen that one colliery population which is older than another will inevitably show a higher prevalence rate than a younger one.  Moreover, in the period up to and after 1985 there was an increasing use made of dust masks which will have reduced the amount of respirable dust both tortious as well as innocent which the men will have inhaled as compared with the earlier period with the older workers.  There is another factor which militates against the use of a method based on the PXR, which is that there was an increasing mobility of labour between collieries in the later years, this being a consequence of colliery closures and departure of the older workforce.  It will also be appreciated that prevalence figures are a retrospective, in that they represent the results of exposure over the theoretical working life and are not representative of exposure to current, or even recent, dust conditions.  Inevitably, their use would introduce a downwards bias into any calculation based upon this data. </p>

Secondly, as the extract itself observes, there are many assumptions and a lack of hard statistical material to underpin much of the apportionment contained within the table.  Thirdly, the table itself makes some allowance for the reduction of dust concentrations in the later years in as reliable a way as could have been devised and which was as true to the judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span> as it could have been made.  Fourthly, the table was concerned with apportionment which included the effects of smoking.  Since that is a quantity which has already been taken into account in calculating the compensation awarded to the Lead Claimants, there is an illogicality in taking it into account a second time.  The unspoken premise to the validity of the suggestion made to Dr Ford in cross-examination was that the later figures to be derived from the PXR were themselves reliable; but the evidence demonstrated that this was not so.  Thus, the exercise was, and must remain, a theoretical one, which could only have had validity if its premise had itself rested on a sure foundation.  I therefore reject that method.  Apart from all other considerations, the adoption of the suggested method of apportionment would have introduced into the resulting calculation a degree of accuracy which the reliability of the underlying figures could not have justified.  In a sentence, the results would have given a spurious appearance of scientific accuracy.</p>

This is for the reason that during any period of underground work it is certain that different, as well as differing, contributions to tortious dust will have been made by British Coal and the Third Party.  On the other hand, time weighting for the purpose of apportionment between British Coal and Contractor periods of employment has obvious merit in its simplicity.  It should also be made responsive to the fact that over time, the level of tortiousness will have varied.  As nothing in this field is or can be exact, such a method is, in my judgment, fair in a rough and ready way.  Mr Mitchell had little difficulty in discarding method 3 as a fair means of proceeding.  This was because the concept of dust insult units was concerned with allocation of respiratory disability between the effects of mine dust and tobacco smoking and not just the assessment of tortious dust in absolute terms.   Although there was initial challenge to the methodolgy which had led to the creation of the table in the Schedule 11 (now 12) of the CHA, after examination it was not clear that any further challenge was made as to its validity whether by means of calling contradictory evidence or in final submissions made by the Third Party.

As already noted, in the present litigation, unlike the position in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span>, there has been little evidence of an objective or quantitative nature about the absolute levels of dust in headings or other places of work performed by contractors in which it is known that any Lead Claimant ever worked.  The Court is left with the generalities already mentioned, which made it highly improbable that Contractors so carried out their operations that dust was minimised.  There has also to be taken into account the inferences which can properly be drawn from the statistical tables which appear at <span style="font-weight:bold"> paragraphs 191 and 192 </span>(above).  There is abundant evidence from which it can be inferred that on a consistent, rather than occasional, basis the Third Party failed to take reasonable steps to protect its workforce from excessive levels of dust.  These considerations lead me to prefer a method which reflects the varying levels in the proportion of the total exposure which is tortuous,  over time.  Such figures would reflect actual variable dust conditions.</p>

These levels vary according to seven different 5 year periods (approximately).  Table 1 of Mr Mitchell’s report <span style="font-weight:bold">D13</span> provides a sample calculation employing this method in the case of Mr Ellis.  There is, however, a weakness incorporated into this method, in that it assumes that the only tortious contribution to a Claimant’s cumulative dust total comes from either the Defendants or the Third Party.  We know, from the discussion which has already taken place, that, during the period of Third Party employment, there has been a continuing contribution to that cumulative dust by the Defendants.  Some allowance has to be built into the method which will reflect this factor.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before arriving at figures which will take this factor properly into account, it is first necessary to allocate responsibility for levels of tortiousness within the headings.  Given the figures for reasons for headings going into sanction (table paragraph [<span style="font-weight:bold">191/2</span>] above) and the figures which can be derived from Dr Ford’s later paper <span style="font-weight:bold">V1/4</span> and the various factors which have been discussed in this Chapter under <span style="font-weight:bold">Factors affecting allocation of culpability,</span> my judgment is that, on a day to day basis, it is just and equitable that British Coal should bear three fifths of the responsibility for matters such as intake contamination, ventilation quantities (including design) and water supplies.  For operational conditions in the headings, the Contractors should bear the greatest share of the responsibility since they were the employer and they had by their contracts accepted responsibility as between themselves and British Coal, whatever they may have thought in practice.  Nevertheless British Coal did also have an active part to play in supervising Contractors’ operations in the headings which, on the evidence, they failed properly to exercise.  In my judgment a just and equitable division of these responsibilities is 75 per cent on the Contractors’ part with the balance to be allocated to British Coal.  In the years of employment by the Third Party, then, the assessment of the Contractors’ responsibility for tortious dust can be expressed as 30 per cent of the annual tortious dust figure in the IRISC calculation sheets.  This apportionment applies irrespective of the <span style="font-weight:bold">Respirator factor</span>. </p>

If, when the individual cases come to be considered there is evidence, which would justify a departure from this finding, that will be made clear.  It will also be the case, that although there is to be no distinction drawn between individual constituent members of the Third Party, where the evidence enables a just distinction to be drawn in relation to conditions in individual mines or as between South Wales and other mining areas, this too will be demonstrated and will be taken into account.  A further point to note is that since each Lead Claimant’s award has already been assessed by making use of the table of tortious values, job factors as well as the respirator factor, it would introduce an element of duplication if such were given any further weight.</p>

Unless or until a … (suitable respirator) became available there was probably little that British Coal could have done to lessen the exposure of men to dust by means of education or persuasion of the advantages of using a respirator.  The counter argument that seeking to persuade men to wear an unsuitable respirator would have delayed the widespread adoption of the respirator as a suitable protective device has undoubted logical attraction.  As against this, however, is the fact that a respirator could have been effective not just against tortious dust but against the whole range of dust exposure which men encountered in the many activities which they were required to perform underground.</span>

In deciding how to apply these considerations in a practical way require that allowance will have to be made for the fact that overmen in particular, and deputies to a lesser extent will have had to remove their respirators for appreciable periods when giving instructions to miners for whom they were responsible as well as the fact that working conditions for all may well not have been conducive to the wearing of respirators for much, if not most of their working time underground.  For the face worker, other than machine driver, who had performed physically arduous work, there is difficulty in proving that he would have used a respirator even if such had been supplied and he had been suitably instructed.</p>

The case for the Defendants was straightforward. Mr Stevenson, the Third Party expert engineer accepted that in general, Contractors did not provide respirators for the use of its workforce.

Further, it was contended that “the defendants assumed the <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>responsibility to provide respiratory protective equipment … and never looked to the Third Party to do so”.  This latter submission, although true insofar as the <span style="text-decoration:underline">provision</span> of such equipment was concerned, was of dubious legal status since it was not so much the provision of the equipment which mattered but efforts made to persuade the workforce to have made use of it which were of importance. This contention was not pursued in evidence and may, therefore, be sensibly be disregarded as a serious contribution to the debate on this topic.  The Third Party also contended that unless or until they had reason to know that British Coal was failing in its duty, as found in the original judgment, there was no obligation on the Contractors to provide, encourage or urge their workforce to use respirators.  It must be said that there is some element of apparent confusion about the Third Party’s position in relation to this issue both in opening and in their closing submissions.  The reasons may not be far to seek as the following references to the evidence will make plain.  Mr Keeble (31:38:23) said that his company (Cementation) left it to the individual whether or not they should wear dust masks, they gave no instruction and left it entirely to the decision of the individual.  Yet, Mr Keeble accepted that it was best practice to ensure that such masks should be worn, particularly at times when dust conditions were bad.  It was plain, however surprisingly, that Mr Keeble had not appreciated (without the benefit of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths’s</span> judgment) that masks could reduce the dust when conditions were bad.  He accepted that had he been aware of that he would have urged his men to make use of dust masks.  Mr Homer, who had originally worked for ATC (supra) joined Cementation after the amalgamation of those two companies.   He accepted that dust was potentially hazardous and took the, by now, familiar line that the company followed British Coal policy (24:101:17-21).

In addition to that, I thought that often in – this was very heavy work because you actually had to drag pipes up a particular slope.  … and the mask did that (indicating).  It actually moved with the breath intake and I thought this system, if relied upon, would not be effective enough and I left it.  That was my first experience. I will say that -- if not asked I say it nevertheless -- when I came, very few people ever wore dust masks and we -- I never sort of promoted them and I never hindered anybody to do that because I think it depends very much on your physical shape and your physical approach to these things.  For instance, if your face is more likely to adjust to the mask as an attachment to your mouth, then obviously you are better off than if for instance it bites into your skin.  Therefore, I, in my safety statement as you have read it, not incorporated dust masks because I think there are two reasons.  One, I just gave a physiological reason, and the other reason is, if relied upon in sole application, it leads people to become careless and not to actually do the sort of more essential thing and that is damping down with water.

They did not accept that the defendants had made a case that Contractors should be found guilty of negligence by reason of their failure to provide or exhort their men to make use of them, even if only at times of peak dust concentrations.  If, however, the Defendants overcame that hurdle, they had then to prove, in any of the Lead Cases the date from which such a finding should be made against the Third Party.  The main plank of the Third Party case on this issue appears to have been based on their lack of knowledge, there being no basis, it was said, for finding that they should have known as much as, let alone, more than British Coal.  Essentially, this argument does not run.  Not only did witness after witness, as briefly reviewed above, accept that he was aware of the dangers arising from dust, especially when it came from rock rather than coal, it was also the case that they had access to the relevant literature, whether or not they chose to put that knowledge into practice or not.

I have already found that no reasonable contractor should have been ignorant of that fact.  No more in the field of dust masks than, in the provision of suitable preventive and suppressive measures in headings, could the Third Party have been justified in following the line, espoused in their concluding submissions on this issue, that they could rely on British Coal to have done what was reasonable, so far as dust creation and suppression were concerned.  That was an attitude based on unjustifiable assumption, and no more.  There was a total absence of evidence that any of the constituent members of the Third Party ever gave any thought to the question what, if anything, it should be doing to protect its workforce from the continuing failure of British Coal effectively to address the problem of the exposure of the workforce underground to dust which had not been ‘minimised’.  The suggestion that it would have been putting an undue economic burden on the Contractors to do more by way of increasing the knowledge, which was readily available to them, and taking action in the light of the knowledge so acquired, is not made out.  It is the absence of evidence to demonstrate that the Third Party ever considered there to have been a problem that justifies this generic finding of negligence.  The evidence was that, so far from British Coal proving unreceptive or resistant to safety measures proposed by contractors, once the Third Party had taken the innovative step of appointing safety officers, which was a step which was only taken after 1974, mine management on a local level was shown to be receptive to what they were being informed.  If it were necessary to find an explanation for this, it is there was an obvious community of interest in complying both with the letter and the spirit of RDR.  There is no evidence that the Third Party ever made any approach to British Coal with a view to some form of protective or remedial action being taken in respect of the continuing exposure of the work force to dust which had not been minimised.  As has been seen elsewhere, the reliance on British Coal, to set a standard which was sufficient for others to follow comes, nowhere near to fulfilment of the employers’ duty of care towards his workers.  Had there been no material available to contractors, then the beginning of a case could have been made on their behalf.  As has been found elsewhere, the Third Party ignored or misunderstood the provisions in their contracts with British Coal which were intended to ensure that the contractors’ own workforce was protected from excessive exposure to respirable dust. They ignored or misunderstood their statutory obligations and substituted an ill-founded belief that British Coal had fulfilled its own statutory obligation, which would avail the Third Party.  The published evidence clearly showed otherwise.</p>

There were particular aspects of the relationship between the Defendants and their workforce which meant that it would have been inappropriate to have continued the respirator factor, by conversion of innocent to tortious dust, after the end of the strike, in 1985.  The basis of this concession by the Claimants was that after that date, the parties were agreed that sufficient provision and exhortation had been made by the Defendants which would have made it unrealistic to have prolonged the period of liability under this allegation of fault.  But this situation has no relevance so far as the Third Party is concerned.  At no stage, before the last year or so of the existence of British Coal as an operating entity, did the Third Party by exhortation take reasonable steps to encourage the use of respirators by their workforce.</p>

It fails on the facts, however, because, from the introduction of RDR, if not before, all collieries, in which contractors’ men were employed, made masks available to any man who passed through the lamp room on their way underground, as by law they were required to do.  The case, which had been advanced through cross-examination of the Third Party management witnesses, and accepted by them, was that no attempt had been made to persuade any of their men to make use of the dust masks which had been made available to them in the lamp room.  I am quite unable to accept that the Defendants have not made out a case that Contractors ought to have taken steps to instruct, urge or persuade their men to make use of the respiratory equipment which was available, or which the Contractors ought themselves to have provided from 1965 onwards.

Secondly, the position of the Third Party in the light of the provision in the CHA that the respirator factor would not be applied as against the claimants after 1985.  It will be recalled that the effect of applying the respirator factor in any given case was to convert what would have been “innocent dust” into tortious dust because of the protection which wearing a dust mask would have given against <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> dust, both tortious and innocent, during such period as the mask was worn.  </p>

The point is that British Coal did not itself engage in the manufacture of respiratory protective equipment, it turned to well known manufacturers of respiratory protective equipment for its supplies. The documents in folder <span style="font-weight:bold">R</span>,<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>demonstrate that commercial manufacturers, as well as the British Standards Institution, were actively pursuing the design of a dust mask which would have been entirely suitable for mining work during the late 1950’s.  It should be noted that Mr Stevenson draws attention to the availability of dust masks from the early 1960’s; see <span style="font-weight:bold">E1¶18.1</span>.  This comment is also consistent with the documents which are to be found in folder <span style="font-weight:bold">R</span>.  Mr Stevenson refers to the Martindale respirator, the documents in <span style="font-weight:bold">R</span> suggest that another well known manufacturer (Siebe Gorman) also produced a respirator which was available during this early period.  There is no evidence that the Third Party ever approached manufacturers, with a view to discovering what might have been available.  In my judgment, there is no valid reason to select a date in respect of the Third Party’s failure to provide respirators and urge their use, other than that from which British Coal were found to be liable, in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span>, namely 1965.

Filling out and the use of drills was both hot and dusty work which will have militated against the wearing of dust masks for much of the time.  Apart from those aspects of the work, manual work in headings was probably less physically demanding than work on the coal face.  In mechanised headings the work was done mainly by machine cutting and machine loading out.  On the evidence, it was both sensible and practicable for dust masks to have been worn during those phases which would have been times of peak dust.  This bears a similarity, in many respects, to the work in unmechanised or coal face work which consisted of large scale use of jigger picks and hand filling.  There would also have been substantial periods when other manual work was being performed, as on the coal faces, which would have militated against the permanent wearing of dust masks by Third Party workers.    </p>

Some Lead Claimants did make use of respirators, from a date some time in the early 1970’s.   If the Third Party had had a programme of instruction, or exhortation, there is at least a likelihood that, as with British Coal workers, the use of dust masks would have started earlier than in fact it did.  As was done in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths’s</span> cases, there will be an adjustment for respirator factor indicated in the discussion of the individual cases later in this judgment.  </p>

The technique requires maximal inhalation followed by forced maximal expiration.  The volume exhaled after defined periods, and the flow rate at various percentages of lung volumes, can then be, measured.  The measure (which) is most frequently referred to in this litigation is the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second following a deep breath in (FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:10pt">1</span>).  This measure is more reproducible than others, it is a simple quick procedure which does, however, require the full co-operation of the subject if its result is to be reliable.  FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:10pt">1</span> is a measure which shows some correlation with both disability and prognosis in chronic obstructive airways disease cases.  Another measure is the total volume of air which can be exhaled during the forced expiration following a deep breath in, this is the forced vital capacity (FVC).  The ratio FEV<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:10pt">1</span><span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">:</span>FVC is termed the forced expiratory ratio and is used in some studies of lung function.

In every case in which he reported, his diagnosis or prognosis diminished the extent of the injury or disability of the individual claimant, when compared with the MAP report.

It is also relevant to note that each RS was trained specifically for the MAP exercise and, as the Guidance Notes made clear, will have been conscious that he was not reporting in the interests of one party to litigation.  His was a unique role, impressed as he would have been that it was his decision, rather than that of a judge, which would determine the medical outcome of the case of the patient (claimant) upon whom he would be reporting.  The RS was, nevertheless, expected to use his clinical experience and bring his ordinary clinical techniques into the performance of his duties in connection with the MAP.  In approaching the matter, thus, I have not overlooked the fact that all expert and professional witnesses in unitary litigation have now expressly to have regard to their duty to the Court.  It is also a factor, which should not be overlooked, that the time which is available to a RS engaged in the MAP is of necessity limited and he may be required to peruse many pages of more or less easily legible medical records.  These will have been scanned onto a disc and made available to be read by him on screen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is to be regretted that the same observation cannot be made of the contribution in these proceedings made by Dr Stenton.  Quite properly, from the point of view of the Third Party, it was important that there should be an examination of the individual performance of the respiratory specialists who had reported on the individual live Lead Claimants and, in the case of the deceased Claimants, the documents which were available for consideration, and whose examinations might eventually lead to an award of compensation.  Again, as a generality, Dr Stenton’s approach was not as impartial as the Court has reason to expect.  As a witness, he had a tendency to be didactic and to argue the case rather than to be content with reporting his findings and opinion.  Some of his responses to cross-examination were lacking in credibility and came close to being overtly partial, notwithstanding his self-acknowledged duty to the Court. Moreover there were numerous instances of Dr Stenton being internally inconsistent in his approach to the evaluation of the evidence not only in the same case but also as between one case and another.  A particular weakness of Dr Stenton’s approach to the individual cases was the manner in which he treated lung function test  (LFT) results.  It appeared to be common ground between all RSs, who commented upon them, other than Dr Stenton, that in addition to the actual numerical flow readings obtained in the testing process, there was also considerable value to be attached to the tracings of the flow volumes (“flow volume loops”).  Dr Stenton could, or, would not accept that this was so.  In turning his face away from consideration of the tracings, I am confident that Dr Stenton placed himself at an unnecessary disadvantage.</p>

Dr Moore-Gillon, who had not had the advantage of examining any of the live claimants, performed a valuable function, in effect, of auditing the MAPs as well as the reports which Dr Stenton had prepared in the case of all claimants.  Some objection was raised to the admissibility of his acting as a ‘referee’ in this manner.  It is an objection which I find to have been without merit.</p>

As already noted, the challenge to the individual MAPs was to the validity of the results and opinions recorded on the MAP form in each case, which were later transferred to IRISC for the purposes of completion of the assessment process.  With but one exception, as to which see in the individual claims, I have without hesitation preferred the MAP reports and the oral evidence given by the RSs to any produced or testified evidence by Dr Stenton.  The exception is the case of Mr Broad, where Dr Jarad missed references to evidence of some asthmatic disability in the massive quantity of records which existed in his case.  These were only more or less legible.  The omission is understandable, but, as will be seen, must be considered a factor which vitiates, his opinion and finding, to some limited extent.</p>

This finding led to considerable debate about the true interpretation of those results.  Later, Dr Stenton obtained his own LFTs.  It is a fact that the numerical and trace reports obtained on behalf of Dr Stenton supported Dr Lee’s tentative diagnosis of COPD.  Both sets of LFTs demonstrated an element of reversibility after bronchodilator, a finding which provided some support for the diagnosis of asthma, embraced by Dr Stenton.  An historical fact is that, in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Griffiths</span> there was no finding of liability against British Coal in respect of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">causation</span> of asthma, it was otherwise for exacerbation of asthma.  Interestingly Dr Stenton commented that the tests performed at his request were consistent with the presence of COPD, although he rejected that as a diagnosis, subject to the proviso that if the MAP LFTs had not been properly carried out, his conclusion that there was no COPD might have to be revised.  Dr Moore-Gillon interpreted Dr Stenton’s report as not rejecting entirely Dr Lee’s diagnosis but only on the basis of balance of probability.  This turned out to be an erroneous conclusion, since, in evidence, Dr Stenton said that if a specialist is looking for COPD, what he would normally expect to find is lung volumes which are elevated and gas transfer which is reduced because of the associated emphysema.  That was not always the case but most men with COPD have some degree of emphysema and impaired gas transfer.  Standing back and looking at Dr Lee’s results and applying the diagnostic criteria for COPD, Dr Stenton said that Dr Lee could not properly have made the diagnosis which he did; 13:13:18.  Dr Lee and Dr Moore-Gillon were both of the opinion that both series of tests, the first although somewhat imperfect, did provide some evidence of an obstructive defect.  Dr Lee recorded in the MAP report:</p>

Despite the absence of entries in the general practitioner records, or elsewhere, indicating that Mr Benyo had ever suffered from asthma, such was Dr Stenton’s diagnosis recorded in his second report, by which he stood when giving evidence.  The real problem for Dr Stenton was that, when LFTs were carried out for the purposes of his second report, they demonstrated airflow obstruction by reduced FEV1/FVC ratio with only a modest reversibility after bronchodilator.  He was constrained to agree under cross-examination that the flow volume loops showed traces of obstructive disease but, when “taken in isolation”, these were of no value.  Both Dr Lee and Dr Moore-Gillon agreed that the flow volume loops produced in the MAP LFTs showed some concavity, which was suggestive of airflow obstruction.  Dr Stenton was reluctant to direct his attention to the traces obtained on that occasion and confined the basis of his opinion forming to the numerical results alone.  His argumentative characteristic was much in evidence in the passage of his cross-examination at 13;100:17 through to 13:120:25.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">What this part of the report signally failed to address was the cause of the reported breathlessness on walking.  If the diagnosis of asthma is rejected, as it has been, and if the shortness of breath on walking is genuine and only rarely affected by angina, it is not possible on the evidence to discount the opinion expressed by Dr Lee in his MAP report that it was caused, in substantial part at least, by COPD.  The simple answer to the argument encapsulated in paragraph 56 of Dr Stenton’s report (above), is that the human lung has a substantial reserve capacity which enables it to lose its reserve before any symptoms become apparent.  Thus normal, or apparently normal function with an absence of complaints of respiratory symptoms in the period 1981 to 1983 is not inconsistent with some already existing, but symptom free, loss of lung function.  It can be said that the letter from Barnsley Hospital in 1987, is not inconsistent with this evaluation of the evidence.  Therefore, Dr Lee’s diagnosis is acceptable on this point.  </span>

As it happens, a similar point was raised with regard to Dr Ledson who reported in the case of Mr Owen (deceased).  I do not propose to dwell on these points since, in my judgment, they are not worthy of elaborate discussion.  What has happened is that each of the two doctors agreed under cross-examination, and in answer to questions which were themselves leading, that they had given the “benefit of the doubt” to the patient whom they were examining.  But that is only a valid criticism of their evidence if those answers are taken out of context.  On a fair reading of their evidence as a whole, I am quite satisfied that they did not disregard the requirement in the CHA that they had to reach their conclusions on the balance of probabilities.  I am confident that that was how they had approached the matter.</p>

In his first report, made at a time when the only LFTs available to him were those obtained as part of the MAP, Dr Stenton had recorded his view that when airflow obstruction is caused by COPD it is generally accompanied by a reduction in gas transfer, but that when it was caused by asthma it is mildly increased or normal.  When tests were carried out on his behalf, a low gas transfer result was obtained, but this he sought to explain on the suggested basis that there had been an underestimate of the alveolar volume – a defect of which there had never been any evidence.  In paragraph 42 of his second report (<span style="font-weight:bold">G p22</span>), Dr Stenton accepted that the majority of Mr Broad’s disability was caused by airways disease.  He had, however, obtained a history that Mr Broad had started to complain of respiratory symptoms when he was in his 30’s and which had gradually worsened.  Dr Stenton observed that there were no clear features to indicate asthma and that although the gas transfer was low, it was “probably artefactual” due to the underestimate of alveolar volume.  He went on to discuss the difficulty of apportioning disability between two disease processes which might be present and (paragraph 42) continued:</p>

The remainder can be attributed to the fixed component which could be due to either asthma or COPD.  My preference is to attribute it to the disease process that is known from the lung function tests to be present (ie asthma) rather than to a disease process that might be present (ie COPD).  It could reasonably be held that in the absence of any further information that it should be apportioned equally between asthma and COPD but that to a large extent depends on the a priori probability of someone like Mr Broad having COPD.</p>

The examining doctor for the MAP was Dr Cooke whose findings were that both chronic bronchitis and COPD were present.  There was 30 per cent disability resulting solely from COPD.  Life expectancy was reduced by some 7 years.  Dr Stenton concluded that chronic bronchitis was diagnosed without adequate corroboration in the medical records.  As a matter of fact this was demonstrated to be incorrect from the various references which exist in the medical notes.   The history of smoking was incorrect and the assessment of disability was too great.  He assessed the total disability at 10 to 20 per cent.  In essence this part of the dispute is readily solved by reference to the disability chart in the CHA which rates, at 30 per cent, a lung function impairment as moderate when:</p>

In my judgment, the downwards adjustment which Dr Cooke made from a possible 40 per cent to 30 percent was entirely fair and justified.  Dr Stenton’s rigid adherence to a position which could not be defended is plain from the above exchanges.  Insofar as there was a challenge to the estimate of life expectancy, this was settled by reference to the tables which are to be found at p193, 194 and 200 of the CHA.  Dr Stenton was, however prepared to accept that if Dr Cooke’s assessment of Mr Brown’s lung function was correct, then he would not disagree with the reduction in life expectancy.  As I have indicated, I do not find Dr Stenton’s opinion to be acceptable in this instance.  Dr Moore-Gillon was in broad agreement with Dr Cooke.</p>

Of more relevance, was Dr Stenton’s stance in relation to the finding, on the LFTs which were performed at his request, that the low lung volumes “suggest an additional disease process the nature of which is unclear”. At 14:87:4, Dr Stenton was asked about this passage during cross-examination.  It proceeded thus:</p>

Both Drs Stenton and Moore-Gillon would have included such a diagnosis.  Dr Stenton’s view <span style="font-weight:bold">F66¶86 </span>was that there was “enough evidence to establish a diagnosis of COPD on the balance of probabilities.  The diagnosis is not certain … There was moderate reversibility of the airflow obstruction … The impaired gas transfer would not be expected with asthma …”.  He then raised the possibility of there being another disease process present; see above which, having regard to that exchange and Dr Moore-Gillon’s opinion, I totally reject.  Dr Stenton was firm in his opinion, by the time he gave oral evidence, that “an element of Mr Kulcsar’s condition was asthma” and that he fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for that condition under the CHA.  Dr Moore-Gillon pointed out that this last comment was not strictly accurate, in that the conditions noted were those, in the absence of which the diagnosis should <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> be made, rather than that if those conditions were present it <span style="text-decoration:underline">should</span> be made.  Additionally, Dr Moore-Gillon observed that although he would himself have made a diagnosis of asthma, he did not consider that such omission on the part of Dr Qureshi was outside the scope of a reasonable diagnosis.  The Court is not here concerned with the question “did, or did not, Mr Kulcsar suffer from asthma?”.  Rather was the question whether the diagnosis indicated either an error of approach, to the application of the CHA Guidelines, or of the Guidelines themselves.</p>

Although Dr Stenton adhered to his estimate of the equal apportionment to disability of COPD and depression, he nevertheless agreed that the latter condition made no contribution to the respiratory condition; (14:128-129).

It was the fact that Dr Morrell had not answered question 33 on the MAP form, which provided the opportunity to record the existence of a co-morbid condition which did not impact on the Deceased’s breathlessness. It was Dr Morrell’s view that Mr Taylor’s psychiatric condition was one which fluctuated and did not, therefore, confine him to his home all the time, so the COPD at those times was indisputably the disabling condition. It was further Dr Morrell’s opinion that the fact that Mr Taylor for much of the time did not venture from his house or attend to household matters was volitional on his part, rather than due to his psychiatric disability.  </p>

It is even a possibility that the psychiatric symptoms were caused or exacerbated by the severity of the effects of his COPD.  Expressly, however, I do not base my decision on this point.  It is a point worthy of more than passing interest, as to the general efficacy of the assessment process within IRISC, that when this claim was processed, the assessor reduced the claim for loss of earnings by 50 per cent due to the presence of some other co-morbid condition; see <span style="font-weight:bold">A core p117, 120</span> as an exercise of discretion.  The co-morbidity in question was not the psychiatric condition, however, but a totally unrelated hernia.  It was common ground between the parties, by the end of the case that, this latter condition had no real effect on the extent of Mr Taylor’s disability and arguably it was a hard decision taken by the assessor.  However, the submission was that the fact that the MAP form did not alert IRISC to the disability caused by depression meant that a claim in respect of loss of earnings was allowed when it would not otherwise have done.  Had the Notes for Guidance required the RS to identify the existence of a co-morbid non-respiratory condition on the MAP form, then it was submitted that there would have been no claims for loss of earnings, services or the like.  That was a defect in the CHA, but has now been corrected.  As to the generic point which the Third Party make in this case, see under <span style="font-weight:bold">The legal effect of the CHA</span>, above.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Clifton explained in his oral evidence how he had arrived at the equal division between COPD and asthma.  The important factor here is that the CHA disability Rating Scale only moves in steps of 10 per cent (<span style="font-weight:bold">O5 p189</span>).  In theory, a reading of 2 per cent would have to be rated at 10 per cent.  But as Dr Clifton observed, when you reach low percentages in the range from 2 to 6 “it gets rather difficult when you are getting down to small numbers like that.”  He was challenged that he had given Mr Mellor the benefit of the doubt at each stage of his analysis so that he had not only diagnosed COPD but had also rated it at 10 per cent.  His reply was:</p>

He was constrained to agree that they were similar and were “consistent with” rather than “typical of” COPD.  When shown the results from his own LFTs he agreed that they did show over-inflation and was unable to explain why he had reported otherwise.  Dr Stenton sought to say that the reference in his report to this feature was “redundant”.  In what has by now become a typical response of Dr Stenton to a fair question, the following exchange took place: (14:141:15)</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Dr Stenton was evidently unwilling or unable to appreciate the dilemma created by the stepped percentage ratings in the Rating Scale and did not address that in his evidence.  Once again, I did not find Dr Stenton’s evidence to be of assistance in reaching my decision on this issue.  Dr Clifton was, self-confessedly, cautious in his approach to diagnosis.  The extract from his evidence quoted above, persuades me that he fully understood the nature of the determination which was required from him.  I am confident that he would not have made the diagnosis of COPD 10 per cent, if the real value was less than 5 per cent.  After that it was a question of his judgment whether and if so how it should have been rated.  Dr Moore-Gillon, although not making the same diagnosis himself, believed that Dr Clifton’s diagnosis was one which was open to a reasonable RS.</span>

It should be remembered that, although the system worked in Mr Mellor’s favour on this occasion, there are just as likely to be other occasions when it works the other way and a claimant does not receive a valuation based on, say, a 14 percent rating, but only to the next lowest band.  That is in the nature of any schemed system.</p>

I have a standard series of questions, the exact wording may vary slightly but basically it comes down to: when you were working as a miner, did you have a cough and would you be coughing up phlegm?  In Mr Mellor's case, presumably he would answer yes, and I would then ask questions as to for how long, would this be occasionally or would it tend to be all year round.  And if they say that it was all year round, then I would accept that.  If they would say only occasionally or for a few months of the year, then I would ask them how many months a year, just in the winter months, for how many months in the winter?    </p>

I certainly tried to supplement it as to whether or not the cough got better, worse or stayed the same when they left mining, trying      to give me some idea as to whether or not this was more than usual, especially somebody like Mr Mellor who has been a non-smoker.  So, with only mild symptoms, I would expect his symptoms to very much settle when he left the employment and those are the answers that he gave me.</p>

Indeed they are urged not to by the Guidance Notes.  The criticism which was levelled at Dr Clifton’s method of eliciting the answers from Mr Mellor, which enabled his diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, was in my judgment entirely misplaced.  The reasons for this conclusion appear most clearly from the sequence of the cross-examination of Dr Clifton quoted in full above.  Dr Moore-Gillon in his evidence did not seek to make any adverse comment about such a method of history taking.</p>

As has already been seen, the Third Party challenged Dr Lee’s MAP and his conclusion in their entirety. The contention was that there was no relevant injury since none of the disability was due to either chronic bronchitis or COPD. In any event, to the extent that this claimant had any requirement for others to perform services for him, this was due to the presence of osteo-arthritis in the left knee and vibration white finger (VWF). The summary of Dr Stenton’s conclusion on lung function tests which were performed at his request were that they showed:</span>

In addition to the tasks of bringing supplies up to the face of the heading, Mr Benyo’s other main occupation was the creation of manholes, either by the use of pneumatic picks or by bore and fire.  From time to time, Mr Benyo also assisted the heading team to install arches and muck out either by hand or the use of Eimcos.  On some occasions, also, Mr Benyo directed the driver of the heading machine where to cut.  This was unquestionably dusty work.</span>

But they include its lack of precision, the attitude of some witnesses was stridently against the employment of contractors (whether they had been employed by them or not) and their evidence was coloured accordingly.  Much of the evidence was contradictory.   Because a large number of witnesses had their evidence read into the proceedings and were not exposed to oral examination it would have been impossible to have attempted to reconcile all the many conflicting points which arose.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The Third Party challenged the assessment of 50 per cent disability made by Dr Jarad, basing their submissions on the report of Dr Stenton.  The overall assessment was 60 per cent, comprising chronic bronchitis and COPD combined at 20 per cent, asthma 30 per cent and obesity 10 per cent.  Since the respiratory disability for the qualifying conditions for an award under the CHA in respect of special damages and future losses, namely 30 per cent, was not reached, the other claims fell away. General damages were also reduced in order to reflect the lower qualifying level of disability. Reliance was also placed on the presence of co-morbid non-respiratory conditions, notably VWF.  The supposed relevance of this was that the claims for loss of services past and future were properly attributable to this condition rather than respiratory disability.  There is the possibility that that submission could have been correct. But it was not explored in evidence with any of the medical witnesses who gave oral evidence before me.  It would be quite wrong for the court to act on bare submission when this is a matter which could and should have been challenged in evidence.  On a fifty per cent disability from COPD the claim under this head has the appearance of reasonableness.  I reject the Third Party's submissions on this point.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Treforgan</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.  For reasons which will emerge, I am satisfied that conditions in this pit were significantly worse than the average for South Wales.  A compelling reason to justify this finding is that there appears to have been a poor exercise of authority by the deputies, who permitted inadequate dust suppression practices on the part of the Contractors. There was dry drilling in stone, on occasions.  Coal was always drilled dry and was a prolific source of dust.  Attempts were made to suppress dust by the use of hand held water baggings, but this was not effective since the water used to run off the coal or the muck.  The headings were often low, which led to the practice of men not withdrawing to a safe distance when firing took place -this was not always carried out by the deputy, but on occasion by the contractors themselves as they were not prepared to wait for him to attend for the purpose - after firing, contractors men frequently returned to the face in advance of the deputy and certainly before the plug of fume and dust had passed by.  There was frequent use of Eimcos for the purpose of mucking out, which were never equipped with sprays.  There was no evidence of attempts to wet the contents of the bucket before tipping, which was not controlled, in the sense of the bucket being gently lowered before tipping.  The notion that it would have been otherwise, when the emphasis from the evidence is of men who were deeply concerned about working so as to achieve maximum bonus was overwhelming.  It also seems faintly incredible, as well as inconsistent with the witness M Davies who described how they were throwing (the muck over the top of the Eimco, it was “going bang onto the belt”.  There was some evidence that the muck pile would be watered before the Eimco was used to muck out.  Again, the effectiveness of this depended on whether the water would enter the pile or not.  The evidence was also of poor housekeeping, in that much unnecessary dust was caused during the mucking out process.  </span>

This means that it becomes thirty five per cent of the whole during this period.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, the evidence was that wet drilling of stone was the general rule.  However there were a number of occasions when blunt picks would be used.  The men used them for "as long as possible".  There was strong evidence that men used to return to the face of the heading very soon after the shots had been fired.  Equally, the evidence in respect of poor housekeeping was particularly powerful.  While the water supply was not always as consistent as it should have been, there was evidence that such was the pressure to complete the work in the headings that work would continue whether the supply was adequate or not.  Eimcos were equipped with sprays, but these did not by any means remain operational.  They were subject to frequent damage in daily use.  There was frequent spillage and there was no high priority to clear it up.  This was another potent source of dust which falls within the general description of poor housekeeping.  Sprays were not universally used on the conveyors except at the point where a contractor's conveyor discharged onto a British Coal conveyor.  These too provided unnecessary sources of dust.  Mr Broad did not have such a poor view of the conditions where he was working as did some of the other witnesses - Boyles, Prosser, Forrest.  It was his view that Nantgarw was a "dampish sort of pit".  There were occasions when not only overtime was worked, but also back to back shifts.  This form of working influences the total dust burden of the individual.  During this period, there is no reason to believe that conditions were any worse than the South Wales average, which was among the top three areas in the country; see Schedule 11.</span>

In the final five years, Mr Broad was back in headings.  Loading out was by means of a slusher and Eimco which had no known means of water suppression and was, by common consent a dusty operation.  He described the conditions as having been "pretty bad … not good, it was medium".  Given that for the first year or so conditions were reasonably good, a fair assessment is that over the full period at this pit, average conditions for South Wales obtained.   </span>

There is an issue whether Mr Brown, even if he had been urged to wear a dust mask would ever have done so.  His oral evidence was to the effect that he chewed tobacco, which was a habit that made it necessary for him to spit from time to time. This would have made the wearing of a respirator impracticable.  So it was argued that it was inappropriate for respirator correction to have been applied in his case.  In his evidence, Mr Brown was adamant that he would never have worn a respirator even if he had been urged to do so. While it would be foolhardy not to respect this stated position, in my judgment, however, it should not be taken at face value.  As the history of respirator usage has demonstrated, not only in this litigation but also in </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Griffiths</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, it was possible for this reluctance to use a respirator to be overcome by the use of persuasion and education.  In re-examination, Mr Brown gave some revealing answers on this topic (9:107:25)</span>

The Third Party also contended that VWF would have made Mr Brown dependent on services in any event.  If allowances were made to reflect these factors, the result would be that only the sum of £4,164.60 was recoverable.

Insofar as the argument on VWF was concerned, here too there was an absence of any challenge to the evidence given by Dr Cooke as to the assessment of disability by reliance on the presence of VWF.  Furthermore, Mr Brown's evidence was that the trouble, which he suffered in relation to this condition, was periodic in nature and only affected him in cold weather. There was no basis for the contention that a condition of this kind should have been included in the MAP, as a co-morbid non-respiratory condition that impacted on overall disability.  It was well within the region of a reasonable MAP report for it not to have been included.  There is no basis, on this account, why to the award should not stand as a reasonable estimate of Mr Brown’s damages.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Brown worked for British Coal for a period of eighteen years and for Contractors for 23 years.  It is not surprising, then, that there were a large number of witnesses whose evidence is before the Court in relation to his case.  It can be seen, from the chart of his employment by Contractors, that a substantial part of his employment was spent in bore and fire headings.  The evidence in relation to excess dust can be summarised as having been: excessive dry drilling, inadequate provision and maintenance of ventilation ducting (especially during the period of seven years at </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Wheldale</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">), the use of Dosco road heading machines in strata for which they were unsuitable with inadequate water suppression, the use of jigger picks without water suppression, the use of Eimcos for loading out without working sprays.  There was also evidence that there was frequently an early return to the face after shotfiring, which the deputies did nothing to prevent.  A Mr Liversidge worked with Mr Brown at </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Wheldale</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> and </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Silverwood</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.  He confirmed that dust levels were high and uncomfortable when mucking out, whether by hand or the use of Eimcos.  Another witness, Mr Roper, also worked at </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Silverwood</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.  He described heavy dust during drilling and the use of slushers while mucking out.  At </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, where Mr Brown spent the last seven years as a miner, conditions are known to have been poor.  In Dr Ford's paper </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">in the period October to December 1990 in the J31X, routine samples showed dust levels at 8.1 and quartz 0.74 mg/m</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">3</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.  This was in a heading in which it is known that Amco were operating; see </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">.  So also at Wistow, in the Main south Return and the B South Trunk in the same period readings of 15.7, 3.2, 5.2 and 0.35 respectively were taken; see </span>

The future losses included loss of earning and pension, services, nursing mobility and other items of trifling amounts.  Mr Ellis's claim was adjusted by the application of a respirator factor (capped) of 18.47.  As he was an habitual wearer of a dust mask, it is far from clear to me why this adjustment was made.  It ought not to have been and his claim should be adjusted accordingly.  Again, if the parties are unable to agree upon the extent of this adjustment, the matter must be referred to me for decision.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The Third Party challenged the assessment on the basis that Mr Ellis became significantly depressed such that he became unfit for work by about 1 July 1997. The Third Party also takes into account the fact that this claimant suffered from VWF and osteo-arthritis in his neck and back. In the result the loss of earnings claim would have been reduced to £42,585.35. Similarly, the pension loss would have been reduced, to an unspecified extent, because of the early retirement from work, which was unconnected with COPD. The only medical issue between the parties was whether or not depression was the real or dominant reason for the claimant's decision to cease work in 1997.  The other areas of dispute were in relation to VWF and the extent to which this impacted on his daily life and the arthritis of shoulder and neck.  Much reliance was placed by the Third Party on a note made on a Social Services form which purported to show that </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">the</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> (only) reason why Mr Ellis had not attended for a medical examination was because of his depression and arthritis.  When he came to give evidence, Mr Ellis volunteered that his chest was another reason why he had not attended.  As I have already made my findings on the medical issues in this case, it remains for me to indicate that I am not satisfied that the condition of VWF has contributed to the need for services within the house, any more than the arthritis, which is not disabling to any significant degree.</span>

Mucking out was by means of a side tipping Eimco.  Sprays were fitted but frequently were damaged.  Repairs were only carried out at the week end.  This was a pit at which, probably more than any other, extended hours were worked, particularly by Mr Ellis.  Seven day weeks were worked and sometimes he worked as many as 14 hours in a day.

Because men were largely paid on a yardage basis, there was an incentive to go back in the heading before the dust and fume had returned to tolerable levels.  No evidence was given, or suggestion made, why this deplorable and repetitive state of affairs should have been allowed to persist year in and year out.  This seems to have been accepted as the norm in South Wales.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">There are, in this case reasons why, during the period of Mr Ellis's employment by Contractors, his exposure to dust should have been assessed as not conforming to the average.  Indeed I would assess that of the period between 1964 (</span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Penallta</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> with NCB) and 1991 (</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> with AMCO) his exposure would have been in total at least twentyfive percent greater than the area average.  But this should not disturb the generic distribution of the claim between British Coal and the contractors, because on the evidence I am not satisfied that either was any better than the other in relation to the generation and suppression of tortious levels of respirable dust.</span>

The contention was that this figure should have been 20 per cent and the balance of 30 per cent was attributable to co-morbid conditions of osteo-arthritis of the hip and asthma. The consequences, if this position was correct, were that the sum ought properly to have been limited to £2,336.19.  I have already said why the Third Party's position on the medical assessment has had to be rejected.  It remains to consider the issue of a non-respiratory co-morbid condition and whether this should have led to any reduction in his award.  Dr Qureshi was, I am satisfied a meticulous and careful specialist.  He was challenged in cross-examination as to whether the musculo-skeletal conditions ought not to have found there way into the assessment of disability.

He was called by the Defendants, but with a degree of reluctance, since there was accurate anticipation that he would not be likely to advance their case against the Third Party.  He was a witness who at all times wore a dust mask, once they had become available and who attended to matters of housekeeping in his headings.  However, there was abundant evidence of the use of drills not equipped or used with water suppression.  This was of particular importance, given that the use of drills in this way preceded the time in the 1970s when his use of a dust mask commenced.  His evidence was also to the effect that loading out muck was always accompanied by the generation of high dust levels.  It should also be recorded that Mr Kulcsar was proud of his record with regard to the speed at which his work used to progress.  It is inevitable that, if there is an accent on speed of advance, there will be a greater production of dust than would otherwise be the case.  It was also clear from his own evidence that there were occasions when he continued work in the heading for which he was responsible when the ventilation bagging was in a damaged condition.  In his impatience to get on with the work “the job had to go on [before new baggings could be obtained] in the meantime, so we would suffer the dust”; see his statement </span>

The disability attributed to COPD was limited to 20 per cent and it did not contribute to Mr Owen’s death. The Third Party put forward the figure of £1,982.96 as the reasonable valuation of this claim.  A respirator correction factor (progressively capped) was applied in this case of 13.88.</span>

Because of the numbers of pits and length of service many of the witnesses available to provide some evidence of his working conditions had also provided evidence in others of the lead claims.  What does distinguish his case is that for the last five years of his work he was employed in supervisory duties rather than at the face.  During the early part of his work with Contractors, there is no reasons to suppose that his exposure to respirable dust  was other than in accordance with the average for those in his area.

Because of the spread of his working places and the number of coincidental witnesses in pits where and when he worked, I am confident that it would be quite unrealistic to have treated his case in this manner.  He is properly to be treated, subject to the last 5 years of his working history as conforming to average conditions.  There is no demonstrable error in the manner in which his case was dealt with as a special case within a modified approach to the CHA.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The past losses included loss of earnings with benefits in kind, loss of redundancy pay, services, nursing and funeral expenses. The loss of earnings figure was reduced by 50 per cent to reflect that the ill health retirement certificate listed COPD and the incisional hernia as the reasons for ill health retirement.  This provides a further example of the manner in which, in practice, the CHA was effectively operated by IRISC.  The respirator correction (progressively capped) in this case amounted to 23.88 per cent and thus reflected the period of 27 years as his working life.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The Third Party’s position was that it could agree the figure of 80 per cent respiratory disability. However, due to the co-morbid condition of depression, the figure should be reduced to 70 per cent. In addition, the third party relied upon the presence of an incisional hernia as having been one of the causes of Mr Taylor giving up work.  Since the loss of earnings was reduced by 50 per cent to take this factor into account, there is not further point to be made about this feature of the case.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In this case, as with the case of the late Mr Owen, there was a dearth of direct evidence in regard to conditions under which he worked.  He is described as a haulage worker.  But, since he was employed by Contractors, the reasonable inference is that he was actually employed on supplies or as a back-up man.  There were only three witnesses who provided any evidence about the conditions at </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:12pt">Bevercotes</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">, they were Messrs Davie, Adams, Marshall and Hayes.  The evidence, which any of these witnesses could give, was of a generic character since none ever claimed to have worked with the late Mr Taylor.  So it was that the Third Party submitted that there was insufficient evidence to form the foundation of any case on behalf of Taylor.  On the other hand, as their evidence, which was all read into the proceedings, conformed so well with other evidence that was already before the court, there is no reason why it should not be accepted.  With some variation it confirmed the generic case which the Defendants were making against the Third Party.  It is not necessary that I should review it in any detail.  It is sufficient for me to state that I am satisfied that the generic case is made out. </span>

It is consistent in its awards so that any one claimant can make a ready comparison of his award with another, which is of the same general character.  It is also a scheme which limits the cost of making awards to a reasonable amount, it makes minimum demands on resources and meets the objectives set out in the CPR.  The scheme is also subject to thorough and effective audit in respect of its multi-faceted operations.  It is also subject to judicial control and review.  There is scope for review of the operation of the scheme as and when it becomes apparent that it is failing to meet its objectives.  Such amendments as are then proposed are subject to the approval of the Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold">B.  </span>The calculation of the awards under the CHA replicates common law principles of awards of damages, albeit that because of the incorporation of schemed elements in the assessment process it does not repeat with exactitude all the principles that have been laid down.  There will be occasions when awards may exceed, in certain elements, what the common law would have allowed.  There will be others when the awards will be below what the common law would have allowed.  Across all awards, there is no reason to doubt that the total will be "somewhere around" what the common law would have given.  Importantly, because of the administrative nature of the scheme, its cost of operation will be but a fraction of the cost of unitary actions, which the Courts would not have been able to handle in the numbers in which claims are being made.</p>

The Defendants are entitled to claim contribution from the Third Party on the basis of awards made under that scheme.  Subject to any apparent operational errors by the assessors or RSs, it is not necessary for there to be any further investigation of a claim made by or on behalf of a miner or former miner who worked for the Contractors.  It follows that the Defendants can safely continue to settle claims made under the CHA on the same basis as heretofore. </p>

The Third Party had given no independent thought to the question whether or not British Coal complied with their obligations under statute and the Regulations which constrained a tight safety regime underground.  There was ample published material which was available to the Third Party, as reasonably informed employers, to demonstrate that British Coal was failing to comply with its statutory obligations in regard to the necessity of minimising dust.</p>
