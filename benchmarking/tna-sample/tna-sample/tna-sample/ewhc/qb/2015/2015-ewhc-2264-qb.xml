	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">This group litigation involves numerous similar claims for damages for personal injuries, in the torts of negligence and public nuisance, brought by 16,626 Claimants arising out of a major fire at the Defendant’s particle board manufacturing plant at Knowsley Industrial Park, Kirkby commencing on Thursday 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011, at approximately 17:30. The seat of the fire was bunker no. 1 in the Woodyard building at the plant, but the fire spread to all six bunkers in the building, causing a very substantial plume of smoke, fumes, associated chemicals, and particulate matter to issue forth into the surrounding area. In due course, most of the flammable contents of the building were consumed in the fire. The Claimants, all of whom either lived or worked in the neighbouring area or near the plant, say that they were exposed to quantities of smoke sufficient to cause them personal injuries: in particular, a range of symptoms variously involving the respiratory tract, the eye, and the skin; and in some cases headache and more general debility. Fortunately, no one has alleged symptoms of any permanence, and it is accepted that these are low-value claims. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Since a Group Litigation Order was made in this case by Hamblen J on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012, the issues between the parties have narrowed considerably. By its Group Defence filed on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2013, the Defendant admitted breach of duty in respect of those who might foreseeably suffer injury in consequence of exposure to the smoke. This admission has removed a layer of evidential exploration, and concomitant potential complexity, from the scope of the litigation. Both the existence and causation of actionable injury remain hotly disputed. </p>

It is unnecessary to take time in the reformulation of the common issues in this introductory section of my judgment. The Skeleton Arguments filed at the beginning of this trial have served to stake out the battleground, and indeed during the course of the 18 day hearing a number of issues either disappeared altogether or the parties’ respective positions in relation to them converged. I should also record that at a late stage in this litigation an application was made to vary the GLO issues to enable the Claimants to pursue nuisance and annoyance claims which differed from, or fell short of being, claims for damages for personal injuries, but I refused that application because it came far too late and the Defendant had all along been meeting these claims on the basis that they were solely claims for personal injury damages – see, for example, the original GLO issues as set out in the Order of Hamblen J. </p>

The Kirkby plant opened in July 2000 and ceased production on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012. At the time of the fire, the plant operated for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and produced approximately 400,000m³ of chipboard product a year. Back in 2000, virgin wood was mainly used, but by 2011 the Defendant’s evidence was that 99% of the raw material was recycled wood – with a lesser moisture content and a greater degree of contamination from sundry extraneous matter such as plastic, metal, glass, concrete and general detritus. The use of recycled wood also magnified the inherent fire risk consequent on the storage of a dry, dusty product in a relatively closed environment, and I heard evidence of a significant number of fires before the incident presently under scrutiny. In my view, it is unnecessary to examine the quantum of that risk, and the reasonableness of the Defendant’s steps to minimise it, because breach of duty is not in issue. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The parties called a number of witnesses to explain the workings and operation of the plant. By way of summary, and avoiding matters of controversy at this stage, external suppliers delivered the recycled woodchips to the plant in vehicles variously described as lorries, trucks or wagons. The capacity of these vehicles was up to 25 tonnes, but on average was in the region of 22 tonnes. Although the plant maintained a continuous operation throughout the week, the vast majority of deliveries took place during normal working hours with only around 4% of the total of 386 deliveries a week at weekends. According to the evidence of the Defendant’s quality control manager, Mr Mark Callaghan, incoming deliveries were weighed at the weighbridge and then directed to any one of three areas where, after visual inspection and the possibility of rejecting sub-standard consignments, the loads were taken off the vehicles to be introduced in due course into the Defendant’s processes. Aside from the external yard where considerable quantities of unprocessed woodchip may be seen on a number of photographs, the loads were either removed from the vehicles using massive hydraulic, tipping devices called Cometers, or were more straightforwardly unloaded onto the walking floor of the woodyard building. Thereafter, the loads underwent an initial cleaning process (the nature of which varied depending on the pathway taken) before woodchips (by now measuring between 1 and 80mm) were transferred, primarily by overhead conveyors, into any one of six concrete bunkers which were in the same building. These bunkers were contained in three separate silos aligned across the woodyard building in pairs of two. Simultaneously with the deposit of woodchip into the bunkers, this material was being withdrawn via a similar conveyor process (involving the use of a large screw at the bottom of each bunker) to be subjected to further cleansing and manufacturing processes “upstream”. </p>

Given the evidence of Mr Gregory Butler, which I consider in more detail below, it is unnecessary for me to address these peripheral disputes. I certainly have the impression of a plant which, at times, was dry and dusty, and the management of which may well have failed to take proactive steps to analyse the fire risk and to address it. However, these issues do not warrant close analysis, nor does the quite general and unspecific evidence about “dressed” loads and degree of contamination. Ultimately, there is convincing quantitative evidence upon which I am able safely to rely. </p>

The ultrasound level detector (the existence of which was revealed to the Claimants only very late in this litigation) was designed to measure the distance between the conveyor and the level of woodchip directly underneath. When the sensor detected that the level had attained a pre-set value, the conveyor moved along the bunker to another position before further deposits were effected. In this way the bunkers were filled, but not in such a manner that the woodchips were ever horizontally aligned within the plane formed by the tops of bunkers. The woodchips formed peaks and troughs. Had an experiment been carried out to ascertain the maximum capacity of the bunkers through this filling system, one would culminate with a pile of woodchips describing a “Toblerone” shape, with the peak at a level which matched the pre-set value on the sensor. Subject to some doubt as to the angle of incline of this tent shape, the maximum tonnage of each bunker calculated on this basis would have been in the region of 3,600 Te (the Claimant proposes 3,696 Te). However, this theoretical perfection could never be attained in practice, for several reasons. First, operational reasons within the plant would dictate the state of the bunkers, and there was no need for the bunkers to be as full as possible: as the operators all told me, they needed to be <span style="font-style:italic">“healthy”</span>. Secondly, it is apparent from the schematic at paragraph 12 as above that the system was not designed to create a uniform, even peak – hence the troughs to which a number of witnesses referred. Lastly, the process was dynamic in the sense that the bunkers were constantly being emptied via separate conveyors to enable the woodchips to enter the next stage in the process. </p>

Two issues arise: first, whether the data would in any event have thrown valuable light on the content of the bunkers, as opposed to the distance between the sensor and the “drop area” immediately below; and secondly, whether I should draw an inference adverse to the Defendant flowing from the nonretention of these data.

However, the supplementary witness statement of Mr Gregory Butler, the Defendant’s quality manager, supplies an analysis, via sampling data, of the average moisture and contamination levels over a five month period between January and May 2011; and his evidence, although tested, was not seriously challenged under cross-examination. Moreover, although the moisture values must be envisaged as reasonably accurate, I accept the Defendant’s contention that the recorded contamination levels in fact <span style="font-style:italic">overstate</span> the actual levels within the bunkers, because the samples were taken before the first cleaning process. In short, I proceed on the basis of data which cannot be significantly impugned, namely a moisture level of 20% and a contamination level of 0.8%. </p>

The Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (“MFRS”) was telephoned at 20:03, and fire-fighting personnel soon arrived at the plant. Apart from spraying water into the bunker, the strategy adopted was to remove as much woodchip material from the bunker as possible in order to reduce the actual and potential fire load.

The amount of smoke increased and the fire was soon spreading along the conveyors at a high level in the building. The senior fire officer within the woodyard building described the event as a “conflagration”. By 04:00, although the timings cannot be altogether precise, it seems from the evidence of the fire-fighting professionals on the ground that the fire had spread throughout the whole of the woodyard building. By 06:05, all six bunkers were recorded as being on fire, although it is possible that the ferocity of the fire had already encompassed these structures. At that stage the fire was a raging inferno and thick, black smoke was spewing from the roof of the woodyard building in substantial quantities. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is common ground that the fire went through three distinct stages or phases. The first stage started at about 17:30 on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June (the precise time matters not) and entailed a smouldering fire propagating slowly outwards from the origin, creating a “nest” of burnt and smouldering material. During this stage the heat that was generated by the process of combustion was sufficient to pre-heat woodchips in the vicinity, but insufficient to ignite the resulting pyrolysis products and cause flame. The first stage concluded between 03:35 and 03:40 on Friday 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. The transition between the first and the second stages occupied a number of minutes, and the second stage commenced at about 04:00. This was the fully developed, substantial fire involving in due course all six bunkers and other combustible materials within the woodyard building. Amongst the characteristics of this second stage were flame and black smoke. The fire transitioned into the third stage when the appearance and quantity of smoke reduced, and the residue materials were gradually consumed in a smouldering process characterised by “reverse propagation”. The parties are not in agreement as to the timing of this transition (which on any view must be somewhat imprecise), the Defendant averring that it occurred by about 10:00 on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, the Claimants by 14:30. Thereafter, the fire diminished in intensity as the residue within the bunkers was gradually consumed within the smoulder, with the MFRS permitting it to burn out in a controlled manner and not declaring the incident officially “closed” until 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011. By that point, there was very little left in the bunkers except for ash and similar residue. Despite the extent and intensity of the fire, only the woodyard building was involved. </p>

In order to achieve indicative values for the levels of exposure of the Test Claimants to relevant chemicals and particles at various times, the plume modellers require a range of data and information, including the relevant heat release rates and emission factors. The concept of a heat release rate is self-explanatory – other things being equal, the greater the rate, the higher the smoke plume travels and the more widely it disperses. The concept of an emission factor is less straightforward, and a full explanation appears under paragraph 92 below. The basic point is that these variables are fed into the computer programme used by the plume modellers.  They also need to know the wind speeds and directions at all material times (these are agreed), and finally they factor into their model other variables such as exit velocities, temperature, diameter and number of buildings (all of which variables are now also agreed). The parties are agreed that emission factors constitute the most important scientific issue in this litigation because they are so far apart in relation to it. </p>

In order to ascertain whether any individual Test Claimant may have suffered a potentially injurious exposure, a scientific approach would mandate that the raw exposure level predicted or indicated by the model be compared against known toxicological data for the chemicals and particles of interest. These data, to the extent that they are scientifically robust and substantiated at relatively low levels of exposure, will serve as a guide in determining whether any individual Test Claimant’s modelled exposure was above or below what might be described as a threshold level for potentially deleterious health effects.  </p>

Submissions were deployed as to the difference between the scientific and legal standards of proof, and I will need to address these in due course. However, at this stage of the analysis I should indicate that in my view purely scientific questions (e.g. the ascertainment of the appropriate heat release rates from given data by applying established formulae) can only be answered by applying scientific methods, within the context always of a civil trial: whereas science may require proximity to certainty, the law does not. To the extent that the heat release rates depend on the quantity of woodchips in the bunkers, I approach the issue by applying the traditional probabilistic standards familiar in civil litigation. To the extent that there is inherent uncertainty or imprecision in any given scientific method, this may be reflected in the overall assessment of whether any individual Test Claimant’s case is proved on the balance of probabilities. </p>

At a pre-trial review which took place on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015, the Claimants sought my permission to file and serve comparable evidence from Dr Phylaktou (I understand that he would also have assisted me on the issue of emission factors), but I refused permission and relief from sanctions, on the ground that it was far too late to adduce such evidence, and the smooth running of the trial would be seriously prejudiced. My detailed reasons appear in a separate transcript. Accordingly, the Claimants have no expert evidence addressing these issues, although they do rely on their modelling expert, Dr David Carruthers of Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants Ltd, to address emission factors and the issue of radiative heat loss away from the smoke plume (if a valid point, this would reduce the relevant heat release rates accordingly). Issues arise as to Dr Carruthers’ qualifications to deal with some of these issues. The Defendant has its own modelling expert, Mrs Angela Spanton of Envirobods, and the parties have experts in meteorology (as I have said, their evidence is agreed) and toxicology. In relation to this last discipline, the Claimants rely on the evidence of Professor Alastair Hay, who is an international authority in his subject, whereas the Defendant has called Mr David Shillito, who is not a toxicologist but a chemical engineer with, amongst other things, an environmental background. Mr Michael Redfern QC for the Claimants did not object to Mr Shillito’s contributions in this regard, nor did he object to him assisting the court on the issue of emission factors – a matter on which he is qualified to opine, although it might be said that the Defendant has exceeded its permitted quota of one engineer.  </p>

On the night of the fire, he could see what was in the bunkers, and they were 85%, maybe 90% full. Under cross-examination, Mr Poulson expanded on this evidence and said that he checked the level of the bunkers from the top of the gantry, because he was trying to find out the source of the fire. Yet, at paragraph 19 of his witness statement, Mr Poulson clearly stated that he was not on the overhead gantry on the night of the fire, but was there the day before. This is consistent with an earlier draft witness statement which was put to him in cross-examination. Mr Poulson tried to persuade me that he was <span style="font-style:italic">“at the top of the stairs”</span> rather than on the gantry itself. I did not believe him. Another point which weighs heavily against him is that the evidence he adduced to support his claim for damages for personal injuries was inconsistent, exaggerated and in some respects (e.g. the reference in his questionnaire to GP attendances) clearly untrue. I cannot accept Mr Redfern’s submission that issues of credibility bearing on Mr Poulson’s symptoms must be hermetically sealed from the credibility of his evidence relating to the bunker levels.

On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011 he was interviewed by Dr Jowett in relation to what he knew about the possible causes of the fire and the quantities in the bunkers. Dr Jowett kept a contemporaneous manuscript note and in my judgment was a particularly impressive witness: moderate, measured, and astute to answer the questions put to him. The reason why Dr Jowett took the trouble to speak to Mr Pybis was because he was the last person to check the contents of the bunkers at approximately 18:50 on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Mr Pybis gave Dr Jowett valuable information as to the profile of the woodchips in bunker no. 1, and the manuscript diagram Dr Jowett was able to draw was clearly based solely on that intelligence. When Dr Jowett’s detailed notes were put to Mr Pybis in cross-examination, he agreed that they were largely accurate, save as to the timing of the last inspection (in relation to his dinner break) and the tonnages Dr Jowett recorded in relation to the bunkers. The relevant section of Dr Jowett’s notes reads as follows: </p>

The two recycled wood bunkers are numbered 5 and 6 on the plan (see paragraph 10 above). The aggregate of these tonnages is 1,500 – 1,600 Te, and Dr Jowett has taken the mid-figure of 1,550. Subsequently, Dr Mitcheson has used the self-same metric to base his heat release rate calculations. </p>

He said, as did other witnesses, that the bunkers would tend to be full on Thursday and Friday to support weekend production. In cross-examination, he agreed that the SCADA system did not indicate whether a bunker was full; it would merely show the operators what was happening directly below the drop level. It was for this reason that visual assessment of the bunkers, which entailed climbing up the stairs onto the gantry, was the best way to evaluate the position, and was therefore habitually undertaken. As regards Dr Jowett’s notes, Mr Pybis did not accept that he would have told him the levels in terms of tonnages. He did not in fact know these. Instead, he would have told him what the levels were in terms of fractions or percentages. Mr Pybis agreed that he might have said that bunker no. 1 was half full, but he would not have said that there was less in bunker no. 2. In fact, his recollection was that bunker no. 2 was 75-85% full. He was less sure about that in cross-examination. In his opinion, all the bunkers had <span style="font-style:italic">“healthy”</span> levels, although there were different levels in each of the bins.  </p>

He had been working in the Cometer hall for a number of years, and must have known the capacities of these bunkers in terms of tonnages. In answer to my questions, he agreed that he heard others mention 500 tonnes. When pressed in cross-examination, Mr Pybis let slip that he <span style="font-style:italic">rarely</span> mentioned tonnages; he felt more confident using percentages. It follows that he sometimes mentioned them. Finally, Dr Jowett’s unchallenged evidence was that he simply wrote down what he was told. He had no reason to do otherwise, and it is clear from other sections of his notes that he took care to ensure that he had understood Mr Pybis’ explanations. </p>

Mr Redfern makes the points that the Defendant is relying on the evidence of a labourer, and that an international company of this stature should be able to adduce more cogent evidence in a case of this importance. I will deal with Mr Redfern’s second argument later, but as for the first I disagree with his somewhat dismissive assessment of his own witness. Mr Pybis had worked his way up from being an industrial cleaner, and his competence and experience are not in question. He was the last person who in fact witnessed the levels in these bunkers. In my judgment, his experienced assessments were reasonably reliable, and would have been at least as robust as anyone else’s. I understand but cannot condone Mr Pybis’ reasons for wanting to backpedal. He was not credible in that respect, but the reliability of what he told Dr Jowett has not been undermined. </p>

Mr Mark Callaghan told me that the bunkers were usually approximately 40-50% full (200-250 Te), which evidence is consistent with what he told Dr Jowett in June 2011. Mr Callaghan said that the Defendant was planning to stop production on Monday 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June for at least three weeks. This evidence came out the blue, and too late in the case for other witnesses to be questioned about it. As I have said, other employees told me that the bunkers would tend to be fuller towards the end of the week. I understand Mr Redfern’s concern about the circumstances in which this evidence has seeped into the case, but I believe that Mr Callaghan was a reliable and impressive witness who did not enter the witness box in order to mislead me. Moreover, in my view other former employees called by the Claimants were giving me, at best, a generalised impression of the Defendant’s operation, not what was in fact happening on this particular day. </p>

I say this because Mr Callaghan told me that approximately 700 Te were withdrawn per day. On the basis of three days’ production (10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> – 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June inclusive), and the necessity to leave the bunker screws safely covered, the arithmetic speaks for itself. On the other hand, the impending close-down is a pointer which slightly favours the Defendant and serves to neutralise the Claimants’ point that as the weekend approached the bunkers tended to be fuller. </p>

He explained that the purpose of the sensor was to monitor the height of the woodchips so that they did not block the conveyor. The icon on the computer screen would then give an indication in the form of a percentage of how much was in the bunker overall. The temporary log files containing this information were probably kept for around three months, but this witness was not sure. He said that a “PLC engineer” would be needed to go back any further. However, he was clear in his evidence that he never used the computer monitoring system to evaluate levels, because there was no need to do so.  </p>

I was given no explanation as to why he was not called to give evidence about the bunker levels, but it is clear that he did not speak to Dr Jowett about them and it is probable that what he knew about bunker levels that night came from Mr Pybis. Furthermore, I draw the reasonable inference that it is highly unlikely that any shift handover log would have been prepared and completed on the night of the fire at or near to 22:00.

At the time of these events, he had been chief financial officer. He was responsible for signing and declaring the truth of the Defendant’s disclosure statements in this litigation. Mr Hayes was a somewhat cavalier witness who appeared to take the view that because the Defendant had disclosed information relating to the contents of the bunkers, viz. the Pybis data, that was the end of the matter. I was not impressed by that attitude, or by certain features of his evidence. It is unclear why no search for any electronic documents was made before the Standard Disclosure Statement was signed on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013. In relation to the first Supplemental Disclosure Statement dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014, Mr Hayes had ticked the box to the effect that no search had been made for electronic data, but then it transpired that electronic meteorological data had been disclosed.

The further Disclosure Statement dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014, again signed by Mr Hayes, stated that a search had been made of the internal server in Portugal.

He told me that the SCADA data with which this case is concerned would not have been backed up or saved on Sonae’s main server in Maia, Portugal. Those data were retained on temporary log files which were deleted after 4 weeks. My understanding of computer systems is imperfect, but I imagine that an expert would have been able to retrieve these data from the systems in Liverpool notwithstanding their deletion. However, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2012 the Sonae plant was sold to a competitor, along with its computers. Some data would have been transferred to Portugal for financial and other obvious reasons, but even if they still existed I see no reason for any of the SCADA data being preserved in this way: their value was ephemeral.  </p>

I have asked myself why Mr Hayes took the trouble to make any lengthy inquiries in Portugal if the true position was that the data of interest did not exist by then. Upon reflection, and considering Mr Hayes’ evidence as a whole, I cannot conclude that he was a mendacious witness. It was necessary to undertake certain inquiries in Portugal as to how the SCADA system functioned in relation to the bunkers, and the operation of Sonae’s computer systems in general.

First, I do not accept that the Defendant should have preserved the SCADA data before the temporary log files were deleted, and/or before November 2012. Assuming that the Defendant’s solicitors advised its client to retain relevant documents, including data, when this claim was first intimated, the Defendant’s computer system in the UK was sold at an early stage in the litigation. It would have required considerable knowledge and “joined up thinking” to have concluded that these systems should have been interrogated, and temporary log files reconstructed, before they were transferred to the purchaser. By the time the Defendant should reasonably have been alert to this recondite issue, it was too late. Overall, the Claimants have fallen short of demonstrating the sort of reprehensible conduct on the Defendant’s side which would justify the drawing of the adverse inference sought; and, in any event, the requisite causative link between conduct and the loss of electronic documents has not been established. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, the SCADA data, even if available, would have thrown little further light on the actual contents of the bunkers. The computer may have generated a percentage figure from the sensor data but it was, at best, only indicative. The clear evidence from Messrs Whitrow and Callaghan, which I accept, is that these data were not relied on. The only reliable means of establishing the bunker levels, and that was imprecise too, was to take a look. Operators and managers would not have taken the trouble to do this if their efforts were supererogatory. Furthermore, looking again at the diagram at paragraph 12 above, it is quite obvious that the inferences to be drawn from a series of distances from sensor to individual peaks were likely to be imprecise and inaccurate, in relation to a process which was dynamic. In the end, Mr Redfern had to submit that I should “draw an inference from an imponderable”. The philosophers might enjoy this sort of metaphysical conundrum, but it is lost on the common lawyer. </p>

Mr Redfern submitted that this fire was reasonably foreseeable, and that issues of foreseeability and causation are, by their nature, intrinsically intertwined. I cannot accept this submission either. The Defendant does not dispute that the Claimants’ alleged losses are reasonably foreseeable. I do not accept that foreseeability and causation can be elided, or (to put the point slightly differently) that the degree of the Defendant’s fault is capable of being relevant to the issue of causation. These are, and remain, discrete concepts. However badly the Defendant may have behaved, the Claimants still have to prove their cases to the requisite standard, and their task is by no means attenuated or abbreviated by the extent or quantum of breach of duty. The instant case is wholly different from the situation analysed by Mann J in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gulati</span> (at [91] of his judgment) where the scope of wrongdoing bore on the quantum of damages, and also differs from the context of Viscount Simonds’ dictum in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry &amp;</span></p>

Paragraph 64 of Dr Mitcheson’s first report dated January 2014 proceeded on the basis of an initial tonnage of 1,550 and a heat release rate of 330 MW, leading to a burn of 700 Te and a residue of 850 Te. In his report dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014, Dr Mitcheson carried out a more straightforward calculation based on the assumption that the bunkers were filled with unburnt woodchips up to the level of the letter boxes. On this premise, the mass of the unburnt woodchips was in the region of 900 Te, a figure not far off the 850 Te attained by a different methodology altogether. Mr Redfern sought to persuade me through cross-examination of Dr Mitcheson that the second method was either self-evident or tautological, amounting in effect to the skinning of the same cat by the same knife (my metaphor, not his), but I cannot agree. Somewhat rough-and-ready though Dr Mitcheson might have been in his later report, I consider that his methodology was different and the point he was seeking to make is valid. </p>

The combustion of these materials created dense black smoke. In addition, there were unquantified accumulations of woodchip and associated dust outside the bunkers which would not have materially contributed to the fire load but would have accelerated the spread of the conflagration at or shortly before 04:00 on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Claimants dispute the quantity of foam insulation and contend for a figure of approximately 40 Te. They also argue that 4-5 Te of perspex roof sheeting was involved in the fire. Dr Mitcheson agreed that the total potential fire load as regards the foam insulation was in the region of 40 Te, and on one interpretation of his evidence in cross-examination he appeared to accept that had it burned it would have added considerably to the heat release rate. It is unclear to me why he made that concession (if indeed he made it) – logically, combustion should have a neutral impact on the heat release rate regardless of the quantity burnt – but his real point was that on his interpretation of the photographic evidence no more than 16 Te could have been consumed in the fire. This was on the footing that only the top 2m burned. Dr Jowett, who was in a better position to assess this damage, said in cross-examination that <span style="font-style:italic">“just the top few metres were involved in the fire”</span>. However, he also said that he had not done the calculation. In my judgment, it is likely that more than 16 Te of foam insulation was involved in the fire, but it is unclear how much more. I do not accept that the whole potential fire load of 40 Te was entailed. My finding has no impact on Dr Mitcheson’s heat release rate calculation for stage 2, but it does serve to enhance the emissions of pollutants during that stage. Yet, how much difference that made cannot be assessed, save in the general sense that the enhancement could not have been that great in proportion to the quantity of woodchips. Finally, I cannot accept Mr Redfern’s criticism of Dr Mitcheson that he should have accounted for the foam insulation. This expert’s brief was to evaluate heat release rates; he had no interest in emissions and pollutants. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As for the perspex sheeting in the roof, it is clear that Dr Mitcheson did not take these into account. They would have had a minimal impact on heat release rates but would have contributed to some extent to the overall fugitive escape of potentially toxic chemicals. This is extremely difficult to quantify, not least because the dimensions of the roof spaces have never been measured, and to the extent that they appear in photographs their size and weight cannot be readily estimated. Mr Callaghan said that there were 3-4 pitches in the roof, with a maximum of 2-3 thin perspex panels in each pitch. With reference to furniture in the court room which Mr Callaghan used as his yardstick, I formed the impression that each panel was about 2m x 1.5m. I would not wish to speculate as to the total weight of all the panels, but the Claimants’ estimate of 4-5 Te seems excessive. The panels melted at the outset of stage 2 and added to the mélange of chemicals at that juncture. </p>

I have reviewed the log very carefully but I am far from convinced that it provides much positive support for Dr Mitcheson’s argument. Certainly by later on that afternoon there is reasonably clear evidence of a significant reduction in the overall quantities of smoke, and the Claimants propose a later time for the transition, namely approximately 14:30 on Friday 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. </p>

First, what may be described as the highlights of the photographic and video evidence were considered by Dr Mitcheson, both in chief and in cross-examination. I should add that when opening his case to me Mr Redfern presented a 40 minute montage of the available evidence, and Dr Mitcheson confirmed that he had seen it. A video available on Youtube, which is untimed but Dr Mitcheson surmises was taken at around 10:00, shows lesser quantities of smoke issuing from the plant, and a possible change in colour – blending from white grey to a darker shade of grey. Photographic images taken at 10:28 and 10:29 that morning, showing the west and northwest aspects of the woodyard building, appear to depict smoke of a light grey colour tinged with yellow. There was some suggestion that the yellow might be a refraction or reflection of light from the sun, but I doubt that. Dr Mitcheson agreed in cross-examination that the yellow smoke was probably the product of something other than wood. However, it remains unclear what this was or might have been, and ultimately smoke of this hue does not really assist me in timing the transition from stage 2 to stage 3. Another image timed at 11:04, but taken from a different angle, shows what I would describe as grey, but not black, smoke. A further photograph taken at 11:17 shows a significantly reduced amount of smoke.  </p>

By 14:49 the quantity had reduced but the colour was still fairly black. Dr Mitcheson’s contention is that this represents the combustion of approximately 2,500 litres or 2.25 Te of hydraulic oil which had entered the immediate zone of the fire. There is some support for this explanation from a MFRS log entry timed at 13:29 – it erroneously refers to “approximately 1,500 litres of hydraulic fuel” having entered the area of the fire, but nothing turns on this quantitative error, or the mis-description of the substance. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On the other hand, the Claimants contend with some conviction that it is not easy to understand how 2,500 litres of hydraulic oil could have accounted for densely copious quantities of black smoke which endured for at least 85 minutes. Interestingly, Mr Callaghan put the duration of this black smoke as being only 10-15 minutes, which in my view is incorrect. I see the common sense force of the Claimants’ point, but Dr Mitcheson explained in cross-examination that the oil could have pooled on the ground. Dr Mitcheson did not accept the force of the point that one would have expected both oil tanks to enter the fire zone more or less simultaneously. In this regard he received some support from the evidence of Mark Callaghan to the effect that the oil tanks were 8-10 metres apart.  </p>

First, they have no expert evidence with which to contradict Dr Mitcheson, and overall I have concluded that he was a good witness. Secondly, if this was not hydraulic oil burning, then the only competing hypothesis is that there was some unexplained recrudescence in the fire involving the woodchips, and what might be characterised as a temporary reversion from stage 3 back to stage 2. Although I fully accept the possibility that this fire waxed and waned to some extent, I cannot agree that a flareup of this magnitude might have occurred. All six bunkers were heavily consumed in the fire by 06:00, and I cannot accept Mr Redfern’s subsidiary point that more polyurethane foam might have been involved after 13:30. </p>

Dr Mitcheson derived this figure from the level of woodchips in relation to the “letter box” or slot openings.

This equates to a volume of about 225m³ in each bunker, suggesting an unburnt mass of about 22 Te per bunker and a total mass of about 120 Te. Accordingly, the majority of the woodchips remaining at the commencement of stage 3 were consumed by about midday on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Subsequently, it is obvious that there was much less left to burn, and Dr Mitcheson calculates that by 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July only about 10 Te remained.

Back in June 2011 he had no interest in matters such as the quantity, thickness and colour of the smoke; these were wholly outside the ambit of his concerns. As I have said, he went to the plant on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June in order to undertake a preliminary inspection. His photographs taken at the time do not show copious quantities of smoke, and when he inspected the woodyard building that afternoon there was very little smoke at ground floor level. The position was the same the following day. Dr Jowett returned to the site on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June and carried out a risk assessment for his own purposes. This assessment made provision for wearing a personal gas monitor should the need arise, but according to paragraph 22 of his witness statement the alarm levels on the monitor were triggered at no point during his inspection. On that occasion, Dr Jowett took what he called an “inspection movie” (his exhibit ‘PAJ-5’, lasting 40 minutes) which shows little smoulder or smoke emanating from the bunkers by that stage. </p>

Given the absence of an expert instructed by the Claimants who might have advanced different heat release rates, following which there might have been room for an element of compromise at a joint experts’ meeting, at the conclusion of his evidence I invited Dr Mitcheson to reconsider his conclusions and advise me as to whether there might be respects in which a different opinion might be accommodated.

Shortly after lunch on the day Dr Mitcheson was giving evidence (Friday 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June), Mr Redfern cross-examined him at length on the quantity of oxygen likely to reach the fire on account of the degree of smoke-logging within and above the bunkers. Mr Redfern’s objective was to ensnare the witness into a debate about emission factors, not heat release rates, but Dr Mitcheson was unwilling to express a view about these. I suspect that he might have been qualified to do so, but it was clear that he had performed neither the calculations nor the degree of deep cogitation required to express a properly tutored view. Mr Redfern made some headway on this topic, in the sense that he was able to persuade me that certainly during the earlier hours of stage 2 there were very considerable quantities of black smoke and this fire was severely under-ventilated. However, I need to store this evidence away for use at a slightly later stage in this judgment, under the rubric of emission factors. </p>

Dr Mitcheson had agreed in cross-examination that the simile was not exact, but he told me that he had taken proper account of the ventilation of this fire in arriving at his final heat release rate for stage 2.

A slightly lower burning rate, and a concomitantly depressed heat release rate, might make a relatively small difference to the plume modelling, no doubt in the Claimants’ favour – the higher the heat release rate, the higher the apex and range of dispersal of the plume.

I appreciate that this is Dr Carruthers’ standard practice, but his expertise in this area is questionable. Although he has a doctorate in atmospheric physics, he is not a fire engineer.

I fail to understand her reference to absorption of heat within the smoke: the issue is whether heat would have radiated away from the smoke plume. Mr David Shillito, the Defendant’s chemical engineer, was qualified to comment on this issue, but was not particularly helpful in giving me a figure upon which I could proceed.

Doing the best I can in these unsatisfactory circumstances, I am prepared to accept the probability that some heat would have been lost through radiation, but I am completely disinclined to embrace Dr Carruthers’ 30%, which is based on little more than assertion.

It is this metric, the emission rate properly so called, which is factored into the plume model. The smoke plume contained a cocktail or soup of chemicals and particles, and their individual emission factors varied. Beyond this general explanation, it is possible to be more precise. Strictly speaking, an emission <span style="font-style:italic">rate </span>is the product of the emission <span style="font-style:italic">factor </span>for any given chemical or particle and what Dr Carruthers called the “burning rate” (i.e. Dr Mitcheson’s heat of consumption, not the same as his heat release rate) for the remaining fire load at the material time. Confusingly, Mrs Spanton’s preferred terminology is not “burning rate” or “heat of consumption”, but “heat output”.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Confusion arises because the experts have tended to use their terms interchangeably, confident in the knowledge that each fully understands the other, but possibly oblivious to a lawyer’s very stale basic science. For the avoidance of all doubt, it may be helpful if I were to set out my understanding of the position. If the emission factor is 100 g/kg, and the burning rate or heat of consumption is 10 MJ/kg (as Dr Mitcheson says it is), 100 g/kg becomes 10 g/MJ. As a joule is a watt per second, this becomes 10 g/s/MW. As Envirobods have explained, there are other ways in which the same result may be attained, entailing the application of a relatively simple formula. Thus, what looks like a rate, because it is measured over time, is described as a factor.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Now that the position is fully understood, no confusion arises. However, it is necessary to be clear as to where this leads. Whatever the terminology, the plume modellers have used two separate variables to arrive at the generation rate over the course of the fire of the chemicals and particles of interest. They appear to have used an emission rate expressed in mg/s/MW (although they have called it a factor), and they have also used an appropriate burning rate. This is the key concept Mr Redfern wanted me to understand.  It is obvious that as the quantity of combustible material falls, so must do the generation of the relevant chemicals and particles. According to Dr Mitcheson’s calculations, the heat release rate falls exponentially after midday on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, and on my understanding what the plume modellers call the burning rate or heat output is logarithmic (assuming that my recollection of basic differential calculus has not altogether deserted me). In truth, it matters not, because the appropriate variable is factored into the ADMS model. However, it is important to keep separate the concepts of emission factors and burning rates, since otherwise there might be a tendency to conclude that because the fire is dying down the emission factors must also be falling commensurately. The emission <span style="font-style:italic">rate </span>will be falling, but not necessarily the emission <span style="font-style:italic">factors</span> – unless, that is, other considerations come into play which independently impact on the latter. </p>

However, that in my view is overly simplistic an approach. Putting to one side the reduction in the burning rate, the parties’ experts are in fact agreed that the emission factors vary as the fire progresses. This is a consequence of variables changing independently of the burning rate, including the chemical environment changing as well as the degree of ventilation and efficiency of combustion. The experts are, however, far apart on matters of degree. </p>

The expert reports range over a vast array of chemicals and toxins, but in the events which have occurred I may short-circuit some of the debate. The present case is concerned with chemicals which possess irritant qualities and with micro-particles. The possible relationship between the two will be discussed in my section on toxicology. The chemicals with irritant properties are primarily the aldehydes, but there were others too within the fire plume that have not been quantified in any meaningful way, whether in terms of their emission factors, the toxicology or the plume modelling. The parties agree that the most important of the aldehydes for present purposes is acrolein. Apart from the irritant chemicals, the parties have been focussing on particulate matter which is less than 10 micro-metres in diameter (the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>) and the further sub-set of particulate matter which is less than 2.5 micro-metres in diameter (the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2.5</span>).  </p>

Towards the end of the trial, I indicated to the parties that I considered that the 20% deduction was incorrect in principle.

I recognise that I was running solo with a point which had not appealed to Mr Redfern. At that stage the parties did not comment on my rationale or conclusion, but after the close of the proceedings and following his interpretation of an apparent concession by Mr Redfern in post-hearing email exchanges, Mr Kent returned to it and urged me to reconsider.

At paragraph 4.14 of his September 2014 report Mr Shillito, when addressing CERC’s emission factors for the micro-particles, did not contend that they should in any event suffer a deduction for moisture. On its natural and ordinarily meaning, “dry” does not mean wood which has been notionally drained of all moisture. In any event, the US EPA document states that the moisture content of wood ranges from 5-70%, and that “dry” wood includes wood with anything up to 20% moisture. I do not read paragraph 1.9.2 of the US EPA review, with its reference to dry wood, as indicating that all moisture is squeezed out of the computation. Finally, I am not prepared to finesse this issue by allowing a deduction lower than 20%. It follows that, although moisture should obviously be taken into account in relation to the heat release rates (as it has been), it should not be in relation to emission factors. </p>

The basic principle, which is universally accepted, is that the better the ventilation the better the efficiency of the burn and the lower the emission factors for any chemical or particle of interest. There are other considerations which impact on emission factors, such as the chemical constituents of the fire load as the fire progresses, but these may be difficult to quantify. A residential fireplace is an open, uncontrolled fire which is reasonably well ventilated. Thus, in stage 2 of the fire this model would in Dr Carruthers’ view (as articulated at one stage in his oral evidence) tend to underestimate the true emission factors for the micro-particles because it is accepted by Dr Mitcheson that the fire was under-ventilated. The fireplace model would be more apposite for stage 3. Given that Dr Carruthers has chosen to use one emission factor for the small particles throughout stage 2 and 3 of the fire, the Claimants submit that he has in fact under-estimated the position.</p>

The presence of thick clouds of black smoke during stage 2 is completely inconsistent with the controlled process within Mr Shillito’s presumed contemplation. Furthermore, a biomass boiler would have to be compliant with the Clean Air Act 1993, where stage 2 of the fire plainly was not. Dr Carruthers also sought to draw inferences from certain photographs relating to how far one could see through the smoke, but this evidence was too subjective and impressionistic for my palate. </p>

In his evidence in chief he explained that (a) the fuel was very different, and he was looking for <span style="font-style:italic">“an effective fuel burnout”</span>, and (b) given the dimensions of our fire, it was appropriate to compare it to a model which was larger than a residential fireplace. Like Dr Carruthers, Mr Shillito in his reports had adopted a single emission factor for both stages of the fire, although had queried the methodological soundness of this approach. On my reading of his written evidence to the court, Mr Shillito was adopting an emission factor which he considered was appropriate for stage 2, and then applied the same value to the beginning of stage 3. In his oral evidence, however, Mr Shillito said that his approach had always been to seek to ascertain the appropriate emission factor for stage 3a of the fire (i.e. 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June), as he called it, and then apply the same value to stage 2. Mr Shillito struck me as an entirely honest witness, but I do not read his reports in that way. I consider that he was extrapolating from stage 2 to stage 3, not the other way round. </p>

Mr Redfern sought to exploit this concession by putting to Mr Shillito in cross-examination that, given that all aldehydes and other emissions are the result of incomplete combustion, logic would surely suggest that <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>Mr Shillito’s emission factors should bear the same increment. Mr Shillito was surprised by this question, and did not really answer it satisfactorily, but the reality is that the premise on which the question was posed was completely incorrect (I must confess that the enthusiasm with which I harried Mr Shillito about this was misplaced). All emissions are the product of incomplete combustion (i.e. complete combustion of wood would produce carbon dioxide, water and nothing else): the issue is not the <span style="font-style:italic">fact</span> of emissions, but their relative quantities. Further, the parties have proceeded on the basis of agreed emission factors for all aldehydes and acrolein in particular – these are safely derived from the literature, and are not related to the emission factors for the micro-particles. In any event, multiplying the emission factors for the irritants by even a factor of four for the first two hours of stage 2 makes no material difference to the outcome of this case. </p>

Mr Shillito rejected the fireplace analogue because in his view it predicates flaming combustion, which this fire was not. He stated that the key point in the instant case is that by the beginning of stage 3 the fire load was charred woodchips in respect of which the volatiles had already been released (during stage 2). Mr Redfern put to Mr Shillito the concept of “re-volatilisation”, but this was simply not understood: the volatiles in Mr Shillito’s view would burn off once and for all when initially released. As for the biomass boiler model, Mr Shillito accepted the point about statutory compliance, but stated that the analogue remained apposite because wood-burning boilers use a continuous source of woodchips (which, therefore, continue to emit volatiles and aerosols), and a larger combustion bed tends to be more efficient.  </p>

The fire is designed to be pretty, to show a nice red flame.  The red flames in themselves produce carbon black. The redness of the flame is in fact carbon black glowing in the flame.  So the fire is designed to produce soot which burns in the flame. The volatiles, which contain the irritant substances, will burn preferentially in the flame to the carbon.  So as I see it, a nice red flame will produce black soot, but probably low volatile contents, and that's one part of it. The volatile material escaping from the fire will depend obviously on the way that the fire is arranged. But to my mind, the black soot from the open fire is contributed by the loss of heat to the outside environment, reducing the -- this is radiation loss from the visible fire, and effectively quenching the red flames.

As the authors of the US EPA report make clear, a residential fireplace is an inefficient device and there will be significant variances between different homes, configurations and wood piles. The report also explains that emission factors will depend on - amongst other matters - burn rate, the degree of ventilation and the degree of flame intensity. Here, during stage 2 we have a fast burn rate, an underventilated fire (exactly how under-ventilated is not readily quantifiable) and low flame intensity. Two out of these three matters incline towards higher emission factors. </p>

I am entitled to draw inferences from all the available evidence, including Mr Shillito’s answers. Although common sense can be a dangerous guide in relation to scientific matters, I have reached the clear conclusion that for stage 2 the instant case must fall towards the upper end of the fireplace model, and of the spread of values proffered by Larson and Koenig. Stage 2 of the fire was characterised by voluminous quantities of dense black smoke engendered in a significantly under-ventilated environment. During its early stages, the “letterbox” slots were blocked. Moreover, Mr Shillito has not included the hydraulic oil, the foam and the conveyor belting in his emission factors for the micro-particles, nor has CERC modelled these (I understand that CERC has modelled the 0.8% contamination, using the parallel of household waste). Although these have not been quantified, the presence of these items (which on my findings were wholly consumed within stage 2) gives me further confidence in moving towards the upper end of the bracket. </p>

As the authors of the US EPA study explain, later on in the burning cycle the volatiles burn out, charcoal remains, and the emission factors decline. This tends to chime with aspects of Mr Shillito’s evidence. On the other hand, Dr Mitcheson proceeds on the basis that at the commencement of stage 3 there were still approximately 850 Te of woodchips left to burn. Although many of the surfaces of the individual woodchips were charred and most were “cooked”, I do no accept that there was charring <span style="font-style:italic">tout court</span>. Accordingly, further volatilisation was a probable phenomenon. Yet, it is indisputable that the predominant characteristic of stage 3 was smoke which was between whitish and light grey in colour. Furthermore, I accept Mr Shillito’s evidence that the fire during stage 3 had become more efficient in consequence of the enhanced ventilation - both through the slots and from above.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, the emission factors for the micro-particles fell significantly during the course of stage 3. By how much is unclear. I do not propose to reflect this consideration in my figure, either by selecting more than one set of emission factors over the 27 days of stage 3, or by taking an average. Like Mr Shillito, I believe that the proper focus is on Sunday 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, when the wind was from the east. In reality, the graph of emission factors plotted against time would show a marked decline from mid-afternoon on Saturday 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June (I take that point in time because the hydraulic oil had burnt out by then) and about midday on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Thereafter, the decline continued, but was very much slower. Fortunately for the calculations, Saturday 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June is far less important for virtually everyone than the Sunday, because the wind was blowing from the west. Focusing therefore as I am on Sunday 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, my conclusion is that the emission factor for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10 </span>fraction is 12.5 g/kg. Again, I reduce that by 0.82 for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2.5</span>s, i.e. to 10.25 g/kg. These factors apply to the whole of stage 3. As before, this represents a liberal approach, even though it is slightly below the Larson and Koenig bracket for the fireplace model. In this regard I have taken account of Mr Shillito’s evidence regarding the efficiency of the stage 3 fire. </p>

It is immediately apparent that in one sense this was an unequal fight: Professor Hay’s enormous lance pitted against Mr Shillito’s smaller weapon. Professor Hay is Professor of Environmental Toxicology at the University of Leeds, and an international authority in his subject. He is extremely experienced and has sat on numerous governmental committees over the years. Mr Shillito is not a toxicologist at all; he is a chemical engineer. However, his experience in environmental issues, and his sense of fairness, cannot be doubted. </p>

As regards the irritants, the focus has primarily been on acrolein, but consideration has been given also to the total aldehydes within the metaphorical soup of the fire plume. During the course of Professor Hay’s evidence in chief, Mr Redfern invited his witness to perform from the witness box a calculation designed to estimate the additive effect of the agglomeration all the probable irritant chemicals in this mix, in other words to look further than the limited number of compounds previously considered. This calculation had not been attempted before, and I did not give the Claimants permission to adduce evidence of this nature in this unheralded fashion.

Item (i) above is addressing the absolute minimum levels at which human beings might begin to experience symptoms. Most healthy persons will not experience symptoms at such levels or anything like them (assuming these values are correct), but the higher the dose the more individuals will begin to suffer. Further, the paper does not throw any light on duration of exposure (and note item (iii)), although the experts appear to have interpreted it as a trigger value regardless of length of exposure. Taking a threshold of 146 μg/m³ for acrolein in the context of its potential to cause eye symptoms is extremely favourable to the Claimants. The plume modellers have used this value, at my request, for the purposes of illustration. I should emphasise, if further emphasis were required, that exceeding it does not mean that personal injury was caused or even likely caused. </p>

On my understanding of his evidence, Professor Hay felt that this was far too low - he suggested something in the region of 460 μg/m³ - but this may have been a complaint threshold rather than an odour recognition threshold.

As I have already said, Professor Hay did not perform a similar exercise for the purposes of his reports, but when I asked him at the very end of his evidence about Mr Shillito’s figure, he told me that his recent calculations were not “far off”. Much later, I had a colloquy with Mr Kent about the significance of this value. I had found it difficult to understand why the threshold for “all aldehydes” was higher than that for acrolein. The supposition must be that there is some sort of dilution effect, which I can understand in an experimental setting where relative concentrations may be in play; but in the context of a given smoke plume with a number of chemicals of the aldehyde family, one would have thought that the act of placing more of these under the microscope would serve to increase, rather than reduce, the irritancy potential. Mr Kent did not really advance a persuasive rebuttal of this, but overall it matters not. There is no evidential basis, or evidence-based methodology, which might enable me to reduce the acrolein threshold <span style="font-style:italic">below </span>146, 356 or 572 μg/m³ to reflect the aggregation of aldehydes.  </p>

Low concentrations of the irritant gases may cause significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, which may affect a large number of people who are not directly exposed to the fire plume. The adverse effects resulting from exposure to these irritants are likely to be completely resolved following removal from the exposure, with no long term sequelae. However, the generation of more complex products such as PAHs, dioxins, dibenzofurans and particulate matter are of concern, but are likely to present a significantly greater hazard from long term or repeated exposure than following a large single acute exposure.” </p>

The only point one should not lose sight of is that the quantities of acrolein, for example, have been separately modelled.

Mr Shillito also agreed that micro-particles could be used as a surrogate provided that due caution was accorded. For me, the issue is not relevance, but weight. The fact that there is direct modelling evidence of the aldehydes does not mean that it is wrong in principle to consider evidence of an indirect nature, particularly given that (a) the micro-particles will be porters for more than just the aldehydes, (b) the modelling evidence is not especially robust, and the more of it the better, and (c) there is a mass of academic literature which chooses to examine the micro-particles. Professor Hay suggested in addition that scrutinising the micro-particles betokens a conservative approach in any event because there must be numerous irritant chemicals travelling independently of them in the plume, and so modelling the micro-particles may underestimate rather that overestimate the global value of the irritants. However, in my judgment this is somewhat speculative, given that (a) many micro-particles may be free of irritant chemicals, and (b) no scientific paper has on my understanding sought to ascertain the likely ratio of micro-particles to chemicals of toxicological interest (<span style="font-style:italic">pace</span> the answer Dr Hind gave to my question).

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The COMEAP report sets out two different sorts of threshold level. More valuable for present purposes are the trigger thresholds based on two consecutive hourly mean concentrations, subject to the second hourly mean concentration being greater than the first. Although these are principally warning levels, Professor Hay’s advice to me, which I accept, is that they represent the sort of levels at which irritant effects might begin to be experienced, adopting I have to say a highly precautionary approach. I do not, however, accept Professor Hay’s point that only one hour’s exposure might be sufficient. I do not consider that COMEAP may properly be rewritten in this way, and it is also noteworthy that Professor Hay’s point was specifically based on the premise that <span style="font-style:italic">“the particulates are only one small fraction of the material that will be arriving at somebody’s respiratory tract”. </span>On the basis that the aldehydes represent the majority of this material, they have of course been separately modelled. At Table 3-2 of the COMEAP report (page 17 on the internal numbering), various suggested thresholds are advanced for the micro-particles, related to three bands, “moderate”, “high or above” and “very high or above”. Professor Hay did not say which of these bands I should select for present purposes, although he did in relation to the 24-hour mean thresholds. Doing the best I can on the available evidence, I take the “high” value for both PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s and PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2.5</span>s, namely 107 μg/m³ and 74 μg/m³ (as it happens, CERC’s recent modelling adopts these values). These thresholds do not appear to discriminate between non-vulnerable and vulnerable individuals, but the precautionary principle would suggest that they are designed for the vulnerable. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The final point which arises in the context of the COMEAP review is the salience of ambient background levels to the health threshold levels I have specified. This is a point which meshes with the plume modelling evidence, and may be expressed in these terms. If, for example, the ambient background level (i.e. the level untrammelled by the smoke plume) is X μg/m³ of PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s for any given period and location, and the modelled concentration of PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s is Y μg/m³ (ignoring the background level) for the same period and location, which value should be calibrated against the relevant health threshold level for these micro-particles? In my judgment, the answer is X + Y, applying the straightforward tortious principle of material contribution to the damage. There are average hourly background data from the Briery Hey monitoring station, some 1,250 m away from the Sonae plant. I assume for present purposes that the background levels do not vary much over the whole area under consideration, although they may be higher nearer the M57. Accordingly, these data will be used in conjunction with the 24-hourly mean concentrations of PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s (see paragraph 152 above) as evaluated for a limited number of Test Claimants (see paragraph 171 below). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Professor Hay drew my attention to an important paper authored by Kunzli et al, published in the American Journal of Critical Care Medicine in 2006, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Health Effects</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">of the 2003 California Wildfires on Children</span>. The focus of this study was a vast, catastrophic series of forest fires in the State of California, visible from space. Local air quality monitors recorded hourly particulate matter concentrations approaching 1,000 μg/m³, being 10-20 times the typically observed ambient levels. The researchers collected data from questionnaires sent out by email within about one month and eight months of the fire (i.e. far sooner after the fire than the questionnaires in the present case, and unrelated to any medico-legal context). The children suffered a range of symptoms not at all dissimilar from those allegedly sustained in the instant case. What is of great interest, though, is the recorded 5-day mean PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10 </span>exposures for children in the various locations identified in Table 2 of the paper. From this table it may be seen that for children with exposures in the range of 30-52 μg/m³, there were precious few complaints of symptoms. However, as will become apparent at a later stage in this judgment, the Californian cohort suffered far higher mean levels of exposure to PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s over a 5 day period than did their analogues, including adults, in the present fire. Symptoms were only experienced in significant numbers when the 5-day mean PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10 </span>exposure level was in the 100+ μg/m³ range. To my mind, this paper significantly avails the Defendant and not the Claimants. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The final point which falls to be addressed on Professor Hay’s evidence is the approach to be taken to what Mr Redfern described as “sub-threshold” levels of exposure. Perhaps anticipating that very few of his clients could demonstrate on the science that they suffered an “above-threshold” exposure, Mr Redfern was astute to draw out of Professor Hay evidence which might prove the Claimants’ case on the balance of probabilities. Whereas it is quite true that many of the Claimants were exposed on the plume modelling evidence to the <span style="font-style:italic">odour</span> of acrolein, that is far from demonstrating that any of them suffered actionable personal injury. Indeed, if anything it is a point which tells against the Claimants owing to the impact of human suggestibility. If Claimant X smelt absolutely nothing, then s/he would probably have to be dishonest to bring a claim. No one is suggesting that the smoke plume contained odourless or occult properties akin to carbon monoxide. If the Claimants smelt something, they might <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span> that they were exposed to a chemical which might have injured them in some way. I will be reverting to this point subsequently. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">A “sub-threshold” exposure leads a Claimant nowhere unless either the science is wrong in some way, or the adverse health effects are additive or cumulative. I did not permit Professor Hay to perform the additions he obviously wished to, but I doubt whether my ruling truly impeded the Claimants (and, if it did, I am not reversing it). As I have pointed out, Professor Hay and Mr Shillito do not appear to be far apart in relation to the total aldehydes. I asked Mr Shillito whether he would be prepared to add a figure or percentage to his 500 μg/m³ threshold, in order to reflect the potential impact of other irritant chemicals in the mix. He suggested a figure of 5%. In the context of this case, that figure is <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> and I ignore it. It falls within the general margin for error in the toxicological and plume modelling evidence. I have no other evidence before me on which to select any different figure. As for the possible cumulative effects, these are already addressed within the 24-hour mean thresholds. There is no proper basis on the available evidence for aggregating a series of belowthreshold 24-hour means in order somehow to attain an above-threshold value.  </p>

The WHO Guidelines, based on PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10 </span>levels as low as 3-5 μg/m³, are concerned only with long-term health effects.  In my judgment, evidence that increases as low as 10 μg/m³ might have significantly affected even some of the Claimants is extremely tenuous and speculative, and I prefer to proceed on the basis of the COMEAP data, setting out indicative health thresholds which are already favourable to them. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I have already discussed aspects of the evidence of Dr David Carruthers in relation to emission factors and the overall methodology of plume modelling. In my view, he was a compelling and beguiling expert who had the knack of explaining quite complex concepts clearly, elegantly and with appropriate enthusiasm. I was not so appreciative of Mrs Angela Spanton, who gave the impression of lacking a degree of confidence and authority. I fully recognise and understand that it was always the Defendant’s intention to call Dr Hall to speak to the reports of Envirobods, but unfortunately he died in February 2015. However, I do not accept the point that Mr Redfern made in cross-examination that Mrs Spanton must be incorrect in her assertion, based on extant modelling, that only 30% or thereabouts of all 16,000 plus Claimants were meaningfully exposed to the smoke plume at all. Looking at the location of the majority of the Claimants in relation to the A580 East Lancs road and the M57, it does appear that about 70% of the total cohort, some of whom were represented within the constituency of Test Claimants, were exposed only to minimal levels. Surpassing the acrolein odour recognition threshold for short periods comes nowhere close to being able to prove an adverse health impact. Dr Carruthers accepted in cross-examination that his modelling showed the same general picture. </p>

I should make clear that in no respect does the fault lie with Dr Carruthers.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As regards the Claimants’ plume modelling evidence, the foregoing point may be illustrated in this way. CERC’s first attempt at modelling was on the basis of nine separate factual scenarios, most of which were unsustainable (I accept that it was at least arguable that there were more than 1,550 Te of woodchips in the bunkers). That attempt was also predicated on a fire history/timeline which was unsupported by any expert evidence, and unsustainable in the face of the photographs. Once the Defendant’s expert evidence was disclosed, what the Claimants needed to do was to regroup and instruct CERC to remodel indicative exposures on the basis of Dr Mitcheson’s report and/or a total mass of 3,000 Te in the six bunkers (if the latter course were adopted, permission would have been needed to rely out of time on the evidence of a fire engineer to combat Dr Mitcheson). Moreover, the remodelling should have been done both generically and in relation to each Test Claimant. Although CERC carried out this exercise on an informal basis (based as it happens on Dr Mitcheson’s data), and various data and histograms were disclosed during the course of without prejudice meetings with the Defendant’s experts, these were not placed before the court on any proper basis until after the trial started. Fortunately for the Claimants, Mr Kent had the good grace and judgment not to object. That said, even if he had done I would have allowed this evidence in, notwithstanding its tardiness. </p>

One specific matter which concerns me is the ability of the model to provide a “handle” on subtle changes in wind direction and of temperature, and the possible ability of smoke to linger and seep. The model cannot account for the peripatetic nature of human behaviour, and in many cases it is difficult to know the exact position of any Test Claimant during daylight hours. On the other hand, the plume model fixes on external exposures, and people remaining indoors will have been exposed to less. Further, it is unlikely that most individuals’ natural daily movements would have brought them closer to the Sonae plant; common sense would suggest that they would have moved in the opposite direction. Mrs Spanton referred to the “margin for error” within the model, but its nature and extent was not explored. Many of the sociological points set out above were made during the </p>

A transient, trifling, self-limiting, reversible reaction to an irritant is not “actionable injury” for the purposes of the law of tort. These could fairly be described as “normal physiological responses”. However, the ubiquity of this concept cannot be recognised because it could be used to characterise the reaction of human tissue to hydrochloric acid.

For many people, exposure at these levels would not in fact cause personal injury, but the threshold defines the level at which they are at least “at risk”.

The extent to which I will succumb to that argument depends on balancing the strength of the scientific evidence against that of the lay evidence. In the final analysis, however, I will have to arrive at appropriate thresholds, even if they are lower than those a purely scientific approach would mandate. To do otherwise would not be to exercise the “complete autonomy” which Mr Redfern suggests I possess, but to indulge in unprincipled decision-making.

A lawyer might treat such accounts with condign appreciation, depending on their overall reliability, credibility and consistency, because the approach of the common law has always been more inclusively flexible than a purely scientific approach. So, the fact that the lay evidence in the present case would not get past the front door of any reputable scientific journal is not quite the point. Secondly, the evidence supporting the various health threshold levels in the toxicological literature may have been filtered through more robust and stringent filters than those which would be required by a lawyer applying probabilistic standards (on the other hand, I repeat the point that many of the COMEAP levels are precautionary). Thirdly, there are respects in which the science is inherently uncertain, notwithstanding its claim to precision. I have in mind the plume modelling evidence. A scientist would say that if the modelling fails to prove the case, that must be the end of the matter. A common lawyer would say that there remains room for flexibility and reasonable latitude, and that the whole picture must be held in mind. How much room, though, needs very carefully to be considered. </p>

In that case, the claimants alleged that they suffered soft-tissue injuries to their spines in consequence of a relatively low-impact road traffic accident. The parties relied on accident reconstruction evidence based on second-hand information about the damage the vehicles had sustained. This evidence directly contradicted the claimants’ evidence and stated that they could not have sustained injuries as they alleged. The trial judge found the expert evidence to be convincing and the claimants to be blameless and honest witnesses. The judge preferred their account. The issue which arose on appeal was whether the trial judge could have rejected the expert evidence without finding any flaw in it. The Court of Appeal held that he could: he had weighed up all the evidence in the case, and was entitled to conclude that the claimants were not lying and that there had to be some inaccuracy in the expert’s evidence. </p>

He formed the view that he could not be satisfied that these witnesses were telling a pack of lies. He was very impressed by their evidence, and he concluded, when he had to balance the evidence of each side, that there must be - although he accepted fully that he could not say what it was – something that was not accurate in Mr Child’s evidence in that particular case. </p>

In his view, the cases tended to follow a clear pattern. Many of the people were aware of the fire, owing to its terrible smell and taste, which were new. Some of them described a very large black cloud crossing their homes and gardens. At least one person showed the doctors a photograph on his phone of the cloud in relation to his garden. All decided to batten-down their houses, but the smell and taste persisted. Generally, within a day or two, the Test Claimants developed symptoms. The first thing they tended to describe was itchy eyes, of varying degrees of severity. Nasal symptoms were described by virtually everyone: their noses were either very blocked or very runny. Sore throats were very prominent. Virtually all of them would say that their throats were very dry at night, and that they needed a glass of water by their beds to </p>

The reaction of the lungs to an insult will depend on its severity. The irritant effects occur within seconds, or at the most minutes, of exposure. The nociceptors in the upper respiratory tract detect the presence of irritants and operate like “smoke detectors”. The mucosal linings will become moist, and in due course the goblet cells will secrete mucous, producing mild physiological effects such as coughing, phlegm and tightness of the chest. Dr Hind stated that more severe and prolonged exposure may result in acute inflammation of the lining of the respiratory tract, which could cause symptoms such as a persistent cough, difficulties in breathing and bronchospasm. Even in these cases the recovery period is likely to be short.  </p>

To my mind, four points of general application need to be emphasised. First, the difference between irritation and inflammation is likely to be one of degree, particularly at the margins. Secondly, human variability occupies a significant range. Thirdly, the strength of Dr Hardy’s mini-foray into epidemiology must depend at the very least on the quality of the evidence, including the histories, elicited from all the Test Claimants. Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, much of these experts’ clinical opinion depended on their chosen point of departure. If the starting-point is exposure to smoke at levels which may have been sufficient to yield symptoms, then Dr Hardy’s patterns and constellations become a compelling explanation for the phenomenon under scrutiny; and, moreover, evidential weaknesses in an individual Test Claimant’s case became less important, because they may benefit from the similarities within the herd.  If, on the other hand, the startingpoint is exposure to smoke at levels insufficient to yield symptoms, then certainly the medical scientist would say that the quest for alternative explanations is necessitated. At the very least, a close examination of the individual circumstances of the Test Claimants becomes more important.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“Well, we talked about irritant contact dermatitis, and irritants you can divide into absolute irritants and relative irritants.  Absolute irritants will cause damage to the skin with one or two exposures.  So, for example, hydrofluoric acid, if you pour that on your skin, is going to drill a hole in your skin.  That's an absolute irritant, whereas relative irritants work by damaging the lipid cell surface membranes within the skin, causing damage to the integrity of the barrier function of the skin cumulatively over a period of time. So irritants are anything which dries the skin, degreases the skin, chemically attacks the skin over a period of time.  So in practice exposure to irritants usually requires months or years of repeated exposure to damage the barrier level of the skin to cause problems, to break through the threshold of the actual barrier function of the skin to actually cause dermatitis. Now, most dermatitis will occur from cumulative damage unless that individual has had repeated exposure over a period of time just beneath the threshold and then the final insult will take them through the threshold. But in practice you need months or years of repeated exposure to develop irritant dermatitis, and that irritant dermatitis has to occur on areas which are susceptible.  So hands from a wear and tear point of view, or if you're talking about an airborne irritant, the first place to get affected will be the eyelids, around the eyes and on the face.  Yet none of the people that we examined had problems on their eyelids. So from irritation, I think it pretty well rules that out as a possibility.  If it's an airborne thing, it's got to affect the areas exposed to the skin. Airborne irritants, airborne allergens where people become allergic to chemicals, affect the skin that is exposed to the air and not on covered sites.  Yet a lot of the individuals we examined had problems on covered sites as well.” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I found Mr Marsh to be a somewhat dour witness who appeared to have been discomfited by the forensic process and Mr Clearkin’s no doubt well-intentioned jibes about his consulting rooms. I cannot accept his contention that because the Test Claimants’ evidence is <span style="font-style:italic">“subjective”</span> it cannot carry any weight. Rather, it is a factor to be weighed in the overall evidential mix. Even so, I have no hesitation in preferring his evidence over Mr Clearkin’s at least as regards the sole generic issue that I am choosing to resolve at this juncture. I cannot accept the assertion that exposure to smoke could have accelerated symptoms by anything like 3-5 years. The notion that smoke might advance symptoms is theoretically possible in extreme cases, but is not really supported by other than somewhat speculative, assertive evidence. These Claimants are all likely to have had pre-existing tear film instability which ebbed and flowed in the ordinary course of the condition. I accept the possibility that a few developed this dysfunction after the fire, but it is no more than guesswork to postulate that exposure to the smoke might have accelerated the process. Although Mr Clearkin did not advance the argument in this manner, I accept that it is possible that smoke exacerbated eye symptoms in previously vulnerable individuals, including those suffering from meibomian gland dysfunction, during the course of exposure to it and a recovery period thereafter. Whether the exposure to this smoke plume caused such an exacerbation is entirely case-specific and must be resolved on all the available evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">To my mind, the following matters of general application arising out of the clinical evidence from the eight experts I heard may be made at this stage. First, in all four disciplines the experts spoke of a gradation between mild irritation on the one end of the spectrum and severe inflammation at the other. Issues plainly arise in the grey area in the middle, but generally speaking I consider that it is valid to think in terms of irritation being transient, self-limiting and a normal physiological response, and inflammation being pathological and, albeit in all these cases non-permanent, probably over the line and into the realm of personal injury and actionable damage. This interlaces with my analysis of actionable damage in my section on the “Governing Law” (see paragraphs 178-181 above). Secondly, I accept Dr Hind’s evidence, read in conjunction with my interpretation of Professor Hay’s, that the lowest health thresholds for a chemical such as acrolein are probably designed to indicate the sort of concentrations where certain individuals may be expected to experience an irritant, rather than an inflammatory response. Thirdly, and as a heavy caveat on the previous point, it should continue to be recognised that there is considerable variability, vulnerability and range of tolerance thresholds over any given population. Fourthly, it is common ground between the experts that timing of onset of symptoms matters. In my judgment, the irritant response will be immediate, and in relation to an incident of this nature most people will be likely to know within a short space of time what is causing that response. It is the Claimants’ case, after all, that the smoke had a nasty, pungent smell. On the other hand, I agree with Mr Redfern that one might expect considerable variability as regards the timing of onset and offset of any inflammatory response. Finally, and to reiterate a previous conclusion of mine, I do not accept Mr Redfern’s submission that the medical evidence, viewed as a whole, supports the possibility of an additive, in the sense of a cumulative, response to sub-threshold exposures. The Claimants can do no better than rely on the trigger values (based on two, consecutive hourly means) and 24-hour means set out in the COMEAP report. </p>

Perhaps the most important, and controversial, of these is the argument advanced by the Claimants’ experts and not the Defendant’s that it is appropriate to draw inferences as to causation from the patterns they believed they discerned as to a common, time-associated constellation of symptoms.  </p>

The parties originally selected 40 Test Claimants (20 a piece) with the objective of examining the broad range of geographical and personal circumstances across the whole group.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I will examine the Test Claimants in the order in which they gave evidence before me. I need to explain my approach. At this stage I will be doing so without express reference to the plume modelling evidence. This is to avoid the potentially mechanistic thinking which underlay the Defendant’s clinical experts’ approach, namely that because any given Test Claimant was insufficiently exposed it must follow that s/he could not have suffered any symptoms from exposure. I believe that I have already made clear that a more fluid, less rigidly “scientific”, approach is required (at least at this stage in my decision-making), although I certainly should not be understood as saying that the plume modelling evidence can be ignored or circumvented. I will be returning to it at a later stage of my analysis. In assessing the Test Claimants, the focus will be primarily on the individual features of their cases, but I will be keeping an eye on a possible “bigger picture” and identification of patterns and constellations. However, this “bigger picture” cannot drive my inquiry, since that would be to commit the logical fallacy of assuming what needs to be proved. I have already said that I will be taking on board all the available evidence, but an issue does arise as to the weight to be given to expert clinical opinion on the Claimants’ side that, generally speaking, the Test Claimants were honest individuals who gave reliable accounts. Dr Swift and Dr August spoke in different terms but to the same effect of intuitive judgments forged from lengthy experience in historytaking and clinical examinations. The Defendant’s experts, on the other hand, deferred to me on these matters. </p>

It is striking in this case that by the stage any Test Claimant was seen by the experts in this case, there were no relevant signs to witness, and no enduring symptomatology. Accordingly, there was no possibility of correlating claimed symptoms with any meaningful clinical examination. It follows that the clinical experts were really in no better position than I was to assess matters of individual credibility and reliability, especially in a medico-legal (as distinct from a purely clinical) context. With respect to them, it might well be said that I was in a somewhat better position inasmuch as the </p>

I do not accept that there is any solid evidence supporting the proposition that some GP surgeries had signs discouraging appointments and encouraging over the counter remedies. Dr Hardy told me about this, but his sources are unclear and I did not hear it directly from any Test Claimant. I do accept Dr August’s point that it is understandable that some Claimants might not mention symptoms to their GPs at appointments for other complaints, but I cannot accept that this should be treated as a universal panacea. Nor can it explain a failure to mention the fire in instances where Claimants <span style="font-style:italic">were</span> attending their GPs complaining of what they now say are fire-related symptoms.

I am more inclined to accept the possibility of a record being incomplete than erroneous.

Owing to these, and to the fallibility of human recollection, it is inevitable that witnesses may be unreliable historians and unable to give me more than a general sense of what happened. Some allowances need to be made for this, but not to the point of excess. The burden of proof remains on the Claimants, and they need to satisfy me that they suffered the symptoms they claimed. In very many cases, apart from recourse to the wider picture of apparently similar complaints, the Claimants have nothing else to go on apart from their own evidence. </p>

I express the matter in those terms because I do not believe that Mrs Beatham was intent on deliberately misleading the court, and that in any event has (wisely) not been suggested. Mrs Beatham is, however, a good example of a suggestible witness who could not remember what actually happened, and therefore tended to say what she assumed could be right because that fitted into her mindset of what this fire must have caused.  </p>

Unless the plume modelling evidence is supportive and/or she is able to rely on a powerful intra-cohort “constellation of symptoms” effect, her claim should fail. </p>

Her eyes were sore and dry, she was constantly rubbing them, and although her symptoms resolved within two weeks, she believes that her myopia was brought on by this experience. She developed red and itchy patches across her torso and face, which made her self-conscious at school and caused problems with sleep. After two months, her GP diagnosed contact dermatitis, and after treatment it took a further two months for symptoms to resolve. She developed migrainous headaches which interfered with her exams, and rendered her unable to attend her maths A level exam (this must be a typographical error: according to her witness statement, this was a GCSE maths resit). These acute symptoms lasted for around 2 weeks. She also experienced dizzy spells, an increased temperature, and a sore throat. </p>

Reading through her substantial, pre-fire medical history, I cannot accept that explanation – it would only make sense if she had not associated her symptoms with the fire at all, which was not her case. She saw her GP again on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and he gave her a sickness certificate covering the period 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> – 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, presumably to excuse her from attendance at college. However, by then the exam season had concluded. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August her GP diagnosed “contact dermatitis”, and it is surprising that on this occasion Ms Alexander did not mention the fire if she believed, as she told me, that it had caused it.

Her eye and skin problems were pre-existing, and in her case there is nothing to cause me to wish to depart from the advice of Professor Hay regarding the absence of evidence linking dermatological symptoms to smoke. I cannot exclude the possibility that smoke exposure exacerbated Ms Alexander’s preexisting eye condition, but the resolution of that issue depends mainly on the plume modelling evidence. Otherwise, Ms Alexander’s case is in the same category as Mrs Beatham’s. </p>

In her first questionnaire, she stated that she first developed a sore throat, sore eyes and a headache within two days of the fire, and that these symptoms resolved within three to four months. She denied that she smoked or had any pre-existing skin condition. In her oral evidence, Ms Bunting agreed that the questionnaire was <span style="font-style:italic">“highly inaccurate”</span>, but a genuine mistake on her part. In her second questionnaire, completed about two months later, she stated that she developed symptoms within 24 hours of the fire, and that her respiratory symptoms lasted two months, her eye symptoms one week, and her skin problems three weeks. Her witness statement times the onset of symptoms at “within 48 hours”. </p>

According to her first questionnaire, <span style="font-style:italic">“I did only think it was a passing flu at first”</span>. However, in her oral evidence she said that she associated her symptoms with the fire straight away, and her sons had the same symptoms. When her attention was then drawn to the questionnaire, she said that it was a long time ago, and <span style="font-style:italic">“maybe I did think it was a passing flu at the time”</span>. In my judgment, this is the more likely explanation, particularly when it is noted that Ms Bunting attended her GP on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011. She went to see him for a long-term problem, but sought to persuade me that she did tell her GP about her cough and sore eyes. She could not explain why this was not recorded. She did accept that she could not recall if she attributed these problems to the fire. I cannot accept that there was any complaint to the GP on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Ms Bunting’s witness statement makes no mention of it. </p>

She told me that this was an omission in the GP notes, and that she did; but that answer is difficult to reconcile with the note of a complaint of a wheezy cough, which was in very similar vein to previous complaints. If there had been something new, it is highly likely that the GP would have recorded it. I have taken on board Mr Swift’s point, made in the context of Mrs Farrell’s case, that when people go to their GP they do not always mention all their symptoms; but her evidence was that she did so on this occasion. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, Mr McLoughlin’s skin symptoms require consideration within the ambit of the overall frame of the toxicological evidence in this case. As I have already made clear, that evidence is unsupportive. As for his eye complaints, Mr Clearkin’s view is that these lasted just two weeks, but he did not accept that this presentation was more consistent with infection than tear film instability. I have difficulty with Mr Clearkin’s logic, and I take Mr Marsh’s point that eye problems do not appear to have been mentioned at the GP consultation on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June.  </p>

On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June he re-attended: he was still <span style="font-style:italic">“bunged up”</span>, and the GP prescribed a short course of steroids.

The possibility that the fire exacerbated his symptoms cannot be excluded, but cannot be substantiated on the balance of probabilities on the basis of Mr Shaw’s account alone. If the cough in fact developed on Saturday, when Mr Shaw as at home far away from the scope of the smoke, Dr Hardy conceded that <span style="font-style:italic">“it’s not due to the smoke, I guess”</span>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Looking first of all at acrolein, it is clear that the majority of the Test Claimants were exposed to levels greater than the odour recognition threshold for many hours, the maximum being 44 hours (for Shaun West). The minimum levels of hourly exceedances are for Jessica Alexander (6 hours), Kelly Colebourne (2 hours), Karen Court (3 hours), Terence Dunn (4 hours), Teri O’Brien (3 hours), James Reece (zero) and Steven Woolvine (2 hours). However, as I have already said the odour recognition threshold is not a health threshold; for that, and as an indicative startingpoint, I have taken a value of 146 μg/m³ for acrolein. The maximum theoretical hourly concentration for any Test Claimant is 12.01μg/m³, i.e. more than 10 times below this level. In fact, this Test Claimant is Peter Shaw who happened not to be at work on that day, and so was not exposed to such a dose. The second highest concentration is 9.48 μg/m³ (for Shaun West); for the vast majority of the Test Claimants the exposures are below 3 μg/m³. I appreciate that the 146 μg/m³ threshold is a trigger value, and not an hourly mean, but given the nature of this fire I doubt whether over relatively short periods of time this makes a significant difference. It would only have done so if the wind had changed over the course of any relevant hour. </p>

Here, I have taken the COMEAP trigger value of 107 μg/m³. In their remodelling, CERC has included the Briery Hey background concentrations because this was in accordance with my directions and ordinary tortious principles. For the vast majority of the Test Claimants, their maximum exposures were on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011, and their highest recorded level was 100 μg/m³ (for a single hour – as to which, see paragraph 443 below). The modelling for these Claimants does not show two consecutive hours’ exceedances; indeed, in most instances the hourly exposures were in the range of 10-50 μg/m³ (and typically within the band of 20-30 μg/m³) - in other words, at or scarcely above the background concentrations recorded at Briery Hey. There are a limited number of Test Claimants who fare somewhat better (in the forensic sense) with regard to the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s.

For Messrs Shaw and Swift, and Master Bradley Woods, their exposures were well below the CERC guideline values for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s (of 51 μg/m³ for vulnerable persons and 76 μg/m³ for non-vulnerable) and for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2.5</span>s (of 36 μg/m³ for vulnerable persons and 55 μg/m³ for non-vulnerable). Moreover, their exposures were not significantly above the Briery Hey background levels. However, on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June Gary Mangan’s 24-hour mean concentrations were 54.3 μg/m³ for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s and 35.8 μg/m³ for the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2.5</span>s. Likewise, on the same day Shaun West’s mean concentrations were 65.6 μg/m³ and 45.0 μg/m³ respectively. Thus, it is open to them argue that there were certainly in the vicinity or “ball-park” of the 24-hour thresholds, depending on whether they should be regarded as vulnerable. </p>

Save for 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, her exposures to the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10</span>s were broadly similar to the bulk of the Test Claimants’, namely not substantially above background concentrations. The fact that her home is approximately 200m south of Messrs Mangan and West materially affects her exposure levels.

On my reckoning, a maximum of 250 individuals could have been living within the outer contour line. Their cases have not been individually examined, but it is possible that some of these could demonstrate two consecutive hours’ exposure above the COMEAP trigger values. That, without more, would not be sufficient to prove actionable injury, but it would at least be a modest platform.

An element of uncertainty has afflicted the exercise at every stage: as to Dr Mitcheson’s heat release rates; the selection of the appropriate emission factors; the toxicology (at these low-exposure levels); and the plume modelling. However, three points need to be made. First, in relation to these issues I have applied a liberal approach throughout this judgment: that is to say, an approach which favours the Claimants where the evidence permits it. Secondly, the vast majority of the Test Claimants have fallen a long way short of demonstrating any significant exposures. Thirdly, there is no obvious reason why the Claimants should be the greater victims of scientific uncertainty than the Defendant. In my view, uncertainty is likely to be normally distributed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I have mentioned the scientific uncertainties in connection with the ascertainment of the toxicological thresholds for low exposures. A related question arises as to whether the thresholds should be lowered to reflect pre-existing vulnerability. Many of the Test Claimants did not enjoy good general health, despite some of their assertions to the contrary. Many may have been prone to respiratory problems, and all those who were seen by the ophthalmologists have current signs of meibomian gland dysfunction. A number of Test Claimants, in particular Edmund Kenny, Kelly Colebourne and Annette Farrell, had pre-existing asthma. However, putting that aside for one moment, there is a lack of any solid, quantitative basis for making a discount for vulnerability. Many Claimants might have been vulnerable, but there is no proper means of assessing or quantifying this. Dr Hardy asserted that those without preexisting pathologies tended to recover within 3-6 weeks of exposure, whereas those who were vulnerable required 3-6 months; but that assertion is simply not borne out </p>

In any event, the level of discount must be an exercise in speculation, and for the vast majority of Test Claimants it would have to be very considerable for them to get anywhere. I note too that the differences between the COMEAP thresholds for vulnerable and nonvulnerable individuals are not great, and certainly well short of the magnitudes which would be required to avail any vulnerable Test Claimant. </p>

Listening as I did to all the Test Claimants give their evidence, the accounts they gave of the smoke plume and of the nature and severity of their symptoms bore no relationship with their modelled exposures. The smell and duration of the smoke was described in more or less exactly the same way irrespective of location. Indeed, I might be forgiven for thinking that some of the Test Claimants who in fact lived the furthest away from the plant were almost adjacent to it. Overall, the claimed symptoms appeared to be independent of exposure and dose. It was as if the Test Claimants had experienced a monolithic phenomenon. I appreciate that human beings differ, but I would expected to have heard accounts which varied according to the now ascertained doses. </p>

As soon as that process occurred, the inconsistencies and weaknesses in most of the Test cases became evident. Furthermore, as soon as the plume modelling evidence is factored into the equation – as it has never been by the Claimants’ clinical team – the claims become weaker still.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, there are serious weaknesses in the Claimants’ overall case which I need to make explicit. I have already alluded to some of them. First, the case is severely damaged by the delay in bringing these claims and the absence of any contemporaneous evidence. Had 16,000 people really suffered symptoms of the severity claimed, one would surely have seen evidence of complaints to newspapers and to the local council, increases in GP attendances, and some contemporary record of a problem. None has been brought to my attention. Secondly, recall bias is always an issue in scientific research based on retrospective evidence, and this phenomenon is hugely magnified when one brings into the equation the obvious corollaries of the medico-legal component. Human beings are naturally susceptible and suggestible, particularly if they are made to believe that they form part of a coherent group with shared experiences, and if they risk none of their own resources in bringing a claim. The standard-form questionnaires asked a series of leading questions. Many of the questionnaires examined in the context of the Test Claimants were shown to be inaccurate and exaggerated, calling into question the objectivity and integrity of the whole process. Nor does the whole set up of pop-up shops and cold-calling of potential Claimants inspire any degree of confidence. </p>

That this information was understood in exactly this way is revealed by the terms of the Facebook posts referred to at paragraphs 9, 10 and 12 of Ms Wilson’s witness statement, as well as by the evidence in Leon Swift’s case.

Plainly, neither Dr Hardy nor Dr Hind made a contemporaneous examination. Mr Kenny has the benefit of no contemporaneous medical examination, and retrospective diagnosis is problematic.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Where does the truth lie in all of this? It is not my function to say what the truth is; my role is limited to deciding whether these claims succeed or fail, applying standard legal methods. However, out of fairness to the Claimants my conclusions about what happened in June 2011 are as follows. There is no unified field theory or overarching explanation. The majority of Claimants experienced an extremely nasty, unusual smell and some may have been concerned about the possible consequences, albeit not so concerned to seek medical advice. Many Claimants - it is not clear to me how many – suffered some symptoms of shortness of breath, lacrimation and soreness of the throat. These symptoms were short-lived, as were any significant quantities of smoke. For the majority of the time, the smoke was blowing away from the plant. The better view on all the available evidence is that these symptoms did not exceed the hurdle the law sets for actionable personal injury, because they were symptoms of irritation rather than of inflammation. It is difficult to say for how long the smoke and these mild symptoms lasted, but I have in mind a maximum period of about one week. Many months later – it is unclear exactly how and why - lawyers arrived on the scene and sensed the opening of a business opportunity. It proved not very difficult to recruit willing Claimants to the group, not least because there was a lot of ill-feeling in the neighbourhood directed towards Sonae, and many people genuinely believed that they must have been harmed in some way. The legal process preyed on human susceptibility and vulnerability, and the rest is history. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I accept that for a period of time, probably 2-3 days, there were deposits of ash and dust which proved recalcitrant and pervasive. It is regrettable that Dr Mitcheson was not cross-examined about this, but I am not prepared to disbelieve the entirety of the Claimants’ evidence on this point. However, I should not be understood as excluding from account the probability of poetic licence and exaggeration. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Previously, I have referred to a maximum of 250 people living within the outer contour line on the CERC contour maps marking exposures to the micro-particles at above the COMEAP trigger values (albeit, I reiterate, not for two consecutive hours). I do not know how many of these are Claimants. I cannot exclude the possibility that some of these might have suffered personal injury, but I have three observations. First, the Claimants have only asked me to examine one individual within this sub-</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">cohort, namely Gary Mangan. Presumably, he was selected because he was representative of the others, and/or because those advising the Claimants believed that he would be a good witness. My observation would be that if there were stronger cases within this sub-group, they should have been put forward as Test claims. Secondly, I suspect that only those with pre-existing conditions might have had a realistic prospect of proving actionable damage. I should not be interpreted as overlooking the fact that all these individuals fell vastly below the relevant health threshold for acrolein, and well below the PM<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">10 </span>levels at which significant numbers of children complained of symptoms as demonstrated in the Californian Wildfires study (see paragraph 157 above). Thirdly, after a multi-million pound group action which has failed, in my judgment it would scarcely be proportionate to start examining even a handful of these cases, in the pursuit of identifying what would be, at best, modest claims. In my judgment, the Claimants’ chance has come and gone.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There are clear lessons to be learned from this litigation. The Claimants’ legal team should have worked out the science at a much earlier stage. Working on a reasonable best case scenario (as I have done), sound toxicological evidence (which they had at their disposal) and plume modelling, they should have investigated whether the case stacked up. Instead, at all material times, the Claimants’ legal team appear to have wanted to make a virtue out of uncertainty – perhaps because they clung to the notion that the litigation would settle.  Alternatively, they believed that the judge would not be that interested in the science, and/or they placed undue faith on the likely cogency of the lay evidence.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On all counts, they have been proven wrong. Further, rather than give the Claimants the opportunity to rely positively on uncertainty, I have taken proactive steps to enable further modelling to be undertaken, thereby creating as robust an evidential basis as human ingenuity may currently provide. The Claimants have lost no money, but their expectations, always unsustainable in my view, have not been fulfilled. I regret that their hopes were raised in the first place. </p>
