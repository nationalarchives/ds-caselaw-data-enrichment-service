The largest island in the group is Diego Garcia; its irregular u-shaped sides enclose a large, deep lagoon. The group includes the Salomon islands, the islands of Peros Banhos, as well as a number of smaller islands.</span>

The contracts could only be renewed in front of a Magistrate on his occasional, supposedly annual, visits but even that was not routinely done, at least in latter years. Contracts were sometimes renewed when a worker returned from Mauritius following leave or a trip for medical purposes.</span>

Some of the children would leave for Mauritius, where relatives might be and to which they looked for a more varied life; they might simply not return. Others would become, from an early age, and after at best the most rudimentary and brief education, plantation workers. They would inter-marry, or marry Mauritian recruited labourers and in turn have families. After the Second World War, Seychelles’ labourers were recruited as well, and some too inter-married, or married existing residents starting families on the islands.</span>

The company acquired almost all of the plantation islands, of Diego Garcia, Peros Banhos, the Salomon Islands, and Agalega from the Mauritian companies which had owned them. The company intended to and did run the coconut plantations for the production of copra; it believed that they could be revived and run profitably, notwithstanding years of decline.</span>

A joint UK/US memorandum agreed on a course of political action, including the need to separate the requisite dependencies from Mauritius and the Seychelles.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The independence of Mauritius was imminent and the independence of the Seychelles was at least anticipated. The United States did not wish its facilities to be dependant on the goodwill and stability of such newly independent countries, whose view of American defence facilities in the Indian Ocean might not have coincided with its own. It proposed that the islands be detached from Mauritius and the Seychelles and formed into another, separate dependant territory. It was recognised that the establishment of a new dependency or colony would attract criticism in the United Nations, even more so were it to be created to facilitate an American military presence in the Indian Ocean. From an early stage, the United Kingdom and United States Governments recognised that the transfer or resettlement of those on the islands would be necessary, both for the effective security and operation of the military facility and to avoid the prospect of the new dependency becoming subject to international obligations in Article 73 of the UN Charter to protect the population and to develop their constitutional rights, perhaps towards independence. Islands populated by contract workers or with an insignificant population which could be transferred or easily resettled were obviously attractive in those respects.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In 1964, in pursuit of this objective, a joint Anglo-American survey of the islands including their population was undertaken. Its purpose was not publicised. It found little trace of the once distinctive Diego Garcian community. In 1965, the United Kingdom decided to proceed with the detachment of the islands. Discussions were held between the UK Government and the Governments of Mauritius and of the Seychelles upon the terms of the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius and of Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches from the Seychelles. Agreement was reached on the detachment of the islands subject to the payment of compensation to the governments, compensation to the landowners and the payment of resettlement costs. The Mauritius Government was to receive compensation of £3m plus the resettlement costs; the Seychelles Government was to be provided with a new civil airport on Mahe.</span>

They would also remain citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. This dual citizenship was not publicised at the time. Before the creation of BIOT, and yet more so thereafter, it was becoming clearer than perhaps had been thought in 1964, following the survey report, that there were inhabitants of Chagos who had been born there and some were second or third generation Ilois. This was a problem, and the morality and lawfulness of their removal in principle, of its manner, of the way in which others who had left voluntarily were unable to return to the Chagos and of their subsequent treatment has been debated for more than 30 years.</span>

The submission said that some 128 or 34% of the inhabitants of Diego Garcia were second-generation inhabitants. Various possibilities for their resettlement and the resettlement of other workers were canvassed. Agalega, Peros Banhos and the Salomon Islands were seen as possibilities because of their coconut plantations, working in which was the only skill which the Ilois and many other contract workers possessed. But the US was still unable to say whether any other islands would be required or when; and even after acceptance of its request in September 1968, it did not want its proposals publicised. This, unsurprisingly, discouraged commercial investment in other island plantations. Even if no defence facilities were ultimately constructed, the UK Government considered that it would be useful to avoid there being any permanent inhabitants in BIOT, so as to preclude obligations arising under Article 73 of the UN Charter or any other costs if the plantations were to close for economic reasons.</span>

The need for immigration legislation to back up the Government’s stated position as to the absence of an indigenous population, as well as to prevent people entering BIOT after the islands had been evacuated came to the fore.

Political protest and hunger strikes by women became a feature of the campaign by the Ilois for what they saw as their rights. The various Ilois committees made claims for £8m in compensation from the UK Government in the spring of 1981.

By early December, the CIOF, recognising that any settlement would have to be supported by the whole Ilois community, nonetheless put forward a figure of £6m as further and final compensation, without abandoning its contention that £8m was fully justified. Various Ilois groups met the High Commissioner to Mauritius to press their urgent cause; he made the same point: any settlement had to have the support of the whole community. No-one wanted a repeat of the events in 1979 when an agreement appeared to have been reached with many Ilois, but not on terms which were acceptable to all shades of opinion. As at other times, the definition of an Ilois and an assessment of their numbers were problematic for both sides, because that had a crucial effect on the calculation of compensation on a per capita basis as well as reflecting on the numbers whose agreement had to be obtained once they had been identified. Bindmans, advising the CIOF, were investigating the rights which the Ilois had over land, in contrast to the Vencatessen case which focused on tortious aspects.

Mr Ramdass was again a delegate because of the Vencatessen case. The UK Government’s opening offer was £2.5m based on 426 families or 1,150 people who had left Chagos for Mauritius after the creation of BIOT. The sum was calculated by reference to the cost of a plot of land, the building of a house, and a capital sum for the establishment of a business.

The nature and effectiveness of those provisions was at issue in this case.

The Trust Fund was to be managed by a Board of Trustees which included five representatives of the Ilois, initially appointed and subsequently subject to elections. The purpose of the Fund was to disburse the UK and Mauritius Government monies, together with a sum provided by the Indian Government, in promoting the economic and social welfare of the Ilois and of the Ilois community in Mauritius. The Seychelles workers, Ilois and Government were not involved in these discussions. The Seychelles islands within BIOT, Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches were never evacuated and they were returned to the Seychelles on its independence in 1976.</span>

When the Ilois went to the Social Security Office to collect this final sum, they were presented with a renunciation form to sign, or far more commonly, to put their thumbprint to. This form was a one-page legal document, written in legal English, without a Creole translation, (A647). Ilois members of the ITFB were on hand to witness the thumbprint or to identify the individual, but on the Claimants’ case, they did not, and were in no position to, translate or explain the purport of the document. Only 12 refused to sign, including Simon Vencatessen; he did not receive this last tranche of money, although his wife did. He understood the purport of the renunciation form.</span>

But the Ilois, short of money and needing every penny, were seeking its release in view of the large number of renunciation forms, at least 1,332 and later 1,339, which had been signed. It appears from the Claimants’ case that at least 1,344 Ilois had received compensation.

These matters rumbled on through the late 1980s. The ITFB in 1989 noted that an Ilois demonstration, seeking another delegation from the Mauritius Government to negotiate further compensation from the UK Government, was told by the President that the 1982 Agreement meant that compensation could now only be sought on a humanitarian basis.

There were 5,023 (4,959) Claimants; the Particulars of Claim provide a breakdown; all but 631 (570) were related to Mauritius; only 58 (24) related to Agalega; the rest, 573 (546), related to the Seychelles. Only 1,075 (1,072) of the 5,023 (4,959) were born on the islands; 557 (542) were deceased natives claiming through their heirs. The rest were the children of natives, alive or dead; of those 475 (461) were under 12. They are all listed by name in Schedule 2 to the Group Litigation Order. I should add at this stage that in the course of closing submissions, the Claimants handed in revised figures which total 4,959, though the accompanying note suggests 4,466 Claimants. I have put the breakdown of the figures totalling 4,959 in brackets above. Nothing much turns on the differences, but it illustrates the difficulties of testing individual claims.</span>

It was Chagos Agalega Company Limited and the subsequent management company, Moulinie &amp; Co, which was responsible for reducing the number of workers, for recruitment and organising the transport of the workers and their dependants to Mauritius, Agalega and the Seychelles upon closure of the islands. BIOT was created to enable the United Kingdom to enter into an agreement with the United States of America for the advancement of their mutual defence and security interests. It was admitted that the plantations were run down and closed as a result of the UK/US Agreements and the subsequent decisions of the United States in respect of Diego Garcia.

It was denied that the Defendants knew or ought to have known that the compensation arrangements might prove unacceptable or inadequate or that they were aware that any losses would be caused for which they would not be compensated by their departure from the islands in terms of real or moveable property.</span>

In respect of Diego Garcia, it was said that it was not practical in view of the importance of Diego Garcia to defence interests for any Claimants to return to Diego Garcia, and that in respect of the other islands, the practicalities of the American attitude in 1969 onwards for a number of years made investment in those islands impracticable. Although the Immigration Ordinance 2000 permitted Chagossians to return to BIOT except for Diego Garcia, the Defendants were not obliged to undertake the investment required for a viable resettlement of those islands.</span>

The pleadings were vague or incomplete as to many factual assertions; yet filling in those gaps, the full extent or implications of which could lead to further facts becoming relevant, through the taking of instructions over long distances from largely illiterate people dealing with events long ago via interpreters and then rendering the answers into pleadings, would be very expensive, time consuming and of debateable completeness or accuracy; live witnesses would be able to deal with those issues immediately, and the true scope of what they wished to say ascertained, clarified and checked or tested. As the aim of the Defendants was to defeat the whole or large parts of the case without a full trial, in circumstances where the Claimants were elderly, at least in their eyes had suffered at the hands of the very colonial power from which they were seeking justice, and were suspicious that as illiterate Creole citizens they were discriminated against in comparison with other colonial citizens, it was only just that the Claimants should have their opportunity to have their say, and should not feel as though the lawyers had dealt with it behind their backs.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The hearing in the end lasted 37 days, not without some gaps. Many more witnesses were called by the Claimants than had been anticipated. They were called to deal with concerns which I raised during the hearing, with particular reference to the limitation and abuse arguments. Those concerns revolved around what the Claimants knew generally about the 1982 settlement, the Vencatessen litigation, the distribution of the £4m by the ITFB and, as it transpired, subsequent occasions when legal advice was sought by the Ilois. I felt that there were many significant witnesses who had not been called, the absence of whom was very surprising in the light of the contentions. The disclosure of documents from both the Defendants’ and Claimants’ files continued through the hearing and while written closing submissions were being prepared. Both sides complained about the inadequacy of the others disclosure. Some relevant documents were not in the control of either party.</span>

I am grateful to the many who acted as interpreters, for a language with few interpreters, many of whom, including a former President of Mauritius, came at short notice, at some disruption to their own lives.</span>

It was unjust that they should have no personal adjudication on the wrongs which they had suffered and the claims which they brought. His clients had been treated unjustly; it was unthinkable that a British Government could so treat the Chagossians. They had been displaced as a people by the Government of the United Kingdom which had eschewed any governmental obligation to them and was now seeking to prevent adjudication on the wrongs done to them. They had never had "</span>

Had they been removed by the UK from the Archipelago to Mauritius while the islands were still part of Mauritius before independence, or had they been removed by Mauritius after independence from islands which had remained constitutionally part of Mauritius, the removal itself would not have generated claims about exile or a removal which was in principle one which no Government could inflict on its citizens. They would have been removed from one part of Mauritius to another part in the public interest, whether for defence purposes or because the islands’ economy could no longer sustain them. Of course, the politics involved in such a route would have been completely different; it would not have been sufficiently certain for the UK or US Governments and the internal politics of Mauritius never contemplated such a course.</span>

But it is to deal with the issues ordered to be dealt with, as to an extent they evolved during the hearing; it includes strike-out proceedings but it is also an application for summary judgment. Still less, however, would any trial of the action be a form of public inquiry into the overall actions or omissions of the UK Government towards the Chagossians over three decades and more, notwithstanding many comments and arguments from him which were more addressed to heaping moral opprobrium on the Defendants than to dealing with the issues to which the applications give rise. Neither the applications nor any trial of the action would constitute a high level, independent and comprehensive review of the rights of the Chagossians, the absence of which Mr Allen complained about. Nor could any trial constitute an inquiry at a general level into governmental wrongdoing or incompetence.</span>

Ill-treatment does not require a hopeless case to be allowed to continue. Indeed, to raise false hopes would not be fair.

I have not heard oral evidence from the Defendants on any issues of real significance, although I have had a great deal of material in the form of documentary evidence about what happened over the years, upon which the Defendants rely. It does appear that, in the absence of unexpectedly compelling evidence to the contrary, at least some Claimant Chagossians could show that they were treated shamefully by successive UK Governments. Whatever view might be taken of the importance of the strategic defence aims underlying the creation of BIOT, the evacuation of the islands and the establishment of the base on Diego Garcia, some who had lived there for generations were uprooted from the only way of life which they knew and were taken to Mauritius and the Seychelles where little or no provision for their reception, accommodation, future employment and well-being had been made. Ill-suited to their surroundings, poverty and misery became their common lot for years. The Chagossians alone were made to pay a personal price for the defence establishment on Diego Garcia, which was regarded by the UK and US Governments as necessary for the defence of the West and its values. Many were given nothing for years but a callous separation from their homes, belongings and way of life and a terrible journey to privation and hardship. Such arrangements as were made in the early 1970s did not take effect for several years and came too little and too late to alleviate their problems. An eventual accord in 1982, driven by litigation, produced an offer which was intended to improve their sad conditions but which was not evidently generous. Their poverty, sadness and sense of loss and displacement impel their continuing desire to return to the islands which were their home.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It was the Claimants who wanted to provide some oral evidence for the purpose of these applications. Initially, this evidence was to show the way of life which they had led on the Chagos, the manner in which they had been compelled to leave the islands or prevented from returning to them, the harsh conditions of their voyages to Seychelles and Mauritius and the destitution in which they had been left there for so long, without assistance or compensation from the UK Government. It was to re-assert their entitlement to return, and their strong attachment to the Chagos, indeed to particular islands within the Archipelago. But it became clear to me during the cross-examination of the witnesses whom the Claimants had initially decided to call, that there was much relevant evidence on other issues in respect of which obvious witnesses were not being called. Those issues related to the series of negotiations leading to the 1982 Agreement, the Agreement itself, the signing or thumbing of renunciation forms, the way in which the ITFB had dealt with those forms, the withdrawal of the Vencatessen litigation and the nature and extent of the legal advice which, over the years, the Ilois, or some of them at any rate, had received and to which publicity had been given. Those issues were directly relevant to the Claimants’ case on limitation.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The evidence of the individual Chagossians was given through interpreters of varying experience. Some of the Chagossians were elderly; some had been very young when they left the Chagos and arrived in Mauritius and the Seychelles. Inevitably, for all, the events surrounding the 1982 Agreement were twenty years past. The individuals were mostly illiterate in any language, spoke only Creole, and lacked significant education. Documents had to be translated in the witness box, and could not be read by them to assist understanding or recollection. Legal concepts were, not surprisingly, poorly understood, at least at any level of complexity, though the witnesses all had and expressed a strong sense of their rights as they perceived them and what rights they would or would not give up. Some legal ideas, notably the making of a claim or bringing proceedings, lacked a clear or consistent Creole translation. Witnesses were also often troubled by ideas of time, how long ago something had happened, and whether something had happened at the same time as something else. Witnesses would sometimes lose the thread of the questions, and could not be brought back to it, and when reminded of what they had recently said, would deny it or give a very different answer as that earlier question was then put again. Accordingly, their evidence requires a careful appraisal.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">But certain observations are apposite at this stage. It was plain that the written witness statements, which for the most part the witnesses were prepared to adopt as true, could not be regarded as accurate or reliable or as the witnesses’ testimony on many aspects. The language of many of the witness statements was far too advanced and detailed to be the true recollection of the actual witness in anything approaching their own words. It appears that one of the problems with the way in which the statements were taken in Mauritius is that the person preparing the statement provided information in it which may be true, for example exchange rates, but which is not within the knowledge of the deponent. This leads to a false impression of the witness’ knowledge. It is impossible to tell the extent to which the written statement has been influenced by the statement taker, no doubt acting in good faith, or the extent to which the statement has been affected by the way in which the story has been taken down in Creole and translated into English and then back again.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">But, even making those allowances, there are some surprising errors in the witness statements and some surprising omissions. There was a surprising lack of material in the witness statements on issues of real importance including the relevant material for the claim to property rights by prescription, as to their beliefs about the nature and purpose of the 1982 Agreement, the existence of the renunciation forms and what they and the Chagossian community more generally had known or believed about the availability of legal advice, and about certain of the wrongs said to have been done, such as the alleged denial of British citizenship. This is not a criticism that each document upon which the witnesses were cross-examined should have been previously considered, but there was often scarcely a reference to important aspects.</span>

Some answers would be given to questions about events which they at other times would deny happened or deny that they remembered. The frequency with which witnesses were unable to remember events or simply did not know about them itself suggested that they had unreliable memories of events now too long ago for more reliable evidence to be forthcoming. Indeed, the lawyers who gave evidence were often unable to do more than rely upon the documents for their recollection as to what had happened.</span>

At times, Mr Allen’s repeated emphasis on their naivety and ignorance as an explanation was overstated and did the Chagossians in their determination and endeavour less than justice. Many were, I concluded, alive to the significance of the passage of time since 1982 and the importance of what they had or had not been told about their rights and used their asserted poor recollections as a device to avoid facing up to evidential problems. For some, this did not appear to be an unfamiliar refuge. Even if that were too harsh a judgment, those gaps in memory show how difficult it now is for reliable evidence to be given on important issues.</span>

There was an element in her evidence of collective memory, that is, evidence which describes what happened to others, where she was absent, as if she had been present and which might be true. There was also undoubtedly confusion of language and thought and an inability to relate questions and answers to specific times. The strength and depth of feeling for Diego Garcia and the emotions attached to her experiences are entirely genuine. The general picture of life on Chagos, the fears of simple and in every sense ill-informed people, and the general picture of life in Mauritius can be taken, for present purposes and in view of the limited scope for challenge, as a basis for showing the general picture which the Claimants’ overall might be able to prove at trial. Mr Howell did not take substantive issue with them for these purposes.

She was in a general sense aware of the significance which that had for the case as a whole. I do not regard her as having been a truthful witness in a number of instances. If that judgment is too harsh, she is, by reason of the passage of time, a witness whose memory is no longer reliable on specific and important individual details. Her evidence had real significance because, overall, it showed how difficult it would be, with the passage of time, to place reliance on what she said in detail. She was not alone in this; it was commonplace among the Chagossian witnesses. It goes directly to their prospects of success.</span>

She was born on Diego Garcia in 1961 and her parents and her grandparents had also been born on the Chagos islands. Her brothers and sisters had been born there too. She described a stress-free existence. Her mother had never had to work. She had had a happy childhood with plenty to eat. She left Diego Garcia in 1971 for Peros Banhos and then had gone to the Seychelles with her parents. She described the harshness of life there, the difficulties of obtaining Seychelles citizenship, and the occasional contacts with Mauritian Ilois groups. Her father had set up an informal group which she helped with. The Seychelles Government had done nothing to help and the Ilois were frightened of making a fuss in what became a one-party state in case they were deported. She could afford no lawyers.</span>

Her husband did administrative work for the company, accounting work and keeping the registers. She did no employed work. Her house was in concrete blocks with iron sheets, four bedrooms and other rooms. When she left Diego Garcia, she had had to leave behind all her furniture, all the flowers and fruits of her garden, all her animals, ducks, chickens and so on.

She went with her husband and all the young children. She expected to be in Mauritius for just three months, but after her child had died on Mauritius, she went to the office of Rogers &amp; Co to seek to return. Mr Autard of Rogers &amp; Co said to her in Creole three times that Peros Banhos had been closed and he could not arrange for her passage back to Peros Banhos, that all the islands had been sold by the English, and that it would be too dangerous there because of the bombs.

The contradiction between 1968 and 1973 is plain on the face of her statement, however. There was other confusion over whom she travelled with, her son Alex and his five children or not; her Judicial Review statement had said so, but this time she denied it.

After two years, her mother found work as a part-time maid, but her step-father got no employment at all. She started work as a maid servant at the age of sixteen, which would mean it was about 1968.

This suggested either that he was mistaken about being refused a return passage, or that such refusals happened because of employment reasons quite independently of BIOT. At all events, by 1971, he must have known something of Mauritian ways. He said that he established not so much a committee as a small family group, which included Mr Piron and Mr Saminaden. Michel Vencatessen was his uncle. Committee or not, he organised petitions and by 1974 agreed that he had become recognised as an Ilois leader along with others in his group. He was in contact with Ilois in different communities including Mrs Alexis. He had been an Ilois representative on the Resettlement Committee and had been involved in setting up the Michel Vencatessen litigation and in meeting with Mr Sheridan in 1979 when 1,200 quittances were signed.

He said that he often got confused. What he could remember was often unreliable and plainly in conflict with reliable contemporaneous material. His evidence changed repeatedly. He could not remember evidence he had given recently. Although he was elderly, not in good health and his wife in Mauritius was unwell, he was clearly evasive at times when his memory was not playing him tricks, and some of his answers were untrue. There was clearly some pressure on him from Mrs Alexis, not just as a result of past disagreements in 1979, 1980 and subsequently, but also directly as a result of him accusing her in court, correctly as it happens, of having been engaged in fraud on the ITFB. (This led to an altercation outside court. Mr Ramdass repeatedly denied that there had been any communication between them; but he later changed his evidence to say that they had only spoken about food; Mrs Alexis always spoke in a loud voice. He explained that he could not remember why he had said what he had said and denied that there had been any conversation at all and wanted to apologise to Mrs Alexis. He denied being afraid of her. From all that I had been told, this was plainly untrue. Indeed, after a sequence of denials by Mrs Alexis that there had been any conversation at all between them, she admitted that in fact they had been talking but only about what to eat. She too persistently lied over that.)</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Whether or not his evidence was the result of evasion or forgetfulness, I am quite satisfied that in 1981 he knew of the role of the litigation in the settlement negotiations and of his role as the representative of Mr Vencatessen’s interests. I reject as incredible the idea that in 1979 and 1980 he had no idea what were the basic requirements of the UK Government in relation to a settlement as relayed to his group by Mr Sheridan. Likewise, I regard as incredible his contention that he had no idea what was in the letters or petition which were organised by the JIC. Mrs Alexis, according to reports, had denounced the petition saying that people had not understood what was in it. There is nothing to suggest that Mr Ramdass was surprised at what had been done in his name in 1980. It was all of a piece with what had happened in 1979. It is difficult to see how he could only have found out about the contents of the letters in court in the light of his witness statement or in the light of his answer that he had begun to distance himself from Mr Mundil because Mr Mundil had betrayed them. He could not remember the manner in which he was saying he had been betrayed. Mr Ramdass said also in his evidence that he could no longer understand all the letters that were written relating to his group and in his name, in which negotiations leading to a final settlement had been discussed, because he was now too old. That may be the explanation, but it does not add to the reliability of his evidence.</span>

Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents had also been born there as had her husband and all but two of her children. She, her husband and children had gone to Mauritius in 1967 when her husband needed medical treatment. When that was concluded, Rogers &amp; Co said that the islands were closed. They had suffered terribly after that because they were unable to return and all their things were left behind. They got a small house through an aunt of her husband. It was plain from all the documentary material, though not from her witness statement, that she had been a leading figure in the endeavours by the Chagossians over twenty or more years to gain compensation and the right to return to the islands. She was involved in setting up a committee in July 1979 which was instrumental in leading opposition to the quittances brought by Mr Sheridan. This Beau Bassin Committee evolved into the CIOF of which she became President. She was on the delegations which negotiated in 1981 in London and in 1982 in Mauritius. Subsequently, she was on the ITFB for a number of years. She became President of and remained active in the CRG. She was a regular visitor to the British High Commission in Mauritius seeking more money and assistance in various ways. She participated in various campaigns including demonstrations and hunger strikes over the years. She was convicted of making a fraudulent claim on the ITFB in respect of her two dead children; she served three months. She had an undoubted strength of character, a conviction in the rightness of her cause and in the ill done to the Chagossians. She said if things were going wrong, Ilois would come to her and if a row or noise were necessary, she would play her part. She was also willing to lie and did so on a number of occasions, including about her altercation with Mr Ramdass over his pointing out that she had been involved in fraud. Her manner on that occasion, about which there is no doubt that she was lying, sullen, downcast and dogged, was repeated on a number of occasions, although I recognise the limitations of demeanour as a guide to truthfulness, especially of a witness from a different background mediated through a translator. Like other Chagossian witnesses, she took refuge in her illiteracy and in the passage of time since a number of the events about which she gave evidence, to avoid facing up to important but difficult questions for their case.</span>

His witness statement did not mention his living in Mauritius for fifteen years up to 1967 because he had not been asked about it. He then said he had gone from Peros Banhos to work on Diego Garcia, but on his timings he must have returned to Peros Banhos. In 1973, the islands closed. He was forced to leave and they went to Mauritius. He lived in Dockers Flats for fifteen years after he returned to Mauritius. In 1973, he met Christian and Eddy Ramdass and Michel Vencatessen and they started to make representations to the Governments for financial support. Michel Vencatessen was his brother-in-law. He became part of a group with those three, together with Mr Piron and Mrs Vythilingam. He was on it to represent people deported in 1973. The others represented those who had come earlier. He represented the Dockers Flats area, Mr Piron another area and Mr Ramdass and Mrs Vythilingam lived in Roche Bois.

Not all the problems were down to the lapse of time, although, with him, there was clearly a good deal of room for an honest lack of comprehension of all the details, as well as for the comprehension, which there might once have been, to have disappeared. Mr Saminaden was inclined to downplay the significance of his role in advancing the Vencatessen litigation, in liaising with Mr Sheridan and his role on the Resettlement Committee as a representative of the Ilois from Dockers Flats. The impression might be gained that the Chagos organisation in the 1970s was rather less than in fact it had been. There were a number of discrepancies between the oral evidence and the witness statement, for example over whether he saw Mr Sheridan speaking in 1979 or merely heard about it. I do not regard those as of any real significance as to honesty, but they demonstrate the problems of reliability which events so long ago give rise to.</span>

She was asked why she had said on the form they would have to be deported because the island had been sold. She said that was true. She had a brother whose form said that they left in 1965 and his parents went to Mauritius for vacation but she said that was not so. She did not know that her sister also said that her parents went for a vacation. All she could remember was that they had to leave the island as it had been sold. But a 1967 departure does not fit with deportation. Her evidence in chief was contradictory and one version contradicted her questionnaire. She had said in chief that she had been at school in Peros Banhos and was still there when she left. In cross-examination, she said that she had had three years’ education in Peros Banhos, leaving school at ten, some three to four years before she left. That fits with a departure in 1967, but contradicts deportation. (Otherwise, she would have had some six to seven years’ education in Peros Banhos.)</span>

She was prepared, however, to give completely untruthful answers if she thought that it was necessary. Again, if that is too harsh a judgment on her, her evidence is completely unreliable. Many of the things that she said are simply not credible for someone who had been active in Ilois affairs in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She had not pursued obvious questions with her sister and colleagues in the CIOF. She had been keen to point out the anger which Chagossians would have felt about renunciation forms, but gave the feeblest of reasons as to why she herself had not pursued the matter at the ITFB or later with anyone else when she heard renunciation forms being mentioned. She again took refuge in saying that she could not remember and in what she said she had not been told.</span>

In his 1977 statement, apparently prepared for the purposes of the Vencatessen case, but not signed, Mr Marcel Moulinie had said that all persons on the islands were employed by the company but he corrected that in his statement for the Bancoult Judicial Review to say that there were some Ilois employed privately by the administrators in domestic work. In his statement for the Judicial Review, Mr Moulinie said that although it was not the practice to require Ilois to sign written contracts, he thought that there was a practice adopted by the company’s shipping agents to require all workers returning from holidays in Mauritius and the Seychelles to sign contracts before returning. Contracts were not signed on the Chagos islands anyway because they had to be signed in front of a magistrate who came rarely and no-one saw the need for Ilois to sign or renew contracts on such occasions. The contracts contained standard terms which required a worker to be returned either to Mauritius or the Seychelles, or rather an obligation on the company to pay for a return fare, but he said that he did not see how those terms could properly be applied to those settled on the Chagos islands for generations. They spent most of their working life engaged under purely informal contracts. Children could work without a written contract.</span>

The practice of requiring contracts to be signed upon return from leave was maintained lest young Mauritians decided to take advantage of the boat trip to go for a free ride and then come back. Most people who went on holiday had to sign contracts when they returned, just like Michel Vencatessen. These were for two or three years. (But Mrs Talate and Mrs David said that they had not signed contracts on return.) The nurse and teacher worked for the company, which also provided the priest. The meteorological station on Diego Garcia was rather separate. All needed and earned rations through working for the company or its staff, and had a variety of spare-time activities.</span>

There were no independent traders or craftsmen, farmers or fishermen. Although people went fishing and built boats and houses, this was not an independent means of existence. Indeed, the low pay, and payment in kind through rations and other supplements such as assistance with accommodation at least in the form of construction labour and materials, would have prevented such an independent economy arising. It was the plantation company which employed those who helped in the company shop or in house building and all the evidence pointed to those as being activities directed by the company to make necessary provision for its workers.

As Mrs Talate said, everyone got rations. Even pensioners often did light work for the company. There would have been no basis for rations to be distributed to such people, and as the witnesses said, the provision of rations was necessary. Women in general worked; there do not appear to have been any who declined to work, and it was exceptional if someone lived or could live off their husband’s wages. Mrs Mein was one such – her husband was in a senior position. She said no-one stopped working – even people without pensions had an easy job like cutting grass. The children, by the same paternalistic or feudal process, were given company jobs after their education finished at 12; they were not left unemployed, to fend for themselves without rations. They worked and, in turn, their own offspring, if they stayed, became workers. There was no unemployment because everyone worked and had to work for the company. Mr Bancoult’s evidence in the Judicial Review suggested that people could choose not to work for the company though, in practice, they did, or had domestic jobs. Some wives or "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In 1965, there were 12 villages in Diego Garcia, of which the largest was East Point which had a church, cemetery, school, sanatorium and senior management housing. Mr Moulinie, in his witness statement, said that houses were restricted to residential areas to maintain security and sanitation. There was a traditional labourer’s house type with a concrete base and wooden frame, and a roof which needed replacing every two years. It would typically have three bedrooms and one living room, with toilet, shower, kitchen and a front and rear garden on which families were encouraged to grow fruit, vegetables and to rear animals. He said that it was clear when he arrived in 1966 that many families had lived in the same house for many years and even generations.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">When somebody wanted to start their own home, they would look for a plot of land within a designated residential area and, having found that, would come to him to identify the plot, because he needed to know where each worker lived. He organised the labour force to build the home, and had a more or less permanent labour force of eight workers skilled in building houses. He would refuse anyone permission to build on a remote part of the island. It would take about two weeks to build a house and the couple who then moved in would occupy it "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">as their home, free from interruption as far as I was concerned. It was their home to live in until they chose to leave. If either or both of them died, then their children might take over occupation of it or alternatively, if they were of age, they could arrange for friends or other relatives to take over the home when they died. I know many examples of children who inherited their parents’ property but cannot actually say that I know of a case where friends inherited. In principle, I would not have objected to this taking place</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". In cross-examination, he said that the land always belonged to the company but they gave the land when someone came to ask for a piece of land, providing it was in a building area. He meant that if permission was asked and it was in the right area, then they always allowed them to live there. In the 1977 statement, he had said that the island belonged to the company, they never allowed anyone to own plots of land or houses and the islanders understood who owned the land. If he had to relocate a worker, which happened occasionally, arrangements would be made for a suitable house of equivalent quality to be built and a payment would be made to compensate for the loss of garden produce. But he did not recall any occasion when he forced a labourer to move from one home to another against his wish. Islanders were free to go wherever they liked all over the islands except for the private property of individuals, and they could do so on carts, on foot, on bicycles or walking. They could go where they wanted by boat.</span>

She had had a four-bedroomed house on Diego Garcia with a kitchen, living area and toilet, but no shower. The houses were boarded with iron sheets and some had concrete. The houses she lived in had not been built by her husband. There had always been land by the house for cultivation and rearing poultry. She said that when people moved house on Diego Garcia, they did so because there was different work which they were required to do in different places on Diego Garcia.

Once they had chosen the piece of land, they would consult the Administrator who would agree because he was a good man and he would then get male workers to go and help build it. It then belonged to them, and if the father and mother died it would go to the children; it would be the Administrator who would tell them that the house was for the children in such circumstances. They would be able to give their house to someone else if they had no children. It was unclear whether she could remember that happening. But the Administrator had to agree because he had given them the land. She said that people did not change houses, it was a question of finding another place to make a house. They did not just agree to change with friends. There were one or two empty houses where people had gone away but not come back. I found it difficult to get a clear answer as to what would happen if a coconut worker had to leave working in a particular place and go somewhere else, but eventually she said that if someone had to change the place at which they worked, the house would remain empty just as if someone had gone abroad; but the Administrator could permit someone to move into it, and if the worker came back then they would build another house for him. But it was a rare occurrence for Ilois to be sent to Mauritius for bad behaviour and when the person she had in mind was sent, his house just rotted and fell down. If they got a pension, they could stay in that house. The Administrator did not force people to leave their houses. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It had been apparent to the Treasury Solicitor and Sheridans that the Vencatessen case was in the nature of a test case and they negotiated accordingly. The Mauritius Government knew that it was an important case. A number of Ilois witnesses said what they had believed the significance of the Vencatessen litigation to be. Mr Ramdass insisted that he did not know Mr Vencatessen’s approach to a settlement because it was Mr Vencatessen’s decision about a case which he had brought for his own family on his own account. Mr Allen suggested that Mr Vencatessen was "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">a cipher</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". The evidence does not support that, but Mr Allen’s submission involves rejecting the reliability of what Mr Ramdass said. Mr Ramdass agreed that he had been to London in 1981 as an observer, to represent Mr Vencatessen’s interests but when it was suggested that that was because the British needed to know the terms upon which the Vencatessen litigation would be withdrawn, he simply said that he did not know about it. He was not sure whether the Vencatessen case had been a way of putting pressure on the British Government. He denied that they had ever sought publicity for their cause.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Ramdass gave inconsistent evidence about this aspect of the litigation. He said variously that the case had not been brought for the benefit of the Ilois but for Mr Vencatessen personally and that Mr Ramdass did not know if it was hoped that if he won everyone would benefit. The case was Mr Vencatessen’s idea. Very shortly afterwards, he said that he had helped in the case for the well-being of the Ilois because he thought that compensation to Mr Vencatessen could be distributed for their benefit. He could not say whether his uncle hoped that all Chagossians would benefit but he imagined that if he took the money and distributed it, it would be good for the Ilois. Mr Ramdass’ curiously contradictory evidence derives, in my judgment, from a realisation as to the importance for this case of the extent of knowledge about the existence of the Vencatessen litigation.</span>

It was a family affair which Mr Vencatessen kept to himself. In chief, he said that he had learned about the case when he disembarked in Mauritius years earlier. Later, he said that the committee of his group had not been in existence before the Vencatessen case started but asserted that he had still only learned of the case through Mr Duval and had then become a member of the group but then said that the group had been in existence in 1974. He agreed he had been on the committee when he had to sign the paper (in 1975) in order for Mr Vencatessen to get legal aid. He did not know why Mr Vencatessen had been chosen to bring the case in Britain but he was seeking compensation from the British Government because it had done something wrong in uprooting him from Chagos and thought that others would benefit if Mr Vencatessen won his case. He described the case as Mr Vencatessen’s, but said that Mr Ramdass looked after it. Although Mr Vencatessen was his brother-in-law, at no time did he mention it to him. It was clear, notwithstanding what his witness statement said about 1978, that he knew of the case from the outset. This was an unsurprising confusion over dates.</span>

It was only in 1981 that she knew that Mr Vencatessen had a case in court but she said that was a case for his family. I do not believe that that is how she understood things in reality. Later, she said, when explaining that Mr Ramdass was there to represent Mr Vencatessen’s interests because he could not travel, that she did not know that he had a case in court. She might have been tired or confused, but my very firm impression is that she knew very well why Mr Ramdass was there but equally knew very well the problem of admitting that in 1981 she knew that someone had brought a case which led to the payment of money to the Ilois. The problem was, if what she later said about the Agreement and the renunciation forms were true, why had others not been pressed to bring cases? She said she had not asked Mr Ramdass what he was doing there because his case was a family thing and she did not have the right to enter into discussions about it.

Mr Sheridan’s judgment that they were a representative body was informed in 1978 and 1979 by his experiences of meeting them and the Mauritius Government. It was also the Mauritius Government’s judgment that they were representative because they were on the Resettlement Committee. They played a part in the collection of 1,200 signatures for the quittances in 1979 in the first attempt to settle the Vencatessen case on a group basis. Simon Vencatessen said it was a family group, but that underplays the role. This group, according to Mr Saminaden, had about 100 adult members, but the CIOF was rather larger. Even after the departure of the rival CIOF from the JIC, Mr Ramdass continued to represent the JIC with Mr Mundil in the 1981 and 1982 negotiations which received advice from Sheridans before and after the negotiations of 1981 and 1982.

The President was Mrs Alexis and other committee members included Elie Michel and Mrs Talate. This committee was to become the Ilois Committee of a Mauritius Creole organisation, the Organisation Fraternelle. Mrs Kattick said when she joined in 1977 or 1978, it had more than 1,000 supporters particularly from Roche Bois. It was this group that was responsible for the campaign to stop the quittances in 1979. The disagreements between Mrs Alexis and Mr Ramdass were still reverberating in 2002 before me. They joined together in the Joint Ilois Committee along with the Ilois Support Committee of Mr Mundil (which, according to Mr Saminaden, did not include Ilois) and the FNSC. Initially, the JIC appointed Sheridans to act for them after the return of Mr Sheridan to London in November 1979. But the CIOF broke away in June 1980 and pursued its more militant line with demonstrations and hunger strikes. The CIOF, with the backing of the OF, were able to instruct Bindmans in 1981 to bring a case for 225 Ilois against the Mauritius Government. It was accepted as the main representative body for the Ilois, although it combined with the JIC to seek £8m from the UK Government. Three of its members were part of the Mauritius Government delegation to the negotiations in 1981 and 1982. They were Mrs Alexis, Mrs Naick and Elie Michel.</span>

She knew that Ministers read the newspapers and so would hear about what the Ilois wanted. They also held public meetings, and not just in relation to the period 1979 to 1981, attended by a large number of Ilois at which what was happening would have been explained. She agreed that her committee, the CIOF, had had quite a number of members who came from the different places where Ilois had communities in Mauritius. At one point, in 1980, she had wished to persuade the Mauritius Government that the CIOF represented the Ilois, but she could not remember obtaining a document signed by over 1,100 Ilois in order to prove that point to them. Later, she remembered a meeting of 400 Ilois at Beau-Bassin in 1980 which had passed resolutions when it was trying to prove that it represented the majority of Ilois. She remembered resolutions about interest on the money paid to the Mauritius Government and about their rights on Diego Garcia. She and Mrs Naick were, she said, the Ilois representatives rather than Mr Mundil, Mr Michel or Mr Ramdass.</span>

The CIOF supported the Agreement and urged the Mauritius Government to sign it. At some point around 1983, it lost the support of the Ilois and was supplanted by the Chagos Refugee Group of which Mrs Alexis became the first President. She was joined in the CRG by Mrs Talate, Mrs Lafade and Olivier Bancoult. Mr Bancoult said that the CRG was founded because Mauritian intellectuals and politicians such as Elie Michel had taken decisions above their heads of which they were not aware, and would say that they would find solutions for the Ilois in the Creole constituencies as a way of getting votes and yet betrayed them. I asked him what betrayal there had been up to the point where the Chagos Refugee Group had been created, to which he replied that he knew they had been betrayed when he saw the letters to which reference had been made in court during the course of his cross-examination, which he had not been aware of at the time. He said that the 1982 Agreement was an act of betrayal and he thought so at the time. He then said that today they could see that there were conditions attached, but he did not know about them in 1982 and 1983.</span>

(In fact one of those was its leading light, Mrs Alexis.) The Group had gone dormant for a time, coming back to life about two years ago. Insofar as the Chagos Refugee Group was founded because by 1983 (and before the renunciation forms) the Chagossians had lost confidence in the ability of Mauritian politicians and intellectuals to help them, I found it difficult to see why reliance was placed on them for the purposes of subsequent correspondence and meetings and that there was not greater suspicion sooner about the forms.

They persuaded the ITFB to pay for a US lawyer to advise them. They too appear to have lost influence in turn in about 1989 when the CIOF regained support and Elie Michel was re-elected to the ITFB and remained there until 1994.

The documentary material, much of it press reports, contains many references to substantial meetings of the Ilois both before 1981 and on many subsequent occasions. Significant publicity was given to demonstrations, hunger strikes and press conferences organised by Ilois. Ilois affairs were a matter of keen political interest in Mauritius because they related to international affairs and defence; they also provided an opportunity for Mauritian politicians to attack the Mauritius Government for the way in which it had allowed the Chagos Islands to be separated from Mauritius before independence, for the way in which it had handled resettlement and for the way in which various conditions attached to any agreement with the UK might affect the claims over the islands which Mauritius was keen to maintain.

Mauritian politicians may have had their own interest to pursue, whether gaining Ilois votes to secure election, or using Ilois issues as a means of attacking the Government of the day or other rival political organisations. But the number of people who, from differing standpoints, were interested in Ilois affairs, however selfishly, can only mean that the range of interests of the Ilois would have been kept to the fore in Mauritius by its politicians. They would have taken opportunities to advance rather than to hinder the Ilois cause as a means of enhancing their own position, however selfishly. There was a community rather than a diversity of interest in maintaining the right of the Ilois to return to the Chagos as a component of the claim by Mauritius. That is a feature which comes out strongly in the material relating to the 1982 Agreement and subsequently.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There was no evidence of any act of betrayal by Mauritius politicians; a number of witnesses complained that they had been betrayed by Mauritian politicians, when faced with correspondence in English or other statements which they were said to have made which referred to the renunciation of certain claims. These usually related to claims for money. But there is no justification for that thought, if the thought was indeed a genuine one rather than a dishonest means of denying knowledge of what they had done. To agree to take a sum of money in full and final settlement of financial claims or to offer to do so did no more than reflect what the UK Government had required as a matter of principle before any sum was paid to the Ilois. It was also what all the English lawyers advised was appropriate so long as the sum itself was satisfactory. No-one advising or leading the Ilois can have supposed otherwise and it cannot honestly be regarded as an act of betrayal for such finality to have been offered in return for the sums of money which the Ilois were asking for. If there was a point at which the interests of Mauritius politicians and the Ilois diverged, it arose either after the 1982 Agreement when the Mauritius Prime Minister in 1984 said that to pursue claims against the UK Government would be an act of bad faith or, when during and after the 1982 negotiations, it was suggested that the Agreement should not be completed because it did not retain sufficiently clearly the rights of the Ilois to return to Chagos. I am dealing here with the Mauritius politicians such as Mr Michel and Mr Mundil who were helping the Ilois, rather than the Mauritius politicians in power against whom complaint was made about the insertion of Article 4 into the 1982 Agreement and the obtaining of renunciation forms in respect of claims against the Mauritius Government as well. It is not that I regard those complaints as well-founded, it is simply that they are irrelevant to the Ilois claims that those who were helping them were in fact betraying them. They attributed the betrayal to the fact that they were either not Creole and were clever such as Mr Mundil, who was Rector of the University of Mauritius, or were Creole but not Ilois such as the Michel brothers of the CIOF.</span>

I accept Mr Howell’s submissions that the evidence shows that the Ilois constituted a relatively small community, largely concentrated in a few areas of Port Louis. Some of the groups, notably CRG and CIOF, had local representatives as Mr Ramdass and Mr Saminaden made clear. Many were inter-related through the fairly informal familial arrangements which appeared to have existed among many. It is not credible that relatives would not talk to each other about matters which went to the very heart of the conditions in which they lived. Quite apart from general meetings, it is clear that news and rumours would travel fast by word of mouth. What happened in 1979 over Mr Sheridan’s quittances illustrates the point. It was further illustrated by the pressure put on Mr Vencatessen in 1982 to withdraw his case. It was a constant refrain of Mr Allen that the Ilois were poor and illiterate, unused to the ways of the world or of Mauritius. They themselves were happy to describe themselves as stupid and childlike but that too is only a very partial picture. Some had received modest education in Mauritius, such as Mrs Kattick, Eddy Ramdass and Francois Louis. Some could speak and read a little English. The ITFB placed press advertisements in relation to the distribution of money. There were press communiqués. The Ilois listened to radio and television and had wanted major decisions of the ITFB broadcast. Mrs Jaffar and Mr Ramdass could read newspapers which often contained substantive material about the Ilois and their cause. Mrs Alexis said that a number of Ilois had come to claim part of the distribution of funds under the 1982 Agreement from France, the UK and the USA because they had been written to by their families.</span>

The groups showed themselves able to obtain legal advice, to obtain the support of the Mauritius Government financially for the payment of their fees. They persuaded the Mauritius Government to organise a delegation at Government level to press the cause with the UK Government in 1981 and 1982. This was notwithstanding the agreement which Mauritius itself had reached with the UK over resettlement costs and concerns which had been expressed about whether the Ilois might become better off than Mauritians, however fanciful that might seem. The Chagossians were able to and did reject offers which they regarded as too low and were supported in that by those who led them including Mr Mundil. Although a number of the Chagossian witnesses, notably Mrs Alexis, Mr Ramdass, Mr Saminaden, Mrs Kattick, Mr Vencatessen and Mr Bancoult, were not always reliable witnesses, whether because they were forgetful or not altogether truthful, they were not stupid. The development of the Ilois cause over the years showed that they were extremely determined and in their varying ways had been effective in obtaining for the Ilois compensation which the UK Government had never wished to pay.</span>

I accept Mr Howell’s point that if someone had wanted to deceive the Ilois about the negotiations in 1982, the terms of the Agreement or the renunciation forms, there would always have been others, whether politicians or Ilois, who would have been only too keen to expose that deception. There were ample means because of the press publicity and political debate whereby any such attempted deception would have come to the notice of such leaders and politicians. Gaetan Duval, Paul Berenger and other leading politicians had taken an interest in the Ilois cause. There had been debates in the Mauritius Assembly about Mr Sheridan’s visit and the attitude of the Government towards the quittances. Indeed, there had been a critical report to the Mauritius Parliament about the very creation of BIOT and the excision from the Mauritian dependencies of the Chagos Archipelago. A report in 1980 (para 586) to the Mauritius Parliament was critical of the way in which the £650,000 had been distributed and of the delay in its distribution.</span>

Mrs Alexis denounced that petition although she had put her thumbprint to it because she said many of those signing it had not understood what they were doing and the Ilois would never renounce their right to return to Chagos. She then set out to show that her committee represented the majority of Ilois and had obtained a petition containing 1,133 signatures out of the 1,300 Ilois in the country (para 580).</span>

It is also reasonably arguable that the exercise of prerogative powers to achieve that same end would be unlawful; see paragraph 61 where Laws LJ expressed considerable doubt as to whether the prerogative could enable such an end, and he concluded that there was no other existing legislation which empowered the enactment of section 4. If it were desired to achieve the aim of clearing the whole of BIOT, specific legislative power would have been necessary. It is to be noted that the Divisional Court accepted the high importance of the defence facility and did not suggest that that its provision could not have been a proper purpose for the clearance of the population, quite the contrary. Its point was confined to the need for a different legislative power to achieve that end. That legislative power could have been provided by Her Majesty, for the Court concluded that BIOT was a ceded and not a settled colony, judged, as it had to be, at the time when it became part of the Crown’s dominions in 1814 and so was not subject to the same limiting effect of the words "</span>

For my part, whatever reservations I have about the decision and various parts of it, I do not see that the conclusions which I have referred to can possibly be said to be unarguable. It follows from that that if the Defendants excluded the Chagossians from returning to the islands between 1965 and 1971, in 1967 and 1968 in particular, and did so as a step towards the removal of the BIOT population, that too would be arguably unlawful. It may have been unlawful to prevent Ilois returning whatever the reason in the absence of legislation. Indeed, the same reasoning would apply to all subsequent exclusions up to the enactment of the BIOT Immigration Ordinance 2000.</span>

I put it that way because I do not consider that the Divisional Court is by any means clearly correct in treating section 4 as empowering the removal of the population. Section 4 sets up a permit system, and requires anyone present in BIOT to have a permit to be there or to be exempted from that requirement. These permits are to be issued by an immigration officer who is given the widest possible discretion as to their issue or cancellation; a four year period is the normal period of grant. An appeal lies against the refusal of a permit to the Commissioner. It is an offence to remain without a permit after the coming into force of the Ordinance. The removal power in sections 10 and 11 permits the Commissioner to make an order directing the removal, of someone unlawfully present, from out of the territory, indefinitely or for a period, and to direct how that order be carried into effect.

The parties are different and more importantly, there was no misfeasance action then envisaged which would have made a substantial difference to the way in which the evidence was presented and analysed. This matters because of the evidence about the way in which it was envisaged that the discretionary removal power would be exercised, by those framing the 1971 Ordinance, and whose purposes, deduced from the documents, were given such weight by the Divisional Court. The nature of any unlawfulness and the purposes of the officials or Ministers is plainly relevant to the mental component of misfeasance.</span>

Leaving aside the fact that the removals took place over a period of 18 months, and that the inhabited islands in the Seychelles part of BIOT were never depopulated, there is no dispute but that when Diego Garcia was evacuated, a choice was given to the Ilois of going to Peros Banhos, Salomon, (both in BIOT), Agalega or Mauritius. There was only no choice available of staying on. Moreover, section 4 did not apply to this choice: they could choose and some did to go to other BIOT islands; even if they had been forced to do so, sections 4, 10 and 11 had no application to such a transfer within BIOT; it had no application to a decision not to stay in BIOT. Although the Defendants admitted that their acts led to the run down of Peros Banhos and Salomon, there is at least room for argument on the evidence that the later departures from Salomon, whether of the Ilois who were long term residents of those islands or of those who chose to go there when Diego Garcia was evacuated, were voluntary albeit in the context of a Government caused run down, and that it was only the last departures from Peros Banhos which were a compulsory removal out of BIOT.

I can see no basis upon which it can be said that a private landowner would have been obliged to permit an islander to remain on his land or to create property rights in his favour. The authorities would have been obliged, if upholding the rule of law, to assist in removing the trespassers. The solution to the evident problems would have lain in the realm of politics and legislation. Further, if the power to acquire land compulsorily, or by agreement is exercised for the purpose provided for by statute, the exercise of private land ownership powers is necessary to give effect to what is a proper public purpose. I have seen no authority which, absent statutory provision, requires the former owner or occupier of land so acquired to be given further rights or entitles him to defy the new owner in the exercise of his rights. If the Crown is inhibited from removing the Ilois as a landowner, it is difficult to see how that inhibition alone could impose some obligation on the Crown to keep some plantations going, with whatever else is necessary such as managers, transportation, rations and subsidies, for an indefinite period. The purpose of compulsory purchase, or of acquisition by agreement in its stead, is to enable land ownership powers to be exercised. </span>

I say that because of the weight apparently given to the documents which record the thinking of various officers at various times. The reasoning does not appear to have been, or at least confined to, an analysis of the powers actually obtained set against the limits of section 11. Indeed, it appears to have been contemplated that the same powers could lawfully have been obtained for the purpose of dealing with a catastrophe. The reasoning does not appear either to be that the powers obtained were lawful but that the assumed exercise of those powers was an unlawful exercise of the discretionary powers. If follows that if a part, or a substantial part, of the purpose behind the taking of the powers in the Private Treaty Ordinance was to assist in the removal of the population from BIOT, then it is arguably open to the same objection as was the Immigration Ordinance.</span>

Mr Allen said that it was unlawful to clear BIOT completely for those purposes; there was an obligation to leave so much of the islands as would enable Chagos (which was only part of BIOT) to function as an economic entity, supporting the Chagossians. He said that there had been no defence requirement for a base on Diego Garcia in order to protect BIOT. Accordingly, and paragraph 4 of the Group Particulars notwithstanding, Mr Allen submitted that no power existed which could permit defence interests to assume such an importance that the islanders were unable to continue their way of life, not just somewhere in BIOT or Chagos, but moreover on each island notably Diego Garcia.

But to say that it could not be done, where the people were removed to countries of which they were also citizens and which were willing to accept them, is to deny the essence of sovereignty, and its essence in a Parliamentary democracy with power over the Crown in right of its colonies and is to substitute for it the rule, not of law but of judges. If there were such governing responsibilities as those of which Mr Allen spoke, they were the responsibilities of politicians elected and answerable to Parliament.

For the Commissioner to be unable to enact legislation to advance the interests of the UK and Colonies, of which BIOT was part, in the sphere for which the UK was responsible would be a considerable restriction. But if that interest is a relevant interest, it is difficult to see how the Commissioner is limited as a matter of law in the significance which he attaches to that interest as opposed to those of the islanders. They are both relevant interests for the territory. Again, this is relevant to the mental ingredient of the tort. </span>

It is an intentional tort which cannot be committed accidentally or negligently or from a mere failure to act or from a misunderstanding of the legal position. The tort had two forms. The first arose where a public officer used his power for an improper purpose with the specific intention of injuring a person, known as targeted malice. The second form arose where a public officer acted in a way in which he knew he had no power to act, or was recklessly indifferent to the legality of his act, knowing that his act would probably injure the Claimant or a class of persons of which the Claimant was member, or recklessly indifferent as to the probability of such harm. It was sufficient recklessness if the act was done, not caring whether it was illegal or whether the consequences happened. It is sufficient if the act is done without an honest belief that it is lawful because misfeasance is the purported exercise of power otherwise than in an honest attempt to perform the relevant duty. A decision not to act can also give rise to liability. The illegality can arise from a straightforward breach of statutory provisions, from acting in excess of powers or from exercising them for an improper purpose. The only recoverable losses were those which the public officer had foreseen as the probable consequence of his act. There was general agreement on those principles.</span>

On that basis, I reject Mr Howell’s further submission that if I struck out the contentious averment, I should dismiss the whole misfeasance case. It is not always necessary as a matter of pleading that the individuals should be identified, whether by name or position or in some other way, such as by authorship of a particular document.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">A very large amount of Government documentation has been produced. There are several strands of correspondence: internal FCO memos between various of its departments and between various officials some of which related to the preparation of advice to Ministers, advice to Ministers, correspondence with and between the FCO and the two Governors or High Commissioners, correspondence between the FCO and the UK Mission to the UN. Some are advisory, some are drafts or comments on drafts and internal debate. There are many officials who appear in the written material and Ministers as well. The Claimants rely on this documentation for their misfeasance case. I regard it as wholly unfair for this serious allegation to be made without any attempt in the light of all this material to identify in the pleadings those against whom so serious an allegation is made. It must be possible for the Claimants to identify them, or the major ones, by name or position, or authorship of documents. The Defendants could not possibly know how far back and how widely they would have to interview potential witnesses and those witnesses would not know whether an allegation was being made against them which their statements had to answer. The Claimants argued that the claim should not be struck out as having no reasonable prospect of success because cross-examination might help their case. For the immediate purposes of this pleading, that only reinforces my conclusion: how are the Defendants to know whom to call for any such cross-examination without any particulars of the persons against whom this allegation is made? Are they to face a speculative cross-examination to see if an allegation can be made against them? That would be a wholly unfair and wasteful way of conducting litigation. Whatever else may result from these applications, the Claimants must plead the names, or other identifying material, of those who they say had the relevant knowledge, of what precisely and what they are alleged to have done. These allegations should have been tied in to the documents disclosed. There is ample material for them to have been working on if they truly have a case of misfeasance.</span>

I received the distinct impression that this aspect of the case had not been thought through with the care it deserved for the making of such serious allegations. He said that the Prime Ministers and Foreign and Colonial Secretaries between 1964 and 1973 would be included. (The Prime Ministers are not actually parties at all.) The Foreign Secretary in 1982 was included and, it appeared, all subsequent ones because the policy of denying that there was a permanent population on the islands had been maintained throughout the 1990s. All Permanent Under-Secretaries involved in drafting advice to Ministers were included because, if they removed relevant material from the eyes of the decision maker, that would be misfeasance for which the UK Government would be vicariously liable. The BIOT Administrators and the Commissioners over time were also to be named. Mr Aust was then too junior for reliance to be placed on his advice. But Mr Allen also seemed to suggest that any officials who wrote the documents upon which he relies would have the relevant knowledge. Such extemporising is not the way litigation should be conducted. The allegation must be properly pleaded if the action is to continue.</span>

The decisions made in reliance on approval of those submissions were the justification for what followed, not some excess of official zeal concealed from Ministers, whilst officials somewhat improbably took the burden of implementing their own policy, politically and morally controversial, leaving Ministers free from any opprobrium over the execution of policies of the highest importance, sensitivity and controversy. But it means that for the Claimants to succeed, they have to have reasonable prospects of contending that the Prime Minister of the day knew of or was recklessly indifferent to the illegality of his policy, or that his Foreign Secretary was or that the Commissioner of the day was or that unnamed officials duped them over illegalities to which they alone were alive.

This was to prevent a permanent resident population giving rise to obligations under Article 73 of the UN Charter and also because the Treasury were reluctant to invest in the plantations. The approval of the Mauritius Government to the resettlement of the Ilois was a temporary expedient but to assist in obtaining the approval of that Government, the UK Government, as a matter of policy withheld information from the Ilois that they were UK Citizens.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I have already adumbrated the way in which the Claimants advance their case on the pleadings. The overarching theme was that the Defendants and their officials knew at all relevant times that there was an indigenous population of two or more generations on the Chagos, and pretended to the outside world that these were only, or virtually only, contract labourers by which they meant transient or temporary workers. They then removed that population when they knew or were recklessly indifferent to the illegality of so doing. They did so not only for defence purposes but also because, BIOT having been created, an indigenous population in that new colony would attract the protection of Article 73 of the UN Charter. The structure of Mr Allen’s submissions did not therefore involve any analysis, by tracing through the documents in a coherent way, what any one official or Minister did and knew in relation to any one of the allegations of illegality and dishonesty. The evidence upon which they rely at this stage is largely the documentary material disclosed by the Defendants, but it is supplemented by the Ilois’ own evidence about their way of life, their ancestry, their employment, the way property was dealt with, about what happened to them at the time of the expulsions or when they were unable to return, their reception and subsequent life in Mauritius and the Seychelles, and their dealings with the UK Government. But it is the documentary material upon which the Claimants rely for showing what the Ministers and officials were doing and with what knowledge. The documentary material has been set out at length in Appendix A and I do not propose to summarise the material here. The Claimants’ case was that they had a reasonable prospect of success in their allegations from that material alone and in effect submitted that reading it made out their case sufficiently for this stage of proceedings.</span>

This was said to require fair consultation, a recognition that no international agreement could trump all their rights, adequate funding for resettlement, and a duty of good faith which required the Government to put right in the 1982 negotiations, and to acknowledge, what it had done wrong. These were mandatory duties which the Defendants could never abandon nor could it contrive to get its citizens to forego those rights. They could only be removed by legislative act by a body with the power to pass such legislation. This asserted governmental relationship ran through other parts of the Claim, such as the claim in negligence. The consequence for the misfeasance claim was that, just as the Defendants were not able to rely on section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance for the removal of the population, they were unable to rely on any other power, such as the prerogative or private landowner powers. Those powers might enable the base to be set up but they could not make lawful the exclusion of the population or taking so much land that it was impossible for them to live on the islands.</span>

The Commissioner is subject to the limitations of the BIOT Order and is neither compelled to enact the legislation for which the Claimants contend, nor has he done so. Neither the Commissioner nor the UK Government has any duty to provide for a welfare state in the absence of legislation. I can see no basis for saying that there is a legal duty to provide employment, or housing on or transportation to Chagos, including Diego Garcia or to compel the private landowner and employer to do so for any individual Chagossian or all of them. There was no obligation to maintain an economy and to prevent the coconut plantations closing or to provide substitute work. There was no obligation to prevent landowners exercising their private rights to prevent someone living on a particular piece of land or to require them to provide land for Chagossians to live on, or to permit the landowners' rights to be overridden by a form of mass trespass; that would be the antithesis of a civil society unless accomplished by legislation. If the landowner had decided to give up running coconut plantations and to remove the islanders from the land to make way for tourist enterprises, there would have been room for political debate as to what should happen but not for legal debate as to the power of the landowners, (assuming that the Ilois had no property rights themselves). There is no obligation on the legislature to prevent private landowners exercising their rights and refusing to permit onto land those whom they are not willing to allow to reside there. There is no obligation to require employers to employ particular individuals or to provide them with transportation to or from the Chagos. There is no obligation on the legislature to so enact nor has the Sovereign required the Commissioner to so legislate nor has She passed any such Act herself. I do not see anything in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I propose to deal with the sequence of allegations as to misfeasance in chronological order. I have already accepted that it is reasonably arguable that if the prevention of the return of Ilois in 1967 and 1968 was on the instructions or, indeed at the request of the Defendants, that was unlawful. I think that it is also reasonably arguable that, in those circumstances, if the Commissioner or his agents knew that those who were going to Mauritius might not be able to return for that same reason, there was a duty on them to forewarn the Ilois. However, there is no evidence that any Defendant or its agents knew or thought that those who left would be prevented from returning. Mr Moulinie may have known what the general pattern of recruitment would be and it may have been a common expectation that Ilois would be re-employed and transported back to the Chagos if they so wished; of course there was no obligation on them to return or to do so at any particular time. It is clear from the evidence of the Chagossians that they regarded themselves as free to make that choice and some stayed for substantial periods in Mauritius, some arriving before BIOT was even created. It must have been obvious to the islanders that there were no new recruits or returners from Mauritius in 1967 and yet others left in March 1968 apparently without inquiry as to their prospects for return. Mrs Talate's witness statement for what that is worth suggests that they were aware of the decline in numbers and of the absence of people who had gone to Mauritius. There is also some evidence that, even before the creation of BIOT, there could be difficulties for those who left the islands for Mauritius as others were recruited to take their place, as would seem inevitable, as there appears to have been no obligation on the Ilois to return after a particular period. But Moulinie was not the agent of BIOT in transporting to Mauritius those who wished to go there nor when they said or failed to say anything about whether they might return. The fact that some Ilois were advised to go to Mauritius in connection with medical treatment imposed no different duty and certainly not upon the Defendants. Mr Moulinie may have realised that recruitment of those leaving in 1967 and 1968 was not certain and nothing was said; he might be criticised for that. But that is not something for which any responsibility arguably lies with the Defendants as a breach of any duty by them or other illegality, let alone one of which they knew or were recklessly indifferent to.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Howell's main point was that there was no evidence that the Defendants had been instrumental in fact in preventing the return of anyone in 1967 or 1968. Those decisions were the consequence of the Moulinies’ recruitment policies. The position to my mind is as follows. The contemporaneous material shows that there were two boatloads of Ilois, one in May 1967 and the other in March 1968, some or all of whom were unable to obtain passage back and were left stranded. First, it is quite plain that the proposals for the defence facility were at the root of the problem because of the uncertainty which they created for investment and the related need for labour; the company had given notice to quit its lease, effective at the end of 1967 and there were negotiations about a management agreement in the latter part of 1967. The UK Government in that period faced the prospect of direct management of the plantations. Second, the focus of Moulinies’ recruitment was to become the Seychellois because the islands’ economic links and shipping ties from July 1968, following acquisition of the "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Nordvaer</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">", were focussed on the Seychelles. That refocus itself may well have been independent of the defence proposals. Third, the evidence of Marcel Moulinie was that there had been no instructions, so far as he knew, from Mr Todd to Rogers &amp; Co not to take returning Ilois, although he had also said that they had given no such instructions either and was not aware that his uncle had done so. The documentary evidence shows, however, that recruitment instructions were given by the company to Rogers &amp; Co to take no more workers from Mauritius. Fourth, the evidence of Mrs Jaffar and Mrs Elyse on what was said, to whom and in what circumstances or when, suffers from certain problems, but does not assist in answering the question of who gave instructions that they were not to be recruited. They said that they were refused passage for reasons connected with the creation of BIOT, the defence arrangements with the Americans and the closing of the islands (even though at that time their closure was not imminent).

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In my judgment, it is clear that the decisions were made by Moulinie &amp; Co on the basis of what it thought necessary for employment purposes. First, there was a clear change in recruitment pattern so as to employ more Seychellois than Mauritians as contract workers. The uncertainty of what would happen to the islands or any of them and when was an obvious factor for Moulinie &amp; Co to worry about. This pattern is evident in the May 1967 Administrator’s Report of his visit to the islands. The discussions between the Commissioner and the CO refer to Mr Moulinie saying that he would not be recruiting additional labour from Mauritius on the second trip there of the "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mauritius</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". Second, the Commissioner’s concern, as it was of the CO, was to make the most of the asset for which it had paid and to make appropriate arrangements for running the plantations, not for removing the population or running down the plantations. The references upon which the Claimants rely need to be seen in that overall context. Third, the Mauritius Government raised the question of those who had arrived in May 1967 when the "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mauritius</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" was due to return to the islands in March 1968; it wanted them re-employed on Chagos. But it was dealt with by the Commissioner as an employment matter for Moulinie &amp; Co. Moulinie had no need for the 75 workers. So the Commissioner told the CO that it would tell him to recruit what labour was needed for the efficient running of the islands and who was employed was up to him. That reflects a legitimate position from a plantation management point of view and there is no reason to suppose that Moulinie would have acted any differently if he had not been told that. Fourth, it is clear that Moulinie told Rogers &amp; Co not to recruit any more in its telegram of 29</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> February 1968 because the islands were fully manned; the reference to concluding negotiations with the MoD shows the effect of uncertainty and not interference. This may be the source of the information which Rogers gave to the Ilois who were refused a return passage. Fifth, the degree of control exercised over the cost of running the plantations can be seen from the extent of approval necessary for materials. Mr Allen argues that this shows the extent to which the BIOT administration would have been involved in the decisions about recruitment. That may be so but the evidence points clearly to the reason for that: the desire to make the plantations work economically; that may have affected the levels of recruitment and that may have affected indirectly who was recruited. But that is not the point. The question, sixth, is: did the Defendants try to stop the recruitment of the Ilois in Mauritius? There is nothing in the Commissioner’s advice, if it was advice, to Moulinie about what to do over the Mauritius Government request which amounts to a prevention of the Ilois returning, let alone that it was so advised in order to exclude them so as to assist in depopulating the islands. That is the nub of the point.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There is a recognition, at least arguably, in the May 1968 BIOT memorandum, (23/171-5), that recruitment could be used as an aid to resettlement, but it is merely a discussion document and one which precedes the July 1968 US decision, which affected the future planning significantly. There is no suggestion in any other of the pre- July documents that the recruitment of Ilois on Mauritius should be minimised for resettlement or other reasons; the concern was with the overall level of the workforce. The emphasis is on making the islands economically efficient.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Again, in relation to the Ilois stranded after their arrival in March 1968, a similar picture emerges clearly. The Defendants’ line at that time was that the matter was one between employer and employee. It is also plain that the CO and High Commissioner in Mauritius were aware that there were Ilois who had connection by descent with the islands and who might have been affected by the defence proposals. There is nothing in the exchanges to suggest that they were however trying to prevent the recruitment of Ilois. The most that can be said is that they were not trying to encourage or to facilitate it, or to bring about their return to Chagos; they were more washing their hands of the problem. The notes reiterate that it is an employment matter, or one for resolution as the picture became more certain as to how long the islands would be functioning. It was also pointed out in the FCO paper of 24</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> October 1968 that Moulinie now wanted to recruit more Ilois for Diego Garcia; the documents also show that they were aware that recruitment of Ilois would pose additional resettlement problems and that there was a potential problem if only some of those stranded in Mauritius were recruited. Thus recruitment of those Ilois was seen as unadvisable. Nonetheless, and to my mind crucially, the upshot of it was that because Moulinie wanted to recruit 100 Ilois from Mauritius in November 1968, he was authorised to do so albeit on one year contracts only. That latter requirement shows a degree of control over recruitment being exercised by the Defendants; but, generally, the signing of a contract upon return to the islands is something which at least some Ilois certainly did, because some contracts have been produced, and there was a company concern about recruits joyriding around the islands on the boat and then returning free of cost. It shows however that the Defendants did not prevent the return of the Chagossians. It does not matter for these purposes that the recruitment did not in fact proceed.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> October 1968 certainly shows that the Defendants could and at times did exercise control directly over recruitment of Ilois. It was not simply a matter left entirely to Moulinies’ commercial judgement. But the general tenor of the documents is that the Defendants were looking at the economics of the plantations and save at the last were not concerned with whom Moulinie recruited, whether Ilois or not. There is nothing in the pre-November 1968 documents to suggest that they had given secret instructions that Ilois were not to be recruited and were deceiving each other about their motives or decisions. I do not consider it to be a reasonable inference that what was seen in October or November 1968 to be the attitude of the Defendants towards Ilois recruitment must have been their attitude at an earlier date. The Mauritius Government in March 1968 might have thought the non-return was a BIOT responsibility but that is simply not borne out by the evidence. By October 1968, after the July 1968 US decision, there is evidence that the Defendants contemplated preventing the recruitment of Ilois because of the resettlement implications, but they did not in fact do so. Indeed there was a limit, according to Mr Moulinie, of 250 on the number of male adult workers on Diego Garcia. There is no documentary evidence to support that, but if it is correct, the population figures show that that limit was not in danger of being exceeded and so it never acted as a constraint on the recruitment of Ilois.</span>

There is no domestic legal obligation on a Government to arrange for the return of its citizens to those territories where they can reside. It cannot be said that there was a duty on the Defendants to arrange for the Ilois to return to the islands, let alone one which left aside any question of employment or how they would be fed or housed. It is not sufficient for this allegation of misfeasance for the Claimants to show that the defence proposal was an unsettling factor which contributed to or even caused the company’s refusal to recruit the stranded Ilois. Nor is it sufficient to identify some discussion about what numbers should be employed, for the Defendants had a legitimate interest in the size of the labour force whether they were to manage the plantations directly or through an agreement under which they would bear the cost burden. I consider that the Claimants have no reasonable prospect of showing that the Defendants in fact prevented the return of the stranded Ilois.</span>

Neither Defendant had ever employed the Ilois or transported them; they were not abandoned by either Defendant in a remote or inaccessible spot to which they had taken them. These Ilois went voluntarily to a country of which they were citizens and with which some enjoyed varying degrees of family connection.</span>

It is reasonably arguable that, as the law has developed and notwithstanding the absence of supporting analysis, there was a duty to consult the Chagossians over what their future was to be, once it had been decided to clear any island for defence purposes. I find rather difficult, however, the notion that there was an obligation to consult the Ilois, (and if them why not the temporary residents or the Moulinies, or UK residents and taxpayers?) about the defence interests of the UK and its colonies. There is plainly no obligation to consult those who might be affected by any international obligation which the UK Government might have it in mind to enter and I cannot see why there was any obligation to consult on whether BIOT itself should have been created. There is no obligation to consult before legislation is proposed or enacted in the absence of a statutory duty or a promise to do so. Neither is alleged to have existed here. If there were, as the Claimants say, any obligation to carry out an assessment, as a Government, of the consequences of the setting up of the base, and there plainly was such an assessment pursued over time, that does not itself oblige consultation about those consequences more generally.</span>

The wider he seeks to make the duty, the more hugely improbable his case becomes. It was recognised by Ministers that it would have been desirable to consult the Ilois about their future, but there were reasons why that could not be done. There is nothing to suggest that they realised that they were under some obligation to consult or that they were recklessly indifferent to any such duty. I think that in the late sixties and early seventies there would have been some surprise at the thought that there could be an enforceable legal duty to consult at all, let alone over defence matters. Even were the Claimants to succeed in establishing that there had been a duty to consult the Ilois over whether there should be a defence facility on Diego Garcia, it is not conceivable that it would have made the remotest difference to the outcome. It must have been perfectly obvious to the Defendants that the Ilois would wish for no change for the worse in their situation but their desires were not important in this context. They were given an element of choice about where to go when Diego Garcia was evacuated.</span>

But the UK Government tried on a number of occasions to persuade the US to allow Chagossians to work on the defence facility, particularly in construction work. It had no success at all ever. The US adhered to the position which it had adopted at the outset. The UK tested whether there was any need to close the whole of Diego Garcia for defence reasons but the US asserted that it was so and the UK accepted that position. It is more than a little odd to take advantage of the defence proposal to argue that that is what gave Diego Garcia its future, but at the same to deny an essential feature of it as seen by those responsible for creating it, namely that it had or would have no resident population to limit its effectiveness as a location for that very facility. In substance, this is an allegation that the base should not have been created on the terms upon which it was. The Court is not in a position to judge the defence assessment which underlies that and will not do so. It is inconceivable that the Defendants could have thought that there was a legal obligation to compel the US to accept Ilois workers or to forego the facility, or were recklessly indifferent to the legalities of the position.</span>

The two allegations do not fit easily together nor does the allegation fit easily with the contention that the departures from Peros Banhos and Salomon were engendered for other than economic reasons. It was pleaded that the Defendants had run down the plantations deliberately or allowed that to happen knowing that they were thereby depriving the entire population of the territory of economic support. This is untenable. The Defendants wanted to keep the plantations going for as long as possible as is evident from all the documentation. There was a tension between that and their desire to avoid having a permanent population on BIOT. That latter objective argued for a rapid decision. I cannot see what the illegality is in what they did in the interim between 1965 and 1971. If, however, the allegation includes any later period, the allegation becomes in effect that they could not remove the islanders from the whole of BIOT and that they had to leave enough land for the Ilois to maintain a viable economy. The agreement with the US could not be given effect, therefore, whatever the route taken to provide for the removal of the Ilois. This is an example of the governmental obligations which Mr Allen relies upon. I deal with that point as part of the allegation that the removal of the Ilois from the whole of BIOT was unlawful, regardless of the means whereby that was accomplished.</span>

The Defendants ignored their governmental obligations to the permanent inhabitants; their interests were a material consideration which was ignored in the formulation of policy. It was unlawful to clear the Ilois off Diego Garcia if there was nowhere else for them to go which had a viable economy. The Defendants proceeded as if they were operating a private estate. There was no authority for the removal of a British citizen as such from the place where he was entitled to reside. The 1971 Immigration Ordinance clothed the BIOT administration with an ostensible power even if it had not been used in fact to bring about the evacuations. He made an allied submission to the effect that it was unlawful to have a policy of clearing the islands which was based upon the deceit that there was no permanent population and to seek to give effect to that deceit. Whether there is a reasonably arguable case depends, for so many of these allegations, upon what power was used and upon whether it could ever be lawful to remove the whole BIOT population for defence or other purposes in the absence of specific legislation.</span>

The point at which that implementation cut across the rights of individuals is the point at which it would require to be examined for its legality in the absence of legislative powers. The Defendants were entitled to take steps to procure the implementation of the defence facilities subject only to any supervening rights which the islanders had. It cannot by itself justify the breach of the rights of individuals. Once the lease to Chagos Agalega Company Limited had terminated, there was no individually enforceable domestic legal obligation on the Commissioner or on the UK Government to cause the plantations to continue to operate in order to provide employment opportunities or the other concomitants of a viable society, food, housing or education and so on. The Ilois contracts might come to an end, but there would be no obligation on the Defendants to employ them or to procure that the company renewed their contracts. There would be no legally enforceable obligation to prevent the company landowner requiring the workers to leave its property if they had no rights to be there.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The Defendants’ case is that it is clear upon all the evidence, including that of the Chagossians, that a choice was offered to the Ilois of Diego Garcia as to whether to go to another BIOT island. They were encouraged to go to those islands, or to Agalega. They were not at that stage all removed from BIOT or required to leave. There were also Ilois who subsequently left Peros Banhos and Salomon voluntarily. It may have been uncertainty which caused some to choose to go to Mauritius rather than to a BIOT island or to leave when they did, but that does not alter the position and does not amount to a compulsion to leave BIOT. But the illegality contemplated by the Divisional Court is a compulsory removal through the specific exercise of a purported statutory power. Accordingly, whilst the Divisional Court may be right as to the legal position if the facts had been as it apprehended them to be, on the incontestable facts, the illegality which it contemplated could only arise for those who were compelled to leave Peros Banhos. There is no evidence that that was accomplished by use of the Immigration Ordinance. The evidence is that the island had become unviable as a coconut plantation; there were too few workers and the company and the Defendants decided to close them as the landowner and to evacuate the inhabitants. The dependency of the Ilois on work for rations, building materials and transportation was evident from the way in which they described life on Chagos and the problems they felt arose when the rations were running down; that may not have happened in fact but they perceived it as an attempt to starve them out. There would have been no comparable means of the Ilois subsisting there alone without employment or other subsidy. This is a powerful analysis, but it has to be seen in the light of what I see as the thinking in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">At the stage of seeing whether there is an arguable case, I appreciate that it can be said that the offer of employment on another island in BIOT was illusory because of the uncertainty over the future of the islands created by the defence proposals and no guarantees were offered as to the future of Peros Banhos and Salomon. Mr Todd told the Ilois, according to his notes, that the other islands would be open for some time. The reality was that the Ilois could see that the time would come when the plantations would close and they would be compelled to leave. Additionally, the US had always made it clear to the UK Government that it might want to have the whole of Chagos. There was, in the background, also the concern of the UK Government that unless the population were removed from BIOT, there would eventually be a permanent population, if there were not one already, which would attract the obligations of Article 73 of the UN Charter and constitute an economic problem for the UK. All the decisions on the future of the island plantations after 1965 can be attributed to the creation of BIOT, the defence proposal and to the uncertainty which it created. The UK Government compelled the closure of Diego Garcia and the removal of the Ilois from it. Even on the Defendants’ own case, it was the economic conditions created by the closure of the plantations on Diego Garcia for defence purposes and the subsequent uncertainties, which led to the drift of Ilois away from Salomon and then from Peros Banhos leading to their ultimate economic collapse. It is possible to say that in those circumstances the Defendants closed the islands and compelled the removal of the population from BIOT. Whether they used the Immigration Ordinance, or as I think overwhelmingly probable, they used their private law rights, a possible case, derived from </span>

I saw no evidence to support Mr Allen’s contention that the closure of Peros Banhos was brought about by subtle pressure from the Defendants on Moulinie &amp; Co.</span>

It would have been consistent with the argument that they had no rights there, property or otherwise. The documents show that the Ordinance was a back up to stop Ilois making for another island and to control their return should it be attempted. It could not apply to transfers within BIOT, or to the making of a choice to stay in or leave BIOT; it could only have applied to the final closure of Peros Banhos anyway and there is no evidence that it was used at that stage.</span>

This is closely related to the allegation that the enactment of the Ordinance was unlawful because of the purpose to which it was to be put, but again there is no evidence whatsoever that anyone knew or was recklessly indifferent as to its lawfulness. It is useful to put this in the context of what the law was. Specific legislative power was necessary on the assumption, which I make for these purposes, that the private powers could not be used. The form of Immigration Ordinance was more than a simple vehicle for expulsion as I have explained.

The UK was responsible for the external relations of BIOT. Although the Sovereign might be divisible, Queen of Mauritius or BIOT and separately Queen of the United Kingdom, the power to legislate in section 11 was provided for the territory to be governed by reference to the needs of the UK and Colonies as a whole and their defence and foreign policy needs in particular for which aspect of BIOT the UK was responsible. Indeed it had specifically created BIOT for defence of the UK and Colonies. Section 11, if the scope of the phase in issue varied with context, has to be read in that light. The restrictions on the legislative power would be found in the Royal Instructions, the power of disallowance, any applicable UK law and the BIOT Order. The Chagos population could all have been removed to Mauritius, if BIOT had not been created. Indeed, as the only evacuation to which the Ordinance could conceivably have applied was that of Peros Banhos in 1973, there would have been a reasonable argument along the lines referred to by Gibbs J, that the removal of those who had lost all practical means of support and life was a proper use of such powers.</span>

Nor is there any suggestion that there was no power to pass such an enactment because of the object for which it was to be passed, taking that to be the removal of the Ilois to Mauritius and the Seychelles. Insofar as its objective was to back up or permit the evacuation of the colony, that objective was seen as a necessary one and the Ordinance was a way of achieving it. There is no suggestion that anyone doubted that that could lawfully be done. It was recognised that politically the objective of permitting a US defence facility to be created in the Indian Ocean at the expense of people who had lived there for a number of generations would be controversial; but never that it could not be done lawfully. Nor do I see any evidence from the whole of the documents that this was because the Ministers and officials were ignoring the possibility, suspecting that it could not be done. The purpose of obtaining such powers, in so far as they related to the removal of the population, was to promote the defence interests of the UK, its Colonies and allies. The use of powers taken under section 11 of the BIOT Order with the aim of promoting that interest had been made explicit in the 1967 Property Ordinances and the subsequent acquisition which was not a secret. No one suggested until the Bancoult judicial review that that might be unlawful. The passage or use of an Immigration Ordinance to promote that same interest would not have been any more obviously unlawful, once defence interests were acknowledged to be relevant under section 11, whatever the political controversies.</span>

There were further discussions in February and March 1969. Again, none of them suggest that the removal of the Ilois from BIOT, whether by an Ordinance or through private rights would be unlawful. That is not because they thought that it would be, but that it would be better to keep quiet or to keep Ministers in the dark. Ministers were fully briefed and there is no suggestion in the documents that officials would carry out the dirty work or leave Ministers out of it or ill-informed nor that they exceeded their authority or instructions. There is no realism to the notion that they were trying to deceive themselves and not say what they thought. It is because they did not think that it would be unlawful. It was not obvious to Ministers that there was some illegal act afoot as Mr Allen suggested it should have been; there was an appreciation that this would be unpopular with the Ilois and others, but not that it could not lawfully be done. The same applies to lawyers. They saw wide powers under the BIOT Order and there were no legal restrictions on what they did. The actual or incipient application to BIOT of Article 73 of the UN Charter did not create a relevant legal obligation for these purposes although it added to the political problems. In January, February and December 1970, there were further discussions about the way in which removal might be effected, with the private law rights more to the fore, but again there is nothing to suggest that anyone knew, or was recklessly indifferent to the legality of what was being proposed. It is clear that the many individuals involved all thought that it was lawful to remove the Ilois from BIOT using either an Immigration Ordinance or private rights or both. In December 1970, Miss Emery suggested to the PIOD that there was something repugnant to the general tenor of British immigration legislation in the Ordinance. Mr Aust replied that it was severe but not so very different from the then proposed reforms to UK immigration law.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Allen argued that there was an obligation to leave so much of the island of Diego Garcia as would enable the Chagossian way of life on the main island to continue so that there would be work for the Chagossians. This is unarguable, as I have already said. There is no obligation on a government to provide for a particular level of economic activity; how many was it to provide for given that the Ilois were not obliged to stay? Were they obliged to work? If so, on what terms? The argument becomes no more than an argument that a government owes a legally enforceable duty to provide some form of welfare state and subsidised economy for its people, even if its legislature has not so enacted. But whatever the merit in that argument, which is somewhat beyond the cutting edge of public law jurisprudence, it is quite impossible to suppose that any Defendant or any official should have put his mind to such a legal proposition and realised that that was the law or that anyone who did not do so was recklessly indifferent to the legality of what he was doing.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I have accepted that it is reasonably arguable that the use of private land ownership rights to remove the whole population of BIOT was unlawful, because of the obiter remarks of the Divisional Court. I assume for these purposes that the earlier acquisition Ordinances were lawful. But there are real problems with that dictum which go directly to whether someone arguably knew that private law powers could not be so used or was recklessly indifferent to that. It is commonplace for compulsory purchase powers to be taken but for a private purchase agreement to be reached instead. The removal of those who once had rights or none is achieved through the exercise of private ownership powers for the public purpose. It has not been suggested that, if relevant, a balanced assessment of defence needs against the needs of the population could not properly lead to the conclusion that the former were the weightier. But the Crown in those circumstances is nevertheless, on the obiter remarks, disabled from using the private powers which it has taken under an unchallenged public Act for an unchallenged public purpose. The basis for the illegality must be that, even though the Ilois were arguably compelled to leave the whole of BIOT for a country of which they were citizens and which was prepared to take them, specific legislation was necessary for that specific removal. The Divisional Court does not contemplate any obligations on the Commissioner once the lands had been lawfully acquired: was he to provide jobs and if so what and for how long, or housing and education? Insofar as there was an inhibition on the use of the private landowner powers, it is difficult to see why it should endure once arrangements had been made for the islanders to go to a country of which they were citizens and which was prepared to take them. No-one was compelled to leave BIOT until that point. However, whatever the true legal position, there is no basis for saying that any Defendant knew that the dicta of the Divisional Court represented the legal position or was recklessly indifferent to it.</span>

This adds nothing; if it is intended to do so it should be particularised or struck out. There is no evidence that coercion in a physical sense was used in the removals. The pleading and the Claimants’ statements have used language which suggests it but there is no evidence for that. If the allegation is that the Ilois had no choice about leaving Diego Garcia and that they had no choice about leaving Peros Banhos, because none were given the unappealing option of staying without support, that is obviously true, but I do not think that that is what is meant. There is no allegation that there was any trespass to the person to anyone nor that anyone on behalf of the Defendants authorised or carried out any such act. The assertions about intimidation through threats of bombing or of being killed were not sustained in any evidence; the witnesses who claimed in their witness statements to have had such conversations with US or British officers did not speak English and did not support those allegations in their oral evidence. Mrs Talate’s evidence is pleaded as typical of the Ilois experience. There was a fear of the planes which they saw taking off low over where they lived on Diego Garcia. I do not find it difficult that fears and rumours spread but that does not make them true, however real the fear. Mr Prosper, according to Mrs David, said that there might be bombs on the base which would make Peros Banhos unsafe; but she agreed that what was in her recent statement about being removed by British Officers was wrong and she agreed that there was no British official present at that meeting. There was understandable distress and fear created by the killing of the dogs. But there were no British Officers present at the evacuations, although there is photographic evidence appended to the witness statement of Mr Mandary, who was not called, that an American Officer was present at a meeting in January 1971 where the closure of Diego Garcia was announced to the Ilois. There was no evidence as to the position on Salomon when the last worker left and the evidence about what happened on Peros Banhos was vague. There were inconsistencies in the evidence of Mrs Mein and her daughter as to when they left but it appeared from her oral evidence that they left before the end because other labourers stayed and Mr D’Offay replaced her husband. Mrs Talate left in 1972, before the end having chosen to go there from Diego Garcia; she was told by Mr Prosper that the islands were closing. There is not the slightest evidence of the threat of or the actual use of force or intimidation to bring about the removal of the Ilois, or that there was any for which either Defendant was responsible.</span>

There was some form of compensation, Rs 500 for those who went to BIOT, and the resettlement agreement with the Mauritius Government which had been reached before the closure of Peros Banhos. I have no difficulty with that being arguably inadequate if there were a legally enforceable duty to provide an adequate scheme but no such duty has been identified. There is no duty to so legislate and no existing power has been identified; if there were a duty to legislate, there is simply no basis for saying that anyone knew of such a duty or was recklessly indifferent to it.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It is not an allegation which appears to derive from the evidence about promises of compensation which were said to have been made by Moulinie or Mr Prosper or Mr Todd before people left the islands. Even if it did, it would not arguably found a case of misfeasance. Mr Todd’s note of the meeting on Diego Garcia does not suggest that any promise was made by him and it would have been against policy for him to have done so; it is not realistic to suppose that he would have done so in advance of arrangements being made with Mauritius. Mr Moulinie had no authority to say anything about compensation being paid by the UK in 1966 which is the only vaguely recollected occasion when he might have done so. So far as statements by Paul Moulinie are concerned, there is no evidence that he had any authority to make them for the Defendants or that any such authority would have been given earlier than the agreement with the Mauritius Government in 1973. The real problem with the oral evidence, apart from its many unreliabilities generally looking back over 30 years, is that is inconsistent with the compensation intentions which the Defendants had before any arrangement with Mauritius in 1972. The sum was agreed at £650,000 in September 1972 and paid in spring 1973. The UK aim was to persuade those leaving Diego Garcia not to go to Mauritius and to go instead to the other islands, so it would have been especially surprising if the promises of compensation had been related to the option which the UK did not wish them to take. There is ample room for confusion in Ilois minds over what was promised to those on Diego Garcia if they would go to Peros Banhos and Salomon. There is no evidence about what was said on Salomon. What Mrs David said was said on Peros Banhos could have related to that agreement with Mauritius. The Ilois petition of about October 1974, referring to the promises made by a "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" that money would be paid to the Mauritius Government by the UK for compensation for the Ilois could also refer to that agreement but it would not have been said before the departures from Diego Garcia. Accordingly, it does not seem remotely likely that anything before the agreement with Mauritius or before the departures from Diego Garcia about compensation in Mauritius, was said with the permission or authority of the UK Government. If it was said after the agreement with Mauritius, and affected the Ilois’ decision as to whether or when to leave, it is not untrue. There was provision for compensation; it turned out to be far smaller in practice when eventually disbursed in part because of the rampant inflation over the period in Mauritius and the growing debts of the Ilois.</span>

In summary, the Claimants allege that the Defendants had a policy of denying that there was a permanent population of Ilois even though they knew the truth; they used language in public which was designed to convey a picture which they knew to be untrue and to quiet anxieties and controversies which would otherwise have arisen. This was done to deceive the UN in relation to the application of Article 73 to BIOT, the Commonwealth Heads of Government, and MPs. It is pleaded that it was unlawful for a policy and administrative decisions to be based on a pretence and that that constitutes an illegality for the purposes of misfeasance. This was given effect to in the removals and exclusions with which I have dealt. There is a related allegation that the Defendants adopted a policy in 1970 of concealing from the Chagossians, the Mauritius Government, (until 1972), and others that the Chagossians were Citizens of the UK and Colonies in order to encourage the Mauritius Government to take them in and on more favourable terms than might otherwise have been negotiated. Deceiving one’s citizens is also illegality for the purposes of misfeasance. There is also an allegation that the Defendants wilfully failed to balance the individual needs of the Ilois against the foreign and defence interests of the UK by failing to communicate to them their true legal position and the Government policies that affected them.</span>

They investigated through surveys what the population was and certainly knew by the Todd report of 1967 that the Newton Report might have underestimated the numbers of Ilois at a time after the creation of BIOT, which some of the documents show was intended to have no permanent population at all. They were very well aware of the dual citizenship which was acquired upon the independence of Mauritius and that therefore the BIOT population retained its UK and Colonies citizenship. They had a clear and honest picture that the Ilois had no property rights. It is not said in this respect that the Defendants deceived the Claimants, who obviously also knew the true position.</span>

The Defendants would have maintained that same stance generally. But this does not advance the Claimants. This is not an allegation of deceit on the Chagossians who knew what the true position was. I do not see how it can be alleged that there is an actionable legal duty of candour and truthfulness towards the UN, other governments or politicians or MPs, let alone one which can ground an action for misfeasance by those to whom the remarks were not made. The consequence of the lack of candour or half truths may have been that those who might have created more political controversy in support of the Ilois or in opposition to the defence facility, did not do so, but that does not ground an action for misfeasance. It is perfectly possible to recoil from some of the comments without them grounding an action in misfeasance. But whether or not it is wise to conceal facts from the UN or to give a false impression to other Governments must depend on a political judgement which it is for Parliament to judge. There might have been good reasons for not giving ammunition to those who would oppose the UK’s defence policy and for trying to find formulae which are partial truths and only to be used if necessary. The judgement that the defence policy might require UN obligations not to be fulfilled is a matter which is not justiciable in this Court. This is a matter of foreign relations and defence strategy.

But for those deceptions, the UN would have tried at least to give effect to their rights. Mr Howell submitted that this was in effect either trying to enforce rights under an international treaty or trying to obtain the ruling of the Court on the meaning of an international treaty, because the essence of Mr Allen’s argument was that what the UK did was in breach of the UN Charter, which was a matter which could not be determined without reaching a conclusion on what it meant or how it applied to the facts.

He illustrated that in relation to BIOT: it was not clear that all non-independent territories were non self-governing for the purposes of Article 73 and had a duty to be brought to independence; that would rather depend on the circumstances. There had been no General Assembly resolution that BIOT was a NSGT. The UN’s concern has been with the detachment of BIOT. Here Mauritius would be, and would have been after the creation of BIOT, anxious lest BIOT became independent and would not support the UK in achieving that; the Seychelles likewise till its islands were restored in 1976. </span>

The question of whether a court would intervene rather depended on how administrative the decision was or whether there was a policy which might give rise to a legitimate expectation. Here, the relationship with the UN and other states over how to deal with the proposal for an internationally controversial defence arrangement and the consequences for the people on the islands in terms of UN rights is plainly a matter of high policy, in which relationship the Court should not interfere. This allegation should be struck out anyway. I am also satisfied that the Claimants’ broader submissions seek to recover damages for misfeasance or deceit by reference to what was said to the UN or to other Governments and to that extent those claims are unarguable.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">One needs to be careful about what is deduced from the documents anyway about what was known or said about the status of the Ilois. Some are drafts or discussion documents and not necessarily the actual public stance adopted. Some are only for use if necessary and it is not in evidence whether what was proposed to be said actually was said. Some contain comments to protect or advance a particular departmental interest. I say that because there is a danger that the internal documents are treated as the final acts, although they may suggest an outlook, thought process, intention or knowledge. At this stage it is reasonably arguable that what was the agreed line was used on some occasions to the UN or other bodies. However, the description of the Ilois as workers is true on the evidence. No-one worked other than for the plantation company or in a domestic capacity for senior staff. There was no independent economy. Even if for those who were too old to work, there was a company pension or rations, many did light work. There may have been women who did not work at various times but their husbands were working for the company. But there is no evidence of self-employed labourers or fishermen or retailers. At least that is a view which could properly and honestly be held and the reports of Mr Todd suggest that all the Ilois were employed. It is also clear that no-one thought that the Ilois had any property rights to any part of the islands; the islands were owned either by the plantation company or by the Crown. It may be that that view is possibly wrong, but it is a view that was genuinely held and there were perfectly good reasons for holding it. How such a position fits with the rights of those same people who have been there for a number of generations is a matter of some difficulty. The partial truths focussed on the former and ignored the latter part of the problem. The problem with the phrase "</span>

That simply goes to the question of whether the removals were lawful or not, and whether it was lawful to remove a permanent population. If it is, the fact that their status has not been told truthfully and fully to the world does not alter the lawfulness of the act. I do not consider that the Defendants' approach to the description of the Ilois’ status evidences the requisite mental state for misfeasance. The purpose of the half truths or lies was not to deceive themselves as to the law and to enable decisions to be taken on a false basis. They knew only too well what the true position was and that is why they acted to bring about the clearance of BIOT, if that is what they actually did. They misrepresented the position to others for political reasons so as to quell opposition to the defence proposal, to the creation of BIOT and to the removals.</span>

It is said that the Defendants sought to conceal the position and also that they deceived the Ilois, which is I suppose, an allegation that the Defendants’ endeavours were successful. This latter allegation is entirely unparticularised. There is no documentary evidence suggesting that the Ilois should be told that they were not UK citizens or that the Mauritius Government be asked not to tell them. There is no evidence of any Ilois being told that he was not a UK citizen when he was, whether in their oral evidence or in the documents. The evidence is all the other way: when they asked they were told. Michel Vencatessen had "</span>

It was set out perfectly clearly and accurately in the Defence to the Vencatessen litigation in 1975.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">As to the former allegation that the Defendants sought to conceal the position, it is readily arguable that the UK Government was deliberately not forthcoming to the Ilois, and especially not in the early days of the decision to evacuate or during the removals and the early years in Mauritius. It arguably adopted the policy of saying something less than the whole truth in the hope that the implicit denial would be effective. In October 1974, (8/1373-1374), it declined to assist the Ilois, in response to a petition seeking its help, by saying that Mauritius had accepted responsibility for their resettlement and that it could not intervene between Mauritians and their Government. A Mauritian newspaper was pursuing the line that the Ilois were British citizens. Mr Howell said that it was an accepted principle of nationality law that one Government would not intervene between its citizens and the Government of the other country of which they were nationals when they were in that country and that is the principle which underlay the stance. Mr Allen said that that principle could not apply where the individuals were in that other country as a result of wrongs done to them by the country from which they were now seeking protection. Either contention may be the legal position, but the principle of dominant nationality was not the reason, arguably, for the non-intervention. The documents are consistent with a desire to avoid it being known that the Ilois were dual nationals, unless the truth had to be told. The UK Government may well have known that the Ilois did not know really what their British status was, and have done nothing to enlighten them.</span>

I do not accept the general premise of so much of Mr Allen’s argument which relies on the assertions of a governmental responsibility arising out of the fact of citizenship. I do not see the source of a positive obligation on a Government, unpalatable though it may be, to tell its citizens of their legal status. No untruth was said; although the Defendants were avoiding telling the whole truth, they did tell the truth when the issue directly came up. If the author intended to create a false impression, I can see a basis for his acknowledging that that was wrong in a moral or political sense; but, if that were illegal, there is nothing to suggest that he suspected that it might be. The Defendants’ actions were on a number of occasions harsh, callous and less than wholly candid, arguably. It may be that the Defendants should have communicated more with the Ilois about their situation as a matter of responsible politics; it may be that there are many views possible on that. But I am unable to find the illegality in that which would ground an action for misfeasance, arguably.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Finally, it is alleged that the Defendants acted with a conscious disregard for the rights of the islanders and allowed other interests to override them completely. This may in part be the same point in fresh language as I have already considered. It is also wrong on the facts. The documents show some concern about whether the US can be persuaded not to take the whole of BIOT; there were some albeit fruitless endeavours to persuade the US to take Ilois workers. The submission to the Prime Minister and other documents show that although the removal of all the islanders was envisaged, their welfare was to be regarded as an important consideration. There were no removals until after arrangements had been put in place for them to go to countries of which they were citizens and which would take them. Some already had a degree of connection with those countries. There was an agreement for a resettlement fund which would have been more effective had it been distributed earlier by the Mauritius Government. Some thought went into provision for their resettlement. What was done and omitted can readily be criticised but it is simply wrong to say that all was done in disregard of the Ilois and conscious disregard is not justified at all. The fundamental problem was that there was an irreconcilable clash between the interests of the Ilois and the defence interests of the UK and USA. The resolution of that clash was a matter of politics at a fraught time internationally. Whether as the losers in that clash, the Ilois were treated as they should have been is another matter.</span>

Some of the individual allegations are inadequately pleaded, or are too vague to remain anyway and I have indicated those which I would have struck out.

I am acutely conscious of the gravity of the allegations and of the treatment meted out to the Chagossians by this country as a colonial power. But I cannot allow an argument to continue for no better reason than sympathy with the Claimants’ collective misfortune. There is no basis for supposing that there are any significant documents on the Defendants’ side which have not been disclosed. The spirit in which the Defendants have conducted this litigation is different from that in which the earlier litigation started so long ago by Michel Vencatessen was conducted according to Mr Gifford. In any event, the Claimants can read all the relevant documents released under the 30 year rule. Mr Allen proclaims the arrival of volume 23 as the proof that it could not be said that there were no more documents. I accept that there may be documents which have not been disclosed; but that is because the allegation leading to their disclosure has not been made. Volume 23 responds to the allegation that the Private Treaty Ordinance documents had not been disclosed and the Claimants might have wished to make an allegation of targeted malice, a late piece of speculation by the Claimants. The disclosed documents do not support that allegation, they show it to be unsustainable and it has not been pursued. Mr Allen seeks to make something of the documents which have been revealed in another context. But that amounts to saying that if he makes more unfounded allegations, some other documents may emerge by that sidewind. I do not think that anything of significance emerged from that late volume. I am wholly unpersuaded that I should allow the misfeasance case to continue on the speculative possibility that something significant will be thrown up in view of what has already been disclosed, the 30 year rule, the evident openness of the Defendants, and in the absence of any obvious undisclosed stream of correspondence.</span>

Mr Allen suggested some topics upon which he would like to cross-examine. It is not helpful to his cause in that respect that he was, until his closing submissions, unwilling to identify anybody against whom an allegation personally was made. How was the witness to be identified to whom he might wish to put these points? As I understood his case, after taking up some time trying to discern the legal framework to what he had painted with a broad brush and general feeling, the senior Ministers were not the only targets of these allegations but anybody who featured as the author of the documents which he relied on. So he had a large cast list. But the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in office from 1964 to 1970 are dead; the Foreign Secretary from 1970 to 1974 is also dead. Sir Edward Heath is not recorded as having any personal involvement, unlike his Foreign Secretary. A number of other Ministers, from that and later periods are dead, though not all. I do not know about the Commissioners or High Commissioners and Governors. But Mr Todd is dead. Many of those who are alive or who might be are elderly. All those who gave evidence about that period would be doing so about what they had known or believed thirty or more years ago, and however wide Mr Allen casts his net the period crucial for this claim is 1965 to 1974 or thereabouts. I do not believe that they would be able to do more than to rely upon what the documents say. Mr Sheridan, giving evidence about events 20 to 25 years ago was reliant on the documents for his understanding; he accepted what they showed even though he had no actual memory of many events. Mr Glasser was in much the same position. Mr Grosz, who is not elderly, dealing with events of 10 to 20 years ago was unable to remember important details and was reliant on interpreting documents, which did not always refresh his memory. The evidence of the Chagossian witnesses showed how the passage of time had diminished the accuracy and extent of their memories. Where the evidence of a witness is inconsistent with the extensive array of contemporaneous material, it is very difficult to see how the former rather than the latter would be preferred.</span>

The documents are extensive. They were not written for public consumption for the most part and there is no reason to suppose that they do not contain the actual views and beliefs of the authors. They had no reason to deceive each other. The documents, by their very tone, suggest internal candour. There may, of course, be an element of self-protection in some of what is written by one official to another on a controversial plan in case of trouble later if it all unravels, but that aspect is unhelpful to Mr Allen’s approach. Mr Allen’s case as to the iniquity of the Defendants’ actions and motives is that the documents show it. I have dealt with what they may show, but it is difficult to see that a new case could be fashioned out of cross-examination. A witness might be asked about what he knew or suspected for the purpose of the mental element of the tort, but the documents explain what was known and believed and why the stances and lines which Mr Allen criticises were adopted. Appealing though it might be, and in one sense perhaps justified, it is not the function of litigation to provide a forum in which, outside of the framework of the torts alleged, cross-examination is permitted so as to achieve the effect of an inquiry into possible government failings and wrongdoings of the nature generally alleged by Mr Allen as his starting point for the consideration of this tort.</span>

As to the first, I have already dealt with the possible duties as a matter of law. I would have thought that the answer as to why they were not consulted about whether there should be a defence facility was tolerably obvious; it is discussed by the then Foreign Secretary in the memo of April 1969. I cannot see what any cross-examination would advance. They could have been consulted about what was to become of them; that failure is arguably unlawful. But I cannot see how cross-examination has any prospect of showing what the documents do not even hint at, which is that whoever Mr Allen targets as a relevant malefactor, knew or suspected that there was a legal duty to do so.</span>

People communicated by documentary means, they minuted meetings, they wrote notes on each others’ memos. Communications with the UN mission or the BIOT Commissioner or High Commissioners were in writing. There was every reason for officials to put down what they thought in writing. So many were involved that it is difficult to see that there could have been some general conspiracy or even a tight knit one to keep off paper the supposed recognition that there was something perhaps unlawful about what was proposed. More curious still, the notion that they were prepared in robust or callous language to deal with the way in which the political problems were to be handled, upon which Mr Allen relies so heavily, and yet were to deal with other, legal, anxieties in conversations never to be recorded. His case is that the papers raise an arguable case of misfeasance; they do not. He cannot hope to make it good by a speculative, wide-ranging cross-examination of whomsoever he eventually identifies, who is still alive and can remember what he thought at the time other than through the documents. It is not without importance in this context that, at any trial, the burden will be on the Claimants to prove their case and to do so with the cogency required in relation to allegations of such gravity.</span>

They were put forward as typical. If they did not support all the allegations of fact in the pleadings, as they did not, there is no reason to suppose that any others would do any better. The pleadings were presumably based on the witness statements which had been prepared for the hearing and on those prepared for the Bancoult Judicial Review. In certain respects the basis of the pleading has been shown to be inaccurate. I do not accept that an allegation should be made and then the witness found to sustain it.

It is pleaded that the Defendants made false statements of existing fact to a range of people, including but not limited to the Chagossians, knowing them to be false, intending the Chagossians and others to act on them to the detriment of the Chagossians. Although the individuals making the representations are not specified, this is a case where the pleadings incorporate by reference specific documents which may or may not identify some of those against whom this serious allegation is made. But the pleading makes it clear that it relies as well on other unspecified documents. As with the inadequate pleading of the misfeasance claim, this vagueness is not appropriate for the reasons which I have given. A claim of dishonesty against a large group of individuals, or some and perhaps not others, is unfair and a wasteful way of conducting proceedings. There is no reason why they should not be identified even if it is only as the author of the document. I would require that to be done before any further steps were taken. That should enable it to be seen what is alleged to have been represented to whom and how. Anything less would make the efficient preparation of the case very much more difficult.

A bank employee gave a false reference to another bank, inquiring of it as to the solvency of its customer, intending that the inquirer’s customer should act on the lie and engage in a business deal which failed. The misled customer sued the bank which had given the false reference. This does not support the sort of case which Mr Allen mounts. It is plain that a misrepresentation can be made through a conduit, and that it can be made to an agent. It can be made to someone who, having sought the information as an agent, is expected to pass it on to the person who acts upon it in the way intended. But Mr Allen’s case is that the representations were not passed on. They were acted on by others in an entirely different way. I also found the case of </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> illustrates it, but it is incontrovertible. I accept that it is arguable that false statements were knowingly made to third parties about the status of the Ilois as residents on Chagos, but with the intent that those third parties should act on them, rather than communicate them to the Ilois, who would have known that the statements were untrue. They may have been intended the persuade those third parties to do nothing to investigate or assist the Ilois, or to reduce opposition to the Defendants’ defence policies. Mr Allen sought to create a variant tort of deceit to fit the problem. He urged that it was arguable that if a false representation is made to a third party, intending him not to alert the Claimant to harm which is intended to be done to him by the representor, but which he would have helped to avert or to warn the Claimant about, the variant tort of deceit would have been committed. This he said was consistent with principle. It was stronger if there was a duty owed to the Claimant by either of the others but not essential. I do not follow this. If the act done or representation made to the Claimant, whether by word or deed, is a wrong which sounds in damages as a tort, the Claimant has his remedy. If it is not, I do not understand why the fact that a lie has been told to a third party converts it into one. This whole basis of claim is posited on an absence of communication between third party and Claimant. This is not a case where the third party owed a legal duty to communicate with or to look after the interests of the Claimants, in the exercise of which the false statements interfered, deceiving the Claimants. Indeed, Mr Allen really sees this part of his argument as strengthening his case that there was a deception practised on the Chagossians.</span>

What is meant by the assertion that they were made by implication from non-disclosure, is that the specified representation was not made and that its content was not expressly denied either. There may be occasions where there is a duty to speak such as where a representation was made believing it to be true but the representor discovers that it was untrue, but none of those circumstances apply here.

If it were said it would, arguably, have been to encourage islanders to go peacefully when the time came. I have already expressed my views on the prospects of the intimidation allegations, the promises of compensation and the statements of danger being made good but that does not mean that the basic premise for the allegation that the representation was made is ill-founded.

The UK is entitled so far as any domestic law obligations go to ignore it. It is fanciful to suppose that there could have been representation which was intended to cover international treaty obligations between states. Mr Todd, for example, would not have intended any statement to cover that. He would have been focusing on the contract and residence position. Even if there had been such a representation, it would be necessary to show that it conferred rights against the UK on the people of BIOT. I have already explained that the nature of those obligations, as between states and the UN, are not justiciable nor are any representations about them capable of founding any arguable deceit claim. There is no evidence that anyone who might have made any such representation to the Ilois knew of or was reckless as to the falsity of that statement.

I am prepared to go along with that. Its essential features would be that the Crown could not send out of British territory a British citizen of the territory or a belonger of that territory without either the free consent of the person or by statutory authority. Similarly the Crown may not prevent or obstruct the return of such a person without statutory authority. The tort continues to be committed from the moment of wrongful departure until return. Here, it was alleged that the Chagossians were "</span>

They were removed without their consent, or without fully informed consent, and those who had left voluntarily were prevented from returning or their return was obstructed as was that of the islanders who left on the evacuations. The tort continues in relation to Diego Garcia because the Crown has not contemplated that they can return there at least to live; it continues in relation to Peros Banhos and Salomon because the Crown has not removed the practical impediments to that return, which include the cost of transportation and the creation of an infrastructure which would sustain a modest but viable way of life.</span>

A number of academic histories of the law and well known commentaries from Blackstone, Holdsworth, Stephen and others broadly support that position. Exile or transportation as a punishment, to which consent was given to avoid something worse, was replaced by statutory provisions for the transportation of convicts to colonies. International treaties, to which the UK is a party, reflect that developing law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 states in Article 13(2) that "</span>

The first case is the earliest in the line of authority which developed into misfeasance. The question in the second case was not whether a tort should be held to exist, nor was the conclusion that wherever loss was suffered through a wrong, a tort should be created so that damages could be awarded. If that were so, damages would be available routinely for administrative acts which were unlawful, but they are not. The question was whether in order to recover damages for the tort which existed, it was necessary to show specific loss. He said that there were analogies with other torts such as trespass to the person or to property. That may be so but tells against rather than for another tort to be recognised, after so many years of the developing law on exile, during which time it has never been the subject of any argument, that I was shown, that it was a tort. An additional reason why it was argued that it should be a tort was that it would provide a remedy for wrongs and in that way hold liable those who did wrong, maintain the obligations of those who wield power to wield for its lawful ends only and thus vindicate the rule of law in a civil society.</span>

The remedy is by way of Judicial Review, and the difficulties in that respect faced by these Claimants do not afford a basis for creating a tort sounding in damages. There is no parallel in false imprisonment; this is false exclusion and there are no analogous cases such as exclusion from the highway or a public place. There is no parallel in any general tort because this tort can by its very nature only be committed by the state; it was not seriously suggested that a private landowner other than the state would not be able to exercise its private law rights so as to exclude an individual from a territory if it owned the necessary land.</span>

There was, contrary to what Mr Allen said, a relevant reservation to the ratification of the ICCPR 1966, which reserved the right not just to apply the Convention separately to each of the territories of the UK and Colonies, but also to apply such immigration legislation in each of its territories as it thought fit for those who did not have the right to enter or remain. This thus leaves open the question of who has such a right. I think that it is of some significance that Protocol Four of the ECHR has not been ratified. I do not find the concept of the "</span>

An omission in that respect is said to be tortious. The indissoluble bonds of citizenship and the governing obligations imposed such a duty. This is untenable. There is no duty to provide transport, employment, the wherewithal to sustain life or accommodation and a refusal to do so cannot be tortious. There can be no obligation, still less a tort if it is breached, to make private land available. I have already dealt with the prevention of return on the facts, but there is no better justification for prevention of return being part of a tort of exile than there is for obstruction.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There can be no tortious liability for enacting the 1971 Immigration Ordinance, nor for enacting the property acquisition Ordinance which enabled the Crown to acquire the private rights which it then exercised. There can be no tort of exile in relation to the enforced move of islanders from one island to another; there is no possible right to stay on one particular island unless that particular island itself is the relevant territory of citizenship. There is no basis for arguing that there is any right, in principle, for the Chagossians who lived on Diego Garcia not to be removed from Diego Garcia to another BIOT island, let alone to another island within the Chagos Archipelago. If there is a right not to be exiled, and a right to return, it can only apply to BIOT and not to Chagos, let alone to every island within the Archipelago. None of the law relied on by Mr Allen would support such a right. It is a commonplace for people to have to leave the area in which they live because of Government proposals. Here the Claimants can only succeed in relation to the removals from Diego Garcia, because the move from Diego Garcia to another BIOT island was temporary and the other islands were closed as a consequence of the effects of the defence proposals. Much of the pleading of this tort is designed to promote such a right and to apply it to the other islands individually. (There is some evidence that the islanders regarded themselves as residents of one particular island rather than as residents of the whole Archipelago.) It is also designed to counter the effect of the 2000 Immigration Ordinance which permits return to Peros Banhos and Salomon, and which puts an end to any argument about the tort continuing. One can see how this is important to the Claimants but that is not the point in law. It is reflected in a pleading which makes no distinction between those who left the Chagos before the creation of BIOT, those who were born there, and those who were born on Mauritius and have never been there.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The property case as pleaded is that the Chagossians acquired ownership of the land which they occupied by prescription or succession under the French Civil Code which was applicable in Mauritius and hence in its Chagos Dependency both before the creation of BIOT and in 1967 when the land was acquired from the Chagos Agalega Company Limited. This required thirty years occupation of the land but that did not have to be by the same person for the whole period. Once acquired, those rights were capable of being transferred or inherited. The Chagossians did the acts of an owner, such as building a house or growing crops, with the intent that they should be owners. All this was manifest and uninterrupted. The rights thus acquired entitled them to enjoy, exploit and to alienate the land. The rights were not acquired over Crown land; and it must follow that the claim is that they were acquired over the private land of the plantation company. I say this because although there is some land on Diego Garcia, at least, which was not in the freehold ownership of the plantation company, that land was thought to be Crown land, and the land which the company did own covered on any view the main areas where houses were to be found. No other private owner has even been hinted at as the person against whom this acquisition by prescription has occurred.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There are obvious problems in the way of this as the source for some of the general assertions about the rights of Chagossians and of the wrongs which it is said, but not pleaded, were done by the passing of the relevant legislation and by the acquisition of the land from the Chagos Agalega Company Limited. The right asserted is not one which is confined to someone who was born on the islands but could apply to the last occupier in the thirty year period, who could have been a contract worker. There are many Chagossians who might not have lived in a house which had been erected for thirty years. The latest point at which someone’s house would have had to be erected on Chagos, in order to take advantage of this argument, is 1937 because, if by 1967 the right had not accrued, there would have been no right which it could have been said the relevant legislation and purchase improperly removed. No witness gave evidence that there was any such property although Mr Marcel Moulinie said that when he arrived in 1965, he had understood that some houses had been lived in by generations of Chagossians. But from the evidence as to how the houses were built, it is plain that in the years about which the witnesses spoke, many Chagossians built the houses in which they lived far more recently than 1937. Indeed, no person at all is identified as enjoying a right so acquired. The questionnaire which is supposed to be part of the Particulars of Claim is quite incapable, except by happenstance, of identifying any person who could claim to be the beneficiary of the right as pleaded. The actual evidence given revealed the difficulty of statements attributing legal concepts of ownership, possession and occupation to those who naturally say in respect of where they live, that that is their house. Their claims were not supported by Mr Marcel Moulinie who denied that they owned any land. In the </span>

I do not consider that I can at this stage hold that it is not reasonably possible that such a claim could be made out and Mr Howell did not press its unlikelihood. So I shall proceed on that basis. Nonetheless, the very weakness of the evidence to support the claim is relevant to the assertion that there was any knowledge of or reckless indifference to illegality or that the legislation was enacted or used to acquire land in a manner which was designed to defeat the property rights of Chagossians.</span>

The pleading is seriously deficient as it contains no particulars of any act relied on as constituting a breach of any of those rights; if the action were to proceed, the allegation should specify what acts are relied on under each head. At present, the best that can be said is that I have from the submissions some sort of sense of what the Claimants are driving at in relation to property and I assume that everything from the fact and manner of evacuation, the journey and the lack of reception or assistance in Mauritius is encompassed by the allegation of inhuman treatment. These allegations were said to encompass torts, unpleaded, which included trespass and conversion, which were torts by BIOT law and under English law.</span>

These appear to relate to the clearing of other interests off the title acquired. There is nothing at all to suggest that it was intended to avoid giving notice to any Chagossians. There is nothing to suggest that anyone thought that they might have any rights of possession at all; Mr Moulinie did not think that they did. It is perfectly clear that workers, even if there for many generations, can occupy property simply as service occupiers for the better performance of their duties. There is no contemporaneous evidence from any source that suggests that anyone thought the position was otherwise. There is no evidence of anyone erecting a house without the company's assistance to him as its worker. It is just simpler in those circumstances to proceed by private treaty.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">, the effect of similar language in the New Territories Land Court Ordinance 1900 was considered. Section 15 of it provided: "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">All land in the New Territories is hereby declared to be the property of the Crown …</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". It deemed the occupiers to be trespassers unless their occupation was authorised by the Crown. This replaced Chinese customary tenure, which was assignable and heritable. One of the issues in the case was whether that customary interest survived so that a developer whose land was being acquired for a price below its market value, could rely on it. It was held that the land vested in the Crown under that wide declaratory power. The effect of the BIOT Repeal Ordinance is thus unarguably to remove any Chagossian property rights which had survived the acquisition of land from Chagos Agalega Company Limited. If there were any surviving interests over the intervening fifteen years from the acquisition, and no claim had come forward, they were thus ended. More than twelve years had elapsed since the evacuation of Diego Garcia anyway, when the land was fully possessed by others.</span>

As to the former, I conclude that there is nothing which arguably breaches the Royal Instructions; the two matters relate to each other and are sensibly included in the one Ordinance, the title of which is apt to cover its total content. An extinguishment provision upon an acquisition for a public purpose is not unexpected.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" in section 15 of the BIOT Order, below, is a phrase wide enough to include the common law or equitable principles which would be invoked as substitutes for the disapplied provisions of the Civil Code under which the Claimants might have enjoyed property rights.) This is too ambitious a submission at any rate for this stage of proceedings. Section 11 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance 1981 No 4 prevents the repeal of any local enactment affecting any right previously acquired under any enactment. Mr Taylor relied upon this provision and it may be that the Civil Code of Mauritius falls into that category. But I consider the stronger point to be that section 3 is inapt, arguably, to remove rights at all. If, despite the two Ordinances which were already effective, some property right had survived, I do not read section 3 as removing it. It would have to be transformed instead into something recognisable in English law, but subject to the permitted local variations which would give ample scope for adaptation. It does mean that any pleaded right would have to be couched in perhaps different language from that of the Civil Code but I have no difficulty in seeing that something could be pleaded. However, that still leaves intact Mr Howell’s two earlier and better points, which are conclusive as to property rights subject to the effect of the Mauritius Constitution. </span>

Mr Taylor relied on the rights set out in the Schedule to the Mauritius (Constitution) Order 1964. It is the Schedule which contains the Constitution. The first Chapter contains the fundamental rights which represent the Claimants’ primary target for inclusion in the BIOT legislative canon but, surprisingly, they did not limit their case to that part and said that other parts might also be included. Those other parts include Chapters dealing with the setting up of the legislature in Mauritius, the Council of Ministers, the judicature, the public service and the Governor. I regard the inclusion of those parts, other than Chapter 1, in the BIOT legislation as nonsense. It would be wholly inconsistent with the BIOT Order.</span>

The phrase has to be construed in context. The BIOT Order was the Constitution for BIOT. It provided for a new colony, drawn from both the Seychelles and Mauritius. Its creation had a purpose. Mauritius was redefined by the BIOT Order so as to exclude BIOT from the Mauritius Constitution. It would be very odd if by the sidewind of the general incorporation of existing laws from the two colonies from which the islands had been detached, BIOT had incorporated a part of the Constitution of one colony from which it was being detached, and had provided for fundamental rights to be enjoyed only by those who were in the former Mauritius part. This is the importance of the definition of "</span>

Had their incorporation been intended, there would have been an express incorporation or listing of the rights to be enjoyed. His distinction between what can be done upon the independence of a colony and upon the creation of a new colony is unsupported by any reason.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Even if Mr Taylor were right, I do not see how that would avail his property rights arguments. If the Ordinances are otherwise valid, they would take precedence over any such rights as were preserved by the incorporation of part of the Mauritius Constitution. The Claimants’ argument is that the rights in question are within the scope of section 15 of the Order and it is that which enables them to be preserved as an enactment. But it is clear from the terms of section 15 that it does not entrench them as rights which cannot be overridden or as rights against which the constitutionality or validity of Ordinances has to be measured. Accordingly, by virtue of section 15 (1), they can be repealed or modified by legislation passed under section 11 for the "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">peace, order and good government</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" of BIOT or passed under other lawful authority. I regard Mr Taylor’s argument that an Ordinance could only have the effect of overriding existing law under section 15 if it expressly said so, as an understandable but untenable attempt to interpret section 15 as some half effective entrenching provision. It could only require clear words as to the legislative effect intended and there is no doubt about that in the Ordinances. If the Ordinances do conflict with any provisions of the constitution, their language is clear enough to enable them to override those constitutional provisions. I do not accept that the effect of section 3 of the Private Treaty Ordinance is to require all actual owners of all interests to agree to the sale of property; that is wholly contrary to the rest of the provisions of the Ordinance, including the overreaching provisions. Mr Howell pointed out that in </span>

That was held to permit the acquisition of land at a price which ignored the development value of the land, even though the Peking Convention, under which the New Territories were leased, forbad expropriation and required a fair price to be paid for land acquired. Unless an attack can be mounted on the legislation in question as not being within section 11, that legislation could remove property rights without compensation or compliance with other provisions of the Mauritius Constitution. There is no English law to which the Ordinance has been shown to be repugnant in the sense of section 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Howell further submitted that it would be very difficult for the Court to give effect to the Mauritius Constitution, even if somehow it were incorporated into BIOT legislation as entrenched rights. The rights are subject to the limitations set out in the Constitution. First, the right in section 6 was not breached nor that in section 1 because what happened was legislative extinction of title with the interest overreached into the purchase money. Section 1 dealt with deprivation of property and section 6 dealt with compulsory purchase; neither dealt with legislative extinction of title with a provision for overreaching into the purchase price; </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">La Compagnie Sucriere v Government of Mauritius 1995 (3) LRC 494 PC. </span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">As a matter of dry legal analysis that is clearly correct. The Claimants might however have been able to make something of the manner in which the payments were made, to say that this was in reality a deprivation of property and that the availability of knowledge as to the acquisition and possible share of the purchase money was so limited as to amount to deprivation without compensation. But it is difficult to see how that would invalidate the legislation itself. Second, section 6 permits compulsory acquisition in the interests of defence; unless the defence interests of the UK and her Colonies are irrelevant, and the only relevant defence interest is that of BIOT itself, which was not suggested by Mr Allen, it is difficult to see how the Court could be in a position to assess the nature and extent of the defence needs, national security and foreign policy against the interests of the islanders. The only argument was that the UK had balanced the interests in a way which was unlawful because of the interests of the islanders which were completely overridden. However, that might go to the </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> of the legislation and whether the appropriate compensation procedures had been emplaced and followed through. If the Claimants had overcome the many hurdles to establish an entrenched right in BIOT to the benefit of the property provisions of the Mauritius Constitution, it is arguable that they were breached, but I do not see that they can achieve the necessary steps on the way.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There was some argument about the role of double actionability in relation to the Claimants’ reliance upon the incorporated parts of the Mauritius Constitution, to the extent that it had been incorporated. Mr Howell launched the argument as yet another reason why the Claimants’ case was hopeless. Part of the problem of analysis arises from the rather poor pleading which underlies this part of the case. If it is said that acts were done which were torts recognisable as such both in English law and in BIOT law, that meets the requirements of the principle of double actionability in tort and the Constitution is irrelevant. On that basis there is no need at all to examine the double actionability rule, even before the coming into force of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 on 1</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana">st</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> May 1996, which removes the double actionability rule in relation to acts done after that date. None of the acts relied on in relation to the property rights arise after 1996, and there are no pleaded acts in relation to inhuman treatment which arise after that date, or none which are not already pleaded in relation to other torts. For example, part of Mr Taylor’s argument was that there had been a conversion of or trespass to the Claimants’ property. But that raises no double actionability issue.</span>

It appears, despite some of the submissions, that this is the Claimants’ point and that it includes an argument that section 14 of the Mauritius Constitution was also incorporated into BIOT law, providing a direct means for enforcing those rights. If it had been, which it has not, there might have been a case for the direct enforcement of those rights through the English Courts, if the relevant property legislation did not override the property related rights including privacy here. I refer to enforcement through the English Courts rather than the BIOT Courts because the Defendants do not seek to take jurisdictional points and are prepared at present for the English Courts to be regarded as having the same powers as the BIOT Court. Jurisdiction, which is absent, cannot be created by consent but at this stage, that is no adequate reason for holding against the Claimants.</span>

There was and at present still is no cause of action in tort for breach of privacy or for taking property under statutory authority, if it clearly so provides, without compensation. An action in trespass in theory would satisfy the double actionability rule, but the alleged breach of the Constitution is not arguably the same as the tort of trespass. There is no tort as such of subjecting someone to inhuman treatment; it may constitute other recognised torts, in which case double actionability is satisfied but there is no pleading of any such tort or reference to the facts upon which it might be based. There is no tort of breaching a constitutional right.</span>

The purpose of the Ordinance and of the consequential acquisition of land from Chagos Agalega Company Limited was in part the legitimate one, on the Claimants’ case, of providing for a defence facility for the UK and the USA. But it was also in part for the illegitimate purpose of removing the population of BIOT whether as an end in itself or as a means to the achievement of the particular defence facilities actually provided. However powerful a case could be made for the UK's defence interests, section 11 did not provide such an enabling power. On the </span>

The Private Treaty Ordinance was invalid, the acquisition of land under it and the consequential extinction of title was either ineffective or sounded in damages for trespass or conversion of real and personal property.

If there were some limit on the powers of acquisition, how much private land had to be left, for whom and why, when they had no right to reside there? The Government should not be in a worse position when exercising its powers to acquire and use land for a public purpose. There was no purpose, behind the legislation or the land acquisition, of removing the population but it would not have been unlawful if it had been part of the purpose to remove people from part of BIOT, Diego Garcia, to another part, as happened.

It was moreover landowning powers which it is quite clear were used to remove the people who were removed. This is reasonably arguably not a case where powers to remove were taken but not used and powers taken for another purpose, entirely or substantially, were the powers used. Following </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There are plainly delay and prejudice considerations of some magnitude which lie in the way of an application for judicial review to quash the Private Treaty Ordinance, not least because it was repealed in 1983. Its purpose in relation to the UK's defence interests was plain on its face and had been so for the 16 years before its repeal without any point being taken. Third party interests had intervened together with those of the defence and foreign policy interests of the UK and the US. This argument would involve quashing the 1983 Ordinance. I do not see the basis upon which that could be done. It does not appear either to have the same continuing effect as the 1971 Immigration Ordinance and its quashing would have to be accompanied by restitution of interests acquired long ago for it to have a direct effect on any claim to return. Any claim for damages for trespass which relied upon the possible unlawfulness of the Private Treaty Ordinance to remove a defence argument as to lawful authority, but which left intact the 1983 Ordinance, would be governed and defeated by the ordinary law relating to limitation. There is no basis for that aspect of the pleadings to be amended to raise a case which cannot succeed.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">This claim related solely to the conditions faced by the Chagossians upon their arrival in the Seychelles and in Mauritius after the evacuations and faced by those who were prevented from returning to Chagos after going to Mauritius for vacation, medical treatment or the like. It did not relate to the conditions experienced on some of the voyages and indeed despite the evidence about them, there is no specific cause of action pleaded which relates to them.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The basis of the claim is that there was and is a duty to provide for the well-being of those Chagossians who were removed from or prevented from returning to Chagos and for their descendants. The pleading is unclear as to whether it covers those who left the Chagos voluntarily before the creation of BIOT, or indeed afterwards. No limit on the number of generations to whom this duty is owed is stated, though in their further closing submissions, the Claimants say that this means those who are entitled to British citizenship as a result of their connection with the Chagos under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. That is of limited help in defining those to whom the duty was owed before that date. It appears from submissions and from the contention that this is a continuing tort and that a duty is owed in 2003 to the children and grandchildren of someone removed in 1971. It is not clear if those who are not living on Mauritius or the Seychelles are included. It is another piece of inadequately thought out pleading.</span>

The duty is to take reasonable steps to provide for their well-being, which includes housing, feeding, employment, healthcare, social needs and community facilities. It is a duty to take care of them. What was necessary was the wherewithal to lead a roughly comparable lifestyle to the one which they had enjoyed on the Chagos. Although the duty is said to be to take reasonable steps, the steps required are in fact those necessary to achieve that particular outcome; they involve the direct or indirect payment of money.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The source of this wide-ranging duty is the governmental obligation owed, the assumption of responsibility for them and the events to which they were subjected. Part of the unpleaded background but which surfaced in submissions was the Defendants’ knowledge that the Chagossians were illiterate, did not speak English, had no access to lawyers to assist in the enforcement of their rights and were made indigent by the acts of the Defendants. Another part was the allegation that the Defendants were the employers or paymasters of the Chagossians or in a closely analogous position. (The former is just wrong; the latter merely an inaccurate way of saying that the Defendants exercised control indirectly over many aspects of their lives, daily and in the longer term.) The Defendants were responsible for the creation of communities of Chagossians in Mauritius and in the Seychelles "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">many of whom were compelled to live in conditions of abject poverty with no means of escape …</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". The assumption of responsibility was evidenced by the payment of some compensation under the 1982 Agreement. The pleadings point to the creation of BIOT, the acquisition of the land and the day to day control which the Defendants had over the plantations and over their long term future, and over the islanders and their long term future as well. It was the Defendants who decided to close the plantations and to evacuate the islands. The Defendants had accepted that there would be a resettlement obligation upon them.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The breach of duty, it was said, started with the initial failure to make adequate provision for those who were stranded on Mauritius and prevented from returning, and then for those who were evacuated from the Chagos. The pleading assumes that all left involuntarily or that it makes no difference to the liability of the Defendants. There is a continuing failure to make adequate provision for them. The pleading refers to the great poverty in which most have lived, with few of the amenities of life or adequate facilities in relation to jobs, healthcare, education and housing. This had been caused by the displacement from the Chagos with inadequate resettlement arrangements. Such facilities have never been provided and so there is a continuing failure. The Agreements of 1972 and 1982 did not discharge those obligations in fact and could not do so in law, as they were Agreements with a third party, the Government of Mauritius.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The full scope of this pleading cannot be appreciated without regard to the second revision to the draft Amended Reply on Limitation and Abuse, which accompanied the written closing submissions. This repeated a point made at an earlier stage that the negligence claim, and the other causes of action, should be seen as including a claim for damages for personal injuries. I would not have realised that just from reading the original Particulars of Claim. But in the proposed Re-Amended Particulars of Claim it is said that the personal injuries included diseases linked to poverty and poor living conditions. These included malaria, stomach disorders, Hepatitis A, mental illness, suicide and drug addiction. These were caused by the Defendants’ unspecified "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">wrongful acts</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" and by the poverty into which those acts cast the Claimants. It is not alleged that those personal injuries were reasonably foreseeable as a result of those acts. It is not clear, but I think it probable that there are two causes said to be at work, wrongful acts and poverty, which may act both separately or together. The pleaders excuse the vagueness about which individual Claimants have suffered from what injuries, on the grounds that these are only group Particulars. I am not at all persuaded by that. This claim came in as a means of dealing with a very obvious and potent limitation argument, so as to try to take advantage of section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980. It does not appear to have been thought of before then. None of the questions on the individual questionnaires relate directly to such a head of claim and they are part of the group Particulars. If the questionnaires had yielded the basis for such a head of claim, it would only have been by happenstance.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Howell contended that the pleadings gave rise to no arguable case, first, by contending that no duty of the width contended for could arguably arise in negligence; in effect it was a matter for legislation. Mr Taylor supported the pleadings by the following submissions. Whether a duty of care arose was a fact-dependant question of law. It would be a startling result if there were no duty requiring reasonable conduct from the Defendants towards the Claimants, leaving the behaviour of unreasonable governments to be moderated only by Judicial Review. This claim did not depend upon it being established that any of the removals or the prevention of return was itself an unlawful act. The Defendants had control over the Claimants’ destinies, took the decisions which led to their departures and to their being unable to return, and did so knowing that they would be harmed thereby. The Defendants accepted in many documents before and after the removals that they were responsible for the Claimants' resettlement. BIOT had been created with removals in mind. The Claimants had been "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">hijacked</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". That made it fair, just and reasonable that there should be a duty of care imposed on their relationship. The level of control, the governing obligations and the weakness of the Chagossians created a relationship of sufficient proximity. There was a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid harm to them. The Claimants asserted that their case was close in principle to the circumstances in which liability arose in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] AC 1004</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">. The Home Office owed a duty of care to neighbouring owners to take reasonable steps to control the boys so as to avoid the manifest risk to their property if they did not do so. As Mr Howell correctly pointed out, the acts which the boys ought to have been inhibited from doing were unlawful acts. That decision is some distance away from this case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Taylor responded to Mr Howell’s next submission that if there were any such duty, the discretionary or policy component was such that it could not be justiciable, by contending that the relevant decisions leading to the evacuation of the islands were unlawful, but that in any event, what was being complained of was not the removals as such but the lack of provision for those removed or prevented from returning. Anyone could see the scope for psychological or other harm. The governmental discretions exercised here were not of such a nature as to mean that the court would be substituting its views for those of the executive, in circumstances where it was Parliament's intention that the executive should make the decisions. Alternatively, this should be seen as an abuse of discretion.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">X v Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633 738h</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> where Lord Browne-Wilkinson had held in relation to a statutory discretion, that a decision within it was not actionable at common law, and that a decision outside its ambit might be.

Accordingly, for a decision in the exercise of a statutory discretion to be actionable at common law, it had to involve no element of policy matters, had to be outside the scope of the discretion, if that were justiciable, and then it had to be fair, just and reasonable for a duty of care to be imposed. Policy matters would include the allocation of resources and the determination of general policies. An allegation about the appropriate level of service for someone's needs might involve policy matters.</span>

Lord Slynn, at p653, held that the mere fact that an act was done within the ambit of a statutory discretion did not mean that no action at common law could arise from it. Whilst other conditions for tortious liability would have to be satisfied, it would only be non-justiciable if what had been done involved the weighing of competing public interests or was dictated by considerations upon which Parliament cannot have intended that the court should substitute its views for those of the executive. Lord Clyde, at p674, further stated that if what were done amounted to an abuse of the discretion because it was totally unreasonable, it too could be actionable.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Howell's third submission was that any duty to take reasonable steps had been discharged by the 1972 Agreement or by the 1982 Agreement. It did not matter that these were not agreements with the Chagossians individually because it was obvious that any duty of the sort pleaded by the Claimants was capable reasonably of being discharged by arrangements made with the Government of the country in which the Chagossians were residing. The situation in the Seychelles was different anyway. Mr Taylor submitted that the real issue was whether there had been a remedy for the breach of duty and that there could not have been a remedy as the damage continued to occur. The sum offered in 1972 was not and was known not to be sufficient. It was patently not possible to argue that a payment ten years after the Chagossians had left the islands discharged the duty of care. The only question was whether there had been a remedy for the breach of the duty not whether there had been a discharge; the 1982 payments could not be determined at this stage to be adequate compensation so as to remedy the breach. In any event this argument had no application to the Chagossians on the Seychelles.</span>

The relevant assumption of responsibility has to create a special relationship; whether such an assumption of responsibility had occurred depended on an objective analysis of what was said or done by the Defendants, and whether the Claimants did in fact and could reasonably have relied upon an assumption of responsibility. So far as personal injury was concerned, all that had to be shown was that it was reasonably foreseeable that the Defendants’ actions would lead to personal injury and that there was sufficient proximity of relationship, the former usually demonstrating the latter too.</span>

As pleaded, it is far too broad a claim to be arguable. Indeed it is scarcely possible to recognise it as a claim in negligence at all. It confuses the concept of a common law duty of care, with a general moral obligation to care for someone. It is not alleged to be a duty to avoid a reasonably foreseeable type of harm. It is not dependant upon an unlawful act. I understand why the case is pleaded in the broad terms in which it is; the Claimants seek redress for the treatment meted out to them in the 1970s, in circumstances where the idea that there is no legal redress at all, not even arguably, could seem to be an affront to moral justice. But the case has to be seen in a legal framework, nonetheless. An affront to justice is not a cause of action nor do unfulfilled moral or political obligations become the source of legal obligations.</span>

There is no duty on a contractor to renew a contract with a supplier who in consequence goes out of business.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Given the asserted source of the duty in indissoluble governing obligations which endure from generation to generation, it is difficult to see how it could not also apply to anyone who was destitute or lacking their former lifestyle or basic amenities, whether they were in their country or in another one. It is not clear why it should not apply to any UK citizen resident in the UK, or to any UK citizen who was not in the UK but happened to be abroad. The pleaded case is not confined to those who were removed from the Chagos or prevented from returning, so that characteristic of some Claimants is not a necessary characteristic for the duty to arise. In any event there are many people who, in roughly analogous situations, may suffer at the hands of a government decision in respect of which compensation is either unavailable or inadequate to enable resumption of a previous lifestyle. That is an unhappy consequence of blight, aircraft noise, planning decisions and compulsory acquisition, particularly where the acquired interests have no real market value. The duty would apply to all those too. The restrictions which the Claimants may try to impose upon their version of the tort are not principled but arbitrary, and disguise the wide and general ramifications which it would have. There is no reason why the duty should only arise upon removal to another country rather than upon removal to another BIOT island, or to another part of the same country upon which the means of sustaining the former lifestyle were absent or upon which conditions of destitution prevailed. Why should such a duty not exist to prevent the withdrawal of economic support for the plantations or transportation upon which the islanders depended for their lives in the islands? But the duty is more extensive yet. It covers not merely the then unborn children and grandchildren of those who were removed or prevented from returning, together with any who qualify under the British Overseas Territory Act 2002 as British subjects, but also all those who left the Chagos voluntarily even before the creation of BIOT. Indeed, the 2002 Act creates the further problem that section 6 gives British citizenship to people who were not British citizens before that Act, so the duty only began to apply to them when it was brought into force.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The scope of the duty is akin to a duty of equivalent reinstatement and perpetual maintenance whenever a Government decision impacts adversely on an individual. As pleaded, it is akin to the requirement to provide an advanced welfare state, with all the aspects of modern social welfare covered together with jobs. Although the duty is couched as a duty to take reasonable steps, it is in effect an obligation to achieve that outcome. This is to treat the law of negligence as requiring the sort of provision which it must be for the legislature to decide, for the implications for policy and expenditure are enormous. The claim does not depend upon any statutory duty being found nor upon any statutory power existing. The law of negligence would be exploited to impose on government a very extensive duty which no legislature has seen fit to impose. No power or duty has been identified either in UK legislation or in the BIOT legislation whereby either Defendant may undertake such extensive responsibilities for anyone, let alone citizens outside those territories. In the absence of such a statutory power, it cannot be negligent to act as if that power did not exist. Assuming that it is the prerogative which enabled the resettlement agreements to be made, it would be a quite extraordinary extension of the court’s role for it to be enabled to impose such a duty on the exercise of the prerogative. The same would apply to any argument that section 5 of the BIOT Order gave the necessary power to the Commissioner. The law of negligence would be used not so much to regulate the exercise of a power but to impose duties and to make their non-performance actionable in damages in a way in which neither legislature has seen fit to do. It is akin to a judicially imposed duty to legislate with the terms imposed by the courts. I do not see any basis for the creation of such a duty at common law. A duty of care for its citizens, which is the fundament of the pleading, cannot comprise a duty to provide a welfare state for the citizenry wherever in the world they may be.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Nor can a government, without legislation, take upon itself so large an obligation and assume a responsibility sounding in damages for its breach. The 1982 Agreement cannot be relied on as the basis for any alleged assumption of responsibility in any case, because it was declared to be without acceptance of liability and was entered into several years after the arrival of the Chagossians in Mauritius. It could not help those who went to the Seychelles any more than could the 1972 Agreement. This too was only with the Government of Mauritius, and it was not an agreement with the Chagossians. It too could not be a source for the assumption of responsibility. Responsibility for the removal of the impoverished and dependent Chagossians cannot create an assumption of responsibility for these purposes. There was no communication of responsibility to them for or on behalf of the Defendants, and none is pleaded. There were no acts done by the Chagossians in reliance upon anything which was said or done by the Defendants, and none are pleaded. If any were to be, the action thus based could only be brought by those individuals who satisfy those requirements. However, this claim is not so fine grained; quite deliberately, it is all-embracing. The questionnaire is incapable of refining the pleading.</span>

It is to be remembered that the case does not depend on any unlawfulness in the removals themselves. The claim assumes that the Commissioner could require the plantations to cease to operate, the islanders’ employment and support to cease and even the islands to be cleared. I can see no reason in principle why the same duty on the Defendants would not arise if the Chagossians had been removed by the decision of the Chagos Agalega Company Limited. If a duty arises from the relationship of citizenship, it is difficult to see the rationale for such a restriction; why should there not be a duty imposed on a landowner who ceases to have a requirement for his workers and requires them to leave his land? His duty would be to provide for them as if they were still his workers. I note in parenthesis that the medical treatment which the Claimants receive on Mauritius is what they would have received in Mauritius had they remained on Chagos, and the education on Chagos was very limited indeed. But the duty appears to require not a 1971 Chagos lifestyle nor a 1971 Mauritius lifestyle but one which changes as the circumstances around them change.</span>

There is no duty at common law to avoid even conditions of destitution for the citizen. This claim, in the guise of a negligence action, seeks to erect a duty to care and to create thereby a cause of action for circumstances in which neither misfeasance, statutory provision or constitutional right, or other recognised tort has provided.</span>

If it had been, it is difficult how a duty of so wide an ambit could be justiciable; it plainly would give rise to major policy issues as to the allocation of resources and the determination of an appropriate lifestyle in which someone was to be kept. It would involve an interaction with a foreign government; it is plain that there was concern in Mauritius about the impact which special treatment for the Ilois would have on Mauritians; the Seychelles Government was of the view that all were Seychellois and that no differentiation should be made between its citizens. The definition of a form of welfare state, with foreign policy overtones, is not a judicial function.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">, above. I do not think that at this stage it can be said that it is clear that personal injuries of that breadth were not reasonably foreseeable. The essential features of life for the islanders were well known: they were used only to a very dependant and simple existence, they had very limited education, work skills of no relevance in Mauritius, they were unused to coping with unemployment, or with seeking private or public housing or dealing routinely with cash, social security, officials or a modern way of life or Mauritian social attitudes towards them. Their dietary needs on Chagos were reasonably catered for and their housing was adequately provided with sanitation. Their roots were known to be in the Chagos. It is arguable that it was reasonably foreseeable, as evidenced by the resettlement agreement in 1972, the preparations for resettlement and the Prosser Report, that at least so far as those going to Mauritius were concerned, the inadequacies of the proposals for their reception, housing, transport of personal possessions, social assistance for immediate needs to obtain food, some training or education for the life ahead, would lead to serious psychological effects, recognisable psychiatric illnesses and the illnesses associated with malnutrition and insanitary housing conditions. This would apply not just to the limited category of those who were the last to leave Peros Banhos but arguably, to all those whom I have identified as arguably having been compelled to leave the Chagos through the sequence of decisions made by the Defendants which they then implemented over time. It could not cover their descendants. I would not draw a distinction between those who went to Mauritius and those who went to the Seychelles for these purposes. It would not cover those who were unable to return. The duty arose upon removal; it is not a continuing duty.</span>

Even those who went temporarily to Peros Banhos and Salomon were told that it would not be forever. There was an option of going to Agalega but it is arguable that the choice of another island so far away or Mauritius itself, or the Seychelles is not so obvious that to decline it makes for a voluntarily assumption of risk. There was no obvious means whereby the full extent of the information necessary for an informed choice to be made was provided to them. Accordingly, it is arguably not unreasonable for them to have chosen to go to Mauritius or to the Seychelles. It is arguable that that duty was breached. The material derives from the condition of the Chagossians some years after their arrival; after all they did not see any benefit from the 1972 agreement for several years during which inflation was rampant.</span>

The documentary material leading up to the evacuations shows an awareness of needs and of the difficulties which would be faced, but the Defendants arguably knew that the conclusion of the Agreement before the evacuation did not mean that anything would actually be done in practical terms by the time the islanders arrived. There is arguably no evidence that even any temporary arrangements for shelter, social security, money to tide them over and so on had been made, let alone anything which would give them a reasonable chance of avoiding personal injury. The evidence arguably shows that the Defendants knew that nothing was being done with the £650,000 as inflation ate away at its capability to achieve what was needed, and did nothing. It is arguable that the minimum requirement of a reasonable step is that it achieve something for the intended beneficiary rather than be merely an agreement with another for the discharge of the obligation, with no subsequent actions to ensure that it has been implemented. It is not necessary for me to identify the reasonable steps which should have been taken in the 1970s to avoid the personal injuries which were suffered.

It would arguably still leave a claim for delayed performance of the duty of care even if it were discharged in 1982. It was plainly not an unconscionable bargain as a matter of settling speculative litigation as I discuss later. But that is not conclusive as to whether it plainly discharged the duty to take reasonable steps. The problem with that argument is that on the necessary hypothesis that there was a duty of care to certain individuals, its discharge depends more upon individual circumstances than a general assessment of the needs of the Chagossians. It would be a significant hurdle in the way of any action but I do not consider that that Agreement can now be said to render unarguable any claim for damages for personal injury.</span>

The reasonable foreseeability of injury arises from it being reasonably foreseeable that, among those who were removed, there would be some who would so suffer, rather than from it being foreseeable that any particular individual would so suffer; the nature of the steps required would reflect that rather than being those required to prevent any identified individual suffering personal injury. Credit would have to be given for any sums received or facilities provided under the 1972 and 1982 Agreements, and allowance made for any facilities, treatment or funds made available by the Governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles.</span>

I appreciate the Defendants’ submission that permission should be refused because it came too late and after evidence had been heard, a point made more in the context of the limitation arguments. But I do not consider that these applications should succeed on remediable pleading points or through the exclusion of relevant material. I was singularly unimpressed by the refusal of the Claimants to respond to the Defendants’ request in February 2003 for information relating to the Amended Reply; the absence at that time for permission to amend was an inadequate basis for most of the information to be refused. But I do not regard that as a justification for refusing permission for the latest version to be served as the Amended Reply.</span>

The Chagossians had had only a hazy idea as to the effect of the 1982 Agreement and no idea at the time that they were being required to waive for all time any claims against the Defendants. The relative position of the parties mattered; the UK Government had abandoned any attempt to compromise claims in the legally binding ways which they knew and there was nothing wrong with the Chagossians taking advantage of their failure to do so. There was neither a contract of compromise nor a clear and unequivocal waiver of rights, either of which would have sufficed.</span>

But for all the difficulties in 1982 in achieving a global settlement for all the Ilois, as they then all seem to have wanted, he submitted that the only proper way to have proceeded was by individual advice and explanation for each Ilois and by developing the sort of practices which have only been seen much more recently in the settlement of group litigation, with dissentients trying to carry on as best they can or being barred. He recognised that this would have given rise to considerable practical difficulties over, say, conflicts of interest between groups of Ilois with different views, and their legal advisers; this could have led to very considerable delays in Chagossians, in their plight, receiving any money. But Mr Allen said that the UK Government ought to have learned from the speed with which it had attempted a settlement in 1979 and ought to have made sure that there were opportunities and time for alternative advice, with copies of the Agreement in Creole, or ought to have sought a parallel oral agreement.</span>

To my mind, it assists effective case management for those issues to be so identified, focusing the minds of the parties upon the factual issues which they need to address. The fact that an argument as to abuse may not ultimately succeed, because particular facts may justify its defeat, is no reason to refuse to identify what the Claimants need to show in fact for their action to succeed.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> case, while not disputing its authority.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">, in my judgment, is concerned with the construction or application of the terms of a seemingly all embracing release to a claim the nature or existence or basis of which was unknown to all parties; the general release could not cover such claims; objectively judged in that factual matrix, the words did not cover such a claim. It would have applied also if one party had not known of the possibility of a claim. This was subject of course to clearer and more precise wording than had been provided in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">But that is rather different from the position here: the claims precluded are all claims arising out of an identified series of acts and omissions. The claims upon which the Claimants now rely and which the Defendants contend are covered by the form, were all in existence in 1984 as a matter of law, apart from the alleged tort of exile. They all bear a close kinship, albeit expressed in different language, to the Vencatessen claims, which the renunciation forms would obviously have been addressing, together with any similar claims however expressed. Indeed, much of the factual material was known or capable of being ascertained, although I accept that the question of what the UK Government knew, compared to what it said, was not fully known until papers were released under the 30-year rule, but the fact that some material had been withheld was known.

It is less clear that it constitutes a renunciation of the right to return (as Mr Allen suggested) as opposed to the renunciation of a claim in respect of preclusion from returning or enforcement of the right to return, which right remained in existence (as Mr Howell suggested). Certainly, a claim in respect of preclusion is renounced; but so too (using the material words of the form) is any claim relating to:</span>

I see no force in Mr Allen’s question as to the duration of the renunciation of claims: it is indefinite. If Mauritius were to regain sovereignty or if the bases were to disappear (the lease has a maximum of 70 years from grant absent any renewal), the legal enforcement of any right to return would remain precluded; the claim could not be made. </span>

Whatever else was included, the consideration clearly covered the Rs 8,000; it covered the remaining distributions by the ITFB including the anticipated community facilities. There is, I accept, past consideration as well in the references to compensation and resettlement, the bulk of the individuals’ money having already been paid out. But that does not assist Mr Allen: this form of abuse may resemble the breach of a contract of compromise, but it is not the same as a breach. The real question is what was the basis upon which the ITFB paid over the Rs 8,000 and is that inconsistent with the claim now advanced?</span>

The basis for the ITFB payment was that the form had to be signed; that issue was in fact litigated and upheld. There is no issue about that. The issue is about whether they knew what they were signing and nonetheless want to sue the Defendants in these proceedings.</span>

It was absurd for the Ilois to seek to portray that case as a family case; the Ilois tended to be concentrated in a few places in Port Louis and word would travel fast. It had received considerable publicity, as a test case. All the negotiations in 1979, the subsequent correspondence, the legal advice showed the Ilois organisations to be well aware of the UK Government’s requirement that a settlement to be final, even though they would not renounce their rights to return. The Ilois themselves were using the litigation route as well as the political route and cannot have supposed that one case could settle leaving others to be commenced.</span>

They would need to explain the position to those whom they represented. There were plenty of people who could assist with the 1982 Agreement quite apart from the CIOF’s English lawyers.

It was inconceivable that anyone would try to keep the Ilois in the dark; there was no value in doing so, nor with the legal advisers, publicity and political interests any prospect of doing so. There was nothing in 1981 or 1982 to suggest that the Ilois could not distinguish between compensation claims which were settled and the right to return, or that they had any objection to settling compensation whilst leaving intact any right to return.</span>

It had been an issue in the run-up to the 1981 negotiations and again in 1982. It had become clear that there had to be some other solution if there were to be any agreements. It was envisaged and expressed in correspondence before the 1982 negotiations and again verbally at the 1982 negotiations that individual renunciations of that right would not be sought. The adverse reaction of the Ilois to suggestions of giving up that right had always been strong and genuine.

There was no reason for Mr Mundil to deceive them about his seeking compensation on that basis, or to keep them in the dark. Eddy Ramdass could read a little English. There were plenty of helpers. It would have reflected the UK Government’s unvarying position, which it always sought to make clear, to everyone. I found their accounts of how the 1981 and 1982 negotiations proceeded to be untruthful and wholly unreliable. I do not believe that the Chagossian delegates were kept in the dark by anyone – it was not in anyone’s interests for the Agreement to founder or to be torn up when its contents were made public. Nor do I believe that they did not ask what was going on or felt inhibited from doing so. They had felt no inhibitions in 1979. Their personal activities were demonstrations, allegations, protests, hunger strikes, organising committees, seeking publicity and political support.</span>

I am sure that that point was communicated to the Ilois delegates, even through translation, and was understood by them. It is not a difficult point. I find it very hard to believe that that broad position was not also obvious to the Ilois generally as a result of the mass meetings, press publicity, and discussions among themselves. The general air of congratulations and gratitude all round on this result after so long cannot have left an impression that more could be asked for. The means by which that was to be achieved, which included the individual renunciation form and the withholding of £250,000 was explained to the Ilois delegates by the English lawyers.

I am sure they would have noticed it and specifically referred to it, if it had been new. Sheridans also advised the JIC on the Agreement specifically referring to the renunciation forms.

The first tranche of payments of Rs 10,000 was made in December 1982, paid out at the central Post Office – no renunciation forms were required. The second, land purchase related, tranche was paid by June 1983 – no renunciation forms were required. The third tranche, where the forms were signed, proceeded without any radio or press announcement that renunciation forms were required. There is nothing in the fact that a Ministry Office was chosen as the venue for the distribution to alert anyone to a different process. True it is that the forms do not look like receipts – they are too long and there are no figures such as might have become familiar from handling money, wages in the Chagos "</span>

All of that subsequent absence of reaction suggests strongly that the leaders at least knew that they had signed forms which put an end to compensation claims and assumed that the Chagossians generally knew it, because they had all understood that back in 1982. It also points strongly to their evidence that it was thought just to be a receipt being untrue.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">At this stage, however, notwithstanding the way in which the evidence points and the compelling analysis by Mr Howell, I cannot conclude that it is plain that the Chagossians in general knew that the document was more than a receipt. It is possible that they could show that that is what they thought. My reluctance derives from the lack of public notification some sixteen months after the 1982 Agreement that it was on the third and smallest tranche that these forms were to be signed. The Chagossians were poor and so in need of the money, illiterate and no explanation was offered of a written document in another language. They generally knew, I am satisfied, that the Agreement was final and contained some mechanism to give effect to that end; but that is not to say that when they signed these forms, they knew what they were signing was more than a receipt and was that mechanism in the form of promise to abandon all claims, financial or otherwise. The distinction between a general awareness of a broad position and the knowledge of the particular document being signed at a particular time is one which I consider it necessary to draw.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I do not consider that the Chagossians generally have no reasonable prospects of showing that they took reasonable care in the circumstances. The first relevant circumstance is their knowledge of the potential legal significance of the document: they had not been alerted to its having any significance beyond that of a receipt by past events or current warning. On that assumption, there was no reason to ask. As I have discussed, I do not consider that the size of the document and the absence of figures is, at this stage, a compelling counter factor. Second, there was only limited evidence that there was anyone to ask – no-one had any translating, explanatory or advisory function. Mr Abdullatif may have been there, but that is not the same as his having an explicit function. They generally were illiterate, simple and trusting and English was not their language. I have already dealt with the role of Mrs Kattick and Mr Ramdass.</span>

It appears that people came in one at a time, approached a grille, took the money and signed the document: no signature, no money. Fourth, although a handful could read and some did object and it might have been possible to return having taken advice, there was an emphasis on achieving a timetabled distribution. Fifth, the Ilois were desperate for money; that would have reduced their opportunity for calm deliberation.</span>

There is force in Mr Allen’s more general submission about the role of justice in abuse proceedings. I do not consider that it would be just for the individual Claimant to be precluded from showing individually what they knew or did not know.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">My strong impression was that the translation of the forms in court, which would have meant little enough as Creole legalese, caused the witnesses all to focus on the renunciation of the claims to return to Chagos. They denied knowledge of the form in consequence and were unable or unwilling thereafter to distinguish compensation from other claims. But that by itself is not enough to exclude all those witnesses. I am quite satisfied that any Claimant who was a member of the 1982 delegation or who served on the ITFB in 1983 and signed the forms is in a different position. First, the former knew of the requirement for individual forms as part of the mechanism for giving effect to the finality of the 1982 Agreement. The latter, if they did not know it before, would have known it through the ITFB discussions. They all would have appreciated that the document being signed in September 1983 was that form. The gap between agreement in April 1982 and the signing of the forms in September 1983, and the absence of forms for the first two tranches, would have been of much less significance for someone who knew what the mechanisms were.</span>

I say that despite the fact that it includes a renunciation of claims to return to Chagos which they may not have known of and would have resisted, had they known. The document is still a renunciation form; it deals with BIOT related claims and ends their ability to sue. The inclusion of an unknown but important provision does not make it radically different for these purposes.</span>

I am satisfied that he knew that the forms were part of the mechanism for preventing any further claims being brought, although he too may not have known what it contained about claims to return to Chagos. Even if he thought that it was a restriction on bringing claims for five years, which I doubt, he knew the essence of the form, that it prevented claims.

The UK Government, submitted Mr Allen, had not merely known of the disabilities of the Chagossians, it had been responsible for them being in that state in Mauritius. They were a weak and vulnerable population engaged in adversarial negotiation with the very Government which should have been taking responsibility for them. They had been kept in the dark for years about the actions of the Government and it was only recently that its deceits had come to light.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The legal advice was inadequate. First, the lawyers were unaware of all that was to come out about those deceits and accordingly did not give advice with full knowledge of the relevant facts. Second, it was not clear how representative was any group which had instructed lawyers, whether the CIOF or Mr Ramdass’ group. Nor could anyone know how far or how accurately any such advice had been disseminated; their structures and memberships were as far from clear as were their means of communicating with their members or the Chagossians generally. The Treasury Solicitor had been aware in 1979 of what was required for any settlement to be effective but those safeguards had been abandoned in 1983. As Mr Allen acknowledged, the scale of the task of getting everyone to agree or dealing with those who wanted more than others from an overall pot or who did not want to sign the forms at all would have been a huge task and could have involved many different lawyers as conflicts of interests arose. The lawyers in 1982 had neither the time nor the money to undertake the necessary work. The Claimants themselves were unfamiliar with lawyers and legal ways.</span>

It did not conduct the negotiations in 1982 in Creole or provide for adequate translations into Creole by those whom the Claimants could trust. It did not attempt to communicate the outcome of the negotiations to all the Chagossians. The requirement for the forms came into the Agreement late and despite Sir Leonard Allinson saying that individual renunciations of the right to return would not be required. There was evidence, (19/B/8), that the UK side was trying to keep that quiet because questions about how it was to be implemented were said to be best left until the agreement was signed. They were printed in English without any translation or explanation being available. The fact that they were in English was part of a deliberate attempt to prevent the Chagossians understanding what the forms were. There was no forewarning that they were to be required in return for the smallest tranche of money some sixteen months after the Agreement had been reached. The sum paid was of the order of £2,500 for each Chagossian and the Rs 8,000 represented only £400.</span>

The 1982 agreement was intended to be the solution to the problems faced by the Ilois and to their claims. It was intended to be final and to contain mechanisms to make that effective. This was understood by the Ilois, by their representatives and their lawyers with the latter at least understanding more of the detail as to how that was to happen. The lawyers had all realised that, whoever precisely their clients may have been, they were in effect advising the Ilois generally. In 1979, Mr Sheridan had been advised by Mr Blom-Cooper QC that £1.25m was a fair settlement. In 1982, Sheridans had advised that the Vencatessen case be withdrawn and had not suggested that the settlement was unfair; Mr Glasser confirmed in evidence that they had thought that it was fair. Mr Grosz and Mr Macdonald had both concluded that it was fair and should be accepted.</span>

That figure had been sought for distribution among 900 families and although the UK Government was not concerned to define how the money was to be distributed, it did its calculations on the basis that there were at most only 426 families to be compensated. It was the ITFB which decided who was to receive the money and widened the range of participants from those accepted as entitled to compensation by the UK Government, but not so extensively as to cover 900 families; it was the ITFB also which decided that the money was to be distributed on a per capita basis without reference to any difference in needs or losses which might have been experienced. There was no complaint from the Ilois about those decisions. Mr Beal, for the Defendants, produced a valuable table of the Ilois populations surveyed on the islands, (so it would not include those Ilois who were unable to return from Mauritius), which showed 680 Ilois individuals in total on the three island groups in July 1970.</span>

That sum of £5m would be worth today about £10.5m. At the 1982 exchange rate of Rs 19: £1, Rs 111,000 was about £5,000.</span>

The Ilois had legal advice to the UK Government’s knowledge and the arrangements for translation were a matter for the Mauritius Government. There was no evidence that the Ilois delegation was kept in the dark or that matters were concealed from them by the UK delegation. The inclusion of the requirement for individually signed forms during the 1982 negotiations was not done covertly nor did it hold up the payment of money to the ITFB nor did it hold up the bulk of the payments. There was no point in reaching an agreement which the Ilois were not prepared to sign up to. The terms of the agreement were the subject of a press communiqué. If there were failures on the part of the Ilois or their lawyers to keep up with or to explain what was happening, those were not matters for which the UK Government was to blame, let alone morally culpable.</span>

It is also clear that they have reasonable prospects of showing that the UK Government was fully alive to their problems. I consider that they may be able to show that as the forms were sought by the UK Government, indeed pressed for, to serve its interests under the agreement and that in collecting them the Mauritius Government was acting as its agent, the UK Government should be treated as being on constructive notice as to the manner in which they were collected. The High Commissioner was in a position to observe or to inquire, had he so wished but he did nothing so far as the evidence before me goes. There is scope for arguing that the manner in which the signatures were obtained involved the exploitation of those weaknesses in a morally culpable manner. They were asked to sign a legal form without explanation at the time as to its purpose or content by those who knew of their weakness. I was wholly unpersuaded that there was any sound evidence that there had been any attempt to prevent them understanding what was in the form, it is rather that no positive attempt to inform them was made at the time. There is no justification for saying that there was any trickery. The signing of the forms was to the UK Government, to the Mauritius Government and to the ITFB the working out of what had been agreed in 1982 with the knowledge and consent of the Ilois. I do not think that it adds to the Claimants’ case that the UK Government was, on any view, responsible for at least many of the signatories being in Mauritius.</span>

I accept the broad thrust though not necessarily all the detail of the arguments of Mr Howell on this matter, which I have set out above. The matter does have to be looked at in the context of the 1982 agreement which I am quite clear was understood by the Ilois in general to be a final agreement. It was generally known that that was an enduring requirement of the UK Government, if it were to pay over any more money. That had been accepted in correspondence, at least to the eyes of any reader, by the Ilois representatives. I have said elsewhere that I do not accept as remotely true that they did not know what was being said in that correspondence and would not have agreed to that point had they known; that would simply have ended negotiations straightaway and the litigation would have followed its course.</span>

Although it may not have known about the subsequent legal advice, the fact that it was sought and no complaint was raised about the terms of the agreement, supports the conclusion that all that had been done properly. It also makes it more difficult for it to be said that the transaction envisaged, but to which no objection was taken, was oppressive. I do not accept that there was anything covert about the insertion of Article 4. It was not a secret protocol, it was discussed with the Ilois’ lawyers and they advised on it. The agreement and all its terms were publicised. The UK government had no reason to suppose that the Ilois representatives were not representative or unable effectively to communicate with the Ilois.

There is no evidence that any part was seen as oppressive or obtained by unfair tactics or the exploitation of the weaknesses of the Ilois. They had not merely had legal advice but political assistance from people whose interests however selfishly coincided with theirs at that time. Whether measured against what the Ilois asked for in December 1981 or against some other measure, the sum in total could not remotely be described as evidencing an oppressive transaction. The Ilois were being asked to give up what all the lawyers knew was a speculative piece of litigation which might in due course provide some with an unknown amount of money in return for something now to relieve their poverty. </span>

As I have said, it was not the concern of the Ilois at any stage to divide up the sum according to some assessment of individual losses or needs. The sort of process which he envisaged would have entailed each individual being advised as to the amount which he might receive if the litigation succeeded, discounting that by the prospects of success, reaching some agreement with his fellow Claimants as to how the sum was to be shared and meanwhile receiving nothing whilst lawyers got themselves utterly enmeshed in conflicts of interests between clients who disagreed on how to split the global sum and who should benefit. The sophistications of settling group actions would have had to be invented and given effect to among people who were admittedly not familiar with legal concepts. Alternatively, the matter would have been fought to an individual conclusion in a series of test cases. If any such process had been instituted in 1982 or 1983, holding up the payment either of the £4m or the payment of the Rs 8,000 for what, so far as I could tell from the way in which Mr Allen explained how it all ought to have been done, would have been a very long time, the lawyers would have had a very hard time of it from the Ilois people themselves who really needed the money. They would have been extremely cynical of the way in which the only beneficiaries of the proposed settlement would have been the lawyers. No one suggested this farandole in 1982 or 1983 as the way in which these matters should be done. His submission was a counsel of perfection, utterly remote from the real world of the Ilois’ needs in 1983. The fact that it was not done does not remotely show the oppressiveness of the transaction. Neither Bindmans nor Sheridans were said to have been negligent at any stage yet they were responsible for advising Ilois about the wisdom and mechanics of the settlement. Bindmans thought that they were advising the Ilois generally through the CIOF and saw nothing wrong at any stage with the negotiations, the content of the Agreement, or the mechanics as described in the Agreement for procuring Ilois assent, generally or individually.</span>

If an individual Ilois had calculated that instead of taking Rs 8,000, he would be better suing for damages, he could have done so. But it is impossible to believe that anyone would have advised him to do so; he would have been told that the form was just what the agreement envisaged, that there would no more money without litigation for years and I do not see on what basis there would have been any legal aid for such a case. It would not have been privately funded. There is no evidence that in 1983 any lawyer would have offered such advice or that any Ilois would have heeded it. Indeed there is evidence, from the concern over the few non-signers after September 1983 needed to procure the unblocking of the £0.25m, that there would have been intense pressure placed upon those Ilois to sign, with the CRG and Mrs Alexis to the fore.</span>

I do not accept the picture painted by some of the Chagossian witnesses of the way in which there was no communication between them; it is wholly at odds with the evidence of meetings, protests, organisations, relationships and their concentration within a few parts of Port Louis. It is conceivable that there might have been collective advice in September 1983 not to sign the forms, to forego the Rs 8,000 and the blocked money in return for the right to continue litigating but that speculative possibility, which the evidence suggests would have been turned down flat, does not remotely show that the transaction was oppressive.</span>

The lawyers all knew that the UK Government was resisting the disclosure of some documents and that the potential for argument about discovery had not been exhausted.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I now turn to the second basis upon which Mr Allen said that the forms were unconscionable. As the Government responsible for the Ilois, it could not reach an agreement with them to wash its hands of responsibility for them or to remove their fundamental rights. This point goes to the content of the renunciation forms rather than to the manner in which they were signed. As I understood it, no matter how much advice had been given, the removal of those rights was not open to a government to accomplish. I was not clear as to the source or scope of this inhibition on the ability of two parties to litigation or potential litigation to settle their differences, nor as to whether a judgement in favour of the Government in the Vencatessen litigation would have suffered from the same disability.</span>

I disagree. It is not so very different a point from others which Mr Allen raised; it is rather a new garb for some well-known complaints about the Defendants’ conduct over the years. I could not see how more cross-examination would have advanced Mr Howell’s case whereas I could see every advantage in strike out proceedings for allowing pleadings to raise the full case which either party wished to raise.</span>

There is a significant difference between saying that a claim for compensation, made after a final settlement has been reached, is an abuse and saying that an application for Judicial Review to determine the validity of legislation in force is an abuse of process. The fact that such a point was not taken, so as to prevent or delay that application, is not a reason why it should not be deployed in this subsequent but related action. It is an argument mirrored by the Defendants’ now abandoned arguments about what should have been dealt with in those or other Judicial Review proceedings.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">".

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Allen's next and related point was no more arguable. It was to the effect that the Court could suspend the effect of the Act where it would be unconscionable to allow the Defendants to rely upon it. He referred to the sort of wrongs which he regarded as the starting point for, though not the content of, his misfeasance claim. He added that there had been no legal system in BIOT to which the Claimants had had access and no legal aid system either. Even if all his facts were incontrovertible, he demonstrated no basis upon which a court could decide that a statute could be removed from the arena to which its language made it apply, simply because a court thought that it would be unconscionable to allow a party to rely upon the rights which Parliament had given him. The 1980 Act is quite explicit in prohibiting the bringing of a cause of action after the relevant time limit, and has made varied and explicit provision for the circumstances in which time should not run against a Claimant or should be extended. That represents the Parliamentary view of where it would be wrong to allow a Defendant to take advantage of the passage of time and marks the balancing of the interests of finality in litigation and fairness to a Claimant.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I do not consider that Mr Allen can be right in seeking to say that the 1984 Act permits the English law on limitation to be disapplied. It is the foreign law on limitation, which, if otherwise applicable, can be disapplied for reasons of public policy including hardship. Section 1 disapplies English law subject to exceptions set out in both subsection (2) and in section 2(1). The existence of the circumstances relied on by the Claimants are irrelevant unless they show that the foreign law is to be disapplied, but they have been relied on to precisely the opposite effect by the Claimants. The language of the 1984 Act might be thought a trifle muddled in section 2, as to what parts of section 1 are to be disapplied but a little thought makes it tolerably clear. Evans J held in </span>

That assessment involves a comparison of the relevant competing laws on limitation. Besides, it is obvious that Parliament did not consider that the English laws on limitation were contrary to its public policy or created hardship, or did only so when compared to foreign law.</span>

That is because it is not for the Courts to hold that the balance contained within the 1980 Act is contrary to public policy, including the creation of undue hardship. Mr Allen also has some difficulty in showing that any tort upon which he relies falls outside the scope of section 1(2), though if he were to have a direct action upon the content of the Mauritius Constitution, it might be one within the scope of section 1 of the 1984 Act. I note that Mr Allen only relies upon the law of BIOT although it is far from clear that the negligence claim would not fall to be governed by Mauritius and English law.</span>

I accept Mr Howell's submission that section 3 of the Courts Ordinance deals with substantive law and that it is sections 13 and 14 which are relevant here because it deals with procedural laws, of which limitation forms part. There may be exceptions to that general rule, where a right is barred and not just a remedy, but Mr. Allen did not take issue with it. As the practice and procedure is to be in substantial conformity with English law, there is no reason to disapply the relevant statutory provisions and no case was put forward under this section that they should be disallowed. Even if section 3 were the relevant section, there is nothing in the local circumstances which warrants an adaptation. No adaptation was specified; what was sought was a wholesale disallowing of the periods of limitation for a particular group of claimants who do not live in BIOT, and have not done so for almost the whole of the period in question, and where few of the acts relied on as constituting the various torts were done. This is misconceived; the process of adaptation is not one which varies according to the needs of various claimants, which is what they argue, but is something which would be good for all as a result of local conditions. It would be odd indeed if the English law on limitation were thought incapable of dealing with disability, access to lawyers, and the fact that someone has been disadvantaged in the pursuit of a claim by the very acts in respect of which he seeks to sue. There is nothing in this argument of Mr Allen’s.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The fourth argument is that there are continuing torts in respect of which, as I understand the argument, it is said, not that time is not barred in relation to anything which has continued to be done in the period of limitation, but that no limitation period has started yet to run. Presumably the argument is that until the tort has stopped, any damage can be sued for irrespective of when it was done and that remains the position for so long as the tort goes on. This was asserted to be the law. No reasons were given. I do not find this easy to follow. Limitation periods are expressed to run from when the cause of action accrued. If it has not started to run, that would mean that the cause of action had not yet accrued. The claim should be struck out on that ground. I assume that the Claimants do not seek that. If the tort continues, it means that a fresh cause of action accrues daily or with each fresh damage. So, the continuing tort of exile, if it existed, would not be time barred in relation to the period of six years preceding the commencement of this action; but that is all. Deceit was alleged to be a continuing tort, but that is clearly wrong. No fresh act of deceit or further damage is alleged in the six years preceding the commencement of the action. The continuing duty of care towards citizens is said to be a duty which continues to be breached. If it existed in the form claimed, the breach would be continuing in the six years preceding the commencement of the action. Those are the only two claims which would be affected by this argument in isolation.</span>

No Claimant under such a disability at the date when any cause of action accrued has been identified, though that is not to say that there are none, nor has the ending of any such period of disability been identified. In reality, there is only one arguable claim in tort, for negligence giving rise to personal injuries. It is difficult to see how even for an infant in 1973, the period of disability did not expire many years before this action was brought and indeed before 1998.</span>

Mr Allen said that the redactions showed that the UK Government had misled the UN about a permanent population, had taken decisions about clearance at the behest of the US, which were based on the geographical ignorance of the US as to the distance of Peros Banhos and Salomon from Diego Garcia and on an unformulated, distant and unspecified defence need, and had decided on a compensation/resettlement figure which had not been calculated by reference to individual or community needs. Those redactions related to all the causes of action. Essentially the same points emerged from the documents for which public interest immunity had been claimed in the Vencatessen litigation; added points were the different treatment of Ilois in the Seychelles, immigration control if the Ilois had no right to permanent residence and the deliberate policy, for a while, of not mentioning that the Ilois had British citizenship.</span>

Second was the absolute power of the Defendants over them, ignoring their rights, refusing any economic development in the Chagos, following the dictates of the US, unnecessarily allowing the closure of the plantations, not consulting the Chagossians and saying nothing about them to the UN. Third was the behaviour of the Defendants after the clearances: denying their British citizenship, refusing to look after them, paying to the Mauritius Government a sum which the UK Government knew to be inadequate, failing to ensure that it was properly spent, paying nothing for the Seychelles Chagossians, concealing the existence of a permanent population, setting up a scheme in 1982 which required its citizens to renounce their rights without ensuring their access to the BIOT Courts or legal aid, and denying their responsibility in preventing return to the islands or for evacuating them (as the Defendants still did).</span>

The first and principal act of deliberate concealment relied on by the Claimants is the claim for privilege and other related non-disclosures in the Vencatessen litigation. I should point out that the Claimants, when tested, disclaimed any allegation that there was any impropriety at all by anyone in the conduct of the Vencatessen litigation or in the processes of discovery: it was not said that privilege had been wrongly let alone dishonestly claimed. In any event, Mr Vencatessen, on the advice of Sheridans and leading counsel and on the accepted facts, voluntarily accepted a settlement rather than pursue the chances of success in a contested action, after the lawyers debated whether further discovery should be sought in court, in which Mr Vencatessen might or might not have been successful. Accordingly, the Claimants’ contention that the untested but honest and legitimate non-disclosure of documents in the Vencatessen action was an act of deliberate concealment from all the current Claimants, rests entirely upon the assertion, which I accept as correct for current purposes, that the discovery decisions were conscious, and in that sense deliberate, decisions of the Defendants, which involved the withholding of material, and were in that sense alone acts of concealment.</span>

It requires active concealment, or withholding information which is actively sought, or withholding it when there is some other circumstance which imposes a duty to disclose it. It is possible only to conceal deliberately that which a person knows, not that which he ought to have known. It requires a deliberate breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time and which is then actively concealed or not disclosed when there was an obligation to disclose.</span>

Implicit in their approach must be the contention that what had been withheld from Mr Vencatessen had been withheld from them all, and conversely that, if material had been disclosed to him, that would have precluded an assertion of deliberate concealment from any of them. Yet, the Claimants have been at pains to assert that the Vencatessen litigation was not in reality representative litigation, settled in 1982 along with the individual Vencatessen case. But unless they do accept that, which creates other significant hurdles for them, it is nigh on impossible to see how non-disclosure to Mr Vencatessen can be an act of deliberate concealment so far as they are concerned; it would be in reality simply an irrelevance and the acts of deliberate concealment would have to be sought elsewhere. </span>

But it is difficult to see how it could go to what could be discovered with reasonable diligence, if disclosure in the Vencatessen litigation was or would have been disclosure to all. And if it was not or would not have been such disclosure, how can the non-disclosure be other than confined to Mr Vencatessen himself?</span>

Otherwise, these pleadings treat them all alike. It is not arguable that the burden of proof rests on the Defendants.

It also shows that the Chagossians themselves actually knew of the position throughout eg Mr Vencatessen’s case asserted it; lawyers such as Mr Duval knew of it. The publicity given to the breakdown of negotiations referred to it. All the lawyers advising in 1981 and 1982 knew of it; Mr Macdonald so advised the CIOF representatives in July 1981. Mrs Alexis’ son, Mr Cherry, brought what was described as a test case in Mauritius, receiving widespread publicity in 1985 which confirmed their status. The CRG wrote many letters asserting their rights as UK citizens; Mr Bancoult’s complaint was that he was not being given the fullness of the rights to which he thought he was entitled as a UK citizen. Bindmans advised on it again in the 1990s. All anyone who wished to know the position had to do was ask the UK Government or keep his eyes and ears open to events over the 1980s and 1990s, or ask any of the many lawyers who had been involved. Any Claimant could have discovered the position, if he did not already know it, at any time and well before 1998.

No-one asked either Defendant what it knew the position to be. It would be a basic act of diligence, reasonably to be undertaken, for someone to inquire what the Defendants thought about what to the Claimants was an important assertion. It is not an answer to say that the UK Government was pretending that there was no permanent population: the Newton report was disclosed in the Vencatessen case, and it shows a permanent population however much debate there may be over the numbers it shows.

Their evidence was that Rogers &amp; Co told them that the islands had been sold. Even if it were believed by some that Mauritius was behind it, or even Moulinie &amp; Co at the time when they were unable to return, it is impossible to accept that any of the relevant Claimants have any prospect of establishing that they did not realise that fact, if such it be, a very long while ago, no later than the 1981 or 1982 negotiations or that they could not have discovered it by then with reasonable diligence. No evidence was given to me to suggest that those who could not return thought that the Defendants were not involved, until 1998 or thereabouts eg Mrs Elyse or Mr Bancoult, Mrs Jaffar. Mrs Jeanette Alexis, who was an evacuee and not in the same category as those prevented from returning, said she did not realise that the Defendants were involved till recently in the evacuations. It is a surprising view for her to have had, but she struck me as generally an honest witness. But even so, given the visits of Mrs Charlesia Alexis to the Seychelles in 1980, who stayed with the family, the discussions about compensation and claims which must have taken place, the visits of other politicians such as Mr Berenger and Mr Michel, it is inconceivable that reasonable diligence eg a simple question to Mrs Charlesia Alexis or any Mauritian group, would not have put her right many, many years ago.

The difficulty is the facts. Mr Ramdass’ group was able indirectly through a Mauritian lawyer-politician to contact Sheridans to bring the Vencatessen case in 1975. Other committees which became the JIC pursued it; they all knew of its relevance for the negotiations, and Agreement. The litigant, and the supporting committees, plainly had access to lawyers notwithstanding all those disadvantages. What that group did, others could have done, if they had not all seen the Vencatessen case as an action leading to a global settlement from which they would all benefit. Others could have contacted Sheridans in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and at any time subsequently. Sheridans’ costs were in part paid by the legal aid fund and, for the Ilois community, by the Treasury Solicitor and the Mauritius Government.

To the extent that it was not sought, that undermines the view that the Chagossians genuinely, and however improbably, thought that the 1982 Agreement and the withdrawal of the Vencatessen case was not the end.

The real problems with the pleadings should be dealt with on their merits which I have yet to come to. The assertion that almost all Claimants, as opposed to all Claimants, may be imprecise but the essence of the contention is clear enough. If the real issue was one of form, I would remedy the pleadings by staying the action, requiring the completion of a new questionnaire by all Claimants, which was directed to answering the more specific and detailed questions, to be approved by the Court, relevant to the issues which are now raised and identifying which issues related to which named Claimant. This would be necessary for many aspects of the pleaded claims.</span>

I accept that not all the others would have been well placed to offer direct advice on the complex issues in the case.

Mr Ollivray and Mr Bhayat were at the 1982 negotiations. Mr Lassemillante may have been more noisy than effective, as Mr Bancoult in effect described him, (and he would not be the first advocate of whom that could be said), but that is not the point.

It was accepted by the pleading that, for the purposes of sections 11 and 14, all of the Claimants who made a claim in respect of personal injuries knew of the statutorily relevant facts before the start of the three year period ending with the issue of these proceedings. No specific date or dates for such knowledge is pleaded, but reliance is placed for the purposes of section 33 on the disclosure of information in the </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> proceedings. It is indisputable but that the causes of action accrued many years ago. So the key issue is whether or not there is any reasonable prospect of time being extended under section 33. I use the expression "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">", not solely because that is how the question was formulated, but also because although I recognise that, in principle, a decision on the application of section 33 can be made before trial, it may also be appropriate for that decision to await trial in certain circumstances, unless the answer to its application is already clear.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" are restored. I have already dealt with the unarguability of the general claim in negligence. If there is a continuing breach of duty leading to personal injuries in respect of those compelled to leave the Chagos by the sequence of decisions for which the Defendants were responsible, no individual has been identified nor his related circumstances so as to sustain such a case, and I do not see how it can be said that there is a continuing duty to them anyway, of the limited nature which I regard arguably as existing.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">"; this suggests a very limited role for cross-examination and oral evidence from the Defendants. I consider that appraisal to be correct and such recollection as any witnesses had, would be almost wholly dependant on those documents, and even those documents could well fail to enable events accurately to be recalled; this was the nature of the evidence of Mr Sheridan, Mr Glasser, Mr Grosz and, to some extent, Mr Moulinie. But this assertion contradicts the Claimants’ stance in relation to the continuance of the misfeasance proceedings, which posited that much of value could emerge from cross-examination of the Defendants’ witnesses, whoever they might be. The evidence of what happened to the Chagossian community was said to be "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">still plain for all to see</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". But, to my mind, that can relate to current circumstances only; it cannot deal with the sequence of events or with causation, or the position in 1973, 1982-3, 1990 or at any other time. The pleading, so far as individual Claimants were concerned, was merely that what happened to individuals would be a matter of evidence in due course. As an attempt to deal with section 33(3), it provides nothing of value, and its very paucity suggests that there is little more to be said about the obvious difficulties which the Claimants face.</span>

But I propose to deal with these pleaded claims on their substantive merits, or lack of them. There is an interaction however; the vagueness and opacity of the pleadings, their rather uncertain approach to facts which ought to be set within a properly understood legal framework has resulted to an extent from or permitted the substantive problems to be overlooked, not wrestled with and thought through.

But it is to be emphasised that it is only the material relevant to the requirements of sections 11, 14 and 33 which matters; ie non-disclosure, say, is only relevant to the extent that it bites upon the claim for personal injuries.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I now turn to the specific factors set out in of section 33(3) of the 1980 Act. First, the reasons for delay. In my judgment, the affected Claimants were in a position to bring proceedings for damages for personal injury when the asserted personal injury manifested itself in a significant way. These injuries, principally ill-health of one form or another, are relevant because they were supposedly unusual in Chagos. The conditions which led to them were evident; the change was evident. Even if a period is allowed for the realisation of what was happening, the establishment of trends, and the time taken for problems to manifest themselves, the first cases should have been started by the time of the 1982 Agreement. The Prosser Report, the slowness of resettlement, the submissions to the negotiations in 1981 and the experiences and claims of the Chagossians gave them the relevant knowledge. It is difficult to imagine any whose claims manifested themselves later than 1990, but again no such date with supporting justification are put forward in respect of any Claimant.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Their argument appears to be that relevant facts were not disclosed. This is wrong. The Claimants knew of their injury, the change of conditions, who was responsible for that change, and that, save for the 1972 and 1982 Agreements, nothing had been done for them. They knew of the availability or lack of health care and what those who provided them with health care thought about the impact on their well-being of the change of circumstances in which they lived. If they did not, it was in any event an obvious question to ask. They could reasonably have been expected to inquire of medical experts and of lawyers as to their position. The section provides that it is irrelevant whether the Claimants knew that the acts or omissions of the Defendants amounted to negligence or a breach of duty of care.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">So, I conclude that the period of delay is between just under thirty years and a lesser period, unlikely to be less than ten years but varying from Claimant to Claimant, and in respect of which the Claimants have provided far too little material to sustain any argument that the delay is not of a very substantial scale, given the obvious starting point.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The Claimants’ reasons for any delay appear to be the Defendants’ conduct in putting them in Mauritius and the Seychelles in the first place without proper provision, denying responsibility for them and not providing information. But these are inadequate reasons. The very existence of the cause of action is that they were displaced there without provision or adequate provision. They knew that all along. It is difficult to see what denial of responsibility or of information occurred which was relevant to this cause of action, or to delay.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Second, the reduction in the cogency of the Defendants’ and Claimants’ evidence by reference to the delay. I regard the Claimants’ assertions as to the Defendants’ evidence insofar as they relate to the personal injuries claim as wholly inadequate to justify any extension. The Defendants’ evidence in relation to any duty of care or its breach may very well be confined to the written material in practice. But there are issues as to whether any Claimant suffered in fact the alleged personal injury eg was Claimant A depressed, did he or she suffer from stomach or respiratory disorders? The evidence of the Claimants was sufficiently unreliable to suggest that that itself would be a major issue. Yet how could that now be tested for a period of perhaps thirty years? Some of that may be a diagnosis unsupported by any medical evidence; if it is, there has been no disclosure of even one contemporaneous medical report to illustrate the point, nor of any hospital records. The Defendants’ prospects of evidence challenging factual assertions as to past ill-health are obviously significantly and adversely affected. </span>

In view of the absence of sound illustration as to the nature of even one individual’s case, how it might be supported by expert evidence, medical history and personal testimony, it is difficult to see how any evidence in response from the Defendants could be other than immensely reduced in cogency. They do not have the opportunity to test any history with anything approaching contemporaneity. Whatever wrongs the Defendants did in the past, they could not now fairly defend themselves on that score.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The evidence which the Claimants themselves called was to my mind the clearest proof of why the cogency of the evidence of both Claimants and Defendants would be seriously adversely affected. The evidence as to what happened to individuals in terms of accommodation and social security was usually self-contradictory and incomplete; what they did with the money which they received was at times problematic. The general picture must yield for these purposes to the specific details provided by individuals to what happened to them. Evidence as to the availability and use made of medical care was unreliable and incomplete. Evidence about when individuals became ill, and what form that illness took was likewise unreliable eg Mrs Elyse’s and Mr Bancoult’s evidence about his father’s condition. It was of a piece with a general lack of reliability over the detail of the Claimants’ evidence and yet the detailed reliability of each individual’s evidence matters here. There was no evidence suggesting that what they had to say on an individual basis could be reinforced by medical records, and to what degree.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Section 33(3)(c) deals with the conduct of the Defendant. I have already dealt with this in part in relation to the reasons for delay. The relevant conduct is that which relates to the negligence claim for damages in personal injuries, rather than the other claims. Such acts as were identified do not relate to delay or concealment or any other act relating to whether it was equitable for this claim to proceed. Certainly, no request for information and no refusal by the Defendants to supply requested information was identified for the purposes of this particular claim. General references to non-disclosure in the Vencatessen litigation and to a failure to provide unspecified information, which it was never said had been requested anyway, simply do not begin to grapple with the statutory provisions which the Claimants seek to invoke. The problems with reliance on non-disclosure in the Vencatessen litigation have been dealt with already; the Claimants face both ways on its significance for this case: what was disclosed to one, was not disclosed to all, yet what was not disclosed to one, was concealed from all. That litigation did not fully test discovery because it was settled. No fact, relevant to this cause of action, has been said, or plausibly said, to have been deliberately concealed. The Claimants may not have been aware of what transpired between the UK and Mauritius Governments in 1972 and onwards, or of the advice which the former received about the poor prospects of the pig breeding scheme, but this cannot advance their case. As Mr Howell pointed out, this shows that no assumption of responsibility, had been communicated to the Claimants, which is the opposite of what they wish to prove. In any event, the relevant agreements and the slowness of payment under the 1972 Agreement was a matter of contemporaneous public knowledge or ready ascertainment. The condition of the Chagossians and their health was known to them; they knew of the involvement of the Defendants in their removal. There were no equivalent agreements with the Seychelles but I do not think it plausible that the Seychelles Chagossians did not know or could not readily have found out, quite simply, about the Defendants’ involvement.</span>

But it is plain that the generality of Claimants knew of their uprooting, that that had been caused by the Defendants’ actions and had led to the poverty, malnutrition, unsanitary, housing and the consequent physical and mental illnesses. If any Claimant had not known that, there were many Chagossians who would have put them in the picture without any difficulty upon a simple inquiry. The Claimants likewise knew that this might be capable of giving rise to an action either by the time of the start of the Vencatessen action, or at the latest by the time of the 1982 Agreement and the well-publicised withdrawal of that action. The reality is that the Bancoult Judicial Review and its outcome have nothing to do with the personal injuries claim. The documents disclosed may assist in arguing that the Defendants were negligent but it is not arguable that those documents reveal the ingredients of a cause of action for damages for personal injury which was hitherto unsuspected.</span>

They made claims on the US Government. They never asserted that damages became payable again.

They said they had no leaders; yet they elected representatives to the ITFB; they had organisations whether solely Chagossian or not; they had political contacts; they could obtain legal advice as to their position. Some in fact did so. Some asserted that they had been deceived by Mauritians; yet the evidence of that was no more than that there had been some letters or petitions suggesting full and final compensation in return for the giving up of claims, including at times but not always the right to return to Chagos. There was some potential for a conflict between the desire for Mauritius sovereignty eventually and a right of return to Chagos immediately, but there was and is a strong common interest in the islands becoming Mauritian. But they set up their own organisations led by Chagossians in 1983 to 1985, notably the CRG, so the alleged malign influence of those who had wanted to assist them, would by then have been neutralised.</span>

I am not sure that that fully reflects the seeking of advice in the 1990s but as a conclusion I felt that it indicated that the Claimants had reached a final agreement with the Defendants in 1982.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Sheridans visited Mauritius on three occasions. In 1979, the visit of English lawyers was not a secret. It was deliberately publicised by Sheridans. Their presence and activities were widely known. Of course, it is right that the advice given was short, was not tailored to individuals and may well have been partially grasped at best. But it was clear that access to English lawyers was possible and practical. The JIC continued to instruct Sheridans and to receive advice. Mr Ramdass went to the 1981 and 1982 negotiations on behalf of Mr Vencatessen. This was agreed to at a public meeting at which his role in relation to the Vencatessen case was explained – it was obvious that that case related to the ensuing negotiations.</span>

They advised the CIOF before, during and after the 1982 Agreement. They regarded themselves as advising the Chagossian community, because of the representative nature of the CIOF.

If it was thought that it had then been settled, it cannot now be said that those who took that view, even if wrongly, should now be entitled to sue. Those who were not of that view, chose not to proceed with a personal injuries claim.</span>

It would have been quite simple for them to be in touch with the CIOF, Mr Berenger, Mr Michel and Mrs Alexis to find out how matters had evolved. Mrs Alexis had been to the Seychelles in 1980 and, I am quite sure, did explain what was happening at least in broad terms. Seychelles Chagossians knew enough to attempt to make claims on the ITFB, albeit unsuccessfully. It would not have been difficult, at any stage, for contact between the two groups to have revealed the names of the solicitors and to pursue the claims.</span>

No claim in relation to a breach of trust has been alleged.

The US had no bases between the Mediterranean and the Philippines. Increasing influence and interest was being shown by the USSR in countries bordering the Indian Ocean. The US wished to be able to counter communist encroachment and to have a facility from which it could deal rapidly with situations developing in the countries around the Indian Ocean. It wanted to develop an island for a communications facility, anchorage, airfield and other related purposes. This was seen to be beneficial to UK foreign and defence interests, especially as its own presence east of Suez was diminishing. Diego Garcia was not the only island discussed but it was an important part of the discussion.</span>

The independence of Mauritius was imminent, and the independence of the Seychelles was at least anticipated. All of this meant that the defence facility could not be provided on an island or islands which might become subject to hostile political control. The islands which might be required therefore had to be separated from local control and detached from the colonies to which they were dependencies. That could only be done in consultation and in agreement with the Governments of the Seychelles and of Mauritius. Whatever the legal position, a variety of political reasons, including the assuaging of a hostile reaction at the UN and depriving the USSR of an argument with which to inflame hostilities, meant that such consent was necessary.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">That is not correct. Mr Beal produced a careful analysis of the census and other survey figures for Chagos from 1883 onwards. None contain a separate figure for Ilois. The total population figures though the 1950s for the three islands drop from about 1100 in the early 1950s to 900 by the late 1950s, to 747 in 1962. This is all consistent with the evidence of economic decline. It is the Scott figure, if any, which is out of line. Mr Newton’s overall figure of 993 with 483 on Diego Garcia is not significantly out of line. The figures for the islands thereafter fluctuate: 793 (431 Ilois), 924 (487 Ilois), both in 1967, the latter reflecting the last major recruitment, to 807 (434) in 1968, 691 (422) and 652 (350) in two 1969 visits, 680 (343) in 1970 and 630 (387) in February 1971. It is the number of Ilois, which was neither a readily defined nor ascertained category, which gave rise to the greater fluctuation in assessment. But the Newton report adverts to that problem of assessment and Ministers continued to seek more refined information. Mr Gifford produced in the Bancoult Judicial review (13/301) figures for births and deaths on the three island groups over similar periods of about 70 years; the registrations, assuming them to be only of Ilois which is not clear, show neither birth rate, nor population, nor do they relate to the same individual. For Diego Garcia it suggests a crude average of 20 births a year, 14 for Peros Banhos and 9 for Salomon. This advances matters very little. </span>

It was plain, at the conclusion of her evidence, that her statement bore no resemblance to anything which she might have said in her own words, by its style, phraseology or language. But the general picture was supported by other evidence and I am content for these proceedings to accept it as a reasonably accurate picture of life in the 1960s on Chagos, though seen through longing eyes and a misty recollection, engendered by the passage of time in a fairly wretched life in Mauritius.</span>

The Mauritius Government was to be told that the US Government was insisting on complete constitutional and administrative detachment and that leasing or defence agreements with Seychelles or Mauritius were not possible, (19/76a). Compensation needed for the consent of the two Governments would include the resettlement costs of displaced labour. American use of local labour was unlikely. It was intended, according to a telegram from the FCO to the Governor of the Seychelles, *(19/76e and 4/77), that people from Diego Garcia should be resettled in the outer islands rather than in Mauritius or the Seychelles and that the resettlement of people from the other detached islands was to be avoided.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It is: how can we avoid treating the new territory as a non-self-governing territory under Chapter XI of the Charter? The answer to this question depends on the status and treatment to be accorded to the civilian population who remain in, or go to the Islands</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". He said that in 1964 the understanding was that any population of the islands would be dealt with in such a way that they need not be regarded as "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">", which would be reasonably straight forward if they were settled elsewhere or given citizenship rights elsewhere and then employed in the Islands under temporary residents’ permits. He now understood however that only one of the islands would be taken and so the treatment of the civilian population in the other islands would require early consideration. This was recognised as an awkward problem and, because the inhabitants would not be removed from any of the islands until the islands were required for defence purposes, it would make it very difficult to avoid having to report on the new territory under Article 73 of the Charter. The matter was being discussed against the possibility that an awkward question would be asked in the House of Commons about this point. The hope was expressed by officials that it would be possible to avoid answering the question. One said: "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I have no doubt that the right answer under the Charter is that we should [transmit information to the United Nations] for the territory is a non-self-governing territory and there is a civilian population even though it is small.

However, because of a receding US interest in Diego Garcia for the time being, the plans, when prepared, were to remain contingency plans because there was no immediate need to evacuate anyone.

There was a tension between the need to use the islands commercially until they were required for defence purposes and the political problems which would arise at an international level if there were to be a permanent population on the islands which had to be resettled. There was no evidence before me that the generality of inhabitants of the islands of the Chagos Archipelago were aware at this stage of the creation of BIOT or of the plans for defence use and their resettlement.</span>

He said that as a matter of personal interest, he was anxious to try to find established communities on the islands, particularly people who have made their living by fishing or market gardening etc. He failed to find any. The labour force came from Seychelles and Mauritius and expected to return to their permanent homes in due course. He added that the estate managers on Diego Garcia would have welcomed local initiative on the part of the labour in fishing and market gardening, but the labour force had been content to be entirely dependent on the company for all their means and showed no interest in trying to establish themselves as individuals on the islands.</span>

Voting rights were absent even before BIOT was created when its inhabitants were indubitably citizens either of Mauritius or Seychelles and it will be from their parent Governments, as it always has been for the new expatriated inhabitants to seek enfranchisement. Finally, though, it would not be a major administrative task to resettle 1,000 Mauritians or Seychellois back in their parent countries, there has so far been no practical need to do so and it would not be easy to do so while we are still coping with the essential preliminaries of setting up an administration in the Territory." </span>

Whether, for the purposes of the present draft legislation (in particular clause 11) this predominance of Ilois need cause us much concern, depends on whether or not the Ilois can be regarded as ‘belonging’ to Mauritius. I think it is arguable that they can, for although they have been in Chagos for a long time, they have lived there only on sufferance of owners of the islands and could at any time have been sent back to Mauritius if no longer wanted in connection with the estate. They have never in the past had any right to reside permanently in Chagos. It seems therefore that there may be nothing inappropriate in the way our law is framed."</span>

On Diego Garcia he said that the plantation was generally in poor condition but that the labour force had been increased and a clearance programme had started; the plantation buildings were basically sound but in several cases required extensive maintenance. Labour relations appeared generally good; there were 15 quarters in the camp made from permanent materials and in good condition. Rations were supplied and there was a well stocked shop with prices appreciably less than on the Seychelles. The basic wage was Rs 25 per month for men and Rs 10 for women. He said:</span>

There was discussion about Agalega and resettlement on other islands. He explained in his witness statement that his uncle and he had many discussions with Mr Todd about resettling the islanders over the next few years, but that nobody came forward from the Government with a sensible solution; this put a blight on the islands. There was no clarity to the Government’s intentions and no answers to enquiries made of them. He complained in a statement, which was prepared for him in 1977, about the lack of communication between the BIOT Administration and the company about its intentions and its failure to exploit the islands properly. The advice given by the company to the Administration that proper compensation should be paid and that the Ilois should be properly looked after was not taken. They had never received any compensation other than small amounts given by the company. </span>

It was said that those figures did not represent a close or accurate survey, as indeed the March 1967 letter said.

He had formed a new company, Moulinie &amp; Company, which would manage Agalega on behalf of Chagos Agalega Company Limited, but which was not prepared to take the lease of Chagos but would probably be prepared to manage the BIOT islands on behalf of BIOT if a suitable agreement could be made.

As the independence of Mauritius drew near, specific questions needed to be dealt with about who would be a Mauritian citizen or a citizen of the UK and Colonies, or both, on independence. In November 1967, an internal FO minute advised that there would be three categories: those who would remain solely citizens of the UK and Colonies which would normally be someone who was born in BIOT and whose father was also born there, but whose other parents and grandparents were born in Mauritius; those who would be of dual nationality, most commonly those born in BIOT whose fathers were born in Mauritius; and those who would become citizens of Mauritius and cease to be citizens of the UK and Colonies, who would normally be those who were born in Mauritius like their fathers and grandfathers before them, but who had lived in BIOT for many years, (4/360). </span>

It advised that the effect of the Mauritius Constitution as proposed would be to give automatic citizenship of Mauritius on independence to persons in the Mauritius section of BIOT except for people born there whose fathers were born in the Seychelles or the Seychelles section of BIOT. But automatic Mauritius citizenship would not deprive them of their citizenship of the UK and Colonies and their entitlement to British passports, though that would not give them a right of entry to the UK. The matter now came up for discussion because it had recently been proposed by Mauritius Ministers that the relevant constitutional provision should be changed so that those born in the Mauritius section of BIOT would only acquire Mauritian citizenship if their fathers or paternal grandfathers were born in Mauritius. However, the FCO foresaw that the evacuation of the islands would involve the population having somewhere else to go, and that they would have no right of entry to Mauritius unless they became Mauritian citizens. Otherwise, they could be in the same position as the Kenya-Asians. Accordingly, there was a concern about those who might retain citizenship of the UK and Colonies, but more importantly that there were some who might only have citizenship of the UK and Colonies.

The Commissioner said that it seemed probable that among the 75 were a number whose contracts were terminated as they were unsatisfactory labourers. It commented that, in any event, Moulinie had no need for the 75 additional labourers. The Commissioner questioned whether the pressure to re-employ these persons on Chagos came from Mauritius officials who were unaware of the citizenship position set out in the Independence Act. Moreover, the labour recruitment from Mauritius was likely to reduce as shipping would be centred on voyages between the Seychelles and Chagos, (5/373). The Commissioner said to the CO, in a passage relied on by the Claimants as showing the role which the Commissioner and CO had in recruiting or managing labour on the islands:</span>

It was contended by the Defendants that there were no negotiations with the MoD at that time, and that the message had not been sent on the Defendants’ instructions, (10/49), but this does not entirely support the point. Other documents of the same time were relied on as showing the relationship between Moulinie &amp; Co and the BIOT Administrator, (5/373)(P), limiting recruitment to what was necessary for the efficient running of the islands. Approval was sought for a detailed list of merchandise and goods required by the managers for the islands; ranging from specific quantities of various sorts of spices, to writing paper, onions, fish hooks and the like.

In April 1968, a CO official circulated a memo, *(5/382)(ND), to various Government departments including MoD and the Treasury concerning the costs so far of setting up BIOT and how the costs of the new Seychelles airport were to be met from the £10m budget set for the UK side of establishing the defence facilities on BIOT. £4.1m had been spent and the airport was estimated now to cost £5.7m. The uncertainty over whether and when that commitment to the Seychelles could be met needed to be resolved. To that end, the CO official proposed that the costs of resettling Ilois from Chagos should be met from CO funds for aid; thus the uncertainty as to how much they would amount to would no longer hold up the Seychelles airport. But the thinking behind the willingness of the CO to take on this financial responsibility was that there were very few permanent inhabitants who would require resettlement, and even those might well be accommodated upon other coconut islands in BIOT or Agalega. It was regarded as very questionable whether a defence facility would ever proceed and it would not be for some years anyway.</span>

Thought was also given to the possibility that the other Chagos islands might also have to be evacuated; Agalega was seen as the likely place for resettlement in that eventuality. Apart from that eventuality, however, the Commissioner thought that resettlement on one of the currently uninhabited Chagos islands was the best option.</span>

It showed the total Ilois on the three inhabited islands of BIOT to number 434 in March 1968. This figure was said to derive from an objective assessment of where individuals were born, which was contrasted with the earlier and higher assessments of November 1966 (563) and May 1967(487), which was based on how people classified themselves. There were 128 on Diego Garcia and 40 more on Peros Banhos. Of the 128 Ilois on Diego Garcia, there were 57 adults and 71 children. There were in addition on Diego Garcia 230 Seychellois, mostly adults and predominantly male, with a further 22 Mauritians. What then follows is important to the Claimants’ case.</span>

No attempt has been made to go further back, but the figures show 434 persons whose roots are firmly established in Chagos and who would not normally be thought of as temporary inhabitants.

We must now turn to the question of the status of the Ilois on the islands, and it is here that we can find some justification for denying them the status of permanent inhabitants. As far as we are aware, the islands have been either leased or in private occupation ever since they were inhabited and the inhabitants have been on the island only because they were employed by the owners or lessees or were members of the family of persons so employed. None of the inhabitants owns any land on the islands and the houses in which they live are the property of the owners. Neither do they have the permanent right to use any land on the islands. The position therefore seems to be that the owners or lessees of the islands have a legal right to remove any person from any of the Chagos islands provided that in doing so they do not break the terms that persons’ contract … and equally that they have the right to refuse to allow any person to return to the islands. The fact that the islands are owned by the Crown and either leased or managed on behalf of the Crown does not change this position and we may therefore contend that as no-one has any right to reside permanently on the islands, there can be no permanent inhabitants. </span>

Such cases do occur, although they are not numerous. On the other hand, we had in February the case of 70 Ilois in Mauritius, apparently claiming the right to return to work in Chagos and being supported in this by the Mauritius Immigration and Labour Authorities … therefore, if we do have to remove Ilois from the islands, we shall have to expect some opposition from the people themselves and possibly from the Mauritius Government. When making resettlement plans, we can attempt to overcome the first problem by making the transfer advantageous to those moved (eg by providing better accommodation) and we shall have to attempt to forestall any objections by the Mauritius Government by securing their admission that the Ilois are Mauritians … ."</span>

Defence Lands, on whose behalf the former owners were managing the plantations, had expressed themselves to be not entirely happy to have responsibility for the plantations to which they had no access and over which they could not exercise any real control. Defence Lands wanted responsibility for the management and administrative arrangements to be placed upon the Commissioner of BIOT. This memo also appears to initiate an intricate minuet between Defence Lands and the CO as to whether the title to the islands vested in the Commissioner should continue to be vested in him or the MoD on behalf of the Crown.

These reflect his belief that with capital investment and a quick decision, the islands could be made to pay their way and be profitable within 3 to 4 years. This was at a time when the timescale of the American requirement was unknown but there was obviously a desire to make the most of the capital laid out on the purchase in the interim, as is clear from other documents. But it was to be affected by the unwillingness of the Americans to say that no other islands were to be required. It suggests that, absent US requirement, the islands could have been profitable but I do not accept Mr Allen’s suggestion that it itself shows that Peros Banhos and Salomon alone could have been profitable and disproves the Defendant’s contention that economic conditions caused the evacuation of Peros Banhos. But it points to the Chagos as a whole as having had the potential, on certain assumptions as to costs and investment, to be profitable over time.</span>

It said that it should be possible to persuade them that it was in their best interests to leave voluntarily rather than to be deported.

If production were to be improved, a short-term increase in labour-force was necessary, but that depended upon the availability of labour and housing. Seychelles labour was not at present available in large numbers because of the airport project; Mauritius labour was available but it was more economic to reduce communications between the islands and Mauritius because the "</span>

In general, the standard was lower than that on the average Seychelles outlying island. The camps were generally clean, but ration supplies suffered from periodic shortages because they were now being ordered on a three-monthly rather than a six-monthly basis by the management company so as to reduce the capital outlay on those items and to reduce the period over which they had to obtain a return. He commented that the physical conditions of the labourers were acceptable but there was no provision for their social welfare. Medical provisions were good and the schools were run rather in the way they had been before, but attendance was irregular. The civil status records were in good order, but he referred to the high degree of mobility between families, reflected in the percentage of illegitimate births which would add to the problems of resettlement should that become necessary. He concluded overall that the islands were suffering from uncertainty as to their future, and that whilst this uncertainty lasted there was little that could be done to increase production except in the case of Diego Garcia where the present labour-force could be more economically used. In general, the condition of the islands was as good as could be expected with the present limitation on exploitation.

A decision was sought before the beginning of November when Moulinie was expected to begin recruitment of additional Seychellois for Peros Banhos and Salomon.

He then said that it was recognised that persons born in BIOT with automatic Mauritian citizenship would not be deprived of their UK and Colonies citizenship and could be granted UK passports, though without an unrestricted right of entry into the UK. It would not have been justified to take away citizenship of the UK and Colonies from a person born in the colony even if he had acquired another citizenship, but the point was not considered very far at the time. Retention of that citizenship put in question any action to prevent their return to Chagos particularly if they could not be settled elsewhere. The FCO then referred to the legal advice which had been given that it was not right to compel BIOT inhabitants who were CUKC to leave without options and that draft section 11 was objectionable. The FCO continued that as it was now clear that not all inhabitants of BIOT were either solely Mauritian nationals or citizens of the UK and Colonies entitled to a Seychelles passport, it was necessary to consider how to deal with any citizens of the UK and Colonies "</span>

He expressed sympathy with those displaced Ilois who had been, by their own standards, among the most fortunate of labourers in that they had had almost guaranteed employment. But now, for defence reasons, the guarantee had gone and they now found themselves in Mauritius, a country with an acute unemployment problem and as Mauritius had virtually no copra industry, with no opportunity to use the skills they possessed. He recognised that the relief provided for them by the Mauritius Government had been cut off. He recognised the advantages, however, of re-employing the Ilois before any announcement was made of the Diego Garcia project as a matter of a moral obligation but that doing so would place the Government in an economically very disadvantageous position as against the political advantage. He referred to Moulinie &amp; Co’s desire to recruit 100 extra labourers and expressed the view that the families thus recruited from the displaced Ilois on Mauritius could be resettled on Peros Banhos and Salomon because of its needs for labour should Diego Garcia have to be evacuated. The risk of a loss would only arise if the whole of the Chagos had to be evacuated. Hence the advantage of obtaining agreement from the Americans and then securing the agreement to the development of Peros Banhos and Salomon. The development of such an idea would require Moulinie &amp; Co to be taken into their confidence as well as a certain future for Peros Banhos and Salomon, (5/541).</span>

In connection with the Ilois on Mauritius, the FCO suggested to the BIOT Commissioner and High Commissioner of Mauritius, (5/553), that the obvious course was to avoid any reinforcement of labour-force in the islands until American plans were clearer, but that a strictly limited recruitment of labour in Mauritius could take place if a refusal to recruit any labour would lead to a serious political outcry there.

She had got money from her brother, who worked in the docks, when she first arrived. Although her statement said that after she had seen Rogers &amp; Co they found a small plot of land and squatted on it, building a small shelter with tin and wood and lived there for twenty years, she had said in her evidence how they rented houses. She said the reason for the contradiction was because her head was turning and she was distressed. They were now living in a house made by a South African company with four rooms and a drainage system, and had been for 14 years; previously she had bought land but the accommodation had been very bad. She was still working as a maid, because the pension was insufficient. If she got ill, she got free healthcare at the hospital but she had to pay to get there if someone could not take her. Although her statement said that she had no "</span>

She and her mother were told (it appears in 1967) by Rogers &amp; Co that the islands had been sold by Mauritius, she did not say to whom, in return for independence. Their personal possessions also were left on Salomon. When they were told that they could not go back to Salomon they were staying with a neighbour and she had to leave school and abandon her education in order to find a job. Her mother had been unable to find work in Mauritius because she had become mad by that time; her witness statement said that her mother had been able to get a job after two years.

She denied that she had mentioned her step-father in her statement, although paragraph 11 refers to him.

She was not the child referred to because she was already married by March 1968 and her daughter had been born then. This material supports the basic point that her family was stranded when she was about 14 (she was born in 1952), but not the detail of the circumstances as she variously described it.

He thought he could do it in a month and was extremely optimistic about the economic fuure of the Chagos Islands based on the quality of the coconuts and guano. He said he received no serious response to the plan from BIOT administrators. He recalled the period between 1967 and 1970 as a period of increasing labour requirements. He was unable to recruit the labour he required because a limit of 250 was put on at the end of 1967 or 1968. In fact, the workforce was depleting because some who left did not return and houses were lying unexpectedly empty. He had to reduce the labour on the outlying areas; John Todd had refused him further labour intakes in about February.</span>

He said on two or three occasions, when questioned about this, that everything was very uncertain and they did not really know what was going on in this period. The 250 limit on the number of labourers was for male labourers on Diego Garcia because the British were going to pick up the bill for expenditure under the draft management agreement as it operated, and so they were concerned about the number of labourers, but who was employed within those figures was left to the company. Mr Moulinie denied that any instructions had been given by him to Rogers &amp; Co not to allow back people who had left the islands. His uncle had never told him so to instruct Rogers &amp; Co and had never said that Mr Todd had told him to instruct Rogers &amp; Co, nor was he aware of any instruction from Mr Todd to Rogers not to let people back. He was uncertain in his evidence about the evolution of the population and the reduction in Ilois families in the early 1970s. Over 1967 to 1968 there were a gradual reduction in the numbers of workers and it was difficult to get them back, probably because the islands were being evacuated. He thought requests for labour might have been refused but could point to no occasion when that happened. His perspective was clearly that of the plantation manager. He had heard in 1969 of people not being allowed back, but Rogers &amp; Co had never told them that they had got instructions not to allow people back. He had never heard of the cases spoken of by the individual Chagossian witnesses of people never being allowed back. He did notice that people had left and never came back. Their notebook with the cash would be sent back to the Seychelles by the Head Office. When asked whether islanders could communicate with those who had left, he said they used the Met Office for communication, even those who could not read or write; there were BIOT stamps and a post office but he did not know how many islanders sent letters. He was unable to shed any light on the request for 100 additional workers in November 1968. He said it was because of the oil fuel that the Captain of the "</span>

Even the full development of Peros Banhos and Salomon alone would require an increase in labour force which would absorb not merely the Ilois on Diego Garcia but those in Mauritius. Because the present labour force was insufficient to maintain the islands, he estimated that a further 530 men would be required if the maximum use were to be made of all three islands, and some 310 on Salmon and Peros Banhos.

The US, therefore, did not wish to enter into a twenty year self-denying commitment, (6/708).

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In March 1969, the PIOD of the FCO, which at this time had responsibility for BIOT, produced a draft working paper on the relocation of the plantation workers from Diego Garcia on to Peros Banhos and Salomon, (6/713). This also involved looking at the position of the Ilois families already living in Mauritius. The development plan prepared by Moulinie over a period of five years was described, together with its labour-force requirements, and the sum of £61,250 capital expenditure on housing and social services in addition to the investment required on the plantations of £126,000. It was recognised that, if the plantations were to be successfully developed, a long-term basis would be required, say fifteen years, in order to justify the substantial capital expenditure required over the first five years. Indeed, it was only after the first five years that there would be a return sufficient to begin to offset the investment. No commercial operator would be likely to risk the capital involved without certainty of tenure including a compensation clause for termination of the agreement. The alternative would be for HMG to provide the capital and run the plantations through a manager who would receive a fee. Taking account of the average price of copra, the Commissioner’s view had been that the plantations on Peros Banhos and Salomon could be run at a profit but could not be regarded as an enterprise capable of earning really substantial profits, or weather in a serious recession in the copra market. Although the adults from Diego Garcia could be accommodated, there were a number of growing children who would require employment and a yet longer-term problem of population increase, although the movement out of Chagos would offset that if contacts with Mauritius were maintained.</span>

He said that immigration legislation would be needed, whether there was total evacuation of the whole of Chagos or permanent resettlement on Peros Banhos and Salomon, or temporary resettlement on Peros Banhos and Salomon. He described the provisions of the draft Ordinance which required anybody entering or remaining in the territory to be in possession of a pass, the issue of which would be at the entire discretion of the immigration officer, whose decision would be appealable only to the BIOT Commissioner. It would be unlawful for somebody who needed a pass to enter or remain without one. Provisions for removal for those whose presence was unlawful were included. Mr Aust commented that if there were to be permanent resettlement on Peros Banhos or Salomon, these provisions would obviously be too severe because a permanent resident should not be required to apply every four years for a pass to remain in the colony. If there were to be temporary settlement of the Ilois from Diego Garcia on Peros Banhos or Salomon, or if the Chagos as a whole were to be totally evacuated, Mr Aust advised that very rigorous controls would be needed.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">A fifth BIOT working paper of April 1969, on evacuation and resettlement, gave the total Ilois population of the Chagos as 434, of whom 128 were on Diego Garcia, (6/739). That figure included men, women and children. There were also 56 Mauritians and 317 Seychellois on the Chagos, of whom respectively 22 and 230 were on Diego Garcia. The existence of the 370 Ilois on Mauritius already, thought to be awaiting re-employment on Chagos, was referred to and it was assumed that any public statement on resettlement would lead some of them to apply to be treated on the same basis as the Ilois in the Chagos. The main object of evacuation and resettlement was seen to be the provision of a solution once and for all to the latent political problem of the continuing presence of the Ilois in Chagos. Although the whole of the Archipelago was being considered for evacuation, a different timescale could apply as between Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos and Salomon. The high unemployment rate in Mauritius itself and the difficulties and expense of finding suitable employment for any families returning from the Chagos meant that a more satisfactory solution might be to negotiate resettlement of the Mauritian citizens from Chagos on Agalega as the only coconut producing island within Mauritian territory. It was said that this had been the original intention when BIOT was established. The unemployment rate of 27.5% in the Seychelles was even worse than on Mauritius but there were hopes with the new airport of economic development. The Ilois were identified as presenting the main problem because they had traditionally worked and lived in Chagos and had no skills other than those of coconut plantation workers. The movement of this class therefore "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">would involve not only uprooting them from their traditional homes and settling them elsewhere, but also providing them with a new livelihood, unless they can be resettled in an area where a copra industry exists</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". There was no such industry on Mauritius. An approach to the Mauritius Government was necessary and it was pointed out that that Government could be expected to negotiate for the best possible terms of resettlement in which humanitarian considerations, as well as the need to avoid adverse publicity would be factors. The continued use of Peros Banhos and Salomon after the evacuation of Diego Garcia, then envisaged for early 1970, could provide some valuable breathing space.

It has always been envisaged that the population should be resettled outside the BIOT as and when the islands become needed for defence purposes. Our aim must be to ensure the welfare of the people concerned, but at the same time we must seek to limit the financial burden falling on Her Majesty’s Government, as well as follow a course which is defensible in the United Nations and which does not store us up greater trouble for the future. I agree with the conclusion reached in the paper that, on balance, the best plan will be to try to arrange for these people, all of whom are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or of Mauritius or both, to return to the Seychelles or Mauritius. The people with whom we are concerned are working the Chagos under contract and own no property or other fixed assets there. However, some of them have established roots in Chagos and I should naturally have wished to consult at least these in advance of any decisions about their future, if this had been possible. Officials have examined closely the possibility of giving them some element of choice, but have advised that this would seem wholly impracticable. We are not able, at this stage, in advance of talks with Mauritius, to offer resettlement there as an option; and even if we could, these workers might express a preference to stay in Chagos. This … would have severe drawbacks from our own point of view."</span>

This referred to the small but growing number of workers and children who were establishing claims to belong to the Chagos which could cause considerable problems in the future, and some of whom might one day claim a right to remain in BIOT by virtue of their citizenship of the UK and Colonies. The plantations were run down because it had not been possible to develop them properly, pending decisions on defence use of the islands. When BIOT was created, it was not envisaged there would be any permanent inhabitants and the problem of the Ilois was, at present, not widely known. If, however, they remained within BIOT, whether resettled from one island to another, the risk of being forced to acknowledge UN Charter responsibilities arose and it would be helpful if any move could be presented as a change of employment for contract workers. The advantages of a short-term solution involving removal from Diego Garcia to Peros Banhos and Salomon were outweighed by the long-term disadvantages and there was an option of relocating them to other islands in the Archipelago. The population of the Archipelago was a maximum of 800 and the 434 Ilois were dual nationals. A relocation solution to another island within Chagos might not be in their long-term interests. </span>

The present understanding was that there would be unlikely to be any political outcry. The Seychelles Governor replied to the effect that the effect of the Diego Garcia project would be to make 150 Seychellois labourers redundant in Chagos but that there were projects, including the airport, which would potentially provide them with employment opportunities, particularly if they returned on a phased basis. Their position was seen as being better than that of the Ilois because of their being more likely to be able to find work to which they were accustomed and they, in any event, had no possible claim to a right to stay in Chagos, (6/775). </span>

They found that the plantation on Diego Garcia was gradually becoming more overgrown as the number of workers on the island was insufficient, (6/805). They were less overgrown on the other islands. There had been a decrease in the population since 1967 of 155 and the main decrease had been in the number of Mauritians and Ilois because the communications with the island were now being confined to the Seychelles. But it had also been difficult to obtain Seychellois for the Chagos and their numbers had also declined. The report followed a similar pattern and its general conclusion was that the islands continued to be run satisfactorily on a care and maintenance basis and that the conditions of life on the islands remained acceptable, which was as much as could be expected under the current restrictions. The total population of Diego Garcia following this visit was put at 319, of which 93 were Ilois, comprising 27 men, 21 women and 45 children.

There would be less of a problem with Seychellois labour, which could be phased back into that labour market within twelve to eighteen months, (6/830).</span>

He could see no difficulty in clearing Diego Garcia by June 1970, but not both Peros Banhos and Salomon as well. Negotiations with the Mauritius Government and with Moulinie, if Agalega were to be used, would take some time. A two-phased plan was necessary. The first phase dealing with Diego Garcia, the second phase with the other two islands. It was suggested that some Seychellois and mono-Mauritians could be removed from Peros Banhos and Salomon to make way for Diego Garcian Ilois in the first instance to go there. Accommodation would have to be improved for them. Seychellois and Mauritians were entitled to more than one month’s notice and to payment for the unexpired portion of their contract. The plan was thus: that in April 1970, Ilois should be removed from Diego Garcia by the "</span>

The BIOT Commissioner sought the permission of the FCO to take Moulinie into his confidence about the proposal because his co-operation would make resettlement much easier.</span>

There was a choice between continuing to defer action until the outcome of the consideration by Congress of the 1971 US Budget, which would involve a probable delay of a year, or of taking steps now on resettlement in any event. The advantage of the former was that it reduced the leakage of information about the proposed US facility. The argument in favour of the latter was that the problem of the contract labourers in the Chagos existed independently of Diego Garcia plans. The Treasury was getting restive. The Mauritian Government might renew its pressure for compensation for those Ilois already in Mauritius which had been expected to be covered in the talks on resettlement which Dr Ramgoolam had expected to start in the summer of 1969 or thereabouts. Moreover, if the plan were begun now, it would be possible to avoid the two-stage resettlement plan. The key to the success of that plan would be the reaction of Mr Moulinie to the BIOT Commissioner’s approach and his ability to keep the Government’s intentions secret from the labourers. His co-operation was important, not merely because he managed Chagos but because he also leased Agalega from the Mauritius Government.

The administrative advantages of relocating the population were seen by the Administrator as being the last consideration. It would be better to relocate the population over a period of two to three years. But no revocable decision should be made until Congress had reached a view later on in 1970. The BIOT Administrator thought that it would be unjustifiable economically and administratively to depopulate Farquhar and Desroche which were both profitable plantations and among the most productive of the islands of the Seychelles group, the abandonment of which would cause an uproar in the Seychelles.

It was to be said, if necessary, that they had been run down to the point at which it was uneconomic to continue their operation, that the people living on BIOT were contract labourers, engaged to work on the copra plantations, that the Government owned all the land and that the labourers owned no property or fixed assets and that except for some fishing, perhaps, and the meteorological station, the copra plantations were the sole means of livelihood for those resident on Chagos. They were all either from Mauritius or the Seychelles and possessed no land or houses on the island. The plantations were owned by the British Government and managed on their behalf.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In May 1970, the internal minutes in BIOT dealt with how Mr Paul Moulinie had reacted to being told by Mr Todd, the BIOT Administrator, that the operation of the plantations was not economically viable and the Chagos were to be closed down, (19/837(a)). Moulinie had agreed that there was no economic justification for continuing the operation unless capital could be made available, and that it would be best to close the plantations. Problems arose, however, when the question of Agalega was raised. The cyclones meant that the labour force now was sufficient to enable them to continue their planting programme and would be sufficient for the normal running of the plantation until some eight years hence when the newly planted areas were in production. The Commissioner therefore had to tell the FCO that the creation of extra jobs on Agalega would not happen as had been expected. It would not be popular to replace the Seychellois with Ilois because of problems which that would create in the Seychelles, and Moulinie regarded the Seychellois as the better workers. There would be local opposition to any resettlement on Seychelles or ex-Seychelles BIOT islands. The question originally raised by Robert Newton in his report in 1964 that islanders might be given plots of land and settled on them, which had hitherto been thought of as too generous for land-less labourers, was mooted again as a starting point for negotiations on resettlement with the Mauritius Government. The only other alternative seemed to be, according to the Commissioner "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">to send the Ilois back to Mauritius and to give them compensation in cash, either in a lump or in instalments. Either is unlikely to prove very satisfactory to the Ilois in the long run. They lack the knowledge, tradition and education to make satisfactory small-holders and any form of cash grant is likely to be soon spent</span>

As Mr Todd feared, the question of defence facilities had been buried so deep in the conversation that Moulinie &amp; Co came back with an offer to lease the Chagos group from BIOT. This was considered by Moulinie &amp; Co as likely to resolve for some time the problem of the Ilois on the islands. The plantations, according to Moulinie &amp; Co accounts, had been run at a loss of Rs 80,000 in the year 1970-1971, (6/871).</span>

Moulinie provided Mr Todd with what he described as a long lecture on the economic opportunity which the UK Government was foregoing, (6/879). Moulinie also took what was described as a gloomy but realistic view of the future of the Ilois if they were returned to Mauritius. No labour was being recruited in July 1970 for the Chagos. He awaited the reaction on the islands to that development with interest. As the autumn wore on, Moulinie affirmed his willingness to provide resettlement for some Ilois on Agalega for some Ilois, if he received financial assistance. Detailed proposals and a five year plan were sought, but it was thought to be a good idea. There was a debate about a one off settlement versus a continuing subsidy.

The Government of Mauritius had given no indication that it would not regard Mauritius as the natural home for the resettlement of Ilois, but it was worth considering a variety of options. These included the use of the outer islands of the Seychelles, staged resettlement on Peros Banhos and Salomon and the resettlement of some on Agalega. There was a need to have further information as to costs of termination of contracts, resettlement compensation and the implications of a staged resettlement on Peros Banhos for the displaced Seychellois labourers.

This was that, according to Mr Moulinie, up to 1967 when direct links with Mauritius ceased and only a few families had gone to Mauritius via Seychelles and a few had taken new contracts, Ilois would do two to five years on the islands and then take advantage of their free passage to Mauritius staying there for a period which depended on how long their money and welcome from their families lasted, but normally returning after an absence of between three months and one year. Often Ilois women would go to Mauritius to give birth and be away for between three and six months. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The submission said that there were about 829 in the Chagos Archipelago, (7/1004), of whom 359 lived on Diego Garcia and the remainder on the two other inhabited island groups. Of this total, 386 were dual citizens of the UK and Colonies and of Mauritius but these, the Ilois, were unaware of their dual nationality, nor were the Mauritius Government aware of it. There were 35 citizens of Mauritius and 408 citizens of the UK and Colonies from Seychelles. The submission referred to the Mauritius Government spokesman’s answer in the Legislative Assembly in December 1965, given with the approval of the Colonial Office that the British Government had undertaken to meet the full cost of the resettlement of Mauritians at present living in the Chagos Archipelago. It had always been assumed that the resettlement would be in Mauritius and it was thought that that was the understanding of the Mauritius Government as well. However, because of the already high level of unemployment, it was to be expected that negotiations would be difficult. There were already about 100 families in Mauritius whose contracts to work in Diego Garcia had not been renewed and in respect of whom the Mauritius Government had been asking how the UK Government intended to fulfil its obligations. An answer to that had been delayed pending a decision about resettlement as a whole. Once again, the suggestion that some might be resettled in Agalega raised its head, but it was recognised that there would have to be some inhabitants moved temporarily to Peros Banhos and Salomon. This interim measure was seen to have no practical difficulties. There was a strong objection to Mauritians being settled in the Seychelles. It was pointed out that of the £10,000,000 originally allocated for the establishment of BIOT, all the money had virtually been spent on payments to Mauritius, the building of the Seychelles Airport and the purchase of the islands, and accordingly there was virtually nothing which could be used for resettlement purposes and that additional funds would be required for it. It was recognised that the evacuation and resettlement of several hundred people would attract unfavourable publicity from critics of the UK’s Indian Ocean strategy. The submission had the concurrence of the relevant departments within the FCO, the Overseas Development Agency and the Ministry of Defence. The Treasury had concurred on understanding that any expenditure over £10,000,000 would be met from within existing provisions and "</span>

So far as the people on Diego Garcia were concerned, the Secretary of State advised the BIOT Commissioner that when Mr Todd visited Diego Garcia with the Americans later in January, he should tell the contract workers that construction work was to begin in March on Diego Garcia and it would therefore be necessary to stop work on the copra plantations.

It would be important at that stage to avoid any distinction being made between what was said to Seychellois and what was said to the Mauritians including the Ilois, (7/975).

The use of civilian labour should be avoided as much as possible. The timetable was set; Seychellois would be moved in March or April 1971, and the balance in July. The majority of contracts specified Chagos, but some the particular atoll. The BIOT Commissioner also told the FCO that, so far as costs were concerned, a detailed estimate was not yet possible, but there seemed no danger of a claim for extra compensation for Seychellois, but if a more generous scheme for resettling the Ilois were publicised, it might spark off claims from them and negotiations with Mauritius should avoid such publicity at this stage, (7/980).

This confirmed that there would be no local labour employed on Diego Garcia, but that, for the foreseeable future, labourers moved to the other islands in Chagos, where facilities were adequate, would not be disturbed. A draft Parliamentary answer that the population was a small number of contract labourers from the Seychelles and Mauritius attracted the comment: </span>

The Foreign Secretary said that he could see no reason why some should not stay. It appeared that there might be some signs that the Chief Minister of the Seychelles might be prepared to take some Ilois Mauritians, but a good deal more information and assessment would be necessary. He repeated his recommendation that the Mauritius Government should be approached in order to establish how far they would be prepared to help. Mr Moulinie should be encouraged to take 50 families on Agalega, a Mauritius island. Although it appeared from discussions with Sir James Mancham, the then Chief Minister of Seychelles, that there might be some possibility in certain circumstances of Mauritian Ilois being resettled in the Seychelles, there were considerable doubts as to whether Mr Rene and his party would agree to that without causing trouble. Ministers were anxious to resettle the Chagos inhabitants without major upset with the Mauritius Government or at the UN, *(7/1033)(ND). </span>

	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana">th</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> February 1971, *(7/1036)(P), internally within the FCO, he said that he thought that undue emphasis had been placed on dual nationality and the line should be taken that that was irrelevant to the question of resettlement. He discussed the effect of the Mauritius Independence Act 1968 pointing out that it preserved dual citizenship of Mauritius and UK and Colonies for those inhabitants of Chagos who, or whose fathers or fathers’ fathers, were born in Chagos. Persons born in Chagos before BIOT was created were regarded as having been born in Mauritius and therefore automatically entitled to Mauritian citizenship on independence, unless they were persons whose fathers had been born in Seychelles. The dual citizenship had not been removed because, said Mr Aust, it would have been contrary to the principles of our Nationality Law to deprive persons born in a colony of their UK citizenship. Mr Aust then turned to the term "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Ilois</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". He said the term had no relevance to nationality and had been used as a convenient, though thoroughly misleading term, to cover dual nationals when, in fact, "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">the Ilois population is made up of citizens of the UK and Colonies, dual nationals and mono-Mauritian citizens, with origins in Seychelles or Mauritius</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". There was no advantage in using the term in negotiations and it could be to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom to do so because it indicated that the inhabitants of Chagos "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">have a close, if not closer, connection with Chagos than with mainland Mauritius</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". He thought that fears of referring to dual nationals in Chagos, lest the Mauritius Government used such knowledge to their advantage at the UN or in negotiations, were exaggerated and that instead of concentrating on nationality or the meaning of "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Ilois</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">", the Government should concentrate upon the undertakings given to Mauritius in 1965. He said that it was clear from the undertakings in 1965 that the resettlement of persons in Mauritius of Mauritian origin was contemplated. There was no suggestion that it would not apply to Mauritians who were also United Kingdom citizens because, in 1965, all the inhabitants of Chagos were UK citizens since there was no Mauritian citizenship until 1968. It was a necessary implication of the agreement to meet the full cost of resettlement that that placed an obligation on the Mauritius Government to permit resettlement in Mauritius. There would have been no need for such an undertaking if settlement elsewhere had been in contemplation. Mr Knight agreed with these comments, but added that if the question of nationality were raised by the Mauritius Government, the FCO line should be to: (7/1044)</span>

It was not thought that there would be any difficulty in re-absorbing Seychellois workers in the Seychelles, but resettlement of the remaining Mauritian/Ilois workers in Mauritius might cause difficulties there "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">since these people have little aptitude for anything other than growing coconuts which doesn’t happen in Mauritius; and may add to the already grave unemployment problem</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" resettlement of Mauritian or Ilois families on other coconut plantations in the Indian Ocean area should take place. Agalega was the only place identified and that for 50 families. The advice to the Commissioner described how negotiations might be tackled: an acceptance of the commitment to meet the full cost of resettlement of the Mauritians living in Chagos in 1965, which included therefore the 100 or so families who returned to Mauritius after 1965; a repatriation and rehabilitation scheme based upon expert advice would be necessary, but possible methods were yet to be considered in detail and the Commissioner could not commit the Government to any particular scheme or to any particular amount of money because no realistic figure had been put to the Treasury. The Treasury was insisting that all costs be kept "</span>

The Chief Minister of the Seychelles was extremely worried at the political implications of any Ilois coming to the Seychelles because he would be in real difficulties over completely unskilled foreign labour going there when there was no need for it; Ilois would be regarded as Mauritians who were particularly unpopular there. By now, it was clear that there was no prospect of any Mauritian Ilois being settled on the Seychelles. The alternative of Farquhar island, also within BIOT, was raised as a possible place for 100 extra men. Agalega was also referred to, but there would be problems in the Seychelles if the Seychellois working there were displaced in large numbers at any one time. It might be better, he thought, to allow the Ilois to remain on the plantations on Peros Banhos and the Salomon islands, even though the copra plantations on those two islands would not be, by themselves, viable. Around this time there were thought to be 103 Mauritian families in Chagos who would need to be resettled, whether in Agalega or Mauritius. </span>

They had described the Mauritian authorities as apathetic but, in his telegram, he commented that that was largely due to their reliance on the UK Government meeting a commitment the extent of which had not been specified. Although he had told his visitors that the matter was being examined urgently, he urged that some form of interim assistance be given without delay pending a firm decision about their future. Mr Ollivry had been told by the Prime Minister of Mauritius that they were probably UK Citizens but the High Commissioner said that that question should not be allowed to cloud the issue of resettlement.

The High Commissioner re-iterated the need for a clear statement as to how the UK Government saw its obligations in order to advance any meaningful resettlement scheme. He said that the Mauritius Government had suggested £300,000 as a conservative estimate covering disturbance, resettlement and reimbursement of public assistance payments. He said that the present estimate by the Mauritians was that there were 250 families or about 1,000 people who had arrived in Mauritius from Chagos since 1965 to whom the resettlement obligation applied.

The Prime Minister’s Permanent Secretary referred to 474 families whose heads had registered with the Employment Service since their arrival in Mauritius. A co-operative pig breeding scheme was discussed and thought to be appropriate. It was thought by a senior Mauritius civil servant that those living and working on Chagos had acquired British nationality. The High Commissioner would investigate employment potential in Agalega and other neighbouring islands, and severance pay; the Mauritians would examine the length of service of those displaced since 1965, the sums paid to them by way of outdoor relief, the use of Crown land for resettlement. The inhabitants would be asked whether they wished to go to Agalega or Mauritius. The High Commissioner was not content with the notes of the meeting on severance pay because Mauritian law might be inappropriate.</span>

They had to leave because Paul Moulinie said there would be no food. However, before their meeting there had been no food, soap, milk, medicine, nurses or teachers and everybody had left and that was why she left. They had to go to Peros Banhos and Salomon and those who wanted to could go to Mauritius, but they had to go to Mauritius if they did not go to Peros Banhos or Salomon. They could not stay in Diego Garcia and they had no right to stay.

There were now 332 persons on Peros Banhos and Salomon, Diego Garcia having been completely evacuated. The difficulty of knowing which way the Mauritius Government wished to deal with resettlement was also thought to impede any immediate action: did it want a scheme which might create internal problems by placing Ilois in a distinctly better position than other Mauritians, or would it rather receive money by way of reimbursement of public assistance whereby the Ilois would effect their own resettlement?

Only 43 were in permanent jobs but these included very poorly paid domestic service. A pig-breeding scheme was recommended. Rabbits could be bred around the houses.

There was confidence, following the Government survey in which these possibilities had been canvassed, that most of the 296 families would wish to participate and that those who did not would receive a cash grant instead. It was assumed that the 13%, as it was put, on Peros Banhos and Salomon would participate.

The FCO was more favourably inclined, even were a third housing estate necessary for those Ilois yet to come: it was still not an expensive scheme, would not have been jibbed at but for the over-expenditure on the Seychelles airport, and with the economic problems facing Mauritius, the Ilois had to be treated reasonably well so as to avoid the Mauritius Government turning round and telling the UK to look after its own people. The FCO thought that it had a weak hand and wanted to avoid cheese-paring.

He also advised that there had been only limited mixing on the islands between the Ilois and the Seychellois, who rarely spent more than two contractual periods there. He advised in April that 100 Seychellois had been returned to the Seychelles when Diego Garcia had been closed, and that 95 Mauritians (18 men, 18 women and 49 children) had gone to the other Chagos islands with a further 25 (7 men, 6 women and 12 children) choosing to return to Mauritius as their contracts had expired.</span>

It saw the obligation to Mauritius as being to meet the costs of a scheme rather than to evaluate or even devise a scheme. It accepted the force of the ODA points but said that it was not for it to become involved in the preparation or execution of the Mauritius Government scheme; it simply had to be sure that the obligation could not be discharged more cheaply. This scheme was almost certainly under-costed and if it were examined more closely, there would almost certainly be a substantial increase in cost. It did have the advantage that the scheme was devised and supported by the Mauritius Government and its adoption would enable an increasingly urgent problem to be disposed of quickly.

There were some urgent welfare cases: 78 people were in receipt of old age pension, but there were others who were unable to work and for whom the extended family system did not provide adequate support and who should be taken care of immediately. For the others, the first call on their individual allocation should be the provision of adequate housing with some furnishing.

The problems which they faced had been compounded by a cyclone in 1975. The Report had recommended the construction for each family of a house which was a little below the standard which was allowed by Building Regulations in Mauritius; this proposal had been rejected by the Mauritius Government which undertook to allocate funds to ensure that the houses, which it accepted should be built, were not below standard.

However, Mr Ramdass with the support of the other two Ilois, expressed concern that the delays in such a case would delay a solution to their urgent problems. The Government reassured them that the work of the Committee would not be delayed pending the outcome of that case.

The resettlement agreement was with the Government and not with individuals, even though that was the manner in which the Mauritius Government had decided to distribute the money. It had been paid to the Government in recognition of the particularly acute economic difficulties which an independent Mauritius faced; the Seychelles had still been a colony when the plantations had been closed, had still received sizeable grant aid and substantial compensation for the detachment of its islands (which had not been evacuated) and did not face such severe economic problems. The FCO added for the benefit of its representative on the Seychelles that the recent offer to settle the Vencatessen case for £500,000 to include all eligible islanders on Mauritius, had been made in that same spirit rather than to compensate for the loss of contested individual rights. It was feared that those now in the Seychelles, having left the Chagos, might start litigation taking their cue from the Vencatessen case.</span>

There were not thought to be any post 1965 arrivals omitted from the list of 426. The figure used by Sheridans, which was some 200 higher, was not thought to be sound.

In September 1975, the Guardian suggested to the MoD that there had been deliberate misrepresentation about the inhabitants of Chagos.

Failing memories, contradictions, exaggerations and omissions of relevant parts of the picture eg as to social security benefits, accommodation and medical treatment for what ailments were commonplace.

Mr Blom-Cooper QC was also identified as one of those advising the Plaintiff; he may have been doing so since October 1974.

It pleaded the acquisition of the islands in 1967, and that Moulinie &amp; Co had managed the islands in accordance with the terms of an unexecuted agreement. It specifically pleaded that, if Michel Vencatessen had been born in 1922 on Diego Garcia as he claimed, he would have become a British Subject by birth and later a citizen of the UK and Colonies by virtue of the British Nationality Act 1948. On the independence of Mauritius in 1968, he would also have become a Mauritian citizen. This pleading is of significance for the claim in these proceedings that the UK Government sought to deceive the Ilois as to their citizenship. It contended that the work on the plantation ceased and that the workers were transferred at their choice either to other Chagos islands or to Mauritius and that those transfers took place with the consent of the employees. In response to a Request for Further and Better Particulars, it was specifically pleaded that this Plaintiff agreed to leave at a meeting with the Moulinies shortly before departure. Residence on Diego Garcia was as an employee and with the leave of his employers; without such leave, he had no right to enter or remain on the island. No acts of force had been used, if at all, by or on behalf of any servant of the Crown. The BIOT Immigration Ordinance 1971 was pleaded, not as the basis for the removal of the Ilois, but as the basis upon which the refusal of their return was lawful: they had no right to enter, they had no permit and indeed had never sought one, or if they had and it had been refused, they had never appealed against such a refusal.</span>

A Declaration was sought that Michel Vencatessen was entitled to return to live on Diego Garcia. In July 1976, the Plaintiff alleged that it was a term of the UK/US Agreements that the Ilois be removed by the UK Government.</span>

It was unlawful to expel the Plaintiff from the whole of BIOT or Diego Garcia. He never consented to leave and if he did, that consent was procured by the false representation that the Secretaries of State would pay compensation. The BIOT Immigration Ordinance could not be relied upon by the Defendant: it was ultra vires the BIOT Order 1965 because its purpose was to remove the whole or the larger part of the population of BIOT and accordingly was not made for the peace, order or good government of BIOT. This was the issue upon which the Bancoult case was fought and won by Mr Bancoult in 2000, but that precise issue had been raised in the Vencatessen litigation nearly 25 years earlier.</span>

There are differences; the property claim had not been formulated and there was no reliance placed upon the Mauritius Constitution. The causes of action are not pleaded as misfeasance, negligence, exile or deceit; but the Immigration Ordinance is said to be unlawful on the grounds relied on 25 years later; the issue is raised as to whether it was lawful for the Crown to rely upon its property rights to remove the population of BIOT and that it was in any event unlawful for it to do so without consulting the population, offering them a choice as to whether to stay or go and if the latter, where to go. The essential unlawfulness of compulsorily removing a whole population or the greater part of it from the BIOT was at the centre of the Vencatessen litigation.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The Defendant began to gather evidence for its case from witnesses in the Seychelles through the Seychelles Attorney General. In August 1975, he interviewed Paul and Marcel Moulinie and Raymond Mein, who was the Assistant Manager for Moulinie &amp; Co on Diego Garcia. He recorded Paul Moulinie as saying that the company and the BIOT Administration had arranged for the transfer of employees to Peros Banhos and Salomon and that the company had carried out the transfer. They could choose to go instead to Mauritius. They could take their personal belongings to those islands. They received a sum by way of resettlement which the BIOT Administration reimbursed. They left willingly. No naval vessels or personnel were involved; the transfer took place without incident or the use of force or coercion as he understood it from Marcel who had been in charge. The same applied when they were transferred from Peros Banhos and Salomon. Paul had said that he dealt with the refusal to disembark on arrival in Mauritius by saying, I infer from the missing words in the note, that the Mauritius Government would pay some further sums to them, (8/1421). Marcel was interviewed with Mr Mein, (19/1383d). They confirmed that no military personnel had been involved in the transfers. They both said that the fifty or so families on Diego Garcia were given the choice of going either to Mauritius or to Peros Banhos or Salomon. Only twelve took the latter course and the majority chose Mauritius in order to be first in line for any jobs there. Michel Vencatessen, who had been the senior overseer on Diego Garcia, as with the rest of the families, had been reluctant to leave Diego Garcia and the older people had been particularly reluctant to go but the younger people had seen it as more of an opportunity. Nonetheless, the promise of compensation and the fact that they were allowed to take all their possessions helped them to make up their minds to go. He said, according to the Attorney General in a note made when he sought further details in March 1976, (19/1384b), that the company treated the islands as an estate and no-one could enter or stay without their permission and none did except as employees.</span>

He confirmed though the accuracy of what was said about compensation and the evacuation. He disagreed that Mr Mein had gone to Agalega for a year, as did Mrs Mein. Although it was a commercial estate, Diego Garcia was also the islanders’ permanent home, for those who had been there for generations, and was not just a question of their having contractual rights as employees. A bad employee would be locked up for a few days, only one had been sent back.</span>

He also said that he had at last found a reference showing that Mr Vencatessen needed no contract in order to stay on Diego Garcia because he was domiciled there. The Attorney General wrote to the BIOT Administrator in April 1976 (19/1384m) saying that Mr Paul Moulinie had told him that Mr Vencatessen had no contract because he had been born on the island </span>

He had assisted in the evacuation of Diego Garcia and had then gone to Peros Banhos for a few months. He had gone reluctantly because of his ties with Diego Garcia. After a short spell on Peros Banhos, he had gone to Agalega for a year, (8/1442). Mrs Mein, who gave evidence to me, said that he had not been to Agalega at all. He had had a year’s salary in lieu of leave when he finally left the company and on the Seychelles, he had had employment in Public Works. He also said that he was not pressing for the Rs 500 which he and all the others who left Diego Garcia had been promised, and which none of them had received. He was on good terms with the company, unlike Mr Prosper, who had been in charge of records on the islands for the company, who also lived in Mahe but was bitter at what had happened.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In August 1976, the Seychelles Attorney General conducted a further interview with Paul Moulinie. He dealt with the contractual position of Michel Vencatessen who on certain documents was referred to as "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">pas engage</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". This meant, he said, that they were Ilois and "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">", (8/1400). But Mr Paul Moulinie did not mean by those documents or by saying that Mr Vencatessen was domiciled there, that he was entitled to live there or even thought that he was. It meant that he regarded the island as his home. Mr Moulinie still thought that the workers looked upon themselves as working on an estate, rather than as having any permanent right of abode. They were given houses rent free which the company repaired and, if they left, re-allocated to another worker. Workers from the island differed only from those recruited from off the island in that they had no contract. They were never given the impression that they would continue to be employed on the island. The children of workers took up employment with the company when they were about twelve unless they were thought bright enough to go to school in Mauritius. Many had done so and some of them had returned to the island if trouble had arisen in Mauritius. The question of a prescriptive right of residence had never arisen. Whenever a worker had had to put off the island, he had just done as told and went. The plantations were run on paternalistic lines, with the company providing free medical care, food in the store, the religious services and the school. Some people had been living on the island for many years, possibly from families who had been there for a hundred years.</span>

Mr Duval was kept informed as to the progress of the case. By October 1976, pleadings were closed, discovery had yet to take place and it was soon hoped to set the case down for trial in view of the urgency attaching to it because of the plight of the Ilois.

The Defendant's Discovery Schedule of August 1977, listed documents which they were not prepared to disclose because their disclosure would be harmful to the public interest. These included the high level consideration of defence policy including the resettlement of workers, and discussions with foreign governments or the UN. Some documents were disclosed after negotiation and others were disclosed in a redacted form. The differences have been identified for me by reference to the extensive chronology with which I have been provided. A Summons was issued for hearing before a Master in December 1977 at which the issue would be resolved; the Master would have been asked to examine the documents himself in order to assess their privileged status. The extent to which those documents were truly privileged was never tested in the litigation before a Master or a Judge. It was said before me by Mr Cyril Glasser of Sheridans that this was because the Treasury Solicitor had made an offer of settlement shortly before the hearing, which offer had been timed to deprive his client of the opportunity of pursuing the application without a further consideration of the prospects of success, and thus to postpone the point at which disclosure might be ordered of embarrassing documents.</span>

That aspect of the conduct of his litigation was a matter for the advice of his lawyers, weighing the prospects of success and the timing of any victory against the risk of losing or waiting with nothing for perhaps a number of years.</span>

It was said that the sum was offered in the same spirit as motivated the £650,000 offer to the Mauritius Government and had not been calculated by reference to any heads of damage. It was envisaged that the sum would be shared equally among the families according to a mechanism of their choosing. "</span>

If, however, after the consideration of any further documents which might be ordered to be disclosed, the action was continued, the offer would be withdrawn. It was thought that Sheridans might be able to obtain instructions for other families in addition to Mr Vencatessen, and for those whom Sheridans did not act, the Crown would have to tell them of the offer. A list of those for whom Sheridans acted was asked for. The Government of Mauritius was informed.</span>

It was not thought reasonable to have to consider the offer and to take proper instructions on it without visiting Mauritius, for which purpose Sheridans sought the financial help of the Defendants, and an adjournment of the Summons for Discovery which was becoming imminent. It was adjourned sine die by consent. It was thought that a week would suffice for the purpose of communicating with the community, seeking their views and advising them on the offer. A request was made for legal aid to cover the visit on the basis that Sheridans had received instructions from "</span>

Legal aid was refused because there was only the one formal client and the community in general were not the legally aided client. But in May, the Treasury Solicitor offered to pay up to £5,000 towards the costs of two lawyers from Sheridans going to Mauritius because of the proposals which needed to be put to the Ilois generally. Assistance was also sought from the Mauritius High Commission by Sheridans. Both Mr Sheridan and Mr Glasser, the Sheridans Head of Litigation, went to Mauritius in June 1978. Mr Glasser said that they had discussed the offer of £1/2m with Ilois representatives. They had gone to meet Ilois community representatives and to see where the Ilois lived. There was critical publicity of the offer in Mauritius. One problem had been that the Mauritius Government was unhappy with money being distributed to individual Ilois, which could be divisive if they became better off than Mauritians. But it was aware of the case and of its importance. Mr Sheridan agreed in Court that the Vencatessen case would be a precedent for other Ilois and he had viewed it in that way when it was in progress, as had the Treasury Solicitor. The offer of £1/2m and the subsequent offers were clearly directed to the Ilois community as a whole. Mr Sheridan said that, although when the first offer of £1/2m was made he did not know whom the Ramdass Committee represented or how representative it was and could not now remember who the committee members were, he did know that this visit had made him more sure of the committee and it seemed that he must have been convinced that they were spokesmen for the community.</span>

He had seen people in small groups of 12 to 15 and told them of the terms of the Government’s offer. He had done his best to explain the contents and effect of the quittance, and what he said, namely that the Ilois would be giving up through the quittances any rights to seek compensation or to return to BIOT, was translated into Creole, although he could not assess how accurately. He agreed that it was part of his task to explain the quittances and to ensure that those who signed them understood them. He had not been able to give legal advice or in the time available to explain what the rights to compensation or the right to return to BIOT actually were. He did not elaborate on those claims although their nature would have been explained, and he did not advise on the merits of the offer. It would not have been practical to take statements or instruction from each family. He spent over an hour talking to each group because there had to be an address followed by a translation. They would confirm their willingness to accept the offer by signing or putting a thumbprint on the quittance. At the start of each document were the parts which his wife and he had asked each individual to complete, explaining what their circumstances were in order to see whether they qualified for the offer. They were dealt with individually in relation to that part of the document which contained individual questions relating to their qualification for the offer. He had worked at this for seven to eight long consecutive days.</span>

However, he agreed that the Ilois were quite capable of making their views known, campaigning about it and indeed had rejected an earlier offer of £1/2m.

He could not remember the Resettlement Board set up in 1970 nor being a member of it. He said that Mr Sheridan had spoken to his group about the 1979 offer and explained that there was a requirement for claims to be renounced. Accordingly, they had told him that they could not take that decision on their own and so arranged a hall and invited people to come where Mr Sheridan explained the position. Mr Ramdass said that those who heard of the proposal were very annoyed about it and no one agreed with it. This was scarcely consistent with Mr Sheridan’s evidence that 1,200 quittances had been signed, in his view voluntarily, and that there had been no demur from Mr Ramdass’ committee when he spoke to them about it in advance. At another point in his evidence he said that he was unable to remember Mr Sheridan coming with a second offer or that a new committee had been established before that by Mrs Alexis. He said that he did not know whether the offer of £1.25m was for Vencatessen alone or for all the Ilois. His group had not agreed with the renunciation of rights but he also said he did not know what conditions had been attached or whether it had been a condition of the offer that the Ilois could no longer sue. He simply repeated that the Ilois did not agree with renunciation of rights. He denied that there had been any discussion with him or any explanation about what was being renounced.</span>

He agreed that Mr Sheridan had told the committee that his offer had a renunciation of rights attached but he said that Mr Sheridan had always been speaking in English. When pressed, he accepted that there had been a translation but he then said that he did not know that for the offer to be accepted all the Ilois had to accept it. He denied helping Sheridans to get the renunciations signed or to arrange for the Ilois to come and meet him and he said that it was just a small number of people who came who disagreed with the proposal. He said in response to the existence of 1,200 signatures that people did not understand what renouncing rights meant. His committee had not been in favour of accepting the offer.

Certain politicians in Mauritius were concerned that if the Ilois renounced their right to return to Diego Garcia, Mauritius would have a weakened argument for the return of the islands. To that extent, their national interests and those of the Ilois were in harmony. The MMM, the opposition party in which Mr Berenger was a leading light, claimed some influence in persuading the Ilois to reject the abandonment of their rights as proposed by Mr Sheridan - as it was seen by some. Questions were asked in the Mauritius Parliament about the Government’s attitude towards this particular condition – it saw it as a matter for the Ilois. It was questioned too about the assistance which it had provided to Mr Sheridan. The Guardian reported on his visit; he told it that the committee which he had spoken to on his arrival had accepted the terms without demur, that the response from the Ilois had initially been so overwhelmingly favourable that he had had to prevent some coming in, so as to have some order to the meetings.

The petition said that it came from the former inhabitants of the Chagos. It was typed and in English. It said: "</span>

The letter referred to the difficulties in working out how many Ilois there were to be compensated, partly because this included those who had worked on the Chagos for a long time. The 800 signatures constituted a majority of the Ilois because it was more than half of 1,200, which was the number of quittances which Mr Sheridan had obtained. But they recognised that there must be considerably more Ilois than that. It was signed by those over 18. The reason why others had not signed it was that it had been collected in rather a hurry; going from door to door was a long drawn out job and they did not manage to get around to everyone, particularly those who lived in more isolated parts of Mauritius, and the weather had been terrible.</span>

When she had told the Ilois who had signed the forms what was on them (which means that she must have found out), they were very angry because they had never imagined that Mr Sheridan would make them do that. Mr Mundil had translated Mr Sheridan’s reply but said that he had not told them that it said that the British Government wanted two things in return for compensation, one of which was a renunciation of the right to return to the islands.

She was either unable to focus on the question because her memory was bad or she knew well enough the general thrust of what was being sought by the Ilois in 1980 but did not now want to acknowledge it. There is evidence that she had denounced the petition in 1980 because its signatories were unaware of its purport, which would mean that she at least had been aware of it.

It pointed out that of the 557 families registered in 1977, more than 300 had said that they would prefer a house to cash compensation. It referred to the difficulty in establishing the relevant numbers of Ilois: one survey carried out by Public Assistance Officers every time a group landed supported a figure of 426 families arriving since 1965, the same figure as arrived at by Mr Prosser; the second survey, under the aegis of the Resettlement Committee in January 1977, after a press, radio and TV campaign asking displaced persons to register, arrived at 557 families. This comprised 1,068 adults and 1,255 children. The numbers who actually received compensation were slightly different, perhaps due in part to the passage of time between the survey and payment in March 1968. The 557 families included 150 people who had arrived before 1965, and from the survey this would have been at least 113 families.</span>

They had removed references to the islanders promising never to return to the island, but thought that they would probably concede that they had no intention of returning while it was in defence use. Sheridans sent a letter to the JIC saying that those references had been removed and seeking instructions on the deed which related to the offer of £1.25m. On 16</span>

According to the press, this Front included the MMM, PSM, the JIC and nine others. Its aim was to obtain more compensation without foregoing any rights to return or affecting Mauritius’ claims to the Chagos; it intended to mobilise national and international opinion. It was to examine the work of the new Government established Ad Hoc Committee dealing with resettlement as well as seeking a second round of compensation. In December 1980, Mr Ramdass wrote to Mr Sheridan saying that he did not know why the CIOF had split from the JIC and gone its own way.</span>

He was not sure whether the Vencatessen case had been a way of putting pressure on the British Government. He denied that they had ever sought publicity for their cause. He complained that Mr Mundil had spoken in their name, without telling them, but also denied that Mr Mundil had gone as their interpreter.

I reject as incredible the idea that in 1979 and 1980, he had no idea what were the basic requirements for a settlement, as relayed to his group by Mr Sheridan. Likewise, I regard as incredible his contention that he had no idea what was in the letters or petition which were organised by the JIC. Mrs Alexis had denounced the petition saying that people had not understood what was in it. There is nothing to suggest that Mr Ramdass was surprised at what had been done in his name in 1980. It was all of a piece with what had happened in 1979. It is difficult to see how he could only have found out about the contents of the letters in court, in the light of his witness statement or in the light of his answer that he had begun to distance himself from Mr Mundil because Mr Mundil had betrayed them. He could not remember the manner in which he was saying he had been betrayed. Mr Ramdass said also in his evidence that he could no longer understand all the letters that were written relating to his group and over his name, in which negotiations leading to a final settlement had been discussed, because he was now too old. That may be the explanation but it does not add to the reliability of his evidence.</span>

By the end of August, Mr Vencatessen pressed for his action to proceed in accordance with a letter of instructions from the JIC. This sought £8m in compensation and no renunciation of the right to return. This would bring pressure to bear on the UK; legal and political pressure would go together.

There was the possibility of a breach of contract claim against Chagos Agalega Company Limited but there was not likely to be any such claim in respect of the distribution of the £650,00; he drew attention to the limitation period. He thought that if the Ilois could be shown to have had land rights, there might be a trust based action and that a claim based on possible land rights, the nature of which was then unclear, provided the most promising line of investigation. He also advised that there would be a serious defect in the law if the Ilois could be expelled without legal redress and that a Court would be sympathetic to a claim alleging intimidation, wrongful imprisonment and assault. It would be difficult to argue that the creation of BIOT itself was unlawful but that if there had been any deception about the nature of the interest which the USA had, that might found an action by the Mauritius Government, the proceeds of which might be held in trust for the Ilois. He concluded that it was political pressure which gave the Ilois the most hope for although it would be easy to show that the Government had behaved badly, he could not say that it would be possible to frame an action which would be taken seriously in the Courts, which ought to be the High Court rather than BIOT Courts for maximum potential political impact.</span>

The papers include an undated petition signed by the group of 426 and of 516 (942) led by Mrs Velloo and Mr Raphael Piron which would share the £3.1m made up of twice £1.25m and twice £300,000. She thought that the payment of compensation to those who left the Chagos after 1965 had been delayed by the overall politicisation of the Ilois around Mrs Alexis, according to a note of a meeting which she had with the High Commissioner in February 1982, (9/1762). Some of the political arguments raised at various times went beyond sovereignty and the creation of BIOT, to the associated militarisation of the Indian Ocean as it was seen.</span>

They could advance from the £1m disbursed in 1978 (£650,000 plus accrued interest) to £4m with a further £3m; anything less would not be acceptable to the Mauritius Government; if necessary it could go to an additional £4m but the last million was only to be offered if really pressed. It should be maintained that only 400 families were eligible but that the Mauritius Government and the Ilois could decide how to distribute it. FCO research produced a paper showing that the total population of the Chagos of all nationalities up to 1964 did not exceed 1000 or so, and the figure of 2867 relied on by the Ilois was grossly excessive. The Prosser figure of 1150 Ilois or 426 families was too high (although those figures do not include any Ilois who were outside the Chagos at any one time but were intending to return). There was a briefing on the fracturing and fractiousness of the Ilois groups, (19A/B/16). Nearer the time of the talks, more extensive briefing papers were prepared, one theme of which was the need to ensure that there would be no further litigation if an agreement were reached and another was the use of the figure of households (426) which emerged from the Prosser report, as the least unreliable of the many figures which had emerged. This would affect the calculation of compensation but not necessarily the way in which any sum was in fact distributed. The sum of £2.5m, based on 426 households, would involve the complete acceptance of Mauritius Government figures for housing and land costs and almost complete acceptance of Ilois figures for family businesses and collective needs. This offer would replace the £1.25m plus £300,000 and would bring the total compensation including the £650,000 to £3m+.</span>

Shortly after, he also reported that Mr Michel had presented a petition of 1,100 signatures to the Prime Minister of Mauritius calling for the Government to pay for Bindmans to fly to Mauritius to advise on the settlement of the Ilois claims, which it did. Their role was to represent the Ilois through the CIOF, according to Mr Grosz, although, in re-examination, he said he regarded himself as advising only the CIOF. I do not think that in 1982 he drew that distinction. He thought the CIOF and he represented the Ilois, in my view. It makes no sense for the delegates to be representative of an unknown, let alone insignificant, number of Ilois. The CIOF had made the running; if they were satisfied, who could be dissatisfied apart from those who would have settled earlier, for less? He had been told by Mr Michel that the CIOF represented the overwhelming majority of Ilois but he himself had seen no proof of that beyond its representation on the delegation. He did not have such reservations as he expressed in re-examination at the time, in my view. He had no specific instructions but his impression from Elie and Sylvio Michel was that if the money were sufficient, the Ilois would renounce damages claims and put the right to return into cold storage for an indefinite period. The UK Government wanted to wash its hands of the business of the Ilois.</span>

The UK Government accepted no legal responsibility for the Ilois who left BIOT after its creation. The offer was made ex gratia and in a spirit of goodwill and no attempt had been made to evaluate the different heads of claim. It was made to enable them to settle with land, a house and money to start a business together with community facilities. The Government considered that 426 was the best figure to take for households who left BIOT as a direct result of its creation and those who left before November 1965 did not do so as a result of the UK Government’s acts. The number of those temporarily away would not significantly alter that figure. Accordingly, the offer of £2.5m or £5,800 per family was put on the table. He also said that the Government was prepared to forego the requirement for individual Ilois to sign quittances provided that the terms of the agreement were incorporated into an inter-governmental agreement which would provide for the establishment of a Trust Fund; this would be the best way of ensuring that the money was used for the proper purposes. This agreement would provide for all claims against the UK Government to be renounced or withdrawn. A slightly different version from the Brief, (19A/B/62), which probably reflects what was actually said, refers to the need for the Vencatessen case also to be withdrawn. An agreement was tabled. The two London lawyers sat with the Mauritian delegation. The negotiations were conducted in English; there was no official translation.</span>

Lord Carrington had previously written to him asking for his support for Sir Leonard. It was then pointed out by the Mauritius Government Ministers present that they did not accept the figure of 426 as appropriate but the Sir Leonard said that £6m was out of the question. The offer of £3m was leaked to the press, notwithstanding pleas at the session for it to be confidential. Mr Allen was critical of these private meetings of which the Ilois were unaware. I see nothing objectionable in them. The negotiations were not exclusively direct negotiations between the Ilois and the UK Government.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It appears from these telegrams that the next day’s negotiations focussed not on the households but on the global sum; the Mauritius Government offered £1m by way of land to which the UK delegation responded by increasing its offer by £1m so as to make £5m (£4m from the United Kingdom) in total in addition to the £650,000. A post negotiation report, (19A/B/84), said that Mr Mundil’s efforts to press for more had been foiled. The UK delegation stance was that it was for the Ilois to decide how the money was to be distributed. The delegation’s lawyer met with Mr Grosz and Mr MacDonald in the afternoon to go through the trust fund arrangements. He is reported to have told them of the need for the Vencatessen case to be withdrawn and for an indemnity to be provided against other claims. Mr Grosz said that Mr MacDonald had said that the Ilois would need to give practical assurances that they were not going to bring claims about the right to travel to Diego Garcia. He confirmed that the need for all claims, including Vencatessen’s, to be withdrawn was a key point which would have been explained and translated to the Ilois delegates or to the whole Mauritian delegation. He said in re-examination that he could not form a view as to how much they understood. However, he never gave any indication that he had remotely formed the view in 1982 that they had failed to understand what was being said. In private, Mr Purryag explained the difficulties which a renunciation of rights to return and a Government indemnity would pose for the Mauritius Government, which was then facing a general election. Mr Grosz said that he had noted Mr MacDonald advised the delegation that the withdrawal of claims would be difficult to enforce and, as an inter-governmental agreement, it could not bind the Ilois.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> March and solutions were debated. The Mauritius Government was also concerned about a clause in the draft agreement which could be interpreted as giving up its claims to sovereignty. The details of the discussions on the agreement, as set out in those telegrams, show that the concern about the indemnity from the Government was proposed by the Ilois (or at least their lawyers) and by the Mauritians to be met by individual renunciations, (19A/B67 and 73). This would protect the Mauritius Government in relation to its indemnity. This was thought to be as satisfactory as it could be, if coupled with the retention of £0.25m in the trust fund until the end of 1985 to be used as a source of funds for an indemnity against other claims being brought, for example by those who refused to sign a renunciation. The end of 1985 was thought to represent a point after which the limitation period would provide protection. In practice, the best protection was that the Ilois were apparently ready to initial the agreement with its provisions for individual renunciations, which the Mauritius Government envisaged would be signed at the first distribution of funds and which it was willing to undertake to procure, motivated by their acceptance of the obligation to indemnify the UK against further claims. It was recognised, at least internally by the UK delegation, that there was no hope of getting the Ilois to abandon claims to return to BIOT. Mr Grosz recollected a lawyers’ meeting at which the terms of the Agreement, including individual renunciations, were discussed. But he did not think Article 4 was actually in the Agreement before he left, although it was certainly in at some point on 24</span>

All drafts had, however, referred to full and final settlement of all Ilois claims and Mr Grosz said that that had been understood. There was, he said, no point in an agreement with the British if the Ilois were unhappy with it.</span>

The Mauritius delegation received advice from both its Law Officers and from the three lawyers advising the Ilois. The telegrams and the post negotiation report both state that the UK delegation wanted its position made clear to the Ilois in Creole so that there was no misunderstanding that this would be a sticking point for the UK and if it were persisted in would lead to the end of the negotiations; it was a political gambit irrelevant to their need for compensation. After several hours, a solution was reached by which Ilois claims arising out of the creation of BIOT would be precluded but not those which Mauritius might have.</span>

They again sat around like dolls not knowing what was being talked about. However, she said they refused to accept that some form of release should be given. She said the solution was that a sum of money would be kept to compensate the British Government in case Chagossians initiated claims against the British Government within the first five years after the compensation was paid. Things were only explained in Creole after the negotiations were finished. Only Mr Bacha explained in Creole what had happened; Mr Mundil explained nothing because he had come only for his own personal interests; Mr Michel explained nothing. She only could remember that Mr Bacha had told her they would get £4m and the Mauritian Government would give £1m for land. He also explained that if anyone brought a case in five years against the British Government, money had been held back against that. The agreement was never summarised or translated to her and she said that if Article 4 had been explained there would have been big trouble. Mr Bacha never said that the British Government would pay only £4m and that there would be no more than that. She did not know whether Mr Bacha might have hidden things from her. She was unaware that there was any requirement in the Agreement that the Chagossians renounce their rights to get money from the ITFB. She said that she did not know that the Vencatessen case was being discussed at the time of the 1982 Agreement or at that time that it would have to be withdrawn; it was only afterwards that that was mentioned. She could not remember putting her thumbprint to the Agreement.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In cross-examination, Mrs Alexis explained a little more about what happened in 1982. She said that in the 1982 negotiations there were meetings between the two delegations and among the Mauritius delegates themselves to decide what to say. Her committee had meetings all the time to decide what to do but not during the negotiations. They had had no meetings with Mr Berenger during the negotiations. She could not remember Mr MacDonald and Mr Grosz being there when they had discussions as a group of Ilois or delegates. She said that all the Mauritius delegates spoke Creole but there were times when they spoke in English. She was then very evasive about why she made no efforts to find out what was being said in English of those who could speak English. She asked rhetorically of whom she could have asked. She said that Mr Mundil was not part of it at that time, in the sense he was not part of the committee and she did not work with him. She asked Mr Bacha during the negotiations but they were just sitting like dolls and were only told things after the negotiations were over. They just told them things were in order so that they could be finished with the Ilois more quickly. She said she had asked Mr Bacha what was being said before the end of negotiations but it is possible that he did not tell them what was being said.

She was President of the CIOF and no shrinking violet. She agreed that the Ilois wanted their representatives to have full authority. She explained that she could not remember an opening statement by the British nor what their first offer was and explained that she had not asked because she said they did not have the right, although they were members of the delegation, to ask because they were too insignificant.

She knew that there was a condition in the Agreement requiring money to be put into a fund because Mr Bacha told her, but they did not ask him any questions because they had no right to do so. This was in answer to the question about what steps she had taken to find out what the Agreement contained so she could tell the Ilois. The Ilois had no right to do anything and Mr Michel, who could not read or write, was not in a position to ask Mr Bacha either. She did not remember a communiqué issued by the delegations and she did not know that anything ever had been said about full and final settlement. She would never accept a final settlement.

Once again, the answer to the questions trailed off into nothingness. She said that it was the Governments who decided to keep the money in the fund; that they had kept some aside in case anyone should bring a case against them and then that it had to be kept for five years and that it could not have been released early if the Ilois had signed renunciation forms.</span>

Even £8m could not be final, and he was not aware that the CIOF were looking for £6m, or any final settlement. He accepted that Vencatessen would not be paid twice over and would only get money from the ITFB and that was all the other Ilois were going to get. He knew the English in 1982 had wanted the Agreement to be final but he said it was not part of the Ilois’ intention. He appeared to think that if there had been another case that would have yielded another large sum of money in order for that to be withdrawn. I asked him why if he thought that was so, there were not more cases, but he said they did not have other people to take the action. They needed someone to encourage them and it was only now that they had the right kind of support.

Her sister had not told her about the visit to England in 1981, because they did not have enough contact even though they both lived in Roche Bois. It was possible, she said, that her sister had been a prominent member of the CIOF but she did not read the papers often. She could not read in French. She then said that she was aware that they had gone in 1981 to negotiate with the UK Government and that Mrs Naick was in the 1982 delegation. They had never talked about the Agreement, but she remembered that there had been an agreement with the British Government giving £4m and the Mauritius Government £1m of land for which the ITFB was responsible. She was asked whether the payment was intended to represent settlement of the Ilois claims for compensation. By this time she was aware of the dangerous path the questions were going down and started laughing at the questions. She said that because the money was not enough she did not think that it was final. She was asked again, not having answered clearly, whether the £4m had been intended to be final. "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">" she said. The question was repeated followed by silence. Now she said she understood that the question was whether the agreement was final. There was an agreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid: that was the £4m. She remembered there was a claim for £8m in 1981 and after negotiations broke down the Ilois made a further demand asking for compensation. But she could not remember any of those negotiations, although she was still a supporter at that time of the CIOF, which was represented on the 1981 negotiations. She then said she did not know that there had been any delegation to Mauritius from Britain to negotiate claims in 1982. I gained the impression that she understood the questions before they were translated on a number of occasions and anticipated the problems that were coming up. She then said that she knew there was an agreement in Mauritius between the two Governments because the British Government delegation had come to Mauritius to reach an agreement. She said that she could not remember if it was intended to be a final settlement. She agreed that £250,000 was kept in reserve to meet a claim against the British Government, that the money could be released if no claims were brought, and released early if all the Ilois promised not to sue the British and that the Mauritius Government had to do its best to get the Ilois to sign the forms not to sue the British Government. Her evidence on this changed later – she said she did not know that. She was unaware of any meeting in April to tell the Ilois about the Agreement but agreed there were many meetings and that it probably had been explained. She said she only discovered the terms when she was on the ITFB in 1983.</span>

I considered that Mr Bancoult was very reluctant to give straight answers to obvious questions about what the Chagossians thought was going on and about what interest they took in the progress of the Agreement and its purport. He said that the Ilois had wanted to be paid compensation without conditions. They had not just agreed because they were poor. He said that nobody had agreed to renounce their rights but they would have wanted to know if there were conditions attached to the payment of the money. He was unaware that there had been a debate associated with the negotiations about whether the Agreement in effect required the Mauritius Government to give up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. He did not know that the money to be paid was in full and final settlement of claims or that the aim of the UK Government was that the Ilois would not be able to claim any more from it. He did not know of the terms of the Agreement, and sometimes he did not have enough money to buy a paper, so he was not aware of the communiqué in which both Governments said that £4m was in full and final settlement; the term "</span>

It had not been said that the 1982 Agreement required them to renounce their rights and there was a protest when Mr Berenger said they had to renounce their rights; all that was said was that part of the money would be kept back until 1985 if anyone decided to sue the British Government or the ITFB. The Ilois had agreed to nothing in the 1982 Agreement, and the payment did not discharge any obligations owed to the Ilois. They were free at any time after 1985 to bring proceedings for more money, he thought, and the people on the delegation never told the Ilois that they would not be able to sue the British Government again. He thought that the Government required the withdrawal of the claim before it paid £4m because there were people outside the scope of the Agreement who wanted compensation. But he could not answer why he thought the British Government might pay £4m and still leave themselves open to being sued by Mr Vencatessen.</span>

From that moment there was intense pressure brought to bear on his father. His house was surrounded, people threatened to beat his father up, he could not go out and had a police escort for 17 days. Up till that moment his father had not known that he would have to withdraw his case in order for the £4m to be paid. Later Mr Vencatessen said that it was thanks to his father that all the negotiations had started and that he had wanted money for his case and the thanks of the Ilois. With those, he would have been happy to withdraw. But Mr Vencatessen said that the Ilois did not want to wait while his father got his money, which they thought was holding matters up.</span>

She went to see Mr Bacha who said it was necessary for the case to be withdrawn in order for the Chagossians to get their money; she had pestered him, so Mr Bacha had sent the police to bring Mr Vencatessen to the Government offices from his home. She said that he was forced to withdraw his case but if he had not withdrawn it, the Ilois would have attacked his house and smashed it down. Then she said that she did not know whether the money could be paid to the Ilois before the case had been withdrawn. No one told her that it had to be withdrawn at the time of the Agreement. It was the English, she knew, who required the case to be withdrawn because Mr Bacha said so and that the English would not give the money otherwise.

When asked why she thought the Mauritius Government was insisting that the case be withdrawn, she said that that was so that they could get a bit of the money for themselves because they were always torturing the Chagossians, then, so that all the money would go into the hands of the Mauritius Government, which could have then said untruthfully that it had gone to the ITFB. </span>

It was eventually agreed in the ITFB that there would be a first payment in December to each individual Ilois of Rs 10,000 in cash. There would be a list of Ilois posted and objections could be raised to names on the list and to those omitted from it. They would attend with a birth certificate and would be identified by an Ilois.

Mrs Alexis was its first President (though her witness statement had not said so). Mr Bancoult and Mrs Talate were involved in setting it up. Mr Bancoult said that it was necessary because Mauritian politicians and intellectuals had betrayed them. His evidence about that was unsatisfactory. The CRG would be Chagossians helping themselves, he said. There had been some claims that the Ilois could regard themselves as refugees, although the aim of the compensation as seen by both Governments had been to enable them to integrate into Mauritius. It petitioned the ITFB on various issues. It wanted to examine the lists of Ilois eligible for compensation to see if there were ineligible or even dead people included. The CRG expressed disagreement with those on the list and the ITFB responded in August by saying that 1,260 Ilois had registered in 1982 plus 96 who were latecomers, or away abroad or working on boats, but that the CRG could send the names of those who should not be there for investigation.

He could not remember the ins and outs of the Ilois being elected to the ITFB over time. He said of the 1982 Agreement that the English had said that they would pay no more than £4m in English, so that he would not understand what they were saying. When pressed as to whether the English had said that no more money would be paid, he said he did not remember. It was a long time ago, however, that he realised that there had been one condition to the Agreement, there would be no more money. In re-examination, he said that Father Patient had just translated the preamble as Mr Allen quoted the agreement to him to see how much had been known. Nor had the Mauritius Government explained it to the Ilois. </span>

Always, he agreed, the English had insisted on the withdrawal of their case. He did not remember the suspension of payments or an emergency meeting of the ITFB. He heard nothing about Mr Berenger saying to Mrs Alexis that there could be no question of the Ilois not signing the renunciation forms after the issue had been raised in the ITFB. There had been no mention about renunciation of rights when the distribution of the Rs 8,000 was announced on the radio. He said they always had to sign to say that they had received the money. There had always been a witness to the receipt of ITFB money. Identity cards were required because they thought they had noticed fraud, and they were required to be shown when the Rs 36,000 for land was paid over. Nonetheless, he said that Mrs Kattick and he were witnesses for the people whom they knew when they came to collect their money. People did not read the paper; they were called to put their thumbprint on it. No one translated them. No one had told him what the documents were. It was not significant to him that there were two forms to sign. People would have reacted very unfavourably to any suggestion that they should give up their rights for Rs 8,000. He thought the ITFB had betrayed them. As soon as anybody had been aware that the forms involved renunciation, he said that they would not have signed such a thing, but he did not remember what happened when Francois Louis came to collect his Rs 8,000 or that Simon Vencatessen had not agreed to sign his form. He said that he had withdrawn from the ITFB because there was fraud on it, in the form of adding names of people who had died to the lists of Ilois to get money. He did not raise these matters with the Board because the people doing this were very violent and it was people on the ITFB itself who added the names of the dead people. He then said that he could not say who the violent people were because it was delicate and there were some he did not know. They did not include Mr Simon Vencatessen, Francois Louis or most of the other names put to him who were Mauritians or non-Ilois. He was prepared to say that it could have been Mrs Kattick or Mrs Alexis because he knew that she had been jailed for such a fraud, and Mrs Naick. He was clearly in some anxiety as he spoke of these things.</span>

It was only some time after that he realised what had happened.

He also disagreed with the others over the distribution of land. He was already in 1983 of the view that they had been victims of Mauritian intellectuals. He heard no mention while he was a member of the ITFB of any discussions about renunciation forms or the preparation of renunciation forms, but he later said that he had heard renunciation forms mentioned at the ITFB. This had made him angry and he had said that they would not sign away their rights and that this was not something the ITFB should be doing. Legal advice had supported him in saying that the ITFB was not responsible for implementing Article 4 of the 1982 Agreement.

Great care would be taken with the welfare of the few local inhabitants which would be discussed with those governments.

The Committee of 24 in 1972 condemned the evacuation of people of Seychellois origin from the Chagos to make way for a UK/US base, but the BIOT inhabitants were not mentioned in the omnibus resolution adopted by the General Assembly. The same pattern followed in 1973, with the further evacuations being condemned by the Committee of 24. Nothing of further significance was discussed. The return of Aldabra, Desroches and Farquhar to the Seychelles on independence was noted.</span>

She said that after she had heard the word mentioned at the Board, she took a delegation to meet Mr Berenger to tell him that she had heard talk of renunciation at that meeting. That was when she first learnt of them. Mr Berenger had said that it did not matter. She did not know at the time of the agreement that the Mauritius Government had to try to get the Ilois to sign such forms and no Ilois representative had suggested that such forms should be signed. She remembered that there had been a conversation in the ITFB about unblocking the £250,000 even if there were only a small number of Ilois who had not signed the renunciation forms. She said that her head would sometimes spin at the Trust Fund meetings. She did not always keep a close eye on what was being discussed.

She agreed she knew that a sum had to be kept in reserve but said that she did not know that it could be released early if all the Ilois signed such forms. There was a difficult passage of questions in which she first said that she had not known, then answered several times that she had never known and did not know that the £250,000 could be released early if all the Ilois signed renunciation forms but she then said that she knew that in 1984. She said that the CIOF had not had lawyers to help it. She denied knowing that minutes were kept of the ITFB meetings and approved at the next meeting, or that they were kept in Creole and English. She could not remember proposing a change to the minutes or seconding their adoption as is shown in minutes of the ITFB on occasions. She said she agreed things were put down on paper but she did not know what it was. She could not remember the President of the ITFB reading out the minutes at the start of the meeting. She then agreed that sometimes her group would look carefully at the minutes including Olivier Bancoult but sometimes there were English words he got stuck on. Sometimes the minutes of the previous meeting were read at the start of the next meeting, she eventually agreed. She had said that she had sat like a doll saying nothing.</span>

She said that she had never heard Mr Berenger say that the money could not be released because there were not enough forms signed and he would never have said that in front of the Ilois. It was difficult to make sure that Mrs Alexis had understood the question. She then said after repetition that she did not remember any discussion about the release of money being prevented because a handful of Ilois had not signed renunciation forms or a discussion about a different form. She then said she remembered raising the question of whether the £250,000 plus interest should be kept separately. The minutes show that this happened at the same meeting as the renunciation forms were discussed, but she said that she did not remember renunciation forms being discussed.

She had not been told what they were renouncing and she had not asked him what was in the form and had only found out in court. There would have been a big war in Mauritius, she said, if the Chagossians had been known to have renounced their rights. All the Ilois leaders would have done the same. She would have expected Ilois leaders, Mr Michel and Mr Ramdass to tell the Ilois about it. No-one told her of any problems with the forms. But none of them knew what they were signing.

The money was simply to be used if anybody sued the English and that was the money which the Ilois were trying to unblock before the five years were up. She said there was a fear that people from outside Mauritius, such as the Seychelles or France or England, would make a claim because there were claims from there, because she imagined families had written to them. I asked her whether what the British Government wanted, in order to unblock the money early, was an assurance that there would be no further claims. She said that so long as they lived they had to claim their rights. It was too small a sum to be compensation. She did not know what would make the British Government unblock it before the five years were up, nor what the Ilois had to do to persuade them to release it early. She was asked what arguments she had used, but no sensible answer emerged other than that they would be completely unmoveable. She said that she did not know whether she had been keen to get the money released early. Nobody had known that it was in full and final settlement. She could not remember asking the Americans for £4m on top of the £4m given by the British Government. She said nobody had ever thought of asking the Americans or writing to the President or the American Embassy. She then appeared to remember later that they had made a request for £4m to the Americans because they were desperate. She agreed that whilst she was on the ITFB they had never made another demand for £4m from the British Government.</span>

I formed the strong impression that he was well aware of the problems created by the 1982 agreement, the renunciation form, the lack of subsequent action by the Chagossians against the British Government and the level of public knowledge of what had happened. He could read English and it is not credible that he was unaware of the content of all of the letters which were sent from the CRG or on which his name appeared. It is not credible, having concluded that they were being betrayed in 1983, that he was not subsequently on his guard against politicians or non-Ilois.</span>

Later, she agreed that there was still money for the ITFB to distribute when she joined and that there were disputes about it. When she had been in the ITFB there had been a dispute about £250,000 because the British Government would not agree to release it because the renunciation forms were not signed, although she said it was never explained that they had to be signed.

She was clearly having difficulty over what she knew at the time when the renunciation forms were signed and what she subsequently knew when she was on the ITFB. The ITFB meetings were in Creole, she said, after Mr Bancoult told them to speak Creole. I asked on a number of occasions why she thought that the English Government would not release the money, but her answers always related to what she had been told or understood at the time when the renunciation forms were signed. I found it impossible to get any closer to her understanding of the position in 1984 and 1985. This was when she was on the ITFB and that issue was being discussed.</span>

There were reports that a lawyer, Serge Perrault who was the CRG’s adviser, was going to London to discuss this with Sheridans. Others applied for a like passport. Their endeavours were publicised again in August.

He was asked about a CRG letter in late November 1985 to the UN Secretary General, (19A/E/27), which referred to the successful campaign to be recognised as British citizens, the 1982 agreement being reached under duress and the violation by the United Kingdom of their human rights. He said that the signature was not his. He said that it was only from the time at which they started a case here, that they had launched a campaign for equal rights with other citizens. It was, however, perfectly clear from the other answers which he had given, that that was the complaint which had been made since at least 1985. It had not been a complaint that they had not been British citizens. It was quite apparent that he was using that answer to avoid answering the questions, which he knew were coming, about what the Group knew about British citizenship. It had been pointed out to him that the Particulars of Claim said that it had been deliberately concealed from the Claimants that they were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. He eventually agreed that they had been after the same advantages as other British citizens. He said Mr Perrault himself did try to obtain those advantages for them but then added it was something that he did on his own account.

He was sent the advice of Mr MacDonald, the Permal decision, the renunciation forms and relevant statutory material. The instructions refer to the rights which the Ilois might have in respect of their compulsory removal from the Chagos, but the problems of legislation and of limitation were referred to. The question of the renunciation forms was raised. The Ilois were said to have signed them when they could not read them and had had no explanation of the contents; many thought that they were only renouncing their right to return for five years. They were also interested in what rights they might have to return when the islands were returned to Mauritius and whether Mauritius could legitimately demand renunciation forms as a result of the 1982 agreement.</span>

The legal issues which he examined were whether the Ilois had any rights arising out of their compulsory removal from the Chagos, whether the ITFB acted properly in requiring renunciation forms, what the effect was of those forms, and whether those who had not signed such forms and had received no compensation had any enforceable rights, particularly of return. As to the first, a number of jurisdictional problems were considered but Professor Bradley concluded that proceedings in respect of the events of 1968-1973 would now be time barred. As to the second, he concluded that the 1982 agreement did not of itself take away any rights which the Ilois might have had against the UK Government, but that the </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">decision meant that a statutory alternative to a claim against the UK Government had been provided; this did not have the effect of barring claims against the Mauritius Government. He then considered claims to return; in order to justify a refusal to allow the Ilois to return, the BIOT Commissioner would have to rely on the Immigration Ordinance of 1971, and he touched upon the validity of that Ordinance and its "</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">powers as he saw them. But he did not suggest that it was ultra vires. He concluded that the renunciation forms would not provide a defence to all possible claims which might be covered by its very wide wording and that there were arguments which might be mounted to overcome any effect which they might have, such as mistake, duress and unconscionability. However, the Ilois "</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">today could not sue in respect of wrongful acts committed 10 or 20 years ago</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">". Those who had received no compensation and had signed no renunciation forms and those who had, if those forms were ineffective, could assert a right to return and maintain proceedings but the difficulty would be to overcome the 1971 Ordinance. International law remedies were addressed but held out little hope. More research might be valuable. </span>

In November 1997 there was an exchange of correspondence between Jeanette Alexis on behalf of the Chagos Social Committee in Seychelles and the High Commission there, which referred to some 200 Ilois deported from Chagos. The High Commission denied that there was any compensation due to any Seychellois because they had all been on terminable work contracts and there was no possibility of their returning to Chagos. The correspondence from the High Commission pointed out that the British passport holders were citizens of the British dependent territories and had no right of abode either in the UK or automatically in the dependent territory of which they were citizens. That depended on the immigration policy of that territory. It also said that the majority of those returning to Seychelles were contract labourers returning home and that the structural problems which were faced in Mauritius did not arise in the Seychelles. There was no infrastructure which would permit a return to the Islands and there was no commercially viable prospect of establishing a community. This debate continued into the spring of 1998.

He said that nobody had brought proceedings after the expiry of the five years, which he thought was the period that had to elapse without cases being brought before the £250,000 would be paid out, because Mr Mandarin, another lawyer, was striving to get into negotiations but unfortunately nothing came of it. It was a long process for Mr Ramdass to grapple with the question about whether the Ilois could ask the British Government for more, after the £4m had been paid. He thought that definitely that could be done but when he was asked why it had not been done, bearing in mind the poverty from which they said they suffered, he said that was a matter for other people but he was tired and had stopped doing it. He said that Mr Mandarin had been trying to arrange negotiations all the time as an Ilois. He agreed that because he had not thought that he had renounced his rights until very recently, he had thought that he had all his rights still left intact. It was extremely difficult to get him to answer the question as to why, if he thought he had not given up his rights until very recently when he discovered what was in the document, no Ilois had brought any proceedings. He answered by saying that nobody had told him that he had given up his rights. He did eventually say that he thought that the Ilois could have brought another case in the same way that Mr Vencatessen had done but Mr Mandarin had failed in his negotiations.</span>

It was about four or five years ago under the CRG that they realised what they could do.

The material relied on in the Bancoult Judicial Review had been drawn almost entirely from public records available after the expiring of the 30-year period, at the Public Record Office. He said that the possibility that the islanders might return one day to the islands had led to the preliminary study prepared by the Defendants and a more detailed preliminary study, Phase 2B, examining the scope for return to the outer islands. The whole case had been about the desire to return to the Chagos Islands. The feasibility of this return was being discussed in late 2002.

Although there was a strong overlap between law and politics, the lawyers who went into politics did not generally practise and because of the mix of law and politics in Mauritius to go to a politician there for legal advice would be unsatisfactory. Even if a politician was able to offer some assistance putting them on the right track as Mr Duval helped Mr Vencatessen, there would be very few lawyers willing to take on a case like this because of its complexity, the poverty of the clients and the strength of the opposition.
