Quite apart from the number of defendants (there were originally some 19 of them), the main part of the trial occupied some 46 hearing days spread over almost 6 months (from June-November 2013) during which the court heard evidence (often with the assistance of interpreters) from over 20 witnesses including some by videolink. </p>

The relevant events cover a wide geographical spread including London, Moscow, Geneva, Spain and Latvia. The allegations (and counterallegations) are wide-ranging and include alleged dishonesty, deceit, conspiracy, fraud, misrepresentation, bribery, forgery, blackmail, money-laundering, false impersonation, intimidation, entrapment, subterfuge, kidnap and even murder. Anyone sitting in court listening to the evidence and the parties’ respective submissions might have been forgiven for supposing that they were in the Old Bailey rather than in the Commercial Court sitting in the Rolls Building. </p>

He was born in 1981 and after working at Web-Invest Bank and then KIT Finance joined Otkritie in 2009 as a director of OB and Head of Fixed Income Trading (“FIT”). He worked at Otkritie’s offices in Moscow until his resignation in September 2011. After the balloon went up in August 2011, Mr Kondratyuk was arrested and charged with certain criminal offences in Switzerland. In the event, he eventually admitted his involvement in the Sign-On Fraud as well as the Argentinean Warrants Fraud; and the claimants settled their claims against him on terms set out in a Settlement Agreement dated 25 January 2013. As part of the settlement, Mr Kondratyuk has returned some of the fraud proceeds totalling approximately US$ 25m. Mr Kondratyuk served a prison sentence in Switzerland for these frauds and was eventually released in April 2013. He has also met with the City of London Police and freely provided them with a full account of what he says was his involvement in the frauds with others.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As part of the settlement, Mr Kondratyuk also agreed to assist the claimants in pursuit of their claims against other parties. Thus it came about that he provided three witness statements and gave evidence in this trial on behalf of the claimants. Such evidence was given by videolink from Paris (pursuant to an earlier order of HH Judge Mackie QC and, after further submissions at the beginning of the trial, reconfirmed by me) in particular because he said that he might be arrested by the authorities here and also feared for his personal safety if he came to England. He was cross-examined over a number of days. In essence, it is his evidence that he participated in the Sign-On Fraud together with Georgy Urumov (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> defendant) and Ruslan Pinaev (the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> defendant); and that all three were also involved in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud together with Yevgueni (Eugene) Jemai (the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> defendant) and Vladimir Gersamia (the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> defendant). The claimants also say that Yulia Balk (the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> defendant and wife of Mr Urumov) was involved in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud. As for the other defendants, it is the claimants’ case that although they were not involved in the actual frauds, they are liable in particular for dishonest assistance or knowing receipt with regard to parts of the fraud proceeds. Plainly, Mr Kondratyuk is a central witness. There is no doubt that the claimants rely heavily upon his evidence in support of their case in these proceedings which evidence, they say, is largely confirmed by other evidence. In any event, the claimants say that their case is established even without Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The defendants all say that Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence can be given no credence whatsoever, in particular because he is a self-confessed liar and fraudster on a grand scale; because he is plainly an individual who used his obvious charisma and outwardly plausible and confident manner to dupe a number of business colleagues and associates; because he is not merely an unreliable witness but someone who is untrustworthy; and because the assistance he has given the claimants by giving evidence against the other defendants is driven by self-interest. In particular, the defendants rely on the fact that even after his arrest, he deliberately lied repeatedly to the Swiss prosecutor. In addition, the defendants say that Mr Kondratyuk lied to the court. Moreover, as appears further below, it is Mr Smith’s submission that Mr Kondratyuk decided falsely to implicate Mr Jemai (and also Jecot S.A. and Ms Jemai) for a number of specific reasons. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, the defendants say that when giving evidence during the trial, Mr Kondratyuk was an evasive and entirely unsatisfactory witness. In particular, Mr Smith submitted that Mr Kondratyuk was evasive in relation to his own assets; that he has a propensity falsely to implicate others; that it is manifest that he deliberately gave false evidence with regard to a number of important matters including, for example, with regard to his share of the fraud proceeds; that his decision to give evidence by videolink (from </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Paris) was plainly tactical and should serve to undermine his credibility; that it seriously slowed down his evidence and meant that he avoided the close scrutiny of the court; that given the <span style="font-style:italic">pentiti </span>nature of the evidence to be given by Mr Kondratyuk his absence from the court room itself was highly unsatisfactory; that the manner in which he gave evidence was indicative of the fact that he was not a witness who was seeking to assist the court in discovering the truth; that he constantly failed or refused to answer even the most straightforward questions; and that his aim was to recite mantras (which he did in a robotic fashion) and to use various tricks to run down the cross-examination clock and to avoid saying anything that was not already contained within his “script” (i.e. the English language statement that had been crafted for him as part of his Settlement Agreement with the claimants). </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At a very late stage of the trial, Mr Smith sought to introduce in evidence further documents which had apparently been recently obtained from Snoras Bank pursuant to a letter of request (the “Snoras documents”) and served late further written submissions in relation thereto. Exceptionally, I permitted the other parties to serve their own written submissions in response which both Mr Peto and Mr Berry did following close of final oral submissions. In essence, Mr Smith and Mr Peto both submitted that the Snoras documents were important because they were probative of a number of matters – and, in particular, undermined Mr Kondratyuk’s credibility. I remain extremely doubtful that it would be proper to admit these further documents in evidence at such a late stage of the trial. Although they were not documents within the possession or control of Mr Jemai and, as I say, obtained by virtue of a letter of request, there was, in my view, no good or sufficient reason why they could not have been obtained at an earlier stage. However, having read the relevant documents and considered the parties’ submissions, it is sufficient to say that they do not, in my view, undermine Mr Kondratyuk’s credibility but that, as submitted by Mr Berry, in certain respects at least, they support Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Be that as it may, I accept that Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence must be approached with very great caution. In particular, it is obvious that he is extremely intelligent (as were many of the other defendants); that he is a charismatic individual with great charm; that he is a self-confessed rogue, fraudster and serial liar; that, even on the basis of his own evidence, he is capable of cunning deception on a large scale; and that his agreement to give evidence against the other defendants may well be driven, at least in part, by self-interest. I also agree that his written statements were most unsatisfactory. In particular, §H1.4 of the Commercial Court Guide expressly provides that if a witness is not sufficiently fluent in English to give his evidence in English, the witness statement should be in the witness’s own language and a translation should be provided. However, although Mr Kondratyuk’s statement was in the English language, it was plain when he gave evidence that he was not fluent in English. Further, I agree that the fact that Mr Kondratyuk gave evidence over some 4 days by videolink was very unsatisfactory particularly since he needed an interpreter (although the latter was unavoidable). Of course, the rules of court provide that in an appropriate case, permission may be granted for the evidence of a witness to be given by videolink; and such an order was made (by, I believe, consent) at a CMC before the trial. However, as noted above, at the beginning of the trial, I revoked that order because, given the central importance of Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence, I considered that it was highly desirable, if possible, for Mr Kondratyuk to give evidence in person – a view which, I should say, was endorsed and supported by Mr Berry on behalf of the claimants. However, in the event, after further consideration, I was satisfied that Mr Kondratyuk’s fear that he might be arrested if he came to England was well-founded or at least could not be eliminated or ignored; that, in those circumstances and for reasons set out in my ruling which I do not propose to repeat, his refusal to attend the trial in person was understandable; and that I should in effect reinstate the earlier order that had been made giving permission for Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence to be given by videolink. Finally, in this context, I also agree that certain parts of Mr Kondratyuk’s oral evidence were perhaps slightly stilted and that he did not always answer the questions put to him squarely. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, notwithstanding all these formidable criticisms and “warning signs”, I am not persuaded that it would be right simply to reject Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence in its entirety. As appears from the rest of this Judgment, I have no doubt that at least certain parts of his evidence are true and support the claimants’ case although I remain far from convinced that certain other parts are true and honest. The difficulty in the present case is that, in my view, all the individual defendants i.e. Mr Urumov, Ms Balk, Mr Pinaev, Ms Kovarska, Mr Gersamia, Mr Gersamia Snr, Mr Jemai and Ms Jemai as well as others (including Mrs Jemai) gave evidence which was dishonest at least in part. In my judgment, the right approach is to consider <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> the evidence with very great caution and scepticism. That is what I have sought to do.  </p>

Mr Urumov was born in 1979 in North Ossetia. However, his secondary education was in Geneva, Switzerland; and he has degrees from the CASS (City) Business School in London and the LSE. He initially worked with Lehman Brothers and in 2005 moved to HSBC. In 2009 he joined Knight Capital Ltd (“Knight”) as Executive Director of the Emerging Markets Fixed Income Desk. By all accounts, he was well known in the industry, a star trader at Knight and extremely successful. At Knight, he was earning approximately US$ 2.5m per annum and, on his own evidence, would have earned between US$ 7m and US$ 10m over the two years of his contract if he had remained at Knight. Ms Balk was born in 1980 in Moscow, Russia. She also went to school in Switzerland and attended the LSE where she met Mr Urumov in 1998. They married almost a decade later in 2007, the plan being (according to her own evidence) for her to work for a short period in mergers and acquisitions after which she would focus on family life and developing her own property development business. After a shortened period of maternity leave, she returned to full time work on 1 October 2010. Denning is a company incorporated in the BVI and beneficially owned by Mr Urumov and Ms Balk. These three defendants were all represented throughout the trial by Farrer &amp; Co and Counsel led by Mr Antony Peto QC with Mr Jonathan McDonagh. </p>

Mr Pinaev was born and brought up in Moscow although he also studied in Switzerland. According to his evidence, he met Mr Urumov and Ms Balk in 2001 while they were all studying in London – and he also obtained a degree from London University. After obtaining a further degree from the Bocconi Institute in Milan, he worked as a derivative trader for Enigma Trading Services Ltd. In 2007, he joined the Ursa Bank in Moscow as CoHead of FIT and then in 2008 joined the Promsvyazbank in Moscow as Head of Eurobonds Trading. Following an approach from Mr Kondratyuk in Spring 2010, he joined Otkritie shortly thereafter as Global Head of Otkritie’s Bank’s Eurobond Trading in which position (according to his own evidence) he expected to earn not less than US$ 5m to US$ 6m per annum. According to his statement, he joined Otkritie in late June/early July 2010. However, his employment contract is dated 25 May 2010 and refers to an employment commencement date of 2 June 2010; and other documents confirm that he was already working at Otkritie by the beginning of June 2010. Ms Kovarska was born in Riga, Latvia. She married Mr Pinaev in 2008. She previously worked at Parex Bank in Latvia until she left in December 2008 at which time she was Deputy Vice President and Deputy Head of the Retail Division. According to her statement, she also had an interest in interior design and property development. Although Mr Pinaev continued to work in Moscow, he and Ms Kovarska bought an apartment in Geneva in May 2010; and from August 2010, she lived in that apartment in Geneva with their two daughters. Rossmore and Pleator are companies incorporated in the BVI and in Panama respectively and are both beneficially owned by Mr Pinaev.  </p>

However, following a judgment I gave at a very late stage of the trial on Day 35 (9 October 2013), Farrer &amp; Co ceased to act for the Pinaev defendants although they (and Mr Peto and Mr McDonagh) continued to act for the Urumov Defendants. Thereafter, Mr Pinaev acted for himself. At one stage, Mr Pinaev indicated his intention to seek an order for permission to represent Pleator and Rossmore; but in the event such application was never pursued. At a late stage (18 October 2013), Ms Kovarska instructed new solicitors, Messrs Cartier &amp; Co, to act on her behalf; and Mr Peto and Mr McDonagh continued to represent her. Even later i.e. on 25 October 2013, Mr Pinaev informed the court that he did not intend to participate actively any further in these proceedings; and that is what happened. </p>

(“Jecot”), which is a Swiss company whose majority shareholder, sole director and controller was at all material times Mr Jemai’s mother, Olessia Jemai. Mr Jemai joined the Moscow Office of Otkritie in mid-August 2010. According to Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence, Mr Jemai had been at school with Mr Pinaev; he (i.e. Mr Jemai) also knew Ms Balk; they were “very close”; and it was Mr Pinaev who persuaded Mr Kondratyuk that Mr Jemai should be recruited by Otkritie. According to Mr Jemai’s evidence, he joined Otkritie as a “trader’s assistant” and thereafter continued in this very minor role - although the claimants say that he was, in fact, a “trader” rather than a mere assistant who was, at the very least, certainly capable of carrying out the necessary tasks to execute the fraudulent trades. According to his evidence, he was the most junior member of the FIT in Moscow although Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence is that he often worked in OSL’s office in London. Mr Jemai was a litigant in person but represented at trial by Mr Ian Smith (on a direct access basis).  </p>

Accordingly, I therefore revoked the order which I had previously made giving Mrs Jemai permission to represent Jecot. It is not clear whether Mrs Jemai ever had authority to act and, in that regard, I should mention that the claimants have reserved their position. In any event, by letter dated 21 October 2013 from the Office des Faillites, Republique et Canton de Geneve (i.e. Bankruptcy Office of Geneva), this court was informed that on 11 July 2013, the Court of First Instance of Geneva had declared Jecot bankrupt; that the Bankruptcy Office of Geneva was the competent authority for the management and the liquidation of Jecot; and that the bankrupt estate of Jecot represented by the Bankruptcy Office had decided not to continue to participate in the present proceedings. </p>

As stated above, prior to such move, Mr Urumov was a trader – and by all accounts a star trader – employed by Knight. In the event, Mr Urumov and four other traders (namely Messrs Mujagic, Mufti, Gherzi and Ramaiya, all part of his team at Knight), joined OSL on payment by OSL of a “golden hello” of some US$ 25m (the “sign-on fee”), such amount being paid in November 2010. In essence, the claimants say that this amount was paid in reliance upon various representations by Mr Urumov as summarised in the first part of Schedule F to their closing submissions of which the most significant are that (i) each of those five individuals had a guaranteed income of US$ 5m p.a. at Knight and (ii) the sign-on fee would be shared equally i.e. US$ 5m each to Mr Urumov and the other four team members. The claimants assert that such representations were false and indeed made dishonestly by Mr Urumov. In particular, it is alleged that Mr Urumov personally received for himself considerably in excess of US$ 5m i.e. approximately US$ 8m out of which some US$ 6,552,889 was subsequently transferred to the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> defendant i.e. Denning; that the vast bulk of the remainder of the US$ 25m was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> shared with the rest of the team but rather was utilised by Mr Urumov to pay “bribes” or “kickbacks” viz US$ 5,667,000 to Mr Pinaev and US$ 6,377,111 to Mr Kondratyuk; and that the sign-on fee would not have been agreed or paid if such misrepresentations had not been made and the claimants had known the truth.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to this summary table, I should clarify two points. First, there was, at one stage, a potential issue as to which of the claimants had “title to sue” in respect of any particular cause of action. Thus, in the second column of Table 1, there are references to OFC, OSL, OML and OB. The explanation for this is that each company had a slightly different role. Thus OSL, OML and OB are the employers of Mr Urumov, Mr Jemai and Mr Pinaev respectively; OML is also the entity that actually made the payment (and OSL made the payment in relation to the Second Trade); and OFC is the entity that apparently agreed to and made good the various losses suffered by the Otkritie Group. However, by the end of the trial, Mr Berry on behalf of the claimants confirmed that the question of which entity had title to sue was not a point of any significance to the claimants. Equally, Mr Peto on behalf of the Urumov defendants and Ms Kovarska confirmed that no question of “title to sue” arose – although it may be necessary to consider this aspect further when drawing up any order of the court. Second, Mr Peto originally submitted on behalf of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev that certain of the claims advanced against them were governed by Russian law. However, in the event, Mr Peto expressly abandoned any such case so far as Mr Urumov was concerned. No such express concession was made on behalf of Mr Pinaev (who was by that stage of the trial no longer represented by Mr Peto and not participating actively in the trial) but absent any positive final submissions by him to support any case under Russian law, it seems to me that I can and should proceed to determine the claims against him in accordance with English law. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the substance of these claims, on the defendants’ side, Mr Urumov denies making any misrepresentations prior to the date when the sign-on deal was agreed – which he says was at a meeting in Moscow on 11 October 2010 – or at any material time. In any event, he denies that the claimants relied upon any misrepresentations. Rather, he says that the deal agreed on 11 October was that he would receive US$ 25m to bring his team from Knight to OSL; that this sign-on fee was, in effect, money due to him to do with as he liked; and that therefore it was entirely a matter for him to </p>

Thus, although Mr Urumov admits that he paid the sums alleged to Messrs Pinaev and Kondratyuk, he denies that these were bribes or kickbacks. In particular, as to the claims in bribery/unlawful conspiracy, it is his case that it was only <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> he did the deal with OSL and agreed the sign-on fee on 11 October that he had a meeting with Messrs Pinaev and Kondratyuk and was persuaded to pay them what was approximately half of the sign-on fee. Thus, it is Mr Urumov’s case that he is not liable for the tort of bribery or unlawful conspiracy. Mr Pinaev likewise admits receipt of part of the sign-on fee but denies that this constituted a bribe or kickback. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second main allegation (referred to by the claimants as the Argentinean Warrants Fraud) concerns one particular deal which was made on 9 March 2011 involving, say the claimants, a fraudulent conspiracy whereby OSL was deceived into purchasing some 1.65 billion Argentine GDP peso (ARS) denominated warrants (ISIN ARARGE03E147) at a price of 12.937 per cent in US$, being a total of US$ 213,468,750 (the “warrants”) when in fact such warrants were in fact worth only approximately US$ 62m i.e. an overpayment of approximately US$ 150m. More precisely, based on an actual market price on 9 March 2011 of US$ 3.79 per cent, the actual value of the warrants on that date was US$ 62,535,000 which equates to a loss to OSL of US$ 150,933,750.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I should mention that at the beginning of the trial, Mr Peto originally advanced a case on behalf of those clients he then represented including in particular Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev that OSL had not, in fact, suffered any loss at all and that the stated loss had in fact been incurred by one of Otkritie’s clients i.e. Gavinic Investments Ltd (“Gavinic”) to whom this particular deal had been booked and who were not parties to these proceedings. There was much evidence on this topic in the course of the trial; but in the event this point was abandoned by Mr Peto in the course of final submissions. I say no more about this point. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thus, it was at least by the end of the trial common ground that such deal was in fact entered into on 9 March 2011 and executed shortly thereafter by OSL, the purchase or “buy” being made via a third party, Adamant Capital Partners AD (“Adamant”, a Bulgarian brokerage company) from Gemini Investment Fund Ltd (“Gemini”, a Bahamian company)/AB Bankas Snoras (“Snoras”, a Lithuanian bank now in insolvency); and it is also common ground (or at least not disputed by any party) that the figures stated above are correct and that OSL did indeed suffer the loss referred to. Further details of the deal appear from Figure 4. Although not expressly admitted by the defendants, there is in my view no doubt whatsoever that this huge loss suffered by OSL was the result of a cunning and well-orchestrated fraud. In broad terms, the main issue in these proceedings is not whether the fraud occurred but whether any and if so which of the defendants was party to such fraud and/or was involved in laundering the proceeds of such fraud. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At this stage, I would only mention one other point by way of clarification with regard to the part played by Adamant. There is no doubt that Adamant acted as principals buying the warrants from Gemini/Snoras and selling them on to OSL on their own account making a small “turn” or profit for themselves. However, it is equally plain </p>

	  <level>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">from the evidence that the role Adamant played was as a “switch”. That is the term which has been used in this case to describe the role played by an intermediary such as Adamant in this particular transaction. There may be many reasons why a “switch” is used in certain transactions. For example, a “switch” may be used to reduce or to avoid tax or for other fiscal reasons – whether legitimate or illegitimate. Another reason may be because there are no existing trading (or credit) lines between two parties (A and B) who wish to carry out a deal. In such circumstances, the difficulty of doing a deal between A and B may be resolved by interposing a “switch” between them – provided, of course, the “switch” has a trading (or credit) line with A <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> B. Another possible reason may be the desire to hide the identity of one or other party. It is this last reason which the claimants say explains why Adamant was used as a “switch” and, moreover, that such desire was itself motivated to seek to cover up the fraud on Otkritie who, say the claimants, thought that their counterparty, the ultimate seller, was in fact Threadneedle.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, as part of the fraudulent conspiracy, the claimants say that Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Jemai made false statements that the true value of the warrants was about 15–16 per cent in <span style="text-decoration:underline">US$</span> whereas to their knowledge, and as published by public sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters, the true value and market price was about 15-16 per cent in <span style="text-decoration:underline">ARS</span> i.e. local Argentinean currency – or around US$ 3.75 to US$ 4 per cent, the exchange rate at all material times being about ARS4:US$1.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants say that in addition to the fact that the fraudsters falsely identified the ultimate seller as Threadneedle they also represented that there would be, and subsequently was, as an integral part of the deal, a binding “forward” or “sale” contract by which Threadneedle agreed to re-purchase the warrants later, at a price higher than the purchase price (initially 3% higher, i.e. 15.9375 per cent, later changed to 13.8425 per cent, in US$). I should make absolutely plain that Threadneedle is, of course, a well-established and reputable asset management company. However, as is now common ground, there never was any sale by Threadneedle to Otkritie nor any such forward or onward “sale” contract by Otkritie to Threadneedle. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At a very late stage of these proceedings, a question was raised on behalf of certain of the defendants (in particular by Mr Peto and Mr Casella) that if I were to conclude that any defendants were liable, then the amount of any such liability was to be reduced by the amounts which have been recovered by the claimants from third parties. This was disputed by the claimants. In particular, Mr Berry submitted that any such recoveries did not reduce the amount of any judgment that might be entered against any particular defendant and that it was for the claimants to decide what recoveries should be allocated to any particular claims. In his submission, such recoveries were irrelevant other than, possibly, at the stage of enforcement. It is unfortunate that this particular issue only really surfaced so very late in the proceedings. One of the difficulties is that I do not even know the precise amount of any net recoveries that have been made. In the event, I have decided that any argument on this topic can and should be dealt with after delivery of this Judgment and before any Order is drawn up when the parties will know my decision in principle on the various claims; and the court can if necessary be provided with information/evidence with regard to the amount of net recoveries.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, the claimants say that the alleged Argentinean Warrants Fraud was preceded by an earlier “buy-sell” transaction involving Argentinean warrants implemented by the fraudsters in late February/early March 2011 (the “First Trade”). In summary, the claimants say that the First Trade was, at least in part, a template for the later fraud, designed to give the appearance of being extremely profitable and part of a plan to inveigle the claimants into the purchase of more Argentinean warrants. Hence, the claimants refer to this as the “sucker trade”. It is important to note that the First Trade did not cause any loss to the claimants but, on the contrary, made a not insignificant profit for OSL (approximately US$ 2.5m) which profit was, say the claimants, in effect funded by Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk. </p>

These applications were in certain respects similar but not identical. In very broad terms, the main point sought to be raised was that the deal in question i.e. the alleged Argentinean Warrants Fraud was in fact part of an attempt by certain individuals employed by the claimants including Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov to defraud Threadneedle and that for that reason the claimants’ claim in these proceedings was tainted by illegality and must fail on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa. </span>In my judgment, that was an entirely baseless allegation.

In truth, this is not essential to the claimants’ claim but it is, at least according to the defendants, an important part of the story. In particular, on the defendants’ side, Mr Gersamia candidly admits – and indeed positively asserts – that he was himself party to such intended fraud on Threadneedle for which participation, according to his account, he was offered a substantial bribe by Mr Lokhov (who was, at the material time, the Deputy CEO of OFC) in the course of a dinner at the Umu restaurant in London on 3 June 2011 attended by himself (i.e. Mr Gersamia), Mr Lokhov and Mr Urumov.

In particular, the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk is that the day after the Second Trade i.e. on 10 March, Mr Pinaev telephoned him to say that according to his calculations, the profit on the fraud would be (approximately) US$ 150m, of which US$ 30m was to be given to Gemini and the balance i.e. (approximately) US$ 120m was for the six of them i.e. Mr Pinaev, Mr Urumov, Mr Gherzi, Mr Jemai, Mr Gersamia and Mr Kondratyuk himself; that he (Mr Kondratyuk) was “very pleased” after this conversation because he realised that each of them would receive US$ 20m; that on the date that the Second Trade was finally settled (i.e. 18 March), Mr Pinaev (who was with Mr Urumov in London) confirmed that the proceeds of the Second Trade would be sent to them at Arcutes; and that there were then discussions with regard to the preparation of various documents including a fake “loan agreement” between Gemini and Arcutes as a “cover” which could be presented to the bank to justify the payment.  </p>

I have found this part of Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence very confusing but, as I understand his evidence, he was told that they were going to have to pay “additional expenses” of approximately US$ 10m which needed to be paid to Mr Gersamia’s colleague (whose name he never learned); that this would leave a reduced figure of approximately US$ 110m to be split between the remaining six of them; that the suggested plan was, in effect, that this money (i.e. approximately US$ 110m) would be paid out by Arcutes and split in three equal shares between each of Mr Pinaev, Mr Urumov and Mr Kondratyuk so that Mr Urumov would receive his and Mr Gersamia’s share, Mr Pinaev would receive his and Mr Gherzi’s share and Mr Kondratyuk would receive his and Mr Jemai’s share; and that each of them would then have to settle up with Messrs Gersamia, Gherzi and Jemai respectively.

It is Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence that Mr Jemai’s share was US$ 15.4m leaving for himself approximately US$ 21m. The claimants say that this figure (i.e US$ 15.4m) is approximately 10% of the total fraud proceeds which was the percentage which had originally been agreed with Mr Jemai – although that is difficult to square with other parts of Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence including that part of his evidence to the effect that the original plan was that the figure of US$ 120m would be split 6 ways i.e. US$ 20m for each of the main fraudsters. I consider this further below in the context of the claims against Mr Jemai but, for present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, according to Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence, Mr Jemai telephoned him and requested him (Mr Kondratyuk) to hold his money for a while because his share (i.e US$ 15.4m) </p>

(“Sun Rose”, a Panamanian company beneficially owned and controlled by Mr Urumov and his wife, Ms Balk); Pleator (which was, as stated above, beneficially owned by Mr Pinaev), and Firmly Oceans (a Panamanian company beneficially owned and controlled by Mr Kondratyuk); that, as appears from Figure 8, the sum of approximately US$ 10.1m was paid by Arcutes to Belux (Hong Kong) Co.

These monies were all distributed by Arcutes in various tranches starting on 21 March 2011 and finishing by the end of March 2011. The result was that Arcutes’ bank account was effectively emptied within a very short period and Arcutes was subsequently dissolved shortly thereafter in May 2011. As appears from Figures 5, 6 and 7, these companies i.e. Sun Rose, Pleator and Firmly Oceans then made further distributions of the fraud proceeds to the families of Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk, companies and associates, including (so far as relevant in these proceedings) (i) by Mr Urumov to or with the assistance of his wife, Ms Balk; (ii) by Mr Pinaev to or with the assistance of Rossmore and his wife, Marija Kovarska; (iii) by Mr Kondratyuk via Firmly Oceans/Vantax to or with the assistance of Mr Jemai, Jecot and Ms Jemai; (iv) by Mr Gersamia to or with the assistance of Templewood and his father, Mr Gersamia Snr.

Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence. Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety. However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">The standard of what constitutes honest conduct</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">is not subjective.

As submitted by Mr Berry, it is important to note that the test for knowledge in a knowing receipt claim is lower than it is for dishonest assistance: dishonesty is not a prerequisite of liability, and the question is whether the defendant had such knowledge as to render it unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit of the receipt: <span style="font-style:italic">BCCI v Akindele </span>[2001] Ch 437, 455 per Nourse LJ.

This justifies his continuing liability to restore its value to the claimant even after he may no longer have the original property to restore by a proprietary claim. Fault means that the defendant must know enough of the facts surrounding the misapplication of trust property to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of his receipt. Earlier tests for fault, which drew subtle distinctions between different degrees of a defendant’s awareness, have been abandoned as being excessively refined. The degree of knowledge which might make the defendant’s conduct unconscionable varies with the context. This allows the court to set a standard that is appropriate to exigencies of the transaction in question. </span></p>

In broad terms, the submission made on behalf of most of the defendants was that the standard of proof was “high” or that more “cogent evidence” was required for the claimants to make good an allegation of reprehensible conduct.

I am prepared to accept that in a very broad general sense, it may well be true to say that it is inherently improbable that a particular defendant will commit a fraud. But it all depends on a wide range of factors. For example, if the court is satisfied (or it has been admitted) that a defendant has acted fraudulently or reprehensibly on one occasion, it cannot necessarily be considered inherently improbable that such defendant would have done so on another; or if, for example, the court is satisfied (or it has been admitted) that a defendant has created or deployed sham or false documents, the court cannot assume that it is inherently unlikely that such defendant did so on other occasions. For the avoidance of doubt, I should make absolutely plain that this is not to say that inherent probability is irrelevant. On the contrary, as submitted by Mr Casella, I accept, of course, that the court should take into account the inherent probability of an event taking place (or not taking place) as is made abundantly plain by Baroness Hale in the passage from <span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B</span> quoted above. However, as it seems to me, the court must in each case consider carefully what is – and is not – inherently probable having regard to the particular circumstances – but the standard of proof in civil cases always remains the same i.e. balance of probability. </p>

As set out below, the parties all served various witness statements and called various witnesses in support of their respective cases. In addition, in the usual way, there was a very substantial quantity of contemporaneous documents which had been disclosed by the various parties, included in the voluminous trial bundle and, by agreement and in the usual way, constituted evidence including evidence of the truth of what is stated in the documents. Such documents included not only copies of documents and emails but also transcripts of telephone calls and “chats” as recorded by “Bloomberg” which is an electronic communication system frequently used by traders and others in the financial services industry. In addition, there were transcripts of previous hearings in this court when certain of the defendants had been cross-examined in relation to their asset disclosures pursuant to previous court orders. However, it is important to note that there was a considerable number of documents which had been disclosed but which were said by one or more of the parties to be a forgery or a “sham” or both.  </p>

These proceedings were opened in November 2011 following a money-laundering notification to the Swiss authorities made by Bordier Bank (“Bordier”), the bank that in March 2011 received US$ 120m of what the claimants say were the fraud proceeds on behalf of Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk. The claimants themselves also filed a criminal complaint in Switzerland in late November 2011. In those proceedings being conducted by the Geneva prosecutor M Tappolet, various of the defendants (in particular Mr Kondratyuk, Mr Pinaev, Mr Jemai and Mrs Olessia </p>

As stated above, Mr Kondratyuk ultimately pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and was released in April 2013, having been in custody for 17 months. As the claimants are a civil party (partie civile) to the Geneva prosecution, they have access to the Swiss court file, including documents produced by witnesses and third parties and the minutes of hearings that have been conducted to date. The minutes are summaries prepared by the Geneva prosecutor on the evidence that has been adduced. At the end of each hearing the minutes are signed by all of the participants. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to note that the existence of these parallel criminal proceedings has presented some not insignificant challenges to the proper management of the present proceedings. For example, the Geneva prosecutor has obtained certain documents from certain of the defendants and other third parties (including, for example, what have been referred to as the “Hinduja documents”) which have only been released to the claimants from time to time in the course of this trial. In accordance with the continuing duty of disclosure, these documents have then been provided by the claimants to the defendants during the course of the present proceedings. I should make plain that the late disclosure of these documents is not a criticism of the claimants. However, this dribbling disclosure has caused practical difficulties in the management of these proceedings which has been particularly challenging. There have been other related difficulties e.g. with regard to a laptop that was used by Mrs Jemai and which was seized by the Swiss prosecutor. At a very early stage of the trial, it seemed to me that the contents of that laptop (in particular the metadata in relation to certain documents which were produced or at least stored on that laptop and which are said to be forged) would at least potentially be highly relevant to certain issues in these proceedings. In the event, the laptop itself remains with the Swiss prosecutor and, it would seem, will not be released. Pursuant to an order I made early in the trial, attempts were at least made to obtain the information stored on the laptop including metadata by transferring such information on to a data-stick. This was supposedly done but in the course of such exercise, it would appear that certain information has mysteriously disappeared. I revert to this further below. </p>

This is (or at least was) a safe deposit box at Bordier in Geneva in the name of “Dunant International SA”, the named 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> defendant (“Dunant”). Dunant is a Panamanian company with bearer shares. According to Mr Urumov, he acquired it at the suggestion of Bordier in order to separate his personal and business assets, although the claimants say that this explanation is implausible (at best) because he already had various accounts in the names of Denning, Sun Rose, PU Incorporated (“PUI”), Tenway (and no doubt others) and the Sun Rose account was entirely emptied into the Dunant Bordier account by mid-May 2011; that in any event, the documents show that it was Ms Balk who organised their acquisition of Dunant through Mr Giovanna of Bordier; and that it can safely be inferred that the reality is that Dunant was established better to disguise the trail of the fraud proceeds: not only was it incorporated in a notoriously opaque jurisdiction (i.e. Panama) but its bearer shares meant that there was no corporate record of its beneficial ownership, and its only assets came from Sun Rose, which in turn were derived from cash deposits. In any event, there is no doubt that Dunant was, at all material times, beneficially owned by Mr Urumov and/or Ms Balk and that this storage box was, in effect used by them. This is important because the claimants say that many of the supposed “contracts” contained in the Dunant box were sham documents which strongly support their case in these proceedings. </p>

In particular, the claimants say that the document shows that some at least of the defendants (including, in particular, Mr Urumov, Mr Pinaev, Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Jemai) agreed at a relatively early stage on a deliberate strategy to make dishonest accusations against Otkritie of criminal conduct in an attempt to scare Otkritie off this litigation through fear of adverse publicity or regulatory or criminal investigations. In particular, the claimants say that the main element of this strategy was to allege attempted fraud by Otkritie on Threadneedle culminating (the claimants say) in the forlorn attempts to backdate it to March 2011 and raise a defence of <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa</span>, as referred to earlier in this judgment. Further, as part of this strategy, the claimants draw attention to what they say are Mr Urumov’s libellous allegations to a journalist of murder by Otkritie and cover up of murder by the claimants’ solicitors, Hogan Lovells; and Mrs Jemai’s libellous allegation of kidnap by Otkritie of Mr Rahimov, which allegations were repeated under an affirmation of truth. In my judgment, these are most outrageous allegations for which there is not a scrap of evidence. </p>

I dealt with this in a ruling in the course of the trial; and it is unnecessary to repeat what I said then. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that it is plain that the disclosure exercise on the claimants’ side (including both e-disclosure and telephone recordings) has been huge and testing not least because of the compressed timetable to trial (less than 2 years from the discovery of the alleged frauds until the commencement of the trial); that the claimants admitted mistakes in the disclosure process, apologised, explained the reasons and repeated the apology; and that although the claimants’ failures in the disclosure process were disruptive to the conduct of the trial, I am satisfied that such failures were inadvertent and have been cured. </p>

I do not propose to set these out at length. To do so would further lengthen what is otherwise a very long judgment.

I should specifically mention Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov who were both crossexamined at some length. As to Mr Lokhov, I have already referred above to the assertion that he offered Mr Gersamia a bribe in particular at the Umu restaurant in June 2011. I confess I have found this part of the case particularly problematic: I consider the evidence – and set out my conclusions in relation to such assertion – below. As Mr Casella recognised, that allegation is not directly relevant to any pleaded issue although I accept that it is potentially relevant to the credibility of Mr Lokhov. However, I should make plain that even if that allegation were true, I have taken such possibility into account and I am satisfied that it would not ultimately affect my conclusion with regard to the rest of Mr Lokhov’s evidence (which I found honest and compelling) nor any other conclusion which I have reached. As to Mr Popkov, I should note that not only was he directly involved in relevant events in 2010 and 2011 but that he has also been the individual who has been largely responsible within Otkritie for handling the present claims. It is fair to say that certain parts of his evidence were less than clear for reasons which were, in my judgment, not his fault and which I explain briefly later in this Judgment. However, I should emphasise that I also regarded him as an honest witness who gave his evidence honestly and to the best of his ability. I also considered all the other witnesses who were called to give evidence on behalf of the claimants to be honest and that they gave their evidence honestly and to the best of their ability – although that is not to say that I necessarily accept the entirety of their evidence. </p>

It was headed by Mr Sergeev, although he had limited knowledge of the international markets and his English language skills were not (as he explains) of the requisite standard. Mr Kondratyuk was a senior member of the team, responsible for proprietary trading. Other members of the FIT included Mr Khazan (Head of FIT Sales) and Mr Kikhaev (Head of Domestic Sales). At that stage, the business of the Moscow FIT was mostly domestic; they did not have international experience or access to international clients. Management’s intention was to expand and to develop Otkritie’s FIT capabilities in London, which was the leading market alongside New York, and to build an agency (as opposed to a proprietary) business which was a lucrative area. Meanwhile, Mr Urumov was employed in London as a trader at Knight with his team consisting of Mr Gherzi, Mr Mufti, Ms Mujagic and Mr Ramaiya. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">According to the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk: (i) Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev called him in early summer 2010 with a proposal to persuade Otkritie to recruit Mr Urumov and his team at Knight for a very substantial sign-on fee (i.e. US$ 50m) which would then (after deduction of at most US$ 2m for Mr Urumov’s team members) be shared out amongst the three of them; and (ii) he (i.e. Mr Kondratyuk) agreed with such proposal. Mr Pinaev and Mr Urumov both deny that they ever made or agreed to such proposal. However, Mr Pinaev does at least accept that soon after he joined Otkritie, it was he who decided to introduce Mr Urumov to Mr Khazan and Mr Sergeev; and Mr Urumov also accepts that it was Mr Pinaev who introduced him into the Moscow FI team. None of this is perhaps surprising given that Mr Urumov was an old friend of Mr Pinaev (they were at university together in London, Mr Pinaev had been at school in Switzerland together with Mr Urumov’s wife, Ms Balk, and Mr Pinaev had previously worked with Mr Urumov’s brother, Tamerlan). They were also business associates and were working together to set up Quantum Leap, an investment fund to be based in Luxembourg. However, what is noteworthy is that their personal and professional connections were kept secret from Otkritie’s management. </p>

Even so, it was Mr Lokhov’s evidence that although Mr Sergeev had suggested to him that the cost of recruiting Mr Urumov’s team might be US$ 40-50m, he (i.e. Mr Lokhov) thought that this was an absurd figure. </p>

For present purposes, it is important to note that it is Mr Lokhov’s evidence that at that dinner Mr Urumov told him that (i) there were 5 people (including Mr Urumov himself) in the Knight team, each of whom had a key position covering different aspects of emerging markets; (ii) each member of the team was on a guarantee of US$ 5m p.a.; and (iii) they would require equal sharing of any sign-on fee to compensate for loss of their guarantees.

On the claimants’ side, Mr Lokhov’s evidence is that after he returned to Moscow he spoke to his colleagues, in particular Mr Popkov and Mr M Belyaev, about the recruitment of the Knight team. In particular, he says he confirmed to Mr Popkov that whilst Mr Urumov and the Knight team looked a “good fit”, it would be completely unacceptable to pay US$ 50m to recruit them.  </p>

As summarised in Mr Peto’s final submissions, the case advanced on behalf of Mr Urumov is that his recruitment was agreed at the meeting of 11 October 2010; that in particular Otkritie made Mr Urumov a firm offer at that meeting which he accepted and understood to be the terms upon which he would join and the terms upon which he would endeavour to bring over his team from Knight; and that as a sign-on bonus for himself and his team, it was agreed that he would receive US$ 25m for himself (i.e. Mr Urumov) to distribute as he saw fit.  </p>

However, this was emphatically denied by Mr Pinaev in cross-examination. In particular, it was Mr Pinaev's evidence that Mr Kondratyuk was not referring to Mr Urumov at all in this part of the Bloomberg chat but was rather referring to the hiring of another individual whom Mr Pinaev identified as Melton Plummer or some other new trading assistant or perhaps Mr Jemai. Further, it was Mr Pinaev's evidence that this could not be a reference to Mr Urumov because Mr Urumov’s employment had already been agreed on 11 October.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Be that as it may, the evidence of Mr Urumov is that he received a call from Mr Pinaev shortly after the meeting in Moscow which Mr Urumov says was on either 11 or 12 October. In summary, it is Mr Urumov’s evidence that Mr Pinaev asked him about how the meeting with Otkritie’s shareholder had gone; that Mr Pinaev told him that he (Mr Urumov) had to meet his superior, Mr Kondratyuk; and that they agreed that such meeting should take place the following day. As to that meeting, Mr Urumov’s evidence is, in summary, that Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk asked him to confirm the terms that he had agreed with Otkritie which he did; that Mr Kondratyuk then said that such terms meant that the remuneration opportunities available to him and his team (including Mr Pinaev) were “decimated”; that if he (Mr Urumov) was not able to offer “some sort of compensation” then he (Mr Kondratyuk) might as well look to move himself; and that Mr Pinaev supported those views. It is Mr Urumov's evidence that he then asked them what they had in mind and that following a “short negotiation”, he (Mr Urumov) conceded that he should pay them about 50% of the sign-on fee after the deduction of what he anticipated would be due to the members of the Knight team if they transferred. The evidence of Mr Pinaev is broadly to similar effect although this explanation of the sequence of events is, as I have already noted, contrary to the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk to the extent that his (Mr Kondratyuk’s) evidence is that the agreement that Mr Urumov should split the anticipated sign-on fee between them had been agreed at a much earlier stage and, in particular, long before the meeting on 11 October. According to Mr Urumov, he was very disappointed about this turn of events as it meant he would lose a very substantial sum of money. However, his evidence was that he knew enough of business in Russia not to be completely surprised; and that he did not think that it was a matter which need concern Otkritie since the payments were being made from money to which he was entitled.  </p>

That had been agreed by at least 11 October 2011. How that $25 million was to be distributed or dealt with among the recipients was my concern.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thereafter, there were certain further discussions between Mr Lokhov and Mr Urumov relating to the “lock-in” periods for the sign-on fees. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say these were resolved and on 9 November 2010 Mr Lokhov emailed Mr Urumov five Deeds (one for each member of the team) that had been prepared by Otkritie’s HR department. Mr Lokhov asked for these to be signed, together with a separate document for each individual, which identified the details of the Tenway account to which the monies should be paid (the “Payment Instructions”).  The Deeds for Ms Mujagic, Mr Mufti and Mr Gherzi provided for OML to pay sign-on fees of US$ 5m to each. The Payment Instructions were for corresponding amounts for each member of the team. The documents commence with the words “<span style="font-style:italic">Please transfer USD 5,000,000 to the following account</span>” and give details for the Tenway account. However, as already noted above and without the knowledge of Otkritie, Mr Urumov had negotiated a much lower fee for each team member viz US$ 750,000 for Ms Mujagic; US$ 500,000 for Mr Mufti; US$ 1m for Mr Ramaiya; and US$ 2.5m for Mr Gherzi.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The evidence of Mr Urumov is that he was away from the office between 8 and 15 November and so forwarded the email to Mr Gherzi in the office, called him and asked him to distribute and discuss it with the team members. Be that as it may, it is absolutely plain that Mr Urumov was fully aware that the draft Deeds and Payment Instructions were untrue in that (i) they overstated by a huge margin the sign-on payments that each of the team members – apart from himself – would receive; (ii) they concealed the true position viz that, as stated above, he (Mr Urumov) had agreed that approximately 50% of the total sign-on fee would be paid over to Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Pinaev; and (iii) he would retain for himself a sign-on fee substantially in excess of US$ 5m. Indeed, on his own admission, he knew that he had to produce these documents to get paid and that they were false. I consider further below Mr Urumov’s attempted justification of the payments he made to Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Pinaev but, in any event, there is and can be no proper or satisfactory justification whatsoever for his conduct in signing (as he did) his own Deed and Payment Instruction as well as seeking and, where successful, procuring the relevant signatures of his team members to these documents which he plainly knew were obviously untrue and (as referred to below) then subsequently returning them to Otkritie as if they were true. It is, in my judgment, nothing less than a brazen and carefully orchestrated deceit on the part of Mr Urumov on a grand scale.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the procurement of the signatures to these documents, the evidence of Mr Gherzi is that he did indeed receive his own draft Deed for signature; that he raised the issue concerning the discrepancy between what the draft Deed stated there viz that he would be paid a sign-on bonus of US$ 5m and what he had agreed with Mr Urumov viz a payment of only US$ 2.5m; that Mr Urumov told him that if he wanted the sign-on fee they had negotiated, he had to sign the Deed; that he was not happy at being bullied in this way; that he discussed his concerns with Miss Mujagic; that she (Ms Mujagic) then discussed her own concerns with him; and that he then had further discussions with Mr Mufti and also a short discussion with Mr Ramaiya. In any event, Mr Gherzi confirmed that he did sign the draft Deed. Although he had no specific recollection of signing the Payment Instruction, I am sure that he did. Similarly, the evidence of Ms Mujagic (as contained in her witness statement but who was not called to give oral evidence) is that she knew that the documents she signed were untrue because she was going to receive only US$ 750,000 but that she was, in effect, persuaded by Mr Urumov into signing. By way of explanation, her evidence is that she found it very difficult to question Mr Urumov; that he was something of a “bully and authoritarian figure”; that he had no patience for questions; that she was therefore reluctant to query his approach or to press him further regarding the details of the arrangements he had made with OSL; that he was also her boss and that she felt she had to trust him to negotiate with OSL. As for Mr Mufti, he accepts that he knew that what was stated in the Deed was untrue but says that he was “naïve” and signed it in order to assist Mr Urumov in getting the bonuses for him and for everyone else.  </p>

In my view, the decision by each of them to sign the relevant documents knowing them to be untrue on their face is inexcusable. I do not accept that such disreputable conduct can be justified on the basis of any “bullying” or supposed “naivety”. I am prepared to accept that they may not have known the precise details of Mr Urumov’s plan but, in my judgment, there can be no doubt that they were each signing documents which they knew were untrue and that they must have realised that this was for some nefarious purpose. In my view, it was nothing less than blatant dishonesty by each of these individuals driven by simple greed and self-interest on their part. </p>

As stated above, the sign-on fee that Mr Ramaiya had agreed with Mr Urumov was US$ 1m. He declined to receive it offshore and, despite pressure from Mr Urumov, insisted that it be included in his first OSL salary payment. According to Mr Lokhov, Mr Urumov told him that US$ 1m was required by Mr Ramaiya for a property purchase (which was untrue) and that it would be more efficient for this to be paid through OSL, the new employer, and taxed at source. At the same time, Mr Urumov asked for US$ 1m of his (alleged) US$ 5m share of the sign-on fee to be paid in the same way i.e. as part of his English salary. As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that this was obviously done (as Mr Kondratyuk confirms) in order to ensure that Mr Lokhov did not ask any awkward questions of Mr Ramaiya, whom Mr Urumov considered “<span style="font-style:italic">too honest</span>”. According to Mr Kondratyuk, Mr Urumov planned to put Mr Ramaiya in a “<span style="font-style:italic">compromising situation … to get Ramaiya drunk and then get some pictures of him with a prostitute or taking drugs which we could then use against him if he ever became difficult over the sign-on fee arrangements</span>”.  </p>

Mr Ramaiya’s evidence is that he did not. Indeed, his evidence is that he was never shown these documents at the time. This is strongly disputed by Mr Urumov. His evidence is that that he gave Mr Ramaiya the draft Deed when he received it from Mr Lokhov and subsequently received a signed version back from him (i.e. Mr Ramaiya) which he understood to be signed by Mr Ramaiya and which he subsequently passed on to Mr Lokhov. However, Mr Ramaiya is emphatic that he did not see or sign these documents; that the signatures are not his; that he did not know and had never met a Nishi Singh, who purportedly acted as a witness; and that the only contract which he ever signed with OSL or any Otkritie entity is his onshore OSL contract of employment dated 16 November 2010 which provided (amongst other things) for a sign-on bonus of US$ 1m which is exactly what he had indeed agreed. </p>

The first and last of these points were never properly put to Mr Ramaiya in cross-examination.

It is right that there is no <span style="text-decoration:underline">direct</span> evidence that Mr Urumov forged Mr Ramaiya’s signature. However, I have no doubt that it was forged by someone; and, in my judgment, the overwhelming probability is that the forger was indeed Mr Urumov (or someone acting on his instructions) for the reasons advanced by Mr Berry. In particular, Mr Urumov had both the very strong motive and the opportunity to procure Mr Ramaiya’s signature to be forged. The document was a necessary part of his deceit – even on Mr Urumov’s own story. He could not count on Mr Ramaiya to sign a false document but the deceptive Deed and the Payment Instruction had to be signed or the scheme would unravel. There was no other individual who had such or any other similar motive or opportunity. As submitted by Mr Berry, the path of the documents excludes any realistic possibility that anyone else committed the forgery unless they were acting on Mr Urumov's instructions or under his supervision. In addition, Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence supports this thesis: he says he had been told by Mr Urumov that he (Mr Urumov) would arrange to forge Mr Ramaiya’s signature. </p>

Thereafter, from Tenway or via another company beneficially owned by Mr Urumov (PUI), those monies were distributed to various parties and on various dates as shown in Figure 1. In particular, Mr Mufti received (through his company, Dorlcote Ltd) US$ 500,000 on 1 December 2010; Mr Gherzi received US$ 2,532,680 on 1 December 2010; Primrose Corporation (i.e. Ms Mujagic) received US$ 611,857 on 16 February 2011; Denning received a total of US$ 6,552,289 i.e. US$ 1m on 2 December 2010 and a further US$ 5,552,889 on 13 January 2011; Rossmore (i.e. Mr Pinaev) received US$ 5,667,000 on 22 December 2010; and Firmly Oceans (i.e. Mr Kondratyuk) received US$ 6,377,111 on 29 December 2010. Further Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence is that it was agreed with Mr Urumov to give Mr Jemai an incentive to participate in the (subsequent) Argentinean Warrants Fraud by offering him US$ 400,000 – which Mr Kondratyuk subsequently did in cash.  </p>

In particular, as to the first alleged misrepresentation, Mr Urumov certainly knew at all material times that the other four members of his team did not expect, had not agreed to and would not in fact each receive US$ 5m p.a. Equally as to the second alleged misrepresentation, Mr Urumov also certainly knew that the other four members of his team were not entitled to guaranteed bonuses worth US$ 5m. In particular, Ms Mujagic’s salary was £10,000 per month gross plus a percentage of profits she generated; Mr Ramaiya’s remuneration was based primarily on commissions from trades, and in his last year at Knight he made approximately £340,000; Mr Gherzi had a total guaranteed bonus of US$ 3m over (it can be inferred) at least 2 years; and Mr Urumov’s own contract with Knight was for two years with minimum compensation of US$ 2m per annum and US$ 1m worth of stock (i.e. US$ 5m over <span style="text-decoration:underline">two</span> years). </p>

However, Mr Peto went further. In particular, he submitted that the evidential burden facing the claimants is “high”, not only by reason of the nature of the allegations of fraud but also (as he submitted) because of the inherently uncommercial nature of the representations which they claim to have relied upon. As set out above, I do not accept that this is the right approach. In my view, the standard of proof is the balance of probability although, of course, I accept that it is essential to bear in mind what might be said to be the “inherent probability” of any particular event having regard to all the circumstances.</p>

In particular, Mr V Belyaev confirmed that the decision to recruit Mr Urumov and his team rested, effectively, with him alone. His co-shareholder, Mr Mints, had given him the discretion to decide the matter and promised to support “any decision” made by him.

That evidence is problematic because there is no suggestion of any representation that the team members were receiving £5m each at Knight – as opposed to US$ 5m – and although I have no doubt this was a mistake by Mr Peto in the question he put, I am not sure that the witness necessarily understood that it was a mistake.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, it is important to note that it is Mr Urumov’s evidence that the possibility of taking any of his team at Knight over to Otkritie was not even discussed at the Coq d’Argent in September 2010; and that he also claims that the subject of his negotiations with Otkritie was the terms “… <span style="font-style:italic">upon which I could </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">create</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a fixed income team for OSL</span>”. I do not accept that evidence. In my view, it is not only inconsistent with Mr Lokhov’s evidence (which I accept) but, as submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me overwhelmingly improbable that neither the possibility of the team move nor the remuneration of the members of the team was discussed at the Coq d’Argent meeting. In my view, this is particularly so given that (i) (as even Mr Urumov accepted) a financial institution typically recruits a team to acquire its clients and contacts; (ii) Mr Urumov himself accepts that he knew that OSL was looking to recruit a fixed income team and that (as I accept) Mr Lokhov made it very clear at the meeting that he wanted to recruit such a team and, if possible, wanted Mr Urumov to lead that team; (iii) the thrust of the evidence of the other witnesses from Otkritie (which I accept) was that the recruitment of a team was, in effect, at the heart of Otkritie’s plans for expansion; (iv) it makes little, if any, sense to pay a sign-on fee of US$ 25m for one man to come in and set up an untried new team. Moreover, in this context, Mr Urumov’s evidence in this regard is inconsistent with the contemporaneous correspondence, including, in particular, an email sent by Mr Sergeev on 17 June 2010 to Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov (among others) which said in terms that “<span style="font-style:italic">… we are in talks with a </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">whole team which is well established and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">complete</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and which at the moment is one of the most successful in London and New York.

Further, this is also what Mr Urumov himself told his bankers at Clariden Leu viz that Otkritie was “targeting his team”.  </p>

The evidence of Mr Pinaev that this was a reference to Melton Plummer is demonstrably false because other evidence confirmed that he (Mr Plummer) was a junior salesman taken on by Otkritie much earlier in the year i.e. in June 2010; and Mr Pinaev’s further suggestion that it was (or might have been) a reference to Mr Jemai is, in my view, not credible – the manifest priapic excitement in that chat would be incomprehensible if it were indeed a reference to the relatively young and (at least then) inexperienced Mr Jemai.

The Deeds and Payment Instructions were formal documents creating legal rights and obligations and Mr Urumov knew he had to provide them as a condition of payment. It is not credible that he believed that Otkritie would require formal legal documents as a condition of payment but, in effect, not care that such documents were shams.   </p>

It would also be absurd to require a clawback of US$ 5m from e.g. Mr Mufti if he was entitled to get very much less.  </p>

However, given the contemporaneous documents, there is, in my view, no reason to doubt that Mr Urumov represented it would be so, and intended such representation to be believed, and that it was believed. As submitted by Mr Berry, it was a positive (albeit false) selling point by Mr Urumov that each team member had a guaranteed US$ 5m p.a. at Knight and needed, and agreed, to move for US$ 5m, because it (falsely) gave the impression that each member was “<span style="font-style:italic">about the same calibre</span>” and that he was merely <span style="font-style:italic">primus inter pares</span> of a uniformly valuable team.

As submitted by Mr Berry, if Mr Urumov is right, it would make a nonsense of the US$ 5m claw-back provisions in each of the Deeds; and if, as Mr Urumov said, each member of the team was guaranteed US$ 5m a year at Knight, they were a team of equals, of which Mr Urumov as leader was merely <span style="font-style:italic">primus inter pares</span>, and equal sharing of the sign-on fee at OSL was both rational and fair. Nor do I consider that there is any merit in the further point advanced by Mr Peto that Otkritie cannot succeed because they failed to make enquiries, e.g. with Knight or the individual team members, with regard to the existing bonus arrangements at Knight. As stated above, it does not lie in the mouth of a liar to say that the claimant was foolish to take him at his word. Moreover, the point made by Mr Urumov lies ill in his mouth, in circumstances where he had assured Otkritie with regard to the existing bonus arrangements and that the Sign-On Fee would be shared equally. In this context, Mr Urumov also sets much store by the annual (performance) bonus arrangements that were envisaged for the team once they commenced employment with OSL. He claims that there was an annex to each of the other employees’ contracts of employment appointing Mr Urumov as an administrator for the distribution of bonuses to his team. A draft was indeed proposed, but not agreed. None of the team recalls an annex to the contract they signed; none is appended to any existing version of their contracts; and none has been found.

It is on this basis that Mr Berry submits that by agreeing to receive and receiving what were obvious “bribes” or “kickbacks”, Messrs Pinaev and Kondratyuk breached the strict duties imposed on them as fiduciaries; and that the conflict between their duty (of undivided loyalty) and their private interests (in earning kickbacks) is patent and inexcusable.  </p>

In fact, Mr Urumov did not meet Mr Kondratyuk until October 2010, when he joined Otkritie Bank; (ii) in an effort to give evidence as helpful as possible to the claimants’ invented case on the alleged misrepresentations, Mr Kondratyuk inadvertently contradicts Mr Lokhov, by swearing that Mr Urumov planned from the start to ask for US$ 25m, with US$ 5m for each member. Mr Lokhov, of course, claims that Mr Urumov had initially asked for US$ 50m.

Second, it is common ground that the payments were not disclosed to Otkritie. The argument that these payments were not bribes because neither Mr Pinaev nor Mr Kondratyuk was part of the decision-making body is, in my view, specious. As stated above, it is sufficient that the payment gives rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest. Third, I reject the suggestion that Mr Urumov never intended that the payments to Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk would be kept secret. In my judgment, that is yet another deliberate untruth by Mr Urumov – as is the further doublesuggestion that he remembers (i) that he asked them whether they had disclosed such payments and (ii) that they said: yes.

As stated above, there is in these circumstances an irrebuttable presumption of inducement. In any event, on the facts I have no doubt that Mr Pinaev’s conduct in introducing Mr Urumov to Otkritie and the conduct of both Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk in lobbying for Mr Urumov and his team to join Otkritie was heavily influenced by, at the very least, the expectation of a substantial bribe or kickback. In reaching that conclusion, I reject the evidence of both Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev that it was only after the meeting on 11 October that Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk in effect insisted that Mr Urumov split the sign-on fee with them. It is true that, apart from the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk, there is no direct evidence of any discussion still less any agreement of such arrangement; and I readily accept that the precise details of such arrangement may well not have been finalised until shortly after the meeting on 11 October. However, in my view, the essential elements of the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk in this context are in my judgment entirely credible which I accept even if the precise detail may be a matter of debate. In any event, even if the arrangement to split the sign-on fee with Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Pinaev was only agreed <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> 11 October, I do not consider that this provides either Mr Urumov or Mr Pinaev with any defence. This is because as I have found (i) no legally binding agreement to pay the sign-on fee was reached between Otkritie and Mr Urumov on 11 October; and (ii) if Otkritie had discovered that the representations were fraudulent prior to the Deeds being signed and the payment of US$ 23m being paid to Tenway, I am sure that Otkritie would have refused to proceed.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, the explanation now advanced by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev in an effort to justify the payments to Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk is, in my judgment, not credible. In particular, the case advanced is that the payments were agreed and made by Mr Urumov privately to compensate Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Pinaev for likely loss of very substantial future remuneration (bonuses) as a result of the recruitment of Mr Urumov’s team, and to dissuade them from leaving. As submitted by Mr Berry, every element of that assertion is in my judgment demonstrably false for at least three reasons. First, the <span style="font-style:italic">raison d’être </span>for the new FI team was to exploit new opportunities and generate substantial profits for Otkritie. Mr Pinaev introduced Mr Urumov and he and Mr Kondratyuk lobbied management hard to recruit Mr Urumov’s team. It is against human nature for them to have thus supported a measure if it would cause them very substantial loss. The notion that anyone could genuinely have supposed that the Knight team would cause losses to the existing FI team by taking any of their business is in my view nonsense. Second, the prospective future remuneration, said to have been lost, is fantastical. Mr Pinaev’s bonus for 2010 (which was an exceptionally profitable year) was US$ 700,000. That sum cannot form the basis of </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">any credible calculation resulting in a compensatory package of almost US$ 6m. Third, Mr Pinaev belatedly seeks to get around that conclusion by arguing that a new bonus regime was due to be implemented in January 2011; that “<span style="font-style:italic">it had been promised to </span>[<span style="font-style:italic">him</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> by Sergeev personally</span>”; and that it would have resulted in a likely bonus of “<span style="font-style:italic">about half of </span>[<span style="font-style:italic">$12.5 million</span>]”. I do not accept that assertion. Mr Pinaev cannot produce any documentary evidence to support this assertion; Mr Sergeev categorically denies having made any promises to Mr Pinaev; and both Mr Sergeev and Mr Popkov confirm that no new regime for bonus payments was envisaged for 2011. I accept that evidence.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, Mr Kondratyuk confirms that the payment he received from Mr Urumov was not made to persuade him to stay at Otkritie or to compensate him for any reduced bonus on account of Mr Urumov’s recruitment. Further, he points out that in order to help explain the payment to Mr Kondratyuk’s bank, Mr Urumov prepared a “consultancy agreement” dated 27 December 2010, expressed to be between PUI and Firmly Oceans. This was recently discovered by the Geneva prosecutor in Dunant’s safety deposit box at Bordier Bank in Geneva. Clause 3 of this purported agreement provides for PUI to pay Firmly Oceans a “<span style="font-style:italic">sign-up fee</span>” of US$ 6,377,111 in consideration of Firmly Oceans agreeing to enter into the agreement, i.e.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> any consultancy services are, supposedly, to be rendered. PUI, a Panamanian shell company incorporated barely a month previously, is recorded in the preamble as having “<span style="font-style:italic">potential business, projects and transactions in the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Ukraine</span>”. In my judgment, that agreement is clearly a fake or a sham or both, giving yet further reason to reject Mr Urumov’s attempt to clothe these bribes with a credible explanation. </p>

For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov continued to be based in Moscow. As for Mr Jemai, there was conflicting evidence. There is no doubt that after joining Otkritie in 2010, he was based in Moscow. As originally pleaded, the claimants’ case was that Mr Jemai did indeed work in Otkritie’s offices in Moscow until around April 2011 and thereafter in their offices in London. This is consistent with an email from Mr Urumov in May 2011 which stated that Mr Jemai had “moved” to London. This was disputed by Mr Jemai. In any event, consistent with other evidence (including the evidence of Mr Popkov) there is, in my view, no doubt, that during the early part of 2011, Mr Jemai spent an increasing amount of time working alongside Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev in Otkritie’s London offices.  </p>

The first deal was made on 25 February 2011. This involved OSL contracting to buy 100 million Argentinean warrants from Adamant. The stated price was 13.02 per cent in US$, i.e. a total of US$ 13,020,000. The second deal was made a few days later on 2 March 2011. This consisted of OSL contracting to sell the same 100 million warrants to another company, JSC Norvik Banka of Riga (“Norvik”). The stated price was 15.47 per cent in US$, i.e. a total of US$ 15,470,000. Both trades settled in two tranches on 8/9 March 2011 when OSL paid for and received the warrants into its account with JP Morgan in London (on the buy leg) and received payment and transferred the warrants out of the same account (on the sell leg). The result was the apparent profit referred to above, i.e. almost US$ 2.5m. These matters are not in dispute and were known to Otkritie at the time.  </p>

This appears in diagrammatic form in Figure 2. In broad summary, the details of this “round-trip” were as follows. The warrants were sourced on the market with the assistance of David McCann at brokers BGC Capital Partners (“BGC”) and Dmitry (“Dima”) Posokhov of JSCB Investbank on 25 February 2011 from First Overseas Bank (“FOB”) at a price of approximately US$ 3.66 per cent i.e. a total of US$ 3.66m. On 1 March 2011, the same warrants were then sold by BGC to Gemini which had a client trading account at Snoras. Meanwhile, a contract to buy those same warrants had been entered into by Otkritie at the stated price of US$ 13.02 per cent, i.e. a total of US$ 13,020,000. It is important to note that that purchase was notionally from Adamant which, in effect, acted as a “switch” in their purchase of those warrants at a slightly reduced price from Gemini/Snoras. On 3 March 2011, the same warrants were then sold on back to Gemini/Snoras through another “switch” (i.e. Norvik) at the stated price of US$ 15.47 per cent i.e. a total of US$ 15,470,000. On the same day, the warrants were then resold back by Gemini/Snoras via BGC to FOB at US$ 3.68/US$ 3.69 per cent i.e. a total of US$ 3.68m/US$ 3.69m. </p>

This is so because OSL had existing trading lines already in place with Snoras and could therefore have transacted directly. In my judgment, the only explanation for using (and paying for) switches was to conceal Snoras’ and Gemini’s involvement in both legs of the trade.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the ostensible loser in the First Trade was Gemini/Snoras. On the face of it, they had sold the warrants through Adamant to Otkritie for approximately US$ 13.02m but had bought them back from Otkritie a few days later at approximately US$ 15.5m through Norvik. Their loss was, of course, OSL’s profit. It is an important part of the claimants’ case that this loss was funded jointly by Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk. In particular, it is the claimants’ case that on 22 February 2011 Mr Pinaev, through his company Rossmore, and Mr Urumov, through his company Denning, each transferred the sum of US$ 1m to Gemini’s Latvia Krajbanka (“LKB”) account; and that on 23 February 2011, each of Rossmore and Denning transferred a further US$ 500,000 to the same account. According to Mr Kondratyuk this was his share. Subsequently, on 4 March 2011, a sum of US$ 3m was transferred from Gemini’s LKB account to its account with Snoras, which was later used to settle the trades with Adamant and Norvik. Thus, it is the claimants’ case that Gemini/Snoras did not bear any risk at all and that Messrs Kondratyuk, Urumov and Pinaev in effect funded the loss.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk is that this first trade was a “sucker” trade, conceived and executed by Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and himself, to make it appear to others at Otkritie (including Messrs Lokhov and Popkov) that (i) the warrants were worth around US$ 15 per cent and (ii) trading in the warrants was profitable, with the object of persuading them to authorise a further trade at the same grossly inflated price. This is denied by both Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev. In particular, both in effect say that they had little direct involvement with the trade and that such involvement as they had was in effect carried out on instructions of Mr Lokhov and/or Mr Popkov. I do not accept that evidence. The contemporaneous documents clearly show that both Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev had a direct and active involvement in various important aspects of the jigsaw, as referred to above. The most important elements of such direct and active involvement can be summarised as follows. </p>

At 4.45 pm, Mr Pinaev sends himself a test trade ticket confirmation for the above ARS-denominated Argentinean warrants showing a “Dirty PR” of 15 and total costs of ARS 450m<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>for 3 billion Argentinean warrants. At 4.47 pm, Mr Pinaev sends a further test ticket. At 4.48 pm, Mr Pinaev sends himself a further test ticket showing a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1. At 4.48 pm, Mr Pinaev sends himself a screenshot of a test ticket for Argentinean warrants using a US$/ARS exchange of 0.248. (This was apparently the correct exchange rate as at 21 February 2011.) Also at 4.48 pm, Mr Pinaev sends to a Mr Erkin Damitov of SJS Markets Ltd a screenshot of a test ticket for Argentinean warrants showing a US$/ARS exchange rate of 0.248. At 4.49 pm, Mr Pinaev sends himself confirmation of his previous test ticket showing a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1 and price of US$ 15 per cent for one million Argentinean warrants. At 4.53 pm, Mr Pinaev sends himself confirmation of the previous test trade he had carried out showing a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1 and US$ price of US$ 15 per cent for 3 billion Argentinean warrants. At 5.18 pm, Mr Pinaev sends Mr Damitov a further screenshot. Later, at 6.58 pm, Mr Pinaev sends Mr Damitov a further screenshot with a message asking him to disregard the last ticket and asking him to consider this ticket the correct one showing a purchase of 100,000 Argentinean warrants at a price of US$ 15 per cent with a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1. At 7.52 pm, Mr Pinaev sends Ms Melnikayte in Otkritie’s front office a screenshot of a ticket for the purchase of 10,000 Argentinean warrants at a price of US$ 15 per cent showing a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1. On the following day, i.e. 23 February 2011, there are further Bloomberg chats between Mr Pinaev and other third parties with reference to possible switch purchases of some 10 billion Argentinean warrants at a price of US$ 15 per cent with a US$/ARS exchange rate of about 3:1. Standing alone, it is not easy to understand the precise purpose of these exercises and communications. Mr Pinaev had no satisfactory explanation. To my mind, the clear inference is that Mr Pinaev was experimenting with different possible trades and, more importantly, the possibility of manipulating different exchange rates. </p>

Importantly, Mr Pinaev told Mr Reynov in that chat that Threadneedle held the securities. The reference to Threadneedle holding the securities was untrue and without foundation. Mr Pinaev’s evidence was that he had been given that information by Mr Popkov. I do not accept that suggestion. In addition, in that Bloomberg chat, Mr Pinaev said the reason for doing the switch is that the “<span style="font-style:italic">stupid Lithuanians cannot do with me direct</span>”.

The most significant, in my view, is a Bloomberg chat at 4.07 pm between Mr Pinaev and the Bloomberg Helpdesk. In essence, Mr Pinaev tells the Helpdesk that he is doing a trade with Argentinean warrants and asks them how he can input the ticket with a US$ price. In response, he is told that the Bloomberg price cannot be changed from ARS to USD if the security is set up as denominated in ARS. Mr Pinaev went on to state that the Argentinean warrants in question trade in US$ at a price of 3.7. In my view, this is </p>

In the course of the same Bloomberg chat, Mr Pinaev directed Mr McCann to sell the warrants to “Dima”. (The reference to “Dima” or “Dimi” is a reference to Dmitry Posokhov, a trader at Investbank which is a financial institution affiliated with Snoras.) Mr Pinaev also asked Mr McCann to obtain approval for a direct trading line between BGC and Snoras, alternatively to find a switch. In the course of cross-examination, both Mr Pinaev and Mr Urumov sought to distance themselves from Mr Posokhov and Snoras. I do not accept that evidence given, in particular, Mr Pinaev’s own comment in another contemporaneous Bloomberg chat where Mr Pinaev described Mr Posokhov as his “<span style="font-style:italic">best contact in Snoras</span>”. </p>

Mr Pinaev confirmed to Mr Kounov that the Argentinean warrants were traded in US$.

In the event, the middle office did not accede to Mr Pinaev’s request. As submitted by Mr Berry, the plan to change the nominal currency having failed, the contemporaneous documents show that both Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev learned how to manipulate trade tickets by inputting manually a false exchange rate so as to inflate artificially the price of the warrants. Mr Urumov also manually changed the prices for the warrants in Otkritie’s internal database, i.e. the trader’s work station or TWS for short.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the evening of 25 February 2011, there is a record of Mr Urumov having a conversation with Otkritie’s back office telling them there was “<span style="font-style:italic">an incorrect set up in Bloomberg</span>”. He then went on to state: “<span style="font-style:italic">Everything is being settled in dollars, there is no FX at all, there is just a dollar price, dollar settlement, dollar notional, so we should forget about FX, there is no FX there.</span>” In my view, there was and is no proper basis for passing on that information to the back office. It was obviously untrue, as Mr Urumov well knew. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears that it was about this time that Mr Jemai became involved. In particular, according to his evidence, he was instructed by Mr Pinaev to book or accept tickets for the First Trade with an exchange rate of 1:1. This is what Mr Jemai duly did with Mr Pinaev’s assistance, but only after he had mistakenly produced a ticket in ARS rather than US$ and was reprimanded in no uncertain terms for doing so by Mr Pinaev. Mr Jemai does not dispute that that is what he did in fact do. However, his evidence is that at that stage, and at all material times thereafter, he was simply doing what Mr Urumov or Mr Pinaev told him to do and that at no stage did he think or even have suspicion to think that anything he was being asked to do or did in fact do was in any way improper, let alone dishonest. I consider Mr Jemai’s position separately below. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Another important message was sent by Ms Mikhailova to various individuals in the middle office, including Ms Melnikayte, which she subsequently forwarded to both Mr Pinaev and Mr Jemai and which was then subsequently forwarded by Mr Pinaev to Mr Urumov. The email is headed “<span style="font-style:italic">Economic sense of the trade</span>”. The email informed the various parties of the conclusion of the First Trade and the payment of US$ 13,020,000 and stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">The exchange rate of Peso/dollar according to Middle Office is 1:1. The market value of this bond is 15.5 peso or 3.65 USD.</span>” The email then went on to raise a question as to whether they should take into account what she describes as the “<span style="font-style:italic">cross-rate</span>” provided by the middle office or the “<span style="font-style:italic">official rate</span>”. The email ended by suggesting that maybe they should transfer the deal on to someone else, otherwise they will suffer considerable losses and will come under the attention of the Central Bank. Mr Pinaev’s evidence is that, following this email, he assumed that senior management had stepped in to provide the necessary explanations to middle office. As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that that statement is nothing less than a deliberate lie.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, again as submitted by Mr Berry, Mr Urumov responded in a very misleading way to this email, claiming that he had spoken to Miss Nechvolodova (which he accepted was a mistake) and to Miss Chepeleva (which was untrue). In the event, Mr Urumov forwarded it to Mr Jemai’s private email address. On this basis, Mr Berry submitted that it was to be inferred that Mr Urumov, Mr Pinaev (who was in London that day) and Mr Jemai discussed how to respond to Ms Mikhailova’s query and agreed a plan to ensure that middle/back office and the risk department accepted the grossly inflated price of the warrants as the market price for internal reporting purposes. Putting Mr Jemai on one side for a moment, I accept that submission. Certainly, the documents show that Mr Jemai spoke to Ms Mikhailova during the course of the day telling her that it was not important what currency the warrants were traded in. He reported this to Mr Pinaev in the course of a telephone call at 2.41 pm on 1 March 2011. As appears further below, this conversation is important and it is therefore worth quoting the relevant part verbatim: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 1 March, there was a further exchange on which the claimants place particular reliance. This exchange started with an email from Ms Sharipova to Mr Pinaev asking for quotations for the mid-price “<span style="font-style:italic">… [indicating the currency!]</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">…</span>” for the warrants for 25 and 28 February. This was followed by a discussion between Ms Sharipova and Mr Pinaev when Mr Pinaev in effect referred Ms Sharipova to Mr Jemai who, Mr Pinaev said, was “<span style="font-style:italic">from our team … he is also a trader … he is a junior trader who usually does this. It’s his duty …</span>” Following that discussion, Ms Sharipova forwarded her original email to Mr Jemai for the relevant information and then sent a further email shortly thereafter asking in addition for the price for 1 March. Mr Jemai responded by email providing the requested quotes with figures of 14.875, 15.125 and 15 for 25 February, 28 February and 1 March respectively. However, these figures were given <span style="text-decoration:underline">without</span> the currency. Mr Shamarin then prompted Mr Jemai, requesting him to add the currency to the numbers which he had given. Mr Jemai then responded saying “<span style="font-style:italic">Sure</span>”, and adding “<span style="font-style:italic">USD</span>” to the figures. Later, Ms Sharipova asked Mr Pinaev whether he was accepting these prices which Mr Pinaev subsequently did. The claimants say that this exchange is important. In particular, the claimants say that this was all part of a strategy by Mr Pinaev to direct price queries to Mr Jemai pursuant to an agreement or understanding between the conspirators to involve Mr Jemai who (by virtue of his relatively junior status) would, if anyone raised any queries, be able to claim that he was merely following orders. Quite apart from the fact that this is consistent with the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk, the claimants say that the fact that Mr Jemai only gave the figures originally without the currency is significant. In particular, the claimants say that the proper inference is that Mr Jemai was hoping that he could get away without committing the deception to writing. Despite Mr Jemai’s protestations to the contrary, it seems to me that there is at least some force in this point. </p>

As I have already stated, and as is common ground, this was again about four times the market price. Initially (on 2 March), Mr Orlov suggested that the correct price was about US$ 4 per cent; and later (on about 8 March) US$ 3.65 per cent. However, Mr Pinaev responded by saying that this was “<span style="font-style:italic">bullshit</span>” and that there is “<span style="font-style:italic">no such price</span>” (which was untrue as Mr Pinaev well knew) so as to persuade Norvik to act as a switch on the sale to Gemini/Snoras. In cross-examination Mr Pinaev reluctantly accepted that he had not told the truth to Mr Orlov. His explanation was that he (Mr Pinaev) wanted to get him (Mr Orlov) “<span style="font-style:italic">off my case</span>”. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that Mr Pinaev deliberately lied to Mr Orlov. </p>

Unsurprisingly this created a very favourable impression with both Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov. In particular Mr Lokhov responded to Mr Urumov’s email with the words “<span style="font-style:italic">Super! Congratulations!</span>”.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have stated, it is an important part of the claimants’ case that the apparent loss suffered by Gemini/Snoras was in fact funded by Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk. In particular, the claimants rely upon the payments of US$ 1m each made by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev, as referred to above. Mr Kondratyuk’s share was initially advanced in equal proportion by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev through their respective companies but he (Mr Kondratyuk) repaid them on 15 March. The total amount (i.e. US$ 3m) was in fact in excess of the loss suffered by Gemini/Snoras on the First Trade and, as submitted by Mr Berry, this explains why Gemini subsequently transferred the sum of US$ 395,000 back to Denning, such sum representing the amount of the excess less “commission”. The documents show that this payment was made on 30 March 2011. This sum was then split three ways: US$ 131,000 was distributed to each of Mr Kondratyuk (through his company Wandsworth Capital Ltd) and to Mr Pinaev (through his company Rossmore), Mr Urumov retaining the remaining balance of approximately one third for himself. All of these payments and distributions were not in dispute as appears from the agreed Figures 1, 2, 6 and 7.  </p>

However, the evidence of both Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev is that the payments to Gemini had nothing to do with the First Trade and represented an investment by way of a share subscription which, they say, is confirmed and supported by a series of Subscription Agreements. However, it is my conclusion that these purported Subscription Agreements are fakes or shams or both created by or at the instigation of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev in order to create a false paper trail. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The circumstances relating to these supposed agreements are, to say the least, very suspicious. There is no doubt that the various purported Gemini Subscription Agreements are materially identical to a document annexed to what was a genuine offering memorandum issued by Gemini on 1 July 2006. However, the only versions disclosed by Mr Urumov were the front pages dated 15 February <span style="text-decoration:underline">2010</span>, bearing the signatures of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev and which Mr Urumov faxed to Clariden Leu on 22 February <span style="text-decoration:underline">2011</span>. On their face, these would appear to be documents adapted by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev from the genuine template and emailed to Mr Kondratyuk by Mr Pinaev from an email address purporting to be that of “James Bellevue”. In my view, the very strong inference is that these were fake documents. Further versions which would also appear to be fake and bearing signatures of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev were also discovered in the Dunant safe deposit box which was exclusively in the control of Mr Urumov and his wife at the material time. As submitted by Mr Berry, these documents would appear to bear the hallmarks of crude, error-filled manipulation. For example, the named subscriber is “Multiasset S.A.” (beneficial shareholder of Gemini Advisors Ltd) and the “person authorised to conduct transactions” on behalf of Denning/Rossmore is stated to be Stanislav Kovtun (CEO of Gemini Advisors Ltd). A yet further set of different versions of these purported agreements also dated 22 February 2011, made out in the names of Denning and Rossmore and bearing (respectively) signatures of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev that are exact facsimile copies of the versions in the Dunant safe deposit box, were disclosed by Gemini’s Latvian bank LKB. The text on these documents would appear to have been modified after the signatures had been applied. Moreover they contain Sri Lankan telephone numbers and fake email addresses for Denning and Rossmore. It is my conclusion that the overwhelming probability is that these documents too are forgeries, which were either produced by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev themselves alternatively by Mr Churin or someone else on their instructions with the intention of deceiving LKB about the nature of the payments to Gemini. </p>

(I consider later the role of others in particular Mr Jemai.) First, they show that, contrary to their evidence, Mr Pinaev and Mr Urumov were actively involved in the execution of the First Trade. Second, it follows that their evidence to the contrary is, in my view, untrue. Third, I do not consider that there is any possibility that such untruths were innocent. On the contrary, it is absolutely plain that they deliberately lied when they gave evidence. Fourth, they were well aware that the price paid by Otkritie for the warrants on the “buy” side and received on the “sell” side was grossly inflated i.e. between about 3-4 times the market price. Fifth, they deliberately created false documents with regard to their alleged “investment” in Gemini. In my judgment, there is no doubt that such payments were made to fund the loss suffered by Gemini on the First Trade and, in effect, the apparent profit made by Otkritie. Sixth, the structure of the First Trade, the funding of the “loss” by Gemini and the forging of the documents with regard to the alleged “investment” in Gemini have no honest explanation: they are, in my judgment, inexplicable save on the basis that they were part of some nefarious exercise. Against that backdrop, I turn to consider the alleged Argentinean Warrants Fraud. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 28 February, Mr Gherzi sent an email to Mr Popkov (copying in Mr Urumov) referring to a previous discussion with Mr Urumov. It outlined “<span style="font-style:italic">a reverse inquiry</span>” from a “<span style="font-style:italic">tier 1 account</span>” with whom there was already a considerable amount of business. As stated in the email, the essence of the proposed deal was a “<span style="font-style:italic">deposit</span>” of 400-500 million of Argentinean sovereign paper for 6 months; the intention would be, once the custody account was set up, for the client to move this holding over to their custody account with Otkritie; the client was willing to pass on the economies of the bond with a 1 point discount to market, resulting in a “<span style="font-style:italic">positive carry of 4%</span>”; the expected “<span style="font-style:italic">annualised</span>” P&amp;L would be about US$ 20-25m (i.e. a return of 10-15% p.a.). It was Mr Gherzi’s evidence that this email had been dictated to him by Mr Urumov, although this was emphatically denied by Mr Urumov. Be that as it may, the overwhelming likelihood is that, even if the specific words were not dictated, the information contained in the email was provided to Mr Gherzi by Mr Urumov. In any event, since the email was copied to Mr Urumov, there can be no doubt that he (i.e. Mr Urumov) was fully aware of its terms. The email is somewhat curious in that it does not identify the name of the client, although Mr Gherzi’s evidence was that the client referred to was Threadneedle. When asked about this in cross-examination, Mr Urumov was, in my view, deliberately evasive, although he accepted that it was “possible” that the client referred to was Threadneedle. In my judgment, it is plain from the contemporaneous documents that Mr Urumov was well aware that the supposed client was Threadneedle. </p>

In cross-examination, Mr Urumov said that he had no recollection of any such conversation; but I am sure that a conversation at least on the broad lines as stated by Mr Popkov did indeed take place. In particular, I accept Mr Popkov’s evidence that they (Mr Urumov and Mr Gherzi) told Mr Popkov that the intended client was Threadneedle. This is of course important because it is (at least now) common ground that there was no such proposal on the table from Threadneedle at that time nor indeed at any time and, in particular, there was no intention by Threadneedle to enter into any such proposed deal.  </p>

In particular, through his Threadneedle Bloomberg account, Mr Gersamia approached a Mr Diego Marynberg (sometimes referred to as “Maradonna”), a trader at a company called Institutional Trading Ltd (“ITL”). Mr Marynberg was not called as a witness but his statement was in evidence. In essence, his evidence (which I accept), supported by the contemporaneous documents shows that on 25 February, Mr Marynberg agreed to prepare the documentation for the proposed trade and to send it to Mr Gersamia; that thereafter Mr Gersamia asked Mr Marynberg to copy in Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev, whom he (Mr Gersamia) described as his “colleagues/friends”; that Mr Marynberg did not know Mr Urumov or Mr Pinaev but agreed to do what Mr Gersamia asked him to do; that Mr Marynberg then sent the standard ITL Counterparty form to Mr Gersamia, copied to Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev, asking for the form to be completed and signed by both the buyer and the seller; that on 28 February, Mr Marynberg received an email from Mr Pinaev attaching a completed counterparty form for Snoras, although Mr Marynberg had no contact with anyone from that company; that Mr Marynberg responded to Mr Pinaev later that day thanking him and asking him for the “second counterpart” i.e. the completed counterparty form for OSL; that shortly thereafter Mr Pinaev sent Mr Marynberg an email attaching the completed counterparty form for OSL; and that on 2 March, Mr Marynberg then sent an email to Mr Gersamia copied to Mr Urumov and blind copied to Mr Pinaev attaching draft agreements to form the basis of the proposed sale of 10 billion warrants by Snoras to OSL via ITL acting as a switch counterparty.

In places, it is extremely rude and in others it is somewhat cryptic. For present purposes, the important point would appear to be that at one stage Mr Gersamia suggests that they meet outside, because, according to Mr Gersamia, he “<span style="font-style:italic">can’t talk here</span>”.

The circumstances in which Adamant came to accept that role are set out in a written witness statement, put in evidence by the claimants, by Mr Bojidar Kounov who is and was at all material times the Managing Director and one of the shareholders of Adamant. It is unnecessary to set out such circumstances in detail. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that according to Mr Kounov it was only on 9 March 2011 that he received a call on his mobile phone from Mr Pinaev asking him whether Adamant would be prepared to act as a switch party again on a much bigger transaction. According to Mr Kounov, the proposed trade was four or five times bigger than any other trade Adamant had previously executed. Mr Kounov’s witness statement sets out in some detail what then happened in the course of 9 and indeed 10 March, in particular with regard to the various tickets that were prepared by Mr Jemai, which I refer to briefly below when I deal with events on that day.  </p>

The details appear from Figure 3. I should mention that in the course of crossexamination, Mr Pinaev came up with the suggestion that Mr Popkov had instructed him at an unspecified time in an unspecified manner to source 10 billion warrants in the market for a different deal. Mr Pinaev maintained that this occurred during a conversation with Mr Popkov that took place at or shortly after a lunch at the Gaucho Grill. However, this finds no support whatsoever in the contemporaneous documents; nor is it mentioned in any of Mr Pinaev’s witness statements; nor was it ever put by Mr Peto to Mr Popkov in cross-examination. In my judgment, as submitted by Mr Berry, this is a late invention.  </p>

The fact is that all of the relevant Otkritie witnesses positively (and very strongly) recall that Mr Urumov was indeed present on that call. In my judgment, that evidence was entirely credible and there is no reason whatsoever to disbelieve them. The contemporaneous documents also point strongly to that conclusion.

This was, and was known by Mr Urumov to be, untrue.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Urumov led Mr Popkov to believe that Threadneedle desired confidentiality; that he feared leaks by Mr Shamarin or his department; and that it was important that the trade was executed without any market leaks. Given that Threadneedle was not, as Mr Urumov well knew, involved at all, none of this was true. In truth, the only plausible explanation for not disclosing the ISIN was to reduce the risk of someone checking the true value of the warrants before OSL entered the transaction and because Mr Urumov feared that the intended fraud might be discovered. Mr Urumov used this (false) excuse to explain his reluctance to provide Mr Shamarin with the ISIN for the warrants.  Mr Popkov was willing to go along with this to the extent that he countenanced Mr Shamarin being given an incorrect ISIN number. As Mr Peto submitted, this shows that Mr Popkov was prepared to deceive Mr Shamarin; and I accept that the fact that Mr Popkov was prepared to engage in such a deceit is relevant to Mr Popkov’s general credibility. However, whilst not condoning such conduct in any way, it is important to note that, so far as Mr Popkov was concerned, the purpose of such deceit was simply to prevent or reduce the risk of a market leak and to assist in the execution of what he thought would be a profitable deal for Otkritie. In addition, of course, I should note that there is no suggestion that Mr Popkov would thereby obtain any secret monetary gain by such conduct.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">During the call, Mr Popkov said that he understood that “<span style="font-style:italic">with the contracted story no one is going to do 8% annually</span>”.  This reference is perhaps somewhat ambiguous but in context it seems relatively plain that the reference to 8% p.a. is to the <span style="text-decoration:underline">minimum</span> annualised return which Mr Popkov required to authorise the Second Trade. That was his evidence in the Swiss proceedings and also at this trial which I accept. However, according to Mr Popkov’s evidence, he was told by Mr Urumov in the earlier video conference and in later calls on 3, 4 and 9 March that Threadneedle agreed to pay 14% p.a. over six months; and that was the revenue which Mr Popkov (and Otkritie) believed would be produced by the Second Trade. That was disputed by Mr Urumov; but I accept the evidence of Mr Popkov on this point for three main reasons. First, as I have stated, I found Mr Popkov an entirely credible witness; whereas that was not the case with regard to Mr Urumov. Second, when, as appears below, Mr Popkov authorised the Second Trade including the forward trade to Threadneedle, it seems to me inherently improbable that he would not have had in mind (even approximately) the profit that Otkritie would make. Third, again as appears below, the tickets which were entered into Otkritie’s system (after correction) on the instructions of Mr Urumov produced a rate of return which was equivalent to exactly 14% pa. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also plain from the transcript of this call that Mr Popkov was confused about at least certain aspects of the proposed deal. In response, Mr Urumov said that “we” will speak to “him” now and that Sasha (i.e. Mr Gherzi) would be meeting “him” that night. Mr Popkov then told Mr Gherzi to make sure that he discussed all questions with “him” and to explain to “him” what was needed. Mr Gherzi answered by saying “<span style="font-style:italic">yes, yes, yes … I wrote down everything here, I will go through it with him point by point, will ask him what he is happy with and what he is not</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> To my mind, Mr Gherzi’s oral evidence in this context was very unsatisfactory. In cross-examination, Mr Gherzi accepted that the “him” in this part of the call was a reference to Mr Gersamia. However,  he (i.e. Mr Gherzi) denied that he (i.e. Mr Gherzi) could or ever did discuss what he described as the “specifics” of the intended trade with Mr Gersamia because, according to his (i.e. Mr Gherzi’s) evidence, he (Mr Gherzi) did not know what the specifics were. In broad terms, that is consistent with what Mr Gherzi stated in para 32 of his witness statement viz that he was not scheduled to and did not meet any “client” to discuss everything as the deal was being arranged by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev direct with Mr Gersamia. However, despite Mr Gherzi’s protestations and in particular his attempts to distance himself from the proposed deal, that evidence is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with what appears in the transcript of this telephone call which, in my view, shows, at the very least, that Mr Gherzi was (with Mr Urumov’s encouragement) telling Mr Popkov that he would meet the client and go through the proposed deal “point by point”. It is also inconsistent with an email which Mr Gherzi sent later in the afternoon on 1 March to Mr Katorzhnov saying that the client had asked not to give out the details of the security until the basic parameters of the deal had been discussed and that he (i.e. Mr Gherzi) would be meeting the client “<span style="font-style:italic">tonight</span>” to agree on the points discussed during the video conference. In response, Mr Katorzhnov sent an email explaining that the funds available for the large trade with Threadneedle were US$ 150-200m “<span style="font-style:italic">as has been voiced out on the conference call</span>”. Mr Katorzhnov’s email made it clear that, as far as he was concerned, the individuals in charge of the apparent deal with Threadneedle were Mr Urumov and Mr Gherzi.  In my view, that was indeed the case – or at least that was the perception which both of them i.e. Mr Urumov and Mr Gherzi gave to all concerned on the Otkritie side. All of this strongly suggests that Mr Casella is right in saying that Mr Gherzi was a Machiavellian character; and lends independent support to Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence that Mr Gherzi was not the innocent fall guy that he pretended to be when he gave evidence in court; that he was in fact an important party to the fraud; and that the sum of in excess of US$ 2.5m which he subsequently received was reward for the role he played in the fraud. At the very least, it is my conclusion that Mr Gherzi was less than frank in evidence and that he knew much more about what was going on than he pretended in the course of giving such evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">It is at least curious that Mr Urumov changed the original subject of Mr Shamarin’s email i.e. “<span style="font-style:italic">Threadneedle</span>” to “<span style="font-style:italic">cli</span>”. The latter would almost certainly seem to be a typographical error for “<span style="font-style:italic">client</span>” as Mr Urumov accepted. In cross-examination, Mr Urumov also said that he did not think that he had changed the subject title. However, it seems to me that he must have done that and that this must have been a deliberate action on his part. There is no other plausible explanation. The question then is: Why? In my view, the only plausible answer is that he was seeking to avoid committing himself on the documentary record to saying that he was proposing a deal with Threadneedle.  </p>

A similar suggestion, i.e. that Mr Gherzi would meet with “him” that night, was also made by Mr Urumov (and assented to by Mr Gherzi) in the course of the earlier telephone call between them and Mr Popkov. This is of course untrue. There never was any intended deal with Threadneedle and, in any event, it was Mr Gherzi’s evidence in §32 of his witness statement that he was not scheduled to and did not meet any “client” to discuss everything as the deal was being arranged by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev direct with Mr Gersamia.  </p>

One particularly egregious example is Mr Pinaev’s reliance on a forged email chain, supposedly between Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov on 1 March 2011, which purports to show that Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov were aware of Gemini’s involvement in the Second Trade. The undisputed evidence of the claimants’ computer forensics expert is that the emails have been fabricated. Mr Pinaev’s suggestion in the witness box that “<span style="font-style:italic">this is something done by the claimants</span>” (i.e<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> a double bluff) is, in my view, not credible – and it was never put in crossexamination to either Mr Lokhov or Mr Popkov.

Thus, on 3 March at 1.21 pm, Mr Urumov sent an email to Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov stating that “<span style="font-style:italic">we have just sold Argentina and have realised a PL + USD 2,500,000</span>”. The email also stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">Please calm down Shamarin as he is starting to get on my nerves. I just do not have the time to deal with this correspondence 20 times a day … I am off to a meeting with the client …</span>” The opening part of that email was plainly a reference to the First Trade. Given my conclusions with regard to such trade as stated above, such statement was in my view obviously false (and known to be false by Mr Urumov) to the extent that it gave the impression that such trade was genuine (when it was not) and that it had realised a handsome profit in excess of US$ 2.5m (when, in truth, such profit was, as I have found, entirely illusory and had been funded by Mr Urumov, Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk). Mr Urumov’s obvious intention in sending that email was to persuade Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov that there was money to be made in trading the warrants at prices above US$ 13 per cent and to persuade them to override the concerns about the intended Second Trade then being voiced by Mr Shamarin. The last sentence (where Mr Urumov says he is “off to a meeting with the client”) is also false or at least highly misleading to the extent that it suggests<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>(as it plainly does)<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and was<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>obviously intended to suggest that Mr Urumov was off to a meeting with Threadneedle but, of course, Threadneedle had not been a “client” in relation to the First Trade. </p>

I kinda told him that we can also [do this], but for lesser sum. All in all he told me that he is not a charity to pay us USD 3 million per deal. He says that we can’t do anything, have to give him back this PL somehow by offsetting on account of another deal. Otherwise he will not open custody nor dvp lines and will mark us in BLACK BOX. This will be complete disaster. Basically very bad situation. Me and Sasha had very big plans in regards to this client – PL + USD25 million and Custody 1BN. This cannot go on like this. How are we going to handle this? I think Sasha will have to really kiss the client’s ass to somehow sort this out. On the whole, if we manage to come to an agreement with the client for partial volume, and then we back down, then we will have no business from this client. Plus he will really damage our reputation on the market! We are not yet goldman sachs and cannot afford to do this. After today’s fiasco, Sasha barely managed to convince him to meet again tonight.

In my judgment, paras 5) and 6) of that email plainly refer - and were intended by Mr Urumov to refer - to a sell transaction that had, at least in principle, been agreed (subject to approval): that must be so not only from the terms of the email itself but also given the preceding discussions as summarised above. Mr Urumov’s evidence to the contrary is, in my judgment, disingenuous in the extreme. Notwithstanding, I accept that the expression “monthly rollover” is ambiguous i.e. it is unclear as to what was to happen on the supposed sell side at the end of each month, and in particular, whether it was Otkritie or the “client” (i.e. Threadneedle) who had the right to “rollover”. Equally, I agree that the reference to “6 months term (depends on custody account opening procedure)” lacks clarity. The evidence on this was somewhat confused, although such confusion is perhaps readily explicable because there was, of course, no “sell” at all whether to Threadneedle or any other party. In particular, it was Mr Popkov’s evidence that the “monthly rollover” meant that the resale to the client (i.e. Threadneedle) would be reviewed every month so “<span style="font-style:italic">… we could terminate if market risk increased …</span>”; and that (if not previously terminated)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the term of the trade was 6 months “<span style="font-style:italic">… or perhaps a little longer if the paper was ultimately placed in a custody account on behalf of Threadneedle</span>”. In addition, I should mention that it was Mr Urumov’s suggestion in evidence that a termination of this type could not be made without necessary DVP lines and other confirmations with Threadneedle in place. However, as Mr Urumov told Mr Popkov during the call on 1 March, the intention was to have a confirmation from Threadneedle on Bloomberg and that this would constitute a binding obligation; and I accept Mr Popkov’s evidence that that is indeed what he understood and that it was not necessary to have trading lines with Threadneedle before the trade. Another suggestion made by Mr Urumov in evidence was that a forward trade in these warrants was not possible. The basis of that assertion is not clear to me; but in any event, it was Mr Popkov’s evidence (which I accept) that he had no reason to doubt that it was perfectly possible to buy these warrants and to sell them back to Threadneedle at a future date.  </p>

This submission had various strands. For example, Mr Peto referred to certain internal documents (including a draft internal report compiled shortly after 9 March 2011 (referred to as the “DAUR report”), an email from Mr Lokhov dated 11 March, other reports dated 11 and 14 March and a P&amp;L spreadsheet) as well as certain parts of the evidence of Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov which he said showed, in effect, that the profit which would be generated on the buy/sell was so huge that the claimants could not have believed that a legitimate enforceable forward trade in fact existed at that time or indeed at any time; and that, in truth, they did not hold such a belief. In further support of that submission and jumping ahead in the chronology, Mr Peto drew attention to certain parts of the evidence after the Second Trade was concluded which, he said, indicated that both Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov had (at the very least) doubts as to whether a forward trade had been concluded. In that context, he submitted that this showed that they did not believe that the forward trade existed; and that their failure to take proper steps to verify the position either by making further internal checks within Otkritie’s systems or by direct enquiry of Threadneedle (which, submitted Mr Peto, could easily have been done by email or otherwise) indicated at the very least such ineptitude as undermined their evidence. (In truth, this latter submission was a watered down version of the <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi </span>plea which Mr Peto had sought unsuccessfully to introduce by way of his amendment application.) Further, Mr Peto submitted that ordinary common sense and commercial prudence cried out against the idea that Otkritie could have entered into a transaction worth a quarter of a billion dollars (about half of OSL’s balance sheet) simply on an oral assurance that written confirmation existed (or would exist) but never asked for sight of the document recording the confirmation from Threadneedle or made proper enquiry of Threadneedle.  </p>

It is also fair to say that Mr Popkov frankly accepted in effect that the fraud might have been discovered earlier if he had done things differently. However, I do not otherwise accept Mr Peto’s submissions as summarised in the previous paragraph. In particular, for reasons which it is unnecessary to explore in detail, the reliance placed by Mr Peto on the internal documents and evidence referred to above was, in my view, misplaced; and, in fact, the expected profit on the deal was not “huge” as Mr Peto originally suggested but, as explained further below, equivalent to 14% per annum. In any event, I have no doubt that Mr Lokhov continued throughout to rely on the assurances given by, in particular, Mr Urumov – as did Mr Popkov. Further, I am satisfied that Mr Lokhov and Mr Popkov did indeed honestly believe in the representations made and that the Second Trade involved both a “buy” and “sell” leg and continued to hold such belief until August when the balloon went up.  </p>

In particular, it was Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence that Mr Pinaev said that 9 March 2011 was the ideal day for the fraudulent trade, because Mr Urumov would be in hospital; that it was agreed that (i) Snoras/Gemini would buy the warrants at the market price; (ii) Snoras/Gemini would sell the warrants to Adamant at four times the market price; and (iii) Adamant would sell the warrants to Otkritie at four times the market price; that Mr Pinaev suggested that, in order to deceive Otkritie as to the price of the Warrants, he would ask Quickline (a Russian broker) to fabricate a screenshot showing the inflated US$ price; that Mr Pinaev showed Mr Jemai Bloomberg screenshots and explained how to make false entries in the Bloomberg system; and that Mr Pinaev explained that the proceeds of the fraud would be channelled through Gemini with the assistance of Mr Churin, a friend of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev. Both Mr Pinaev and Mr Jemai denied that any such discussions had taken place. Mr Jemai denied attending any meeting at this bar. However, this is contrary not only to the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk but also to the recollection of Mr Giovanna of Bordier who gave evidence to the Swiss prosecutor. In any event, Mr Jemai accepted that in early March, shortly before the Second Trade was executed, he spent what he described as a “mega-weekend” skiing with Mr Kondratyuk in Courcheval.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Pursuant to the authorisation given by Mr Popkov as stated above, the Second Trade was executed in the course of Wednesday 9 March. The evidence of Mr Kondratyuk is that he had agreed in advance with Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev that they would all stay away from the office on that day (i.e. 9 March 2011) when it was executed. The claimants say that (consistent with the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk) Mr Urumov deliberately arranged to be away on that day in order to enable him to say later that he was absent from Otkritie’s offices on the day when the Second Trade was made and that he was not involved in it. This is denied by Mr Urumov. In any event, Mr Urumov's evidence is indeed that he was away that day and that he knew nothing of the purchase of the warrants on that day. In particular, it is Mr Urumov’s evidence that he was in the Princess Grace Hospital in London on 9 March; that he had previously been admitted 2 days earlier i.e. on 7 March; that he had had an operation that evening (i.e. on 7 March) for surgery for cancer which involved the total removal of his thyroid gland; that he spent the following day recovering from the general anaesthetic and the next few days feeling very unwell; that given the pain and discomfort, he was not able to speak at all for a day or so and not beyond a whisper for about a week; that he did not use a telephone while in hospital; and that he had no involvement in the exchanges between Mr Popkov, Mr Jemai and the Risk Department on that day and “<span style="font-style:italic">no involvement in the purchase of the Argentine paper</span>”.  </p>

The claimants say that Mr Pinaev was in fact pretending to be ill at home in order later to claim that he had not executed the final trade. That may well be right although (like many points in this case) it is impossible to say whether that is true or not.

Specifically, the claimants say that the phone records show that Mr Urumov received no less than 16 calls from Mr Pinaev alone on his (i.e. Mr Urumov’s) private mobile telephone (07957 352109) and not his Otkritie mobile (07554 880352); and that it is to be inferred that Mr Urumov used this phone to make it harder for Otkritie to trace the calls. In particular, it is the claimants’ case that Mr Urumov gave instructions and Mr Pinaev kept Mr Urumov informed of progress with regard to the execution of the buy trades with Adamant and (as appears below) the entry of the fake forward trade in Otkritie’s systems.  </p>

In my view his evidence in this context is not credible for a number of reasons. First, the evidence in his statement that he did not use a telephone while in hospital is demonstrably false. Thus the records for his Otkritie mobile phone show four calls being made at various times during 9 March, including a call lasting longer than six minutes to Russia/Kazakhstan, a call at 8.11 am to his wife, and a call to Mr Popkov at 11.02 am. In my view, the overwhelming likelihood is that it must have been Mr Urumov himself who made such calls. Second, the number and length of calls between Mr Pinaev’s phone and Mr Urumov’s private mobile phone are, in my view, very strong evidence which undermines the suggestion that Mr Pinaev did not at any stage speak to Mr Urumov but that such calls were taken by Ms Balk. Third, it is in my view noteworthy that Mr Urumov has failed to disclose the records for his private mobile phone. Mr Urumov’s evidence was that he had tried to obtain such records but that his mobile phone company had told him that they do not have such records. I find that surprising; but, in any event, there is no doubt that the records from Mr Pinaev’s phone show the calls as stated above from his phone to Mr Urumov’s private mobile phone.  </p>

Mr Popkov then asks Mr Gherzi how he would be making the trade and Mr Gherzi replied “<span style="font-style:italic">Err … Look … I just talked to Pinaev, he is going to book all this. Urumov met with the client and they discussed all these technical moments. As I understand, the counterparty … Formally, the counterparty is in Argentina, we don’t have lines with them, and by the way, we also still don’t have lines with Threadneedle. As I understand it, the incoming deal, we are going to do it via … I mean, we are going to switch it … And who is the counterparty, to be honest, I don’t know, I will now call Ruslan</span> [Pinaev] <span style="font-style:italic">to see …</span>” Mr Popkov then said: “<span style="font-style:italic">I see. I don’t care who is going to be at the first leg but for the second leg there should be a name that is consolidated, I mean, affiliated with Threadneedle, which consolidates with it …</span>”. Mr Gherzi replied: “<span style="font-style:italic">… Ruslan</span> [Pinaev] <span style="font-style:italic">told me he apparently found a counterparty … Need to check with him again, I will give him a call …</span>” Mr Popkov then explained that it may be necessary for the trade to be booked as two separate transactions, one for the bank and one for Gavinic and asked if this could be done, whereupon Mr Gherzi replied that it should be possible to split the ticket. Mr Popkov said: “<span style="font-style:italic">… I mean the external story, when we are asked. So externally we are going to report that this is no f***ing buy-sell that we bought this paper from some idiots and then sold it at the spot…</span>”. Mr Gherzi said: “<span style="font-style:italic">You see, these details were discussed between Urumov and Pinaev, when they met</span>” and “… <span style="font-style:italic">I will discuss this with Ruslan</span> [Pinaev] <span style="font-style:italic">now, because Ruslan met with them for dinner last week, they all met and discussed these questions … But I think, yes, the incoming will be through I don’t know who – I am waiting to hear from them who is going to switch it… And for the outgoing, yes, I think it will be Threadneedle, most likely</span>”. Mr Popkov then reiterated that he needed the Threadneedle counterparty name. </p>

At 9.25 am, Mr Gherzi emailed Mr Popkov, copying in Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev, stating: “<span style="font-style:italic">Dmitry, to confirm the full name of the counterparty on the outgoing leg of the trade is Threadneedle Asset Management.</span>” It is noteworthy that neither Mr Urumov nor Mr Pinaev contradicted what Mr Gherzi had said. Although Mr Urumov was in hospital and Mr Pinaev may not have been in his office until a little later, we know from subsequent events on that day that they were both in email contact. In my view, the overwhelming inference is that they both intended Mr Popkov and others at Otkritie to believe that there was an outgoing leg (i.e. a forward sale) and that the counterparty was Threadneedle which was, of course, false, as they well knew. </p>

Moreover, Mr Berry emphasised that this particular email had been disclosed by the claimants and not by Mr Jemai, even though it was, on its face, an email that had obviously been received into his private gmail account. Thus, Mr Berry submitted that Mr Jemai had failed to comply with his disclosure obligations and that it was to be inferred, on the basis of this limited but telling sample, that Mr Jemai’s private gmail account contained highly relevant documents that have been withheld from the court. In response, Mr Jemai denied that there had been any deliberate failure to comply with his disclosure obligations; that, for various reasons, any relevant emails from this gmail account must have been trashed or were otherwise no longer available. Further, Mr Jemai explained that it was his habit sometimes to send emails from his work account to his personal gmail account if, for example, he was going out of the office for lunch or any other reason and still wanted to have access to a particular email. In that context, he provided disclosure of other examples when this had happened. Even so, the fact that Mr Jemai did forward this draft email to himself seems to me to indicate, at the very least, a desire to be able to look at it outside of the office. </p>

Almost immediately thereafter or even during the conversation, at 10.25 am, Mr Urumov emailed Mr Gherzi and Mr Pinaev (copying in Mr Jemai) stating “<span style="font-style:italic">We traded this already. Jusst show them trade tickets or give them client’s direct number. Let them call direct.</span>” As sent, that email is the last in a chain, starting with Mr Popkov’s original email at 8.33 am followed by Mr Shamarin’s email at 9.14 am, Mr Popkov’s “<span style="font-style:italic">?</span>” of 9.20 am and then Mr Gherzi’s email of 9.30 am. This email was the focus of much attention in the course of evidence and submissions. In particular, as submitted by Mr Berry it is noteworthy that this email was sent by Mr Urumov at a time when, on his own evidence, he was in his hospital bed. At the very least, it seems to me that it shows that Mr Urumov’s assertion in his statement that he had no involvement in the exchanges between Mr Popkov, Mr Jemai and the Risk/Compliance Department on 9 March 2011 and had no involvement in the purchase of the Argentine paper to be demonstrably false. In addition, Mr Berry submitted that by “<span style="font-style:italic">client</span>”, Mr Urumov could only have been referring to Mr Gersamia who must, submitted Mr Berry, have been briefed about this. In particular, Mr Berry submitted that only if Mr Gersamia was party to the conspiracy and knew of and participated in the deception practised on Otkritie could Mr Urumov be confident that, if Mr Popkov or anyone else from Otkritie called Mr Gersamia “direct”, Mr Gersamia would back up Mr Urumov’s story that Threadneedle was, indeed, the counterparty in the first trade and was also the counterparty in the second trade. Thus, Mr Berry submitted that this email on its own is sufficient to convict Mr Gersamia of conspiracy.  </p>

Shortly thereafter, there is a transcript of a telephone call by Mr Popkov to Mr Pinaev dealing with the manner in which the deal would be booked. In summary, Mr Popkov told Mr Pinaev how the deal needed to be booked in Otkritie’s account.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Mr Pinaev told Mr Popkov that there would have to be a discussion with the Middle Office regarding how the trade would be booked internally. Mr Popkov responded that he would speak with the Middle Office and forward details to Ms Nechvolodova and Mr Pinaev said that he would “<span style="font-style:italic">… forward it to Jemai, because from our side, Jemai will be doing all the calculations, under my control …</span>”. Mr Pinaev then asked: “<span style="font-style:italic">OK Dima, tell me one thing, can I make a deal with the client … by?</span>” Mr Popkov responded that he could do both the buy and sell trades; and Mr Pinaev confirmed that he would then do the tickets for these.

Mr Pinaev then confirms: “<span style="font-style:italic">Yes, yes, yes ok.</span>” In my view, this is a very important exchange for two main reasons. First, it confirms Mr Popkov’s evidence that the basis on which he authorised the Second Trade was that the buy and sell legs were to be executed simultaneously – in effect as part of a single deal. Second, given that there was no sell leg at all, what Mr Pinaev told Mr Popkov (i.e. “<span style="font-style:italic">yes, yes, yes, ok</span>”)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>was untrue as Mr Pinaev well knew.  </p>

In particular, it seems to me that Mr Pinaev’s statement to Mr Kounov that he should confirm with Mr Jemai that the price is in US dollars because he is the “trader” is incomprehensible. On any view, it is plain that Mr Pinaev knew far more than Mr Jemai; and, in my view, the only sensible explanation for this is that Mr Pinaev was deliberately seeking to distance himself from the proposed transaction. Of perhaps even greater significance is the later comment by Mr Pinaev in this exchange, when he is asked by Mr Kounov what exchange rate should be applied: “<span style="font-style:italic">As far as I know 1:1</span>”, which Mr Pinaev well knew was untrue, as had been confirmed only the day before by Norvik when they had specifically told Mr Pinaev that the price in US$ was “<span style="font-style:italic">3.65</span>” and in ARS “<span style="font-style:italic">15</span>”. </p>

This appears from a transcript of a phone call between Mr Jemai and Mr Pinaev on 10 March 2011 when Mr Jemai told Mr Pinaev that he tried to arrange for Mr Sergeev to sign a copy of the agreement by sending it to the hotel where he was staying, but Mr Sergeev proposed that it should be checked by lawyers first, which prompted Mr Jemai simply to forge his signature.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The documents show that Mr Jemai entered “sell” tickets into the TOMS system apparently confirming the sale of the warrants to Threadneedle – although, of course, there was never any such sale and such tickets were false. The evidence of Mr Jemai is that he did this on the instructions of Mr Pinaev – although this was denied by Mr Pinaev. In particular, it was Mr Jemai’s evidence that the details of the fake forward trade had been supplied to him by Mr Pinaev who forwarded him an email from Mr Popkov. However that email on its own does not give sufficient information to produce the tickets (e.g. it does not contain the price or the precise name of the counterparty). It is fair to say that there was further a email from Mr Popkov to Mr Pinaev also forwarded to Mr Jemai on 9 March which provided some further information i.e. it referred to a sale by OSL to “TNAM UK” at a price of 15.9375 (currency unspecified) but even this was insufficient to produce the tickets. In my judgment, the overwhelming inference is that Mr Jemai already knew the details of the fake forward trade which had been agreed with the other conspirators; input the fake tickets accordingly; and when he did so, intended Otkritie to be misled into believing that there was a forward trade and to rely upon it when it settled the buy side of the Second Trade. It is noteworthy that Mr Jemai told Mr Shamarin that he could not recall the name of the counterparty seemingly confusing “Threadneedle” with “Threadstone” – although, in my judgment, this seeming confusion was pretence on his part just as he feigned ignorance when he told the Swiss Prosecutor that he only vaguely knew the name of Threadneedle from it being mentioned by colleagues. Mr Pinaev admitted in evidence that both he and Mr Jemai realised they were inputting a fake ticket (because they knew there was no forward sale in existence) but his evidence was that they were instructed to do this by Mr Popkov. In my judgment, that assertion is a deliberate lie; the “sell” tickets were entered into the system by Mr Jemai with the full knowledge and active agreement of Mr Pinaev and Mr Urumov as an integral part of the fraudulent conspiracy. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In so doing, it seems that Mr Pinaev and Mr Jemai misunderstood Mr Urumov’s instructions (or his intention) because they had used the wrong price viz US$ 15.9375 per cent. That produced a total forward price of US$ 262,968,750, and therefore a high rate of return, well in excess of the figure that would produce 14% p.a. over six months. Shortly thereafter, it seems that Mr Urumov realised the error and, on or before 14 March, instructed Mr Pinaev and Mr Jemai to reduce the price of the fake forward trade, so that it would generate 14% p.a. over six months i.e.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the rate of return that (as I have found) Mr Urumov repeatedly told Mr Popkov had been agreed with Threadneedle. Accordingly, Mr Pinaev instructed Mr Jemai to replace the tickets for US$ 15.9375 with tickets for US$ 13.8425. The new price was calculated as follows viz <span style="text-decoration:underline">Buy:</span> 14 March 2011 1.65bn x 0.129375 = US$ 213,468,750. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sell:</span> 10 September 2011 1.65bn x 0.138425 = US$ 228,401,250. This produced a total projected revenue (i.e. profit) for Otkritie over 6 months of US$ 14,932,500 equivalent to a net return over that period of 14,932,500 ÷ 211,368,750 x 100 = 7% exactly, subject only to rounding error. On an annual basis, that is equivalent to 7 x 2 = 14% p.a. This is important further independent evidence consistent with and confirming Mr Popkov’s evidence that that is the annual rate of return that Mr Urumov had orally told him (i.e. Mr Popkov) that Otkritie would receive on the deal. It follows that the repeated suggestions put by Mr Peto in cross-examination to the claimants’ witnesses (including Mr Popkov and Mr Lokhov) that the rate of return was much higher than this figure were made on a false basis.  </p>

(Of course, if there had been a binding forward trade in existence, the price could not be amended retrospectively.) Importantly, Mr Urumov admitted in evidence that he saw the fake forward ticket. Realising this is fatal to his denials, he said that it was Mr Gherzi who had entered a false trade, and that he (Mr Urumov) complained about this to Mr Gherzi and Mr Popkov. That story was never put to either in cross-examination. In my judgment, it was a late invention by Mr Urumov which is not credible.  </p>

In my judgment, the Gemini-Arcutes Loan Agreement is a fake or a sham or both. The overwhelming inference is that it was produced to satisfy LKB’s money laundering requirements.  There is no evidence that Bordier was ever provided with a copy of the Gemini-Arcutes Loan Agreement. Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk lied to Bordier about the origin of the US$ 120m paid to Arcutes, by pretending that it represented the proceeds of sale of shares in a Russian company called Ural Pharma. Mr Urumov and Pinaev produced or procured the fake Ural Pharma SPA (with Mr Kondratyuk’s forged signature thereon), and admit signing it knowing it to be false. </p>

The underlying bank records show that these transfers were effected using convoluted and costly physical cash transfers. In particular, the records show that Bordier purchased physical bank notes from UBS for the purpose of the first two encashments (approximately US$ 20m on 21 March and US$ 16.365m on 23 March). In a bizarre charade (which Bordier has acknowledged was the largest cash transaction it had ever conducted), the cash stayed inside an armoured car outside Bordier’s premises for a few hours, while the bank recycled the US$ 20m and US$ 16.365m three times, with each lot being ‘purchased’ on Arcutes’ behalf (for which purpose Bordier debited its account), before being ‘sold’ back to the bank on behalf of Messrs Urumov, Pinaev and Kondratyuk’s companies (Sun Rose, Pleator and Firmly Oceans respectively). The proceeds – less the bank’s US$ 10,000 commission for each large sale/purchase – were then credited on the same day to their bank accounts as “<span style="font-style:italic">Sale of Bank Notes</span>”.  Taken alone, the Bordier bank statements of Arcutes, Sun Rose, Pleator and Firmly Oceans therefore do not reveal the identity of the recipient or source of these huge payments – although these links are recorded in internal Bordier documents.

These included what have been referred to as the Sun Rose IMA, the Gemini Cancellation Document, the Pleator IMA, the Pleator Delegation Agreement and the Pleator Supplementary Agreement. There was much evidence in relation to these documents. Mr Pinaev claims that he proposed and then insisted upon the use of separate agreements to govern his, Mr Urumov’s and Mr Kondratyuk’s individual relationships with Gemini. Mr Urumov, on the other hand, suggests that this was Mr Kondratyuk’s proposal from the outset. In any event, both say that Mr Kondratyuk came to a dinner at a restaurant in London called Ikeda in late March 2011 with two IMAs (each in duplicate), which were already signed by Mr Churin on behalf of Gemini; and that they each signed the relevant versions, keeping one copy for themselves and giving the other to Mr Kondratyuk.  </p>

On 31 May, Mr Jemai sent an email to various people, including Mr Popkov, in which he said that the forward trade could settle any moment if the client calls, therefore it was incorrect to calculate the funding cost until September.  As submitted by Mr Berry, it is my conclusion that he thereby intended to deceive Mr Popkov into believing that there was a rolling monthly sale to Threadneedle. Mr Jemai’s evidence to the Swiss Prosecutor to the effect that he was not involved with the forward trade was knowingly false, as was his evidence to this Court that he did not know the reason for the rollovers.  </p>

That is only consistent with Mr Urumov intending Mr Popkov to believe that a forward trade had been done with Threadneedle at US$ 13.8425 per cent so that OSL would pay out to Adamant on the buy leg, in the belief that (i) there was a back-to-back agreement with Threadneedle on the sell leg, and (ii) the market price was US$ 15 per cent or so.   </p>

This was the first and only time Mr Popkov met Mr Gersamia. The meeting was conducted in English. This is very odd because Mr Urumov certainly knew that Mr Popkov spoke English very poorly and both Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia spoke Russian well. As submitted by Mr Berry, the explanation would seem to be that Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia must have agreed in advance to conduct the meeting in English because they did not want to have a detailed conversation about the First and Second Trades. During the meeting, Mr Popkov asked Mr Gersamia whether “everything was okay” with the Second Trade, and Mr Gersamia confirmed that it was, thereby intending his answer (falsely) to assure Mr Popkov that all was well with the forward trade. </p>

It is also plain that the intention was that the list would be passed on to Mr Popkov or other Otkritie managers with the intention to deceive Mr Popkov and others by reconfirming (falsely) that there was a forward trade.

In part, they serve to corroborate the claims advanced. However, they were also heavily relied upon by in particular Mr Peto and Mr Casella in support of their would-be <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa </span>plea but, as already noted, their applications to amend their respective Defences were rejected.  However, in one sense such events do not – or at least may not – really matter at least so far as the claims against Mr Pinaev, Mr Urumov and Mr Jemai are concerned because there is, in my view, no doubt, that OSL suffered the loss which it now claims in relation to the Second Trade by latest when it paid over the sum of US$ 213,468.78 (i.e. on 18 March 2011) and that these individuals were at the heart of such fraud. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, I should say that these later events are – at least sometimes – somewhat confusing. That is so for at least five main reasons. First, on the claimants’ side, there is, in my view, no doubt that they (in particular Mr Popkov and Mr Lokhov) honestly believed that there was a forward trade ie “sell” in place with Threadneedle – although there was, of course, never any such “sell” in place. Second, if the fraud concerning the Second Trade was not to be discovered, it was important for those involved in the fraud to maintain the deception. The result in this case is often the weaving of a web which becomes increasingly tangled. Third, the need for some “escape route” for the fraudsters was obvious. In that context, there is, in my judgment, no doubt that their chosen escape route was at some later stage to try to offload the warrants on to Threadneedle which would, of necessity, involve the perpetration of a further fraud – this time on Threadneedle. The suggestion that one might hide one fraud on A by committing another (perhaps even bigger) fraud on B might seem improbable or even foolish. But I have no doubt that that was the plan - driven, I suspect, by the fraudsters’ hope of even more spoils. As already noted, although Mr Gersamia denies any involvement in the fraud on Otkritie which was the Second Trade, he frankly admits – and indeed asserts – his intention to carry out such fraud on Threadneedle although this proved, in the event, unsuccessful. Fourth, it is the fraudsters deliberately adopted a cunning and aggressive defence strategy which involved various nefarious strands including (i) an attempt to shift the blame ie. by saying that the Second Trade had been authorised not by Mr Urumov or Mr Pinaev but by Mr Popkov and Mr Lokhov; and (ii) an attempt to lay the groundwork to blackmail or at least intimidate Mr Lokhov by alleging that he had offered Mr Gersamia a bribe to assist in carrying out the proposed fraud on Threadneedle. Fifth, as time passed and it became increasingly clear that the original fraud might be discovered and that the intended fraud on Threadneedle might not take place, the fraudsters began to fall out or, at least, their relationships became somewhat strained.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In June, Mr Urumov told Mr Popkov that the market price of the warrants had increased by about 30%. Mr Urumov knew that this information was reported to Mr Lokhov. The evidence of Mr Lokhov (which I accept) is that he saw an opportunity to close out what he thought was the forward trade with Threadneedle before its scheduled maturity date in September, so as to realise a profit which could be split in such proportion as might be agreed with Threadneedle, free up liquidity for OSL and reduce leverage. It is important to understand that this thinking was founded on the false premise that there was an existing forward trade with Threadneedle – but of course there was none. However, as already stated above, I accept that that is indeed what Mr Lokhov thought; and on this basis Mr Lokhov asked Mr Urumov to arrange a meeting with Mr Gersamia in order to discuss <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> early termination of the forward trade, which would enable Threadneedle to sell the warrants in a rising market, benefitting both parties.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The meeting took place at the Umu restaurant on 3 June 2011. The evidence of Mr Lokhov is that at the meeting, Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia discussed with him (Mr Lokhov) the option of an early close-out, thereby confirming to Mr Lokhov that there was a forward trade; that Mr Lokhov and Mr Gersamia agreed in principle that Threadneedle would close the forward trade early, in a few weeks’ time, and split the resulting profit between Otkritie (75%) and Threadneedle (25%); and that this appeared to Mr Lokhov as a legitimate commercial arrangement. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In evidence, Mr Urumov said that, even on the assumption that Mr Lokhov did believe that a forward trade had been executed, this proposed arrangement was “commercial nonsense”. Initially, his explanation for that assertion was that (on the stated assumption) Threadneedle had already booked a profit on paper of US$ 3 (which, I understood to be US$ 3 per cent). Thus, Mr Urumov asked rhetorically in evidence:  why would Threadneedle give up a profit that has already been booked in order to refund Otkritie a proportion (he said 75%) of that profit? In my judgment, this explanation is obviously wrong in particular because (on the stated assumption) it rests on the false premise that Threadneedle had already “booked” a profit. I am prepared to accept that if such forward trade had existed, Threadneedle might have been showing a notional mark-to-market profit as at say the beginning of June but there was plainly a risk that the market price of the warrants would fall between June and September. All other things being equal, whether or not Threadneedle would in fact have “booked” a profit would depend on the ultimate market price on the maturity date in September 2011 and whether they would then have sold the warrants at that time in the market. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is fair to say that Mr Urumov realised very quickly in the course of his evidence that the explanation he had initially given was incorrect (although he did not admit any mistake) and he almost immediately offered a further explanation why he considered that Mr Lokhov’s proposed arrangement was “commercial nonsense” viz. that Threadneedle could have taken an offsetting position in the same securities and have completely hedged their position. I am prepared to assume that such suggested hedging was theoretically possible; a possibility that was endorsed by Mr Gersamia in evidence and also recognised by Mr Kasapis, the market expert who was called to give evidence by the Urumov/Pinaev defendants. However, such suggestion was never put in cross-examination by Mr Peto or Mr Casella to Mr Lokhov and, on that basis, Mr Berry submitted that for that reason alone, it is not open for them to advance such a case. Be that as it may, Mr Urumov’s hedging suggestion does not, in my view, assist in the present context for at least three reasons. First, although it was, as I am prepared to assume, theoretically possible, I have no idea whether or not such “hedging” was realistic and practicable and there was no cogent evidence before the court that such hedging was realistic and practicable. On the contrary, Mr Kasapis’ evidence was that he had not personally done any forward trades of these warrants and he had never seen any such trades. Second, I have no idea whether such “hedging” was commercially viable for this type and number of warrants in the state of the market at that time; and again there was no cogent evidence before the court to indicate that it was. Even on the assumption that this might have been commercially viable, it would almost certainly have involved additional counterparty risk (which may or may not have been acceptable to Threadneedle); and I have no idea how it might have been structured nor how much it might have cost. It would all depend on the perception of the market players (whoever they might be) as it stood in (say) June 2011 looking ahead to the maturity date in September 2011. Third, and perhaps most fundamentally in this context, the possibility that Threadneedle might have hedged its position does <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> make Mr Lokhov’s proposed arrangement commercial nonsense. At best, it is simply an alternative. Ultimately, the attraction of Mr Lokhov’s proposal to Threadneedle would depend upon their perception of what the market might do; the greater the perceived risk of the price of the warrants going down, the more sense it would make, from Threadneedle’s perspective, to accede to the arrangement put forward by Mr Lokhov. Thus, I do not agree that Mr Lokhov’s proposed arrangement was “commercial nonsense”. On the contrary, it was, in my view, at least potentially commercially attractive although, at the risk of repetition, it rested on a false premise i.e. that there was a forward trade with Threadneedle. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although Mr Lokhov confirmed that his voice could be heard on at least part of these recordings, the provenance and authenticity of these recordings are highly contentious. Mr Gersamia initially said in his second statement dated 14 March 2013 that he had <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> recorded any conversation with Mr Lokhov. However, in his third statement dated 30 June 2013 (served during the trial), Mr Gersamia said that, contrary to his earlier statement, he <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> recorded the conversation at Umu on his Blackberry which he had placed behind a cushion in the restaurant and which he collected the next day. He also said (in his third statement) that in August 2011 he posted a copy of the recording through the letterbox of Mr Urumov’s home. In his oral evidence, Mr Gersamia confirmed what he had said in his third statement and that what he had said in his earlier statement was false. However, the difficulty with Mr Gersamia’s evidence is that it is clear from the last few minutes of the Original Recording that the person carrying the recording device is Mr Urumov - because towards the end (when Mr Gersamia had already left) one can hear Mr Urumov and Mr Lokhov thanking the restaurant staff, leaving the restaurant and saying goodbye to each other. Thus, as submitted by Mr Berry, it is my conclusion that not only did Mr Gersamia lie in his second statement but that his latest evidence to the court is also a lie; that, for reasons that are not clear, Mr Gersamia has been prepared to deceive the court possibly in an attempt to assist Mr Urumov’s defence; and that Mr Gersamia’s claim in evidence that he gave away the device he supposedly used to record the conversation to “<span style="font-style:italic">the son of a woman who helps clean my parents’ house</span>” is, at best, difficult to accept as true.  </p>

I do not accept that evidence. As submitted by the claimants, this seems to be yet another brazen lie by Mr Urumov: as anyone listening to the last few minutes of the Original Recording can tell, the only two individuals who can be heard are Mr Urumov and Mr Lokhov, and the recording device remains with Mr Urumov as he gets into his car to drive home. That explains why the USB stick containing the Original Recording was discovered in the Dunant safe deposit box, to which only Mr Urumov and his wife<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>had access. </p>

If there were any truth in Mr Gersamia’s latest evidence that he was the one responsible for making the Original Recording, the natural conclusion would be that he was responsible for doctoring evidence by producing the Short Recording – although it may well have been done by Mr Urumov or by someone on Mr Urumov’s instructions or perhaps by Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia acting in concert. However, I recognise that this is speculative: the fact is that it is, in my view, quite impossible to reach any positive conclusions with regard to the provenance or reliability of this material. All that can safely be said in this context is that both Mr Gersamia and Mr Urumov have lied in court about the provenance of this material; and that it is difficult to imagine any purpose for ‘splicing’ the Original Recording in this way, other than to mislead the </p>

Although the detail is lacking, this is hardly surprising given the general nature of the conversation, the inaudible gaps and the surroundings in which the conversation took place. However, such a general proposal seems entirely consistent (or at least not inconsistent) with Mr Lokhov’s evidence with regard to his proposed arrangement. It is this part of the Short Recording and this Short Transcript which, submitted Mr Casella, shows that Mr Lokhov offered Mr Gersamia a bribe. The claimants were invited to agree this transcript by the Gersamia defendants, but the claimants say that due to the poor quality of that part of the Short Recording, accuracy cannot be established. The result is that this transcript is unfortunately not agreed. At the invitation of Mr Casella, I confirm that I have listened myself to this part of the Short Recording a number of times. In summary, my conclusions are that (i) it is impossible for me to say whether, even on a balance of probability, this part of the Short Recording is continuous or whether it has been “spliced” together; and (ii) there are various sections in the Short Recording where it is simply impossible to hear what is being said and which may be important in order properly to understand what is being said. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before considering what these recordings/transcripts show, I have to say that it was difficult, if not impossible, to understand the case advanced by Mr Casella on behalf of Mr Gersamia with regard to this supposed bribe. According to Mr Gersamia’s evidence, Mr Lokhov was asking him (Mr Gersamia) to organise a structure to take the warrants; that if he (Mr Gersamia) did this, there would be a “pay-out” for him (Mr Gersamia); and that it was clear to him (Mr Gersamia) that “<span style="font-style:italic">… it would be a transaction which was significantly off the market price, but he did not indicate by how much …</span>”. In context, Mr Berry submitted that this reference to the proposed transaction being “<span style="font-style:italic">... significantly off the market price …</span>” must mean a price which was higher i.e. above the then market price which seems to me probably correct. However, as submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that this is, on any view, nonsensical. Further, the difficulty is that such a case was never put to Mr Lokhov whose evidence was that he (Mr Lokhov) suggested that OSL would sell at a price that was higher than the intended forward trade but lower than the then current price. In any event, there is, so far as I can tell, nothing in these recordings/transcripts which supports or corroborates Mr Gersamia’s evidence as quoted above. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning then to the transcripts, I accept that the Short Transcript is, as far as I can tell, broadly accurate of what I can hear on this part of the Short Recording; that on its face, the Short Transcript includes a reference apparently by Mr Lokhov to the production of a “brokerage agreement” which, as submitted by Mr Casella, is capable of being a reference to an agreement whereby Otkritie might pay Mr Gersamia a bribe and that this conclusion is supported by the reference by Mr Gersamia to “<span style="font-style:italic">..a structure…yeah, I mean my personal, but my personal …</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and a “<span style="font-style:italic">..shell company, far away ...</span>” and the reference by Mr Lokhov to a BVI company which would be “<span style="font-style:italic">our company</span>”;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and that the Short Transcript also includes another important short passage where Mr Gersamia says that “<span style="font-style:italic">I</span>” (i.e. Mr Gersamia) should “<span style="font-style:italic">… get around 10% of the whole thing ...</span>”. I agree that, on its face, this latter passage would seem to amount to a demand or request by Mr Gersamia to be paid a kickback. However, the recording then becomes inaudible; and even on the unproven assumption that the recording is continuous, it does not in terms record an agreement by Mr Lokhov to accede to Mr Gersamia’s demand or request in this passage still less an offer by Mr Lokhov to pay a bribe. Given the covert circumstances in which the Original Recording was apparently taken, the lies made concerning its provenance and the other uncertainties and difficulties which I have already referred to with regard to both that recording and the Short Recording, I strongly suspect that the purpose of the recordings was indeed to trap Mr Lokhov and thereafter blackmail or intimidate him. In any event, it is, in my view, unsafe to draw any positive conclusions from this material. In particular, I am not prepared to draw a conclusion that Mr Lokhov offered Mr Gersamia a bribe as part of his proposed arrangement. </p>

It was the first time Mr Lokhov had met with Mr Gersamia since the Umu dinner, and the purpose, so far as Mr Lokhov was concerned, was to discuss further the closing out of the forward trade. According to the evidence of Mr Lokhov (which I accept), Mr Gersamia told him that the forward trade would be settled in due course, and that he needed a couple of weeks to sort out his portfolio; that Mr Gersamia stressed the need to maintain confidentiality so as not to inflate the market price; and that Mr Lokhov did not put any pressure on Gersamia, nor was there any mention of any bribe.  </p>

Although it appears that Mr Pinaev had told Mr Efimov that there were trading lines between Threadneedle and Newedge, Mr Gersamia was doubtful and there was a debate between him and Mr Efimov about the existence of such lines. It is clear from the chat that they were discussing the proposed trade in warrants between OSL and Threadneedle, via Newedge. The proposed transaction was priced at four times the market price. </p>

As appears from these messages, Mr Gersamia was trying to work out how he could enter the purchase on the Threadneedle system, in circumstances when he knew he would be asked why he was buying securities without having an onward sale to a third party.  His story was going to be that he had lined up a Russian bank as a buyer but they had unexpectedly dropped out. So, he asked Mr Pinaev to get one of his contacts (who turned out to be Ivan Kucherenko of Quickline) to send him a false message, which Mr Gersamia could then show to his bosses if they queried the trade. There was very frequent contact between Mr Gersamia and Messrs Urumov and Pinaev around this time. In contrast, Mr Berry submitted that Mr Gersamia apparently made only one attempt to call Mr Lokhov during this period (i.e. at 12.39 am on 26 July), which lasts for 8 seconds (hence, probably went straight to voicemail). I am not sure that that is necessarily correct but in any event there is no evidence that Mr Lokhov was involved in arranging an onward sale <span style="text-decoration:underline">by</span> Threadneedle to a third party.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 1 August, Mr Gersamia confirmed a trade for Threadneedle to buy 937 million warrants from Otkritie via Newedge as a switch at around US$ 16 per cent, which he knew was about four times the true market price. However, as a result of an error or a technical problem, Mr Gersamia was unable to input the trade into Threadneedle’s system. On 2 August, Tullett Prebon pulled out from the trade because their clearing house (Pershing) refused to accept the trade at a price of US$ 16 per cent. Therefore, the decision was taken by, in particular, Mr Urumov to do the deal direct with Newedge, without any intermediate switch. On 3 August, another attempt was made to execute the sale of 937,500,000 warrants to Threadneedle via<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Newedge at the inflated price of US$ 16 per cent, i.e. a total of US$ 150m. Mr Jemai (who was closely involved in executing and monitoring the trade alongside Mr Pinaev) issued a ticket on behalf of Otkritie, which was confirmed by Mr Efimov. Mr Efimov issued tickets on behalf of Newedge, which Mr Gersamia confirmed, and Mr Gersamia then entered the purchase of the warrants in the Threadneedle system. As he did so, Mr Gersamia was presented with a pre-trade compliance warning, but he overrode and ignored this. The plan was to settle the trade the next day, 4 August, when Mr Gersamia knew his boss would be out of the office on annual leave. On 4 August, JP Morgan (clearing house for Threadneedle) queried the price of the warrants and suggested that it should be the same amount but in ARS not US$. Mr Gersamia’s response was untruthful: he said he was<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">not sure why like that, perhaps has some pricing source issues</span>”, whereas he knew full well that he had committed Threadneedle to pay about US$ 148m (ignoring compliance warnings) for something that he knew was in fact worth about US$ 37m. In evidence, Mr Gersamia frankly admitted his intention to carry out the fraud on Threadneedle; and that he had lied to JP Morgan. </p>

For the avoidance of doubt and contrary to later suggestions by him, at no point during the meetings with Threadneedle investigators on 5 or 16 August did Mr Gersamia suggest that he put the trade through because he felt pressured by Mr Lokhov. In any event, I reject such suggestion: Mr Lokhov did not exert any pressure on Mr Gersamia. </p>

In particular, it is important to bear in mind that so far as Otkritie were concerned there was a binding forward trade with Threadneedle which would mature latest in early September 2011; and that, if Threadneedle did not pay, the initial fraud would almost certainly be discovered. In that context, Threadneedle’s investigation of Mr Gersamia (which Mr Urumov was aware of) was obviously a crucial event. Following Mr Gersamia’s suspension, the main events can be summarised as follows. </p>

He still wished to go ahead with his proposed arrangement and was still labouring under the (false) impression sustained by Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia that there was a genuine forward trade in place and that Threadneedle would be prepared to settle it early. With this in mind, Mr Lokhov requested Mr Urumov to set up a meeting with Mr Gersamia (who apparently was on holiday during part of this period). This took place on 17 August at the Four Seasons Hotel in London. In evidence, Mr Gersamia initially denied that he had met Mr Urumov in advance of that meeting but it is plain from records of calls and text messages that they did indeed meet – probably on 15 August at some bar. We will never know for certain what was discussed between Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia during that earlier meeting but despite Mr Gersamia’s protestations to the contrary, it seems to me that the overwhelming likelihood is that Mr Gersamia told Mr Urumov that he had been suspended by Threadneedle (if he had not previously done so) and that they put together some plan (the claimants say a “charade”) with regard to what they would say to Mr Lokhov at the Four Seasons. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The evidence of Mr Lokhov (which I accept) is that in advance of the meeting with Mr Gersamia, he had dinner with Mr Urumov earlier that evening at the Four Seasons to agree their approach; that their strategy was that he (Mr Lokhov) would stay calm; and that Mr Urumov was to play the role of “bad cop” as he was close to Mr Gersamia. When Mr Gersamia arrived, Mr Lokhov’s evidence is that they sat together in the bar at the Four Seasons. According to Mr Urumov’s evidence, he (Mr Urumov) did not sit with them but “<span style="font-style:italic">sat on a neighbouring table in the lobby</span>”. I do not accept that evidence: it is inconsistent not only with Mr Lokhov’s evidence but also Mr Gersamia’s evidence (when he says that they “<span style="font-style:italic">more or less sat together</span>”) as well as what Mr Urumov said at a meeting at the end of August in Milan. According to Mr Lokhov’s evidence (which I again accept) this meeting lasted over 2 hours; at the start, Mr Urumov asked Mr Gersamia why Threadneedle had not settled the trade; things then became heated; they then discussed the trade with Threadneedle, still negotiating the profit split; Mr Gersamia said that he could settle the deal “next week” although Mr Lokhov said that the deal must be settled “tomorrow”. As submitted by Mr Berry, given Mr Gersamia’s suspension from Threadneedle, these discussions and supposed negotiations were a charade. The claimants say that the obvious inference is that Mr Urumov and Mr Gersamia were seeking to incriminate Mr Lokhov, by eliciting comments from him which could subsequently be mischaracterised as attempted bribery; and that Mr Urumov must have recorded the meeting (as he did at Umu) but has concealed the recording because it would corroborate the truth of Mr Lokhov’s evidence and undermine Mr Urumov’s evidence. In my view, that scenario is speculative but certainly very plausible. In any event, it was only at the end of the meeting that Mr Gersamia revealed that he had been suspended, and produced a letter to that effect from Threadneedle’s head of compliance. Mr Lokhov was shocked by this turn of events. </p>

Mr Lokhov was shocked by this news but he believed that the warrants were worth US$ 15-16 per cent and that therefore Otkritie had adequate collateral. Mr Urumov knew this to be false but failed to correct Mr Lokhov’s mistaken belief.

The Urumovs now claim that they offered £19m for 42 Avenue Road on the basis of “<span style="font-style:italic">… Ms Balk’s knowledge of the market, and influenced by the general research we undertook, and knowing that the vendor was eager to sell ...</span>”; that 42 Avenue Road “<span style="font-style:italic">was an excellent investment for the Gemini funds</span>”; and that the role of Ms Balk was to manage the construction process </p>

I agree that these points raise some suspicions although I accept that this property had somewhat special features; that it was located in a particularly attractive (and very expensive) part of London; that its value may be a matter of debate; that valuing this type of property is or at least may well be far from easy; and that, as submitted by Mr Peto, the value suggested by the claimants may be an underestimate.  </p>

On its face, that seems difficult to accept: as it seems to me, no sensible investment manager would put all of his client’s eggs in one basket in this way, especially if the investment monies had really been advanced pursuant to an agreement that could be terminated by the lender with just a week’s verbal notice. Further, on the assumption that this suggested investment of some US$ 33m by Gemini was genuine, one would inevitably expect to see some record of its acceptance as well as some kind of evaluation, recommendation, analysis, presentation, review, monitoring and reporting of this ‘investment’, as required by clause 1 of the purported Sun Rose IMA.

Moreover, the document bears a strong similarity in many respects to a large number of other purported contracts between third parties viz Vandry Investments Ltd (“Vandry”), Tarmilona Ltd (“Tarmilona”) and Lamen Ltd (“Lamen”) (the “VTL material”) which, say the claimants, were produced by Ms Balk on previous occasions for the specific purpose of money-laundering. The VTL material was discovered by the Swiss prosecutor either in hard copy or on a USB stick in the Dunant safe deposit box. In total there are some 60 purported contracts with dates ranging from 2006 to 2010. I do not propose to identify all of them: a full list was attached as Schedule B of the claimants’ closing submissions. It is important to note that the claimants accept that this material does not relate to any money-laundering in relation to the fraud proceeds in the present case but other quite separate money-laundering exercises. Nevertheless, they say that they are entitled to rely upon Ms Balk’s involvement in the production of these purported ‘contracts’ and payments (totalling more than US$ 6m) as evidence going to her credibility and, more specifically, to show her significant previous connection to Tarmilona, one of the other recipients of the fraud proceeds; her ownership and control (with Mr Urumov) of both Lamen and Vandry; her past involvement (with Mr Urumov) in disguising the source and destination of money transfers, including by the use of shell companies and sham contracts; her knowledge that Mr Urumov engaged in such activity; her propensity to engage or assist in such activity; and, ultimately, her dishonest involvement in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud and the laundering of the fraud proceeds. In effect, the claimants seek to use this evidence as similar fact evidence.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This gave rise to some debate as to whether this material could be adduced in evidence and relied upon by the claimants for such purposes. In particular, Mr Peto submitted that the claimants could not rely upon the VTL material other than for credit/credibility purposes, on the basis that there had not been “<span style="font-style:italic">the usual kind of notice or disclosure</span>” such that Ms Balk “<span style="font-style:italic">was in a sense in the Mastermind chair …</span>”.  Thus, Mr Peto submitted, it would be unfair on Ms Balk to make findings on the allegations relating to the VTL material (to support findings on the ultimate issues against her in this case), because they had not been specifically pleaded and she had not had sufficient notice of them. Further, Mr Peto submitted that, if an issue upon which Ms Balk was cross-examined by the claimants went only to credit, then the claimants were “<span style="font-style:italic">bound by the answer</span>” and the court “<span style="font-style:italic">can’t choose to disbelieve the answer</span>” (the supposed “rule of finality”).

In <span style="font-style:italic">O’Brien</span>, the similar fact evidence appears to have been pleaded (or at least was proposed to be pleaded) – hence the issue of its admissibility arising at a CMC and Lord Bingham’s comment (at §8) that “<span style="font-style:italic">while, for purposes of pleading and disclosure, it was desirable and perhaps necessary to obtain a proleptic ruling in principle on the admission of this evidence, the final say, in relation to any particular item of evidence, should rest with the trial Judge</span>”.

I would not necessarily accept that submission; but I do accept that the authorities do not suggest that the admissibility of similar fact evidence necessarily depends on whether it has been expressly pleaded. For present purposes, I am content to accept that the position is as set out by Lord Denning MR in <span style="font-style:italic">Mood Music Publishing v.

As to whether Mr Urumov and Ms Balk had fair notice of the claimants’ intention to rely upon such material, Mr Berry’s written note on this topic set out in considerable detail the relevant procedural steps and correspondence which had taken place between the parties. It is unnecessary to set this out in detail. For present purposes, it is sufficient for me to say that I have no doubt that fair notice was given to Mr Urumov and Ms Balk. For all these reasons, it is my conclusion that the claimants are entitled to rely upon the VTL material for the stated purposes. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So what does the VTL material show? In essence, Ms Balk’s evidence is that with regard to Lamen, the documents in question were, in effect, all genuine consultancy agreements. However, she was unable to produce a single report, note, email or other document which could support such assertion; and, apart from a vague reference to some work she said she did for Heidelberg Cement and Barratt Homes, she was unable to recall any of the work which she said she had done with any specificity whatsoever. With regard to Vandry, her evidence was, in effect, that this was her father’s company and that she must have put the relevant documents in the Dunant box by mistake. In my judgment, her evidence with regard to both Lamen and Vandry (and also Tarmilona) is a deliberate lie. These documents – both individually and collectively – bear all the hallmarks of having been created as part of a moneylaundering exercise. If they were genuine consultancy agreements, they would have generated at least some further documents which Ms Balk would have been able to produce or at least recall in at least some detail which she was unable to do. In crossexamination, she sought to explain her inability to produce certain of these documents  on the basis that she had put the reports on a memory stick which she posted to Tarmilona in Eastern Europe. In my judgment, that seems most improbable; but even if it were true, it does not explain her inability to produce copies from her own computer. It is simply not credible that all relevant documents that might support her evidence have apparently vanished into thin air. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, the suggestion that 42 Avenue Road was purchased as an investment by Dunant for Gemini is not consistent with the contemporary documents. As I have already stated, Dunant is a Panamanian company with bearer shares. According to Mr Urumov, he acquired it at Bordier’s suggestion in order to separate his personal and business assets – although it seems to me that this explanation is (at best) inherently improbable (indeed highly improbable) because Mr Urumov already had various accounts in the names of Denning, Sun Rose, PUI), Tenway (and possibly others); and the Sun Rose account was entirely emptied into the Dunant Bordier account by mid-May 2011. In any event, the documents show that it was Ms Balk who organised their acquisition of Dunant through Mr Giovanna of Bordier. As submitted by Mr Berry, the obvious inference is that Dunant was probably established to better disguise the trail of the fraud proceeds: not only was it incorporated in a notoriously opaque jurisdiction, but its bearer shares meant that there was no corporate record of its beneficial ownership; and its only assets came from Sun Rose, which in turn were derived from cash deposits.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Urumov says that he opened the Dunant Bordier account on 24 March 2011 and that he told Bordier at that time of his intention to buy a property in London. In fact, the account opening documentation makes it clear that he and Ms Balk were the <span style="text-decoration:underline">joint</span> beneficial owners of Dunant; and Bordier was apparently told that “<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> want</span>[<span style="font-style:italic">ed</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> to purchase a property in London …</span>” It is noteworthy that there is no hint in those contemporary documents that this was supposedly for the purpose of an investment management project of the kind now alleged on behalf of Gemini or any other third party. Moreover, the documents show that the Urumovs gave Bordier a Moscow residential address, despite having lived in London for many years by that time; and that in response to a question about future potential payments envisaged on the account, the Urumovs told Bordier that they expected “<span style="font-style:italic">USD 20 millions re: the sale of the remaining shares of Uralpharm (inflow)</span>”. As submitted by Mr Berry, it would seem that this was obviously an attempt to fob off Bordier (who might otherwise have been concerned at the large and speedy withdrawal); but most importantly it gives the lie to Mr Urumov’s attempt to deny active involvement in the Ural Pharma cover story deployed to justify Arcutes’ initial receipt of US$120 million (see above). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifth, it is also relevant to note that the Urumovs had formed an intention to purchase 42 Avenue Road well before they had acquired Dunant and opened its Bordier account. This appears from contemporaneous documents which the claimants obtained from the Urumovs’ solicitors (Mishcon) by way of <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>order dated 23 October 2012. That disclosure shows that the Urumovs had targeted that property by 11 March 2011, just as the Second Trade was being concluded. On 14 March, the documents show Mr Urumov describing it as “<span style="font-style:italic">yulia</span>[<span style="font-style:italic">’s</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> project</span>”. By 16 March, the Urumovs had instructed Mishcon to offer £18m for the property. Mishcon described their clients not as Dunant but as the Urumovs personally. A draft sale contract for the property had been drawn up by 22 March 2011, showing the final price of £19m, and again this identified the purchasers as the Urumovs themselves, not Dunant. The documents show that Mr Urumov was apparently to be abroad from 27 March 2011 in Baku, Almaty and Kiev, so Mishcon drew up a general power of attorney in favour of Ms Balk to enable her to sign the necessary documents on his behalf. It is not clear when it was executed, but it was ultimately dated 28 March 2011 – with Mr Pinaev witnessing Mr Urumov’s signature.  </p>

On any analysis, the Urumovs had clearly lied to Mishcon, telling them that “<span style="font-style:italic">you </span>[Yulia] <span style="font-style:italic">are funding this purchase initially entirely with your own cash resources…</span>”;<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and Mishcon appear to have been satisfied in this regard by a reference from Bordier dated 25 March 2011, stating that Dunant “<span style="font-style:italic">is well known to us as a client of our Bank since 2011 and we are fully satisfied with the source and origin of funds</span>”.     </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Crucially, as submitted by Mr Berry, there is no mention anywhere in Mishcon’s files that the purchase monies were to come from Gemini (or any other fund, institution or lender); nor that they were the proceeds of any loan; nor that the purchase was by way of an investment for a third party, or in the course of a business, or anything of that sort. In my view, these contemporary documents point very strongly in favour of the conclusion that contrary to the case which they now advance, the Urumovs had truthfully told Mishcon that the property was to be their private residence, but lied about the real origins of the money. This is underlined by the fact that, after the sale had completed, they informed Mishcon (in the context of planning issues) that they were “<span style="font-style:italic">intending on installing a large mechanical umbrella in the garden of the property</span>”, which “<span style="font-style:italic">will only be put up when they are entertaining friends …</span>” </p>

In particular, as I have already noted, the claimants obtained judgment in default against Dunant and obtained title to the property. If this represented a genuine investment of monies belonging to Gemini, why did Gemini not seek to intervene and assert such alleged interest? It beggars belief that Gemini would not have done so if this had been a genuine commercial investment on Gemini’s behalf.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Moreover, it is important to note that by the time of the default judgment i.e. March 2012, the Urumovs say that they had in effect divested themselves of their interest in Dunant and 42 Avenue Road. In particular, the Urumovs assert that in August 2011, Mr Urumov’s health had deteriorated and he wanted to cancel the Sun Rose IMA because he was concerned that he would be “<span style="font-style:italic">unable to perform the IMA satisfactorily</span>”. Given that (i) the vast bulk of the monies had, on Mr Urumov’s account of events, already been invested for Gemini by the purchase of 42 Avenue Road; (ii) Ms Balk was supposedly responsible for the redevelopment works; (iii)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>there was little other money left to ‘invest’ under the IMA, and no evidence that Mr Urumov had done any investing with it; and (iv) there is no objective evidence that Mr Urumov’s health had in fact deteriorated, this assertion is, to say the least, lacking in credibility and difficult, if not impossible, to accept. In any event, Mr Urumov claims that in these circumstances, he spoke to Mr Churin of Gemini, who (i) agreed, despite it being Mr Urumov who wanted to cancel, that Mr Urumov was entitled to the £200,000 early cancellation fee (supposedly paid by Dunant to Balk’s account in two payments on 11 and 18 August 2011, totalling US$329,000); and (ii) asked Mr Urumov, without any explanation, to pay US$ 200,000 from Dunant to Mr Kondratyuk’s company, Firmly Oceans (which he did, on 19 August).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Urumov then says that it was later agreed with Mr Churin (by telephone) that Mr Urumov should deliver the bearer shares in Dunant to a representative of Gemini; and that he did so in Barcelona on 20 or 21 August 2011 (the latter being the day before he met Mr Popkov in Lugano to discuss the warrants trades), allegedly handing over the shares in Dunant (worth some US$ 35m) to an unidentified individual in return for a copy of an agreement cancelling the IMA (the “Gemini Cancellation Document”), which was, according to Mr Urumov, already signed by Mr Churin and which he (Mr Urumov) counter-signed and gave to the representative. The Gemini Cancellation Document contains a number of features which are, to say the least extremely curious. In particular, it refers to “<span style="font-style:italic">Urumov’s liability</span>”, when it was supposedly <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sun Rose</span> who had incurred the liability under the Sun Rose IMA; it refers to a liability “<span style="font-style:italic">of US$40 million</span>”, when Sun Rose had received just US$ 36.5m; it provides that Sun Rose would remain responsible for paying the “<span style="font-style:italic">operating expenses related to the investment assets of Dunant</span>” (clause (h)) – e.g. the utility bills for 42 Avenue Road; and bears a purported ‘signature’ of Churin that is a facsimile copy of that appearing on the Sun Rose IMA itself  (but is different from that on the Ural Pharma SPA). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thus, the case advanced on behalf of Mr Urumov (and also Ms Balk) is that, as from 20 or 21 August 2011, the beneficial and legal interest in and control over Dunant passed from him and Ms Balk to Gemini. However, (i) Gemini has expressly confirmed that it knows nothing of these supposed arrangements, and has no information concerning any agreement with Mr Urumov or Dunant; (ii) that it has and claims no interest whatsoever in Dunant or in 42 Avenue Road; (iii) the Urumovs have at all times remained as the stated beneficial owners of Dunant in the records of its Swiss bank, Bordier; and (iv) indeed, Mr Urumov himself travelled to Switzerland to access Dunant’s safety deposit box on 10 October 2011, just after these proceedings were launched against him, and at a time when he now claims he no longer had any interest in (or rights in respect of) Dunant. Further, the contents of the box – as disclosed by the Geneva Prosecutor – comprised documents all relating to the Urumovs’ affairs. The present position is that Dunant has no apparent owner or controller. Since January 2012, the company records appear to show that it has no registered agents or directors, as confirmed by the Panamanian agents in October 2012. As noted above, default judgment was entered in these proceedings on 1 March 2012. That judgment was entered by Flaux J following a hearing where Dunant was not represented although Mr Urumov was apparently represented by Counsel who opposed the application.  </p>

The court is, in my judgment, entitled to “pierce the corporate veil” in these circumstances on the basis that Denning was plainly used by Mr Urumov and Ms Balk as a device or façade: see <span style="font-style:italic">Tractor AB v Smallbone (No 2) </span>[2001] 1 WLR 1177 at §23 per Sir Andrew Morritt V-C; <span style="font-style:italic">Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest </span>[2013] 3 WLR 1. However, in preparing this Judgment, I have had considerable difficulty in identifying the relevant figure. The figure of US$ 2,675,000 would appear to be different from that stated in the claimants’ closing submissions and different again from what appears in Figure 6. I very much hope that the appropriate figure can be agreed; but, if not, I will have to hear further submissions as to the quantum of the claim against Denning. </p>

The fact that she was directly involved in setting up both Sun Rose and Dunant shortly before the Argentinean Warrants Fraud, that she was a shareholder and beneficial owner of those companies and a joint signatory with Mr Urumov in respect of these companies’ accounts all point strongly in favour of such a conclusion. However, in my judgment, there is not sufficient evidence to uphold the claimants’ claims against her for dishonest assistance, procuring Mr Urumov’s breach of contract or conspiracy in relation to the Argentinean Warrants Fraud itself.

On the contrary, it is her evidence that Mr Urumov had told her – and she believed – that the money/assets in Sun Rose and Dunant were being managed on behalf of a client i.e. that it was not their own. In particular, her evidence is that at the beginning of March 2011, Mr Urumov told her that he was going to be entrusted with an investment to manage in the region of £ 23m (i.e. about US$ 36m); that he was a very well-known investment manager; that contrary to Mr Pinaev’s evidence that being entrusted with this sort of money was every trader’s “wet dream”, the sum of £23m was not a significant sum when compared to the billions in the portfolio that he (Mr Urumov) was managing; that she knew that he would do the due diligence necessary or he could possibly do; that therefore she had no reasons to doubt that whatever decisions he had made were “proper and correct”; that he did not tell her and she did not ask who the investors were or where the money came from or how he came to have such a huge amount to invest; and that she did not ask him any questions at all about this investment because she trusted her husband.  </p>

Indeed, in this context, I would particularly emphasise that Ms Balk appeared to me (like Mr Urumov) to be highly intelligent. As she herself emphasised in evidence, she has no less than three degrees from top European universities with a particular skill in real estate management and her own company, Evangelina Property Group. According to Ms Balk’s own evidence, her role with regard to the investment monies was to identify the real estate asset and then manage the construction process and sale for which her company would receive a fee of 1% of the gross development cost of the project in addition to Mr Urumov’s own fee. Given Ms Balk’s intelligence, qualifications and self-asserted skills, it is not credible that, according to her own evidence, she did not know whether the investment monies were by way of a loan or not or whether there was a management agreement or not; that she had not seen any documentation; and that she therefore did not think there was any requirement to report proposals to the investor and did not know whether there was any requirement to make reports to the investors about the investment. In my judgment, these are matters which would be known – indeed be of the first importance – to anyone performing the role which Ms Balk said she performed if the investment were genuine. </p>

On this basis, it is my conclusion that Ms Balk is liable to OSL/OFC by way of damages and/or equitable compensation for US$ 36,978,000 and/or an account on the basis of dishonest assistance and/or procuring breach of contract and/or knowing receipt. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Part VIII: The Pinaev defendants</span></p>

In particular, the claimants say that the Conches Villa was purchased for the Pinaevs’ own family use; that the other monies received by Pleator were used for purposes unrelated to any genuine commercial investment including to indulge Mr Pinaev’s taste in expensive cars, spending more than US$ 1m on two Ferraris; and that the suggested “investments” or “loans” are, in fact, fakes or shams or both. As to the latter, it is noteworthy that the Pinaevs entirely failed – at least initially – to disclose their existence despite their obligations to do so under the freezing orders. When questioned in correspondence about the outbound payments to various entities (such as Haymoks, Mauchline, Calorna, Dalberg etc<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>, described further below) shown on other disclosed documents, the claimants say that vague and implausible stories began to emerge. The Pinaevs then refused to provide copies of the supposed ‘loan’ agreements, citing supposed concerns about confidentiality. It was only when the claimants issued an application for disclosure of the agreements and related documentation that the Pinaevs eventually consented to an order for production made by Walker J dated 18 July 2012. Since then, further ‘versions’ of various agreements have emerged to meet what the claimants say are the exigencies of the Pinaevs’ developing case which, say the claimants, are all fakes.

In summary, it is the claimants’ case that in early October 2011, upon learning that the claimants had begun legal proceedings (initially against Mr Urumov alone), the Pinaevs set about desperately trying to convert the fraud proceeds into portable and/or untraceable form – in the shape of CHF 500,000 in cash, a banker’s draft for a further CHF 2m, and three diamond rings worth US$ 4m – and promptly fled to Israel where they assumed new names; and that they also made arrangements to ‘park’ more than US$ 5m of the fraud proceeds with friends, mainly by wire transfers to Latvia (from where Ms Kovarska originates), pursuant to what the claimants say are obviously fake ‘loan’ agreements.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In May 2011, the Pinaevs purchased (in Ms Kovarska’s name) a large house at 194 Route de Florissant, Conches, Geneva (the “Conches Villa”) for CHF 20.4m (about US$ 24m) using in part (about US$ 17.5m) the money received from Gemini via Arcutes and Pleator. The balance was funded by a mortgage loan against the property from Julius Baer bank. The Pinaevs then spent more than US$ 1m on building and refurbishment work which apparently commenced in July 2011. In summary, it is their case that the Conches Villa was acquired for “<span style="font-style:italic">development and investment</span>” on behalf of Gemini. Analogously with the Urumovs, their evidence is that Mr Pinaev chose to make a commercial investment of most of Gemini’s money on Gemini’s behalf in that sector of his home town (Geneva) residential property market where families like his like to live, under the commercial management and direction of his wife; that Ms Kovarska was a skilled property developer and that her efforts to create a beautiful family home (for which purpose she even flew to Cuba to buy antiques) were undertaken for the purpose of commercial investment effectively on behalf of Gemini in order to sell it to a third party for a quick profit. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">According to Mr Pinaev, he considered that the best way to invest his share of the Gemini ‘loan’ monies was to put a substantial proportion of it into the residential property market where families like his like to live (ie. Geneva), under the commercial management and direction of his wife. On its face, as in the case of the Urumovs, that seems difficult to accept: as it seems to me, no sensible investment manager would put such a large proportion of his client’s eggs in one basket in this way, especially if the investment monies had really been advanced pursuant to an agreement that could be terminated by the lender with just a week’s notice. Further, on the assumption that this suggested investment on behalf of Gemini was genuine, one would inevitably expect to see some record of its acceptance as well as some kind of evaluation, recommendation, analysis, presentation, review, monitoring and reporting of this ‘investment’, as required by clause 1 of the purported Pleator IMA. However, as in the case of 42 Avenue Road, there is no documentary record of this kind – or of any kind – at all. </p>

In cross-examination, she said that she “understood” that Mr Pinaev had received a “loan”; that she did not know the exact number when he first told her about it in the end of March; that he told her a little later that he had received around US$ 36m from a “big investment fund” which had bought or was going to buy Saab or </p>

Initially, she said in evidence that Mr Pinaev had not told her the name of the fund although she then admitted that he did tell her the name of the fund (i.e. Gemini) some time later. In my judgment, her evidence in this context (like that of Mr Pinaev) was particularly unsatisfactory and lacking in credibility if the purchase of the Conches Villa was indeed a genuine commercial investment on behalf of Gemini or some other third party. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the evidence with regard to refurbishment costs was, in my judgment, also unsatisfactory and totally lacking in credibility. For example, Ms Kovarska’s evidence was that she had not drawn up a written account for the investor of everything that she had spent although she said she had an “account for myself” which was also available for Mr Pinaev. Further, Ms Kovarska’s evidence was that the estimate for the development was CHF 1.3m – and that this was the amount actually spent. However, the information which she gave to this Court pursuant to an earlier order of Cooke J was that the development costs were approximately CHF 2m. In cross-examination, she said that the latter was a “mistake” because she was in a “hurry” when she prepared the statement for the court – although I find that explanation difficult to accept. Further, the fact that she went to Cuba to buy antiques for the Conches Villa and that such trip was not (as she accepted) charged to the investor is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with this being a genuine commercial investment for a third party notwithstanding Ms Kovarksa’s explanation that they were buying for a residential property and that it was up to the client to decide if he liked the antiques or not. In my judgment, all these matters are inconsistent with or, at the very least, tend very strongly to undermine the suggestion that this was a genuine commercial investment on behalf of a third party investor or that Ms Kovarska honestly believed that it was. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, there is other independent evidence which is inconsistent with the case now advanced by the Pinaevs. In particular: (i) the Pinaevs’ private banker (Mr Giovanna of Bordier) gave evidence in Switzerland that he was shown around the house by his clients, in the presence of their architect (Patrick Schwarz), and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that the “<span style="font-style:italic">villa’s purpose was clearly to serve as a home for the PINAEV family</span>”; and (ii) the man in charge of the building work (Wahid Kamel of Renov &amp; Gestion S.A. in Geneva) has also given evidence in Geneva, confirming that “<span style="font-style:italic">the redevelopments essentially consisted of changing the layout of certain parts so that they could be occupied by the new owners’ children and </span>[<span style="font-style:italic">parents-in-law</span>]” and that the Pinaevs planned to move in for Christmas 2011 (and indeed Mr Kamel himself helped them to move some of their personal effects into the property). Mr Peto rightly points out that these individuals did not give live evidence. He submitted that had they given live evidence and been cross-examined, it would have been possible to expose their evidence that the Pinaevs intended to live in Conches as baseless and/or vindictive speculation; and that, in effect, it is of little, if any, weight when compared to the evidence of Mr Pinaev and Ms Kovarska who both gave “live” evidence. I accept that the fact that this evidence of Mr Giovanna and Mr Kamel was not given “live” and not tested in crossexamination renders it less satisfactory than might otherwise be the case. However, I see no particular reason why the evidence of these individuals would or even might be unreliable; and although such evidence on its own is, of course, not determinative, it seems to me to carry at least some weight to be considered with all the other evidence.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, at the signing of the <span style="font-style:italic">acte de vente </span>(the formal deed of sale)<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>on 20 May 2011 in front of the Swiss notary conducting the sale, Ms Kovarska formally certified that she was “<span style="font-style:italic">not acting on behalf of any persons having their residence or registered office abroad</span>”; and that “<span style="font-style:italic">her future acquisition is not, and shall not be financed by persons having their residence or registered office abroad to an extent that exceeds the normal rules in civil and commercial matters</span>”. As submitted by Mr Berry, these statements are flatly inconsistent with her present assertion that the monies came from a genuine third-party fund, on whose behalf this was a true investment. In evidence, Ms Kovarska accepted that these statements were untrue and that she had lied to the Swiss notary. However, her explanation for this was that she had lied to the Swiss notary in order to circumvent local regulations i.e. although she was permitted as a local resident to buy property in the canton, such purchase was prohibited if made by or on behalf of a non-resident third party. I accept that that is or at least may be true, but, at the very least, this shows that, on her own evidence, Ms Kovarska is both dishonest and a liar. Rather, given all the other evidence, it seems to me that the overwhelming likelihood is that what Ms Kovarska told the Swiss notary was true; and in that case, this shows that Ms Kovarska was dishonest and a liar in what she told the court. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifth, the Pinaevs’ evidence as to the funding of the purchase is also inconsistent and it is clear that they prepared fake or sham documentation. Thus, when giving disclosure under the freezing orders, Mr Pinaev said that “<span style="font-style:italic">sums totalling CHF15.224m were paid by way of loan and gift by Pleator and/or Pinaev to </span>[<span style="font-style:italic">Kovarska</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> to fund part payment of her purchase of the house</span>”. The Pinaevs’ solicitors then disclosed certain unsigned agreements between Mr Pinaev and Ms Kovarska suggesting that Mr Pinaev paid just over CHF 13m viz CHF 5.25m by way of loan (the “Conches Loan Agreement”) and CHF 7.8m by way of <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">an immediate and unconditional gift</span>” (the “Conches Gift Agreement”). However, in Ms Kovarska’s subsequent asset disclosure, she claimed to have borrowed CHF 7.4m (not CHF 5.25m); and to have been given CHF 6.9m (not CHF 7.8m) “<span style="font-style:italic">with the reservation of repayment</span>” (i.e.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>not unconditionally). There is no document recording any such “<span style="font-style:italic">reservation</span>”, which Kovarska now describes as a “<span style="font-style:italic">repayable gift</span>”. As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that this is an obvious attempt to reconcile the evidence with their story that the purchase was an investment on behalf of Gemini. When asked about the difference between the stated amounts of the “loan”, the Pinaevs’ solicitors merely noted that “<span style="font-style:italic">the balance of the loan is not documented</span>”.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On any analysis, as submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that the Conches Loan and Gift Agreements are further sham documents used by the Pinaevs to perpetrate a deception. Thus, the Conches Gift Agreement falsely states that the CHF 7.8m monies derive from “<span style="font-style:italic">assets PINAEV earned before </span>2008”. Even on their own present case, this is untrue. Further, as also submitted by Mr Berry, it seems likely that the funding was clearly structured in this way so as to give the false impression to the Swiss notary that the purchase complied with the <span style="font-style:italic">lex Kohler</span>, the Swiss law by which Ms Kovarska (as an EU citizen) was entitled to purchase Swiss property provided that at least one-third of the purchase price came from her own funds (hence the supposedly “<span style="font-style:italic">unconditional</span>” gift). However, the Pinaevs now have to claim that this “gift” was repayable (hence, it was really finance and not a gift at all) in order to explain how it could possibly sit with the supposed ‘investment’ on behalf of Gemini. As submitted by Mr Berry, it would seem that the purchase was therefore unlawful under the <span style="font-style:italic">lex Kohler</span>, and the documents must have been intended to support Ms Kovarska’s misrepresentation of the position to the Swiss notary. </p>

That account had been opened on 21 December 2010 but had lain empty and dormant until 8 August 2011 i.e. when it received the US$ 4m from Pleator. This was of course, just after the onward sale of the warrants to Threadneedle had collapsed (and Mr Gersamia had fled from Threadneedle’s offices); and on the very day that Mr Urumov supposedly dismissed Mr Pinaev from Otkritie. The monies were subsequently returned to Pleator in tranches, starting with US$ 2.9m on 31 August 2011 and ending with several transfers on 4 to 6 October 2011, just as (i) proceedings were launched against Mr Urumov and (ii) Mr Pinaev was opening an account at Bordier for a further newly-incorporated BVI vehicle called Molly Properties Corp (“Molly Properties”).

Again, quite apart from my conclusion that the Pleator IMA is a fake or a sham or both, it seems to me implausible (at best) that the movement of these monies formed part of a genuine investment strategy for Gemini. Rather, as submitted by Mr Berry and given in particular the timing of the original transfer, it seems to me that the pattern of movements on Delsga’s account at Bordier bear all of the hallmarks of a classic money-laundering ‘transit’ account; and that the overwhelming likelihood is that the original transfer was part of the Pinaevs’ plan to empty the contents of the Pleator and Delsga accounts at Bordier into Molly Properties and the RMML Trust, but their urgent need to move all of their assets out of Bordier when the balloon went up in early October 2011 intervened.  </p>

The implication appears to be that this was some sort of genuine investment; and indeed, Mr Pinaev’s evidence when cross-examined as to his assets was that this was a commercial investment under the GeminiArcutes Loan Agreement and the Pleator IMA. But the former confined the use of funds to investment in share of hedge funds which this was not.  The supposed Pleator IMA, while permitting wider classes of investment, called for written proposals and reporting but there was none (although Mr Pinaev now claims to have satisfied his reporting obligations by mentioning this ‘loan’ to Mr Kondratyuk). No due diligence documents relating to the Mauchline Agreement have been produced pursuant to Walker J’s Order. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that over the next few days, the Pinaevs resolved to flee from Switzerland to Israel, after spending the coming week (10 to 14 October) desperately trying to convert the balance of the fraud proceeds into portable and liquid assets or to park them in ‘safer’ locations.  In particular, Mr Pinaev told their private banker at Bordier (Mr Giovanna) at this stage that he “<span style="font-style:italic">wished to take back the entirety of his assets and take his business elsewhere</span>”; and on 10 October, Mr Pinaev and Mr Meleshko (the Pinaevs’ Swiss/Russian lawyer and a paid introducer of clients to Bordier) asked Bordier to close his account and give him the balance in cash.  (Mr Kondratyuk did the same at around the same time; whilst also on 10 October, Mr Urumov visited his safety deposit box held by Dunant, the company he claims to have transferred to Gemini three months earlier: see above.) In fact, Bordier was not prepared to allow the Pinaevs to withdraw all of the money as cash, but ultimately M Grégoire Bordier agreed with Mr Meleshko that the Pinaevs could move half of their assets to other banks, provided the other 50% remained at Bordier. According to Mr Meleshko, M Grégoire Bordier achieved this compromise by threatening to file a money laundering notification against Mr Pinaev if he tried to withdraw more than 50% of his assets. As it turned out, however, Mr Pinaev circumvented this agreement by using the monies to make retail purchases of diamond rings and lying about further wire transfers being to companies he owned. In particular, on Monday 10 October Mr Pinaev opened a new account at a different private bank in Geneva – Hottinger &amp; Cie – over which Ms Kovarska was granted power of attorney. The following day, Tuesday 11 October, Mr Pinaev went to a luxury jewellery boutique in Geneva called Chatila SA, and bought a 10-carat diamond ring for CHF 1,501,500 (approximately<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>US$ 1.67m). He faxed a payment instruction to Bordier from the shop itself. Mr Pinaev’s evidence at first was that he went back to Chatila on Thursday 13 October to pick up that ring, and to purchase two more, this time with pink and yellow diamonds, costing another CHF 1,796,500 (approximately<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>US$ 2m). This time, Ms Kovarska joined him. It was three days before her birthday, but Mr Pinaev has asserted that none of the rings he bought were worn by Ms Kovarska “<span style="font-style:italic">at any time</span>” – although he now admits that she acceded to M. Chatila’s invitation to try rings on. For her part, Ms Kovarska has a surprisingly hazy memory of whether she tried on any of this impressive jewellery or what happened to it thereafter. Later the same day (Thursday 13 October), Mr Pinaev visited Bordier </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With regard to these events, it is Mr Pinaev’s evidence that the money which he spent (i.e. almost US$ 4m) on diamonds was part of an investment strategy on behalf of Gemini because he “<span style="font-style:italic">became worried in early October 2011 about the Eurozone monetary policy and the possibility of the collapse of the Eurozone</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>I do not accept that evidence. Again, it seems to me a deliberate lie. In particular, at that time, most of the money was held in US$ and CHF; and on the day between his visits to buy the diamonds, he actually instructed Bordier to sell the US$ and <span style="text-decoration:underline">buy</span> Euros (acquiring some €1.1m from money in his US$ and CHF accounts). Further, Mr Pinaev claims that he embarked on this investment strategy on Gemini’s behalf, by buying diamonds mounted in rings from a retail boutique on one of Geneva’s most exclusive shopping streets.  He therefore paid the equivalent of VAT and (no doubt) a hefty retail premium, including the cost for the mounting of the diamonds themselves. Mr Pinaev’s recent explanation was that it is illegal to buy loose, unmounted diamonds in a Swiss shop – although Mr Berry submitted that this was untrue. In any event, it seems to me that this course of expenditure is inconsistent with such funds forming part of a genuine commercial investment on behalf of a third party. In summary, it is my conclusion that, as submitted by Mr Berry, the truth is that the rings were intended to be easily portable for the journey to Tel Aviv – where one of the world’s biggest diamond markets happens to be located and diamonds can be recut, resold and disappear for a small additional cost. </p>

This story is a recent invention which I do not accept. As submitted by Mr Berry, the idea that a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide </span>investment fund would wish, or even be prepared, to be re-paid in cash and jewellery (or that Mr Pinaev believed that it would) is inherently incredible, even without considering the facts that such ‘repayment’ is credibly denied by both Mr Kondratyuk and Gemini as well as what the claimants say are (i) the many holes and inconsistencies in the Pinaevs’ story (some of which were drawn out when they were cross-examined as to their assets in January and February 2013); and (ii) the obvious fakery of the documents deployed to support such case.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that the obvious truth is that, in the week of 10 October, to the extent possible, in the face of Bordier’s refusal to let Mr Pinaev take <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> of his assets in cash, the Pinaevs turned the Bordier bank accounts into portable assets, including the diamonds, CHF 500,000 in cash and a CHF 2m bankers’ draft, and fled with them.  They were clearly desperate to empty the accounts into which they knew the claimants would be able to trace the proceeds of the frauds. In particular, as submitted by Mr Berry, the Pinaevs’ account turns on their having taken the second and third diamond rings with them out of Chatila on <span style="text-decoration:underline">13 October</span>, and having them in the safe in Ms Kovarska’s Chemin du Pommier apartment overnight from 13 to 14 October. However, they clearly did not do so. In particular: (a) in her asset cross-examination, Ms Kovarska would not support the story that Mr Pinaev left Chatila with the two diamond rings worth CHF 1.8m on 13 October, and it is not credible that she would not have known, or would have forgotten, if he had done so; and (b) Bordier did not act on any payment instructions before Friday 14 October (and even then paid only with value date of Monday 17 October).  It is not credible that Chatila would release the diamonds before receiving payment of so large a sum as CHF 1.8m. Confronted by Chatila’s own evidence, and presumably recognising the force of the above points, Mr Pinaev changed his evidence asserting that the funds for the purchase of the second and third diamonds “<span style="font-style:italic">would certainly have been received before 9am on 14 October 2011</span>” and that he must have “<span style="font-style:italic">confused the precise timing of collection</span>” such that “<span style="font-style:italic">it must be that I visited </span>[Chatila] <span style="font-style:italic">on the morning of 14 October 2011</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>).

Mr Pinaev had no previous dealings with Haymoks.  He asked for no security.  He did no due diligence.  There is no document evidencing any negotiation.  The single email that is said to have been sent during the whole course of a supposedly commercial deal has allegedly been “<span style="font-style:italic">deleted</span>”, and is inexplicably irrecoverable. Mr Pinaev has belatedly, and incredibly, said that the purpose of the loan was to “<span style="font-style:italic">achieve a better than average return</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Mr Pinaev<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>initially refused to produce the loan agreement, citing supposed confidentiality concerns.

The fourth version was produced by Mr Pinaev on 14 January 2013, two days before his crossexamination on assets began, as “<span style="font-style:italic">the latest and most complete version of the final loan agreement available to me</span>” but, as submitted by the Mr Berry, was rapidly exposed as riddled with errors.  The fifth version was produced part-way through that cross-examination, ostensibly to support the answers, given in the previous session, that the “right” signed version was “<span style="font-style:italic">definitely</span>” in Spain. Again, it did not in fact do so because it was not signed. Thus Mr Berry submitted that the very multiplicity of different signed and stamped “wrong” versions of the loan agreement, about which so many different stories were told, and the inexplicable absence so late in the day of a “right” binding agreement, is itself sufficient reason to reject the story that this was a genuine commercial loan. I agree. </p>

As he states in §35.1 of that statement, the sum of US$ 528,861.81 (equivalent to €400,000) was paid to Mr Alexsandrs Petrovs so that “<span style="font-style:italic">… he would have the opportunity of being involved in infrastructure investment…</span>”.

In the light of my findings, both these companies were used by Mr Pinaev as a façade to channel the fraud proceeds and thus these claims succeed in full. </p>

Consistent with what is there stated in the body of the text, it seems to me that where dishonest assistance is provided by D by way of laundering of the traceable proceeds of the breach of trust/fiduciary duty, it would be remarkable if D were not liable therefor even if D was not involved and had not provided any dishonest assistance in the “original” breach. In my view, the simple reason why D will (or at least may) be liable for dishonest assistance in that context is that the breach of trust/fiduciary duty will not necessarily be “complete” at a single moment of time but will (or at least may) continue in the context of the handling of the fraud proceeds. As a matter of analysis, there may be other reasons why such accessory liability will (or may) arise in such circumstances but, for present purposes, I do not consider that it is necessary to consider these.

For example, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms Kovarska provided any dishonest assistance at all with regard to the Ferraris which were purchased by Mr Pinaev using part of these monies; and I see no proper basis for imposing liability on her in relation to the use of such monies to purchase the Ferraris even if, as I have found, she knew that Mr Pinaev was not entitled to such monies.

However, in the light of my earlier findings, there can, in my view, be no doubt that the claim for knowing receipt succeeds in the amounts claimed viz (i) CHF 14,720,000 i.e. the sums received by Ms Kovarska from Pleator for the purchase of the Conches Villa; (ii) €1,450,000 i.e. the sum paid from the Pleator account to Haymoks; (iii) US$ 528,861 i.e. the sum paid from the Pleator account to Calorna. Mr Peto submitted that such claims cannot succeed in respect of the last two amounts because there was no evidence that such amounts were in fact received by Ms Kovarska herself. It is true that there is no direct evidence to that effect but, as submitted by Mr Berry, it is my conclusion that in the light of the circumstances relating to such payments, the overwhelming probability is that they were part of a money-laundering exercise and transferred/received for the benefit of Mr Pinaev and Ms Kovarska jointly. Alternatively, it is my conclusion that these particular payments are, in any event, recoverable on the basis of dishonest assistance on the part of Ms Kovarska. </p>

But I have no doubt that he was an active participant in the fraud by providing dishonest assistance generally to the other fraudsters (including the provision of information with regard to Threadneedle) and by being prepared to pretend that Threadneedle was involved in the Second Trade. According to Mr Kondratyuk, that was certainly his broad role for which he was rewarded most handsomely by receiving a huge share of the fraud proceeds shortly after the execution of the Second Trade.

Without such an “insider”, there would almost certainly have been an unacceptable risk of the intended fraud being discovered before it was executed. Second, apart from Mr Gersamia, there was no other individual at Threadneedle who could fulfil this role. Third, the relevant communications which I have summarised above show that Mr Gersamia was closely involved in the fraud. In particular, the extended Bloomberg chat during the morning and early afternoon of 9 March (when the Second Trade was done) between Mr Gersamia and Mr Gherzi is, in my view, critical. I have already quoted or referred to the relevant passages of that chat in the course of events on that day. At the risk of repetition, the chat lasted on and off for most of the day. Mr Gersamia logged in using his Threadneedle account from his desk at Threadneedle’s offices in London and supplied key information to help Mr Gherzi answer queries from Mr Shamarin and others. I accept that the language is in places cryptic but, in my view, it is plain that Mr Gersamia was providing important relevant information including the name of the precise Threadneedle entity that would be contracting with OSL and the audited financial statements for Threadneedle. (Mr Gersamia obtained the documents requested from the head of Threadneedle legal department and asked one of the secretaries at Threadneedle to scan them, before emailing them to Mr Gherzi, who passed them on to Otkritie’s risk department.) </p>

I do not agree. As submitted by Mr Berry, whether or not Mr Gherzi had obtained this <span style="text-decoration:underline">general</span> information from Mr Pinaev (contrary to Mr Gherzi’s own recollection) it was Mr Gersamia who had provided to Mr Gherzi the identity and address for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">specific</span> entity that was supposed to be transacting with Otkritie, as well as the audited accounts, and who (as is apparent from the Bloomberg chat) was anxious that the Second Trade proceeded as planned by the conspirators.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The main thrust of Mr Gersamia’s evidence with regard to this chat on 9 March was that it was not concerned with any particular deal or deals at all but related simply to the setting up of trading lines in the abstract with regard to possible future dealings between Otkritie and Threadneedle. I do not accept that evidence. It is fair to say that there is one entry in the chat at 13:37:08 when Mr Gherzi says: “<span style="font-style:italic">… thanks yes it is for actt opening etc…</span>” but, in my view, it is plain from other entries that they are talking about the execution of a particular deal on that day which can only be a reference to the Second Trade. Thus, again at the sake of repetition, at 14:37:48, Mr Gherzi says: “<span style="font-style:italic">… everything is ok all approvals are given and they are closing as we speak I am being told…</span>”; and at 15:38:44, Mr Gherzi says “<span style="font-style:italic">… booking it now internally so assume all closed …</span>”, to which Mr Gersamia responds: “<span style="font-style:italic">ok</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> The conversation then continues with Mr Gersamia saying that he bought himself a “<span style="font-style:italic">big mac</span>” and Mr Gherzi saying that he was thinking along the same lines but that he was not sure if he deserved a “<span style="font-style:italic">super-size deal</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> Despite Mr Gersamia’s protestation in evidence to the contrary, it is my clear conclusion that the language used including references to “<span style="font-style:italic">closing</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">booking</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">assume all closed</span>” is not concerned with the opening of trading lines but is and can only be a reference to the execution of one or more deals; and that Mr Gersamia’s evidence that he was not aware of the fake forward trade is a deliberate lie. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, there is a number of other points which, in my view, strongly support the conclusion that Mr Gersamia participated in the fraud. Standing on their own, I do not consider that these points would of themselves justify a finding to that effect but in my judgment both individually and collectively they strongly support such conclusion. First, on 10 March, Mr Gersamia made some inquiries with Stral Zarkovic, a friend of his at BarCap, who had sold Snoras/Gemini some 600 million warrants for the purposes of the Second Trade.  On its face, this seems too much of a coincidence and inexplicable save on the basis, as submitted by Mr Berry, that it is likely that Mr Gersamia wanted to satisfy himself that he had not been cheated by Mr Urumov and Pinaev. It is also noteworthy that in the course of that chat, Mr Gersamia asked Mr Zarkovic whether he knew how to delete a Bloomberg chat. In crossexamination, Mr Gersamia could not explain why he had asked this question; and in my view there is no legitimate reason for so doing. Second, later on, in April, Mr Gersamia had two Bloomberg chats with his friend, Mr Supranonok. Mr Berry submitted that in the course of these chats, Mr Gersamia was in effect suggesting to Mr Supranonok that he should try a fraud in the Argentinean Warrants and that it was essential to buy the warrants. That may be right but in my view that is an inference too far. What is certainly noteworthy is that after Mr Gersamia tells Mr Supranonok that it is essential to buy Argentinean warrants, the conversation continues as follows:  </p>

But the items he was looking at, for instance, Portuguese banks, ENRC, et cetera, he should not put into that portfolio Argentine warrants.</span>” In my view, that explanation lacks credibility.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As soon as the Second Trade had been executed on 9 March, Mr Gersamia set about acquiring an offshore vehicle viz Templewood, incorporated in the BVI. He did so through Mr Vikrant Bhalerao at Clariden Leu. Mr Gersamia’s evidence was that this introduction was by Mr Gherzi. Mr Berry submitted that this was untrue in particular because he (i.e. Mr Gherzi) first dealt with Clariden Leu some two weeks <span style="font-style:italic">later</span>; that Clariden Leu was in fact Mr Urumov’s private banker; and that the overwhelming likelihood is that this introduction was made by Mr Urumov who was on the same day<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>opening a new account through Mr Bhalerao for Denning. That submission may well be correct although the conflicting evidence renders any finding difficult. In any event, there can be no doubt that at this time Mr Gersamia did indeed set about establishing Templewood and a bank account for that company through Clariden Leu. Further, in that context, there is no doubt that Mr Gersamia lied to Clariden Leu about his financial position. In particular, the bank’s contemporaneous documents show that he told Clariden Leu that the account would be funded by an initial expected amount of US$ 2m from “other Swiss banks” being “transfers from the client’s account with Swiss banks like UPB, Pictet, Lombard, ODA”; that his permanent residential address was in Tbilisi in Georgia; that his net assets were US$ 12m (including US$ 10m in property and US$ 2m in other investments); that his net annual income was US$ 2 to US$ 3m; and that he was liquidating a property investment in Georgia to pay US$ 7 to US$ 8m to fund the account. These are all very impressive figures. However, in crossexamination, Mr Gersamia accepted that all this information was untrue. Mr Gersamia’s various suggestions that he could not remember providing this information or that it was provided knowing it to be false on the encouragement of Mr Bhalerao and, in particular, to “get a better service” or that Mr Bhalerao simply made up this information himself are, in my judgment, not only mutually inconsistent but also deliberate lies. Further, in my judgment, Mr Gersamia could give no satisfactory answer as to why he decided to set up Templewood and to open this account at this very time i.e. virtually simultaneously or almost immediately after the Second Trade. In my judgment, the overwhelming inference is that Mr Gersamia did this in anticipation of receiving the monies which he had been promised for his role in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud – which as appears from Figure 8 is exactly what happened a few weeks later when, following a payment of approximately US$ 10.1m on 30 March 2011 from Arcutes to Belux (which was, as I have stated, a Hong Kong company owned by Mr Gersamia’s brother-in-law, Mr Dolidze), Belux in its turn transferred the sum of US$ 6.9m on or about 6 April 2011 to Templewood. The payment from Arcutes to Belux was described to Bordier at the time as a ‘finder’s fee’ for the Ural Pharma deal but the transaction was processed by Bordier without any supporting contractual documentation.  </p>

Mr Gersamia put his father, who was looking to undertake some business dealings on his own account, in touch with Mr Gherzi. Mr Gersamia Snr and Mr Gherzi met on a few further occasions and Mr Gherzi informed him that he was looking for opportunities to invest in the CIS region on behalf of investment funds with which he was connected.  Mr Gersamia Snr also recognised that this opportunity may be of interest to his son-in-law, Mr Dolidze, for his Georgian furniture import and retail business known as Belux, particularly since the terms proposed were very attractive compared to those generally available in Georgia. </p>

The evidence of both Mr Gersamia and Mr Gersamia Snr is that they met Mr Gherzi in March when this possible loan was discussed. In that context, Mr Casella relied upon a receipt for a dinner at an Italian restaurant when, Mr Casella submitted, Mr Gherzi met Mr Gersamia and Mr Gersamia Snr – although the contemporaneous documents indicate that this was originally intended to be a dinner between Mr Gherzi and Mr Gersamia alone. Mr Gherzi denies any involvement in any such discussions; and, in particular, his evidence is that the first and only time he met Mr Gersamia Snr was at a football match on or about 8 April 2011. In that context, the claimants rely upon a Bloomberg chat to show (as they say) that Mr Gherzi had not met Mr Gersamia Snr prior to 8 April 2011; and also a later email on 13 May 2011 from Mr Gersamia passing on, apparently for the first time, Mr Gersamia Snr’s email address. However, Mr Casella submitted that the Bloomberg chat is to the contrary; and that, in any event, Mr Gherzi is a dishonest witness. As submitted by Mr Casella, there is a paucity of documentary evidence either way.  Mr Gherzi has said that he has been unable to locate the email under cover of which he says that the Bexerton-Airdale Agreement was supposedly sent to him. For his part, Mr Gersamia Snr says that he has been unable to locate the email by which he says that the draft loan agreement was sent to him by Mr Gherzi. According to his (Mr Gersamia Snr’s) evidence, this is because: (i) the laptop which he was using at the time had suffered a virus, with the result that it lost most of the data in the process and was subsequently wiped and reused; and (ii) his emails are not retained on the server of his internet provider once they have been downloaded to his computer. In my judgment, both those explanations are lacking in credibility – as is Mr Gersamia’s professed “inability” to find his passport – or any other document that would show that he was (as he asserts) in the UK at the beginning of March 2011.  </p>

First, the suggestion that the purpose of the loan was to provide “working capital” for Belux i.e. to build a furniture showroom on a piece of land which he (Mr Dolidze) owned in Georgia is totalling lacking in credibility. It is true that some documents were produced to support such suggestion including certain architectural plans and a ‘project finance’ document; but, for various reasons, such documents were, at best, highly suspicious. Second, the terms of the purported Arcutes-Belux Loan Agreement are manifestly uncommercial. In particular, it provides for a 10-year, unsecured loan, with no interest payable for 2 years without any stated purpose for or restrictions on its use. Third, despite Mr Gersamia disavowing any involvement, the loan document itself is derived from the very same template as the supposed Tremlett–M Oil ‘loan’ with which Mr Gersamia accepts being involved in preparing (and which he now claims was drafted by his cousin, despite the latter’s ‘signature’ being another facsimile). Fourth, payments were subsequently made by Belux (from the supposed Arcutes ‘loan’ monies) to discharge Mr Gersamia’s personal liabilities and for the benefit of Mr Gersamia Snr, which undermines any intention of repayment. Fifth, emails from March 2011, obtained by the claimants from Threadneedle, give the lie to Mr Gersamia’s disavowal of any contemporaneous knowledge of, or involvement in, the payment to Belux and show that he knew that: (i) it was not a loan; and (ii) the lion’s share was destined all along for an individual (i.e. him). The email chain shows Mr Dolidze forwarding to Mr Gersamia Hong Kong tax advice from Belux’s accountant, who had specifically noted the money laundering implications of the transactions they envisaged, to which Mr Gersamia’s succinct response was “<span style="font-style:italic">so fck it… send it all to Singapore?</span>”. Sixth, the Arcutes-Belux Loan Agreement also included approximately US$ 2.5m which, as referred to earlier, was subsequently paid via Mr Gersamia Snr and Bexerton to Mr Gherzi apparently pursuant to the Bexerton-Airdale Consultancy Agreement which, in my judgment, is also a fake or a sham or both. Seventh, as already noted earlier, Arcutes was dissolved by its shareholders on 10 May 2011 which would not have occurred if it held valuable rights under the Arcutes-Belux Loan Agreement. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As stated above, on 6 April 2011, Belux transferred US$ 6.9m to Templewood’s account at Clariden Leu, Bahamas. Mr Gersamia’s evidence is that this transfer was a legitimate investment on behalf of Belux pursuant to the purported Templewood IMA. I do not accept such evidence for the following reasons. First, its foundation is (at least in part) that the Arcutes-Belux Loan Agreement is valid which, in my judgment, is plainly not the case for the reasons stated above. Second, it is inconsistent with what the Gersamias told Clariden Leu at the time that the monies came from the sale of property in Georgia: the payment reference was “PYT FOR AGREEMENT 01/07/2010”<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and internal bank documents describe them as the proceeds of a real estate sale to Belux. The Gersamias gave to the bank a fake contract to substantiate that story. (The Gersamias’ new suggestion is that it represented some sort of ‘security’ arrangement. However, that suggestion is, in my judgment, a recent dishonest invention.) Third, the transfers of the monies from Templewood to others (described below) bear no resemblance to any actual commercial investment. Fourth, Belux has previously been used by Mr Gersamia to receive moneys of dubious nature from the Urumovs e.g. a payment of US$ 46,699 from Tenway on 9 November 2010. It is my conclusion that the overwhelming inference is that the Templewood IMA was also a fake or a sham or both; and that the supposed ‘loan’ to Belux and the subsequent transfer to Templewood were the means of indirectly transferring Mr Gersamia’s share of the proceeds of the Argentinean Warrants Fraud into his control, whilst trying to obscure the trail by using offshore companies and accounts. </p>

As stated above, this was supposedly pursuant to the Gersamia Referral Agreement but, in my judgment, the overwhelming probability is that that too is a fake or a sham or both. The Gersamia defendants accept that the purpose of this agreement was to provide the funds required to make the payment to Mr Gherzi of US$ 2.5m. However, they say that their belief and understanding was that the purpose of such payment was a referral fee in respect of Mr Gherzi having arranged the loan to Belux. In particular, Mr Gersamia Snr asserted that it is not surprising that 25% of the loan would need to be paid in respect of setting up the loan since such payments were commonplace in the CIS region in which he conducts his business. I do not accept this evidence. Further, even if that were true, it does not explain why it was necessary for Mr Gersamia to procure Mr Gersamia Snr (and for the latter to agree) to incorporate Bexerton (again through Mr Bhalerao). In my judgment, the overwhelming probability is that such exercise was, as submitted by Mr Berry, a means of siphoning a portion of the proceeds of the fraud to Mr Gherzi via<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Mr Gersamia Snr and Bexerton thereby disguising the origin and/or beneficiary of the payments: it was dressed up as a ‘referral’ payment to Mr Gersamia Snr himself (not Mr Gherzi) pursuant to the Gersamia Referral Agreement for onward transmission via<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Bexerton to Mr Gherzi’s own offshore vehicle, Airdale with its account also at Clariden Leu in the Bahamas.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As appears again from Figure 8 and as referred to above, Templewood received US$ 6.9m from Belux on 6 April 2011. Of that sum, on 14 April 2011, Templewood paid US$ 300,000 to an account in Cyprus in the name of KD Shipping. As to KD Shipping, Mr Gersamia initially refused to identify the beneficial owner. In April 2012, he denied knowing the identity of the beneficial owner, but claims to have dealt with a director called Mr Denis Molodkovets whom he accepts is a friend of his and of Mr Supranonok. Mr Gersamia has said that KD Shipping is a subsidiary of a shipping company, KDM Shipping. If that is true then, according to its website, KDM Shipping is a Ukrainian-based shipping company specialising in dry-bulk river-sea freight in the Black, Azov and Mediterranean Seas; and KD Shipping is a Panamanian company, which only became its subsidiary on 25 November 2011 (having previously been owned directly by KDM’s shareholders). The circumstances relating to this payment are also highly suspicious. For example, on 19 April 2011, there is a Bloomberg chat in the course of which Mr Gersamia tells Mr Supranonok: “… <span style="font-style:italic">main parcel … should be there ready to pick up from post office</span>” which would seem inexplicable other than as a cryptic and disguised reference to this transfer. The purpose of the US$ 300,000 payment was originally said by Mr Gersamia to have been “<span style="font-style:italic">the provision of market analysis and advice in the shipping industry</span>” including a written report disclosed late (which the interlocutory evidence suggested was generic and obtainable from various Russian-based websites for a small fee). Although Mr Gersamia does not accept that, he acknowledges that the payment would indeed have been excessive for the report alone:  he now suggests that more advice was given or promised by way of “<span style="font-style:italic">consulting and advisory services in the field of physical agricultural trading</span>”. As submitted by Mr Berry, on any analysis, this would be a remarkable way to use US$ 300,000 supposedly entrusted by its client, Belux, for investment.  In fact, however, it is clear that the money was paid to KD Shipping on 14 April 2011 in order to be – and was then actually – funnelled by KD Shipping through to Mr Supranonok (presumably for future onward transmission to or use by Mr Gersamia).  Thus, through further disclosure applications in the United States (this time from Deutsche Bank), the claimants have established that between 21 April and 2 May 2011, KD Shipping made five payments from its Cypriot bank account totalling US$ 296,900, which were paid into Mr Supranonok’s UK account at HBOS. As submitted by Mr Berry, Mr Gersamia’s attempt to explain away this further coincidence is incredible and wholly unsupported by any evidence. It is also inconsistent with the banks being told that the payments to Mr Supranonok were for “<span style="font-style:italic">consulting</span>”.  </p>

Mr Gersamia’s evidence is that this was part of his investment strategy on behalf of Belux. In my judgment, this is plainly untrue because there is no evidence at all of any of these monies actually being used for any sort of investment.  On the contrary, there is ample evidence (obtained from Tremlett’s Swiss bank) of Mr Gersamia treating these funds as his own, including using them to pay his lawyers, SCA (for this action) and Burges Salmon (for advice in respect of property and trusts – of which he claims to have none); and funding the credit card, in his father’s name, to pay for a lavish lifestyle including more than US$ 72,000 on travel and holidays; more than US$ 34,000 on shopping and luxury goods; more than US$105,000 on restaurants, nightclubs and brothels; more than €27,000 at one nightclub in Sardinia on a five-day trip, immediately after his suspension from Threadneedle on 5 August 2011, for which purpose he also hired a Lamborghini and a Maserati; and more than US$ 30,000 in one night at a Moscow restaurant, on 11 December 2011, immediately after he had discovered that proceedings had been launched in relation to the Argentinian Warrants Fraud.

As to M Oil, Mr Gersamia initially refused to identify its beneficial owner; only when cross-examined as to his assets did he accept that it is a company owned and controlled by his cousin, a Mr Mgaloblashvili. In April 2012, Mr Gersamia admitted that he did no due diligence in relation to the company (purportedly because it was not necessary or appropriate given that he knew the beneficial owner); and said that he would provide a reference from BNP Paribas “<span style="font-style:italic">shortly</span>”<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>  No reference has been forthcoming. Ince &amp; Co. (acting for M Oil) have, on the other hand, said that M Oil <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> conduct (unspecified) due diligence in advance of the transaction, which revealed “<span style="font-style:italic">nothing untoward</span>”. The ‘loan’ document itself is odd, in that (i) it is based on the same template as the Arcutes-Belux Loan Agreement (ii) the signature of each party is on a separate page in which the text itself is different; and (iii)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the signature for M Oil is clearly a copy or facsimile. The loan was unsecured and fell due for repayment on, on its face, 26 March 2012, but has still not been repaid.  Mr Mgaloblashvili apparently told his bank on 11 August 2012 that he was asked by Mr Gersamia to “hold” the payment until further notice (although Mr Gersamia had said in his asset cross-examination that there had been no repayment until the claimants undertook to pay M Oil’s solicitors’ fees). Since March 2012, Mr Mgaloblashvili has funded £300,000 of Mr Gersamia’s legal costs, with payments being made from the very branch of BNP Paribas to which the M Oil ‘loan’ proceeds were transferred in January 2012. The day before the trial, the solicitors acting for M Oil, Mr Gersamia and Otkritie agreed that M Oil would pay US$ 250,000 to be held by S C Andrews pending judgment. </p>

This was shortly after Mr Gersamia realised that the claimants had discovered the frauds (and, in particular, the Arcutes transfer to Belux). The day before the payment to Liberty Bank was made i.e. on Wednesday 7 December, the claims (and freezing orders) against Mr Urumov were expanded to include the Argentinean Warrants Fraud. The following day, the claimants served Mr Urumov with the further claim and order and also, importantly, obtained a freezing order against Belux in Hong Kong. That day (8 December), the records show that Mr Gersamia spoke to Dolidze before travelling to Moscow for the weekend (where he spent more than €35,000 of the fraud proceeds at a restaurant). Mr Gersamia returned to London on Monday 12 December and began what would appear to be a desperate attempt to hide the rest of the moneys (as set out further below).  This included various visits, on 12 and 15 December, to Butterfield Private Bank in London. Mr Gersamia was also in contact with Mr Urumov that week, as can be seen from the text message Mr Urumov sent to Mr Gersamia on 13 December. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first of these large transfers i.e. US$ 1m paid to Liberty Bank, Mr Gersamia’s evidence is that this was an ‘investment’ for Belux, to take advantage of the interest rate of around 9%. Given my earlier conclusions with regard to Belux, I do not accept that evidence and the timing of such supposed “investment” strongly suggests that it was simply a transfer designed to put the monies out of reach. Mr Gersamia claims that the US$ 1m remains there, although he has been unable to produce any more recent statement than December 2011, and this appears at least doubtful. When cross-examined as to his assets on 15 February 2013, Mr Gersamia said that he had requested copies of his Liberty Bank statements on numerous occasions.  More recently, he said that the bank in Georgia was not co-operating with him and has refused to provide statements to him.  The claimants suggested a joint letter to the bank which seems a sensible proposal although (unless the position has changed recently) this has been repeatedly ignored by Mr Gersamia. In any event, it remains uncertain as to what has happened to these monies. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second of these large transfers i.e. US$ 3m paid to Jaspen, Mr Gersamia’s evidence is that this formed part of an “investment” of some US$ 3.4m in corn futures through Jaspen, based in Ukraine of which this sum of US$ 3m happened to have been demanded and paid urgently on 12 December 2011. I do not accept that evidence for the following reasons. First, the background to Jaspen and its relationship with Mr Gersamia is, to say the least, murky. Jaspen is, it is said, run by Mr Gersamia’s “<span style="font-style:italic">close friend</span>”, Mr Supranonok. The closeness of the relationship between Mr Gersamia and Mr Supranonok is illustrated by the highly personal (and often obscene) nature of the Bloomberg ‘chat’ between the two men; various transfers of other monies by Mr Gersamia to Mr Supranonok; and holidays taken together including one in March 2012 to Panama, which was funded from the fraud proceeds, with expensive air tickets being paid for by Mr Gersamia using his father’s Tremlett credit card just after Mr  Gersamia was joined to the action and his assets frozen and around the very time when he was apparently setting up a new Panamanian holding structure for his assets.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the suggestion that Mr Gersamia would ‘invest’ such a large sum of money in corn futures, with which there is no suggestion he had any previous experience, is implausible to say the least. He has disclosed no documents showing any communication with Jaspen about (i) the opening of a trading account (other than an incomplete copy of an Agency and Services Agreement seemingly dated 5 May 2011 (the “ASA”); (ii) the choice of asset to be traded; or (iii) the particular trades he supposedly instructed Jaspen to conduct. This is despite the ASA expressly providing for written trade confirmations to be issued and counter-signed for each separate trade </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">(see cl. 3.8). Equally, he has produced no documents showing any communication with Belux, on whose behalf this massive and disastrous investment was supposedly made. The suggestion now is that losses over US$ 3m were incurred in October 2011, despite Templewood having by then only advanced US$ 340,000 to Jaspen.  The balance, of exactly US$ 3m, was demanded and paid two months <span style="text-decoration:underline">after</span> the losses had supposedly being incurred. More specifically, on 12 December 2011, Mr Gersamia told Clariden Leu that US$ 3m was in respect of an “<span style="font-style:italic">urgent</span>” margin call from Jaspen to be implemented the same day. However, that explanation for the urgency is difficult to accept given that two months had already passed since the losses had, on Mr Gersamia’s evidence, been crystallised. Mr Gersamia belatedly produced a purported Promissory Note dated 1 September 2011 (with a maturity date of 30 December 2011) in an amount of exactly US$ 3m. However, it seems to me that this is almost certainly a fake and, as submitted by Mr Berry, probably a recent concoction.  As submitted by Mr Berry, this supposed Promissory Note would appear to serve no real purpose: it gave Jaspen no more security than it already had under the ASA. Further, the date is inexplicable. Even on Mr Gersamia’s own evidence, he could not have known on 1 September that the losses on these corn futures, which crystallised only on 10 October, would (with fees of US$ 199,975) amount to exactly US$ 3.34m, leaving him <span style="font-style:italic">exactly</span> US$ 3m in debt to Jaspen; and, in any event, he claims only to have instructed Jaspen to trade the corn futures at the end of September or beginning of October 2011 and that the losses only escalated dramatically on his account during the week from 4 to 11 October. In addition, the documents reveal other transfers (in particular US$ 120,000 on 21 June, US$ 200,000 on 2 September and US$ 20,000 on 4 October – this last payment having been transferred almost immediately by Jaspen to Mr Gersamia’s grandfather) which at the very least strongly suggest that Mr Gersamia was simply using Jaspen as a conduit to pass money to others on Mr Gersamia’s behalf; and it would also appear that between about 10 and 12 December, Mr Gersamia was preparing other fake invoices to justify other payments. For all these reasons, I reject Mr Gersamia’s evidence with regard to this supposed investment in corn futures through Jaspen. In my judgment, the payments to Jaspen including in particular the sum of US$ 3m transferred on 12 December 2011 was a money laundering exercise designed to park and hide a large part of the fraud proceeds with a trusted third party. </p>

However, it is unnecessary to lengthen this already very long judgment to examine these matters in detail.

For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that I regarded him (i.e. Mr Gersamia Snr) as a dishonest witness (like Mr Gersamia) who made a number of obvious and deliberate lies including (i) his assertion that it was “normal”, and not suspicious, for Mr Gherzi to be paid back US$ 2.5 million of the “loan” or “investment” his employer (a bank) was supposedly making to Belux; (ii) his evidence that he was still providing “consultancy” services to Belux pursuant to the Gersamia Referral Agreement; (iii) his denial (or at least purported lack of memory) that he had forged his son’s signature for the purpose of procuring from Clariden Leu a payment of US$ 200,000 of the fraud proceeds to his personal bank account; and (iv) his explanations with regard to his purported inability to provide proper disclosure. Mr Gersamia Sr also admitted that he knew his son used a credit card issued in his (the father’s) name, although (when he eventually answered the question) he claimed not to know whether the credit card issuer knew this; and that there was no genuine sale of the land, as suggested in the fake contract he said he prepared (although he incredibly denied knowing that it was going to be presented to a bank to justify Templewood’s receipt of the fraud proceeds). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As already summarised above, the claims against Mr Jemai are advanced on various bases viz breach of contract, dishonest assistance of breaches of fiduciary duty by Mr Urumov, Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk, conspiracy, deceit and knowing receipt. The remedies sought are damages and/or equitable compensation in the sum of US$ 150,933,750 alternatively US$ 35.8m alternatively US$ 15.8m and/or an account. Before considering these various claims, these figures require some explanation. The first of these figures i.e. US$ 150,933,750 represents, of course, the loss which I have already found was suffered by Otkritie as a result of the Second Trade and, in broad terms, the claim in support of such figure is founded on the claimants’ allegation (supported by the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk) that Mr Jemai was an active and dishonest participant in the Second Trade. Again in broad terms, the alternative claim for US$ 35.8m is based upon what the claimants say is Mr Jemai’s involvement in relation to the receipt and dissipation of Mr Kondratyuk's (gross) share of the fraud proceeds and which was channelled through Jecot; and the further alternative claim for US$ 15.8m is based upon what the claimants say is Mr Jemai's own share of the fraud proceeds which Mr Kondratyuk in effect agreed to pay Mr Jemai out of his (gross) share. Again, these claims are supported by the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk. In particular, it is the claimants’ case, consistent with Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence as noted above, that he (Mr Kondratyuk) agreed with Mr Jemai that his share of the fraud proceeds would be kept for the time being by Mr Kondratyuk whilst he (Mr Jemai) and his mother (Mrs Jemai) planned how to launder his (Mr Jemai’s) share through Jecot and various banks with which the Jemais had contact (including Baltikums Bank in Latvia and the Bank of Azerbaijan). As appears below, it is the claimants’ case that this is indeed what happened. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to these claims, there is no doubt, as I have already described above, that Mr Jemai was directly involved in the booking of the buy side of the Argentinean Warrants Fraud from Adamant which led to the payment by OSL of the grossly inflated price for these warrants and the loss to OSL of US$ 150,933,750. There is equally no doubt that he was also directly involved in the internal booking of what was, in truth, the phantom sale of the warrants to Threadneedle. Mr Smith readily accepted that these facts were indisputable. He also accepted and indeed positively asserted that Messrs Kondratyuk, Urumov and Pinaev all made very serious amounts of money i.e. millions of dollars each from the Sign-On Fraud; and that Mr Kondratyuk was one of three persons who directly owned the company Arcutes which received US$ 120m from the alleged fraud in relation to the Second Trade. Although Mr Smith did not formally admit the involvement of Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud, he did not seek to suggest otherwise. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in essence, Mr Smith submitted that Mr Jemai acted innocently throughout on the instructions of Mr Pinaev; that his involvement was subsidiary to the involvement of other colleagues at Otkritie (including Ms Melnikayte and Mr Mufti) who were equally mistaken and misled about the nature and pricing of the Argentinean Warrants; that it was Mr Pinaev who obviously managed to persuade Mr Bojidar Kounov, the Managing Director of Adamant, to act as a switch with a price in US$ based on a US$/ARS exchange rate of 1:1; that it was Mr Pinaev who then completed the Second Trade; and that Mr Jemai then entered the tickets for the trade under the instructions of Mr Pinaev and actually mistakenly entered the trade in ARS when creating the ticket for the trade which is inconsistent with the claimant's allegations. In effect, it was Mr Smith's submission that Mr Jemai was an innocent dupe. </p>

Creating a role and reward for Mr Jemai minimised Mr Kondratyuk's own role and reward for the Second Trade. Instead of having to accept that he received US$ 36.5m, he was able to shift more than US$ 15m of the benefit and therefore the blame away from himself and on to Mr Jemai which one would expect would have had a significant impact on his sentence in the Swiss proceedings as would have been known to Mr Kondratyuk. Indeed, the result of Mr Kondratyuk's plea-bargain was a much reduced prison sentence and made him eligible for release on 27 March 2013 after only one year and four months in prison. This also made it feasible or at least easier for Mr Kondratyuk to settle the claimants’ case from the assets he had available to him. </p>

In that context, Mr Smith relied upon a number of matters including Mr Jemai's youth; the fact that this was his first serious job; the fact that, contrary to the claimants’ case, Mr Jemai was not a “trader” but simply an “assistant” and although he had what was called a “traders’ login”, this was simply a “necessity” given that he was preparing tickets and doing other tasks on Bloomberg like (for example) Ms Melnikayte; his enthusiasm to learn and advance in his new career; his admiration for and trust in his work colleagues; the fact that he was not a seasoned fraudster and indeed the absence of any suggestion whatsoever that he has any past misdemeanours of any kind; that the theft of some US$ 160m from an employer is not an entry level crime but the work of a career fraudster and/or somebody who has serious reasons to be disaffected with his workplace which Mr Jemai was not.

In particular, Mr Smith submitted that the central explanation given by Mr Pinaev to a number of people was that, outside Argentina, the Argentinean warrants were traded in and settled in dollars irrespective of their designated Peso denomination; that the 1:1 US$/ARS exchange rate which has loomed so large in much of the claimants’ case is an interesting feature that is ultimately a red- herring; that according to Mr Pinaev's instructions the 1:1 rate was to be used as a device for ensuring what he said was the correct US$ price which could be entered into the bank's records and systems; and that it cannot be seriously suggested that any representations made by Mr Jemai (or indeed anybody else) contained a representation relied on by the bank that the prevailing rate was 1:1.

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, seeing and hearing Mr Jemai give evidence, I readily accept that he was or at least appeared to be very different from (say) Mr Urumov, Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Pinaev. He was certainly younger than any of these individuals. He lacked their charisma and was much less confident. His salary was relatively low: some 50,000 roubles (equivalent to approximately US$ 1,000) per month when he joined Otkritie in 2010, increased to 180,000 roubles (approximately US$ 3,500) per month in the Spring of 2011. Even with bonuses, his salary package was peanuts compared to those of Mr Urumov, Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk. My general impression is that he was, in effect, in thrall of them - ready to do their bidding. It is unsurprising that Mr Pinaev referred to him as the “little monkey”. It is plain that he could hardly pay for his own living expenses during this period and depended on the generosity of others including his so-called friends (e.g. Mr Pinaev and Mr Kondratyuk) and his mother. In truth, it seemed to me that Mr Jemai was an individual driven by greed, desperate to be “one of the big boys” and to live the lavish lifestyle that they all enjoyed - as was demonstrated by the fact that he decided to splash out and buy a Ferrari with the monies which he subsequently received in 2011. I agree that this picture might be said to lend at least some support to Mr Smith’s general submission that Mr Jemai was an innocent dupe. However, I do not accept that it was inherently improbable that he would become involved in a dishonest fraud – on the contrary, the general characteristics which I have identified might be said to suggest the opposite. Nor do I accept that there is any real force in Mr Smith’s rhetorical question: as submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that there was a very real advantage to the other fraudsters to have someone like Mr Jemai as part of the team who would, in effect, be the person who would pull the trigger; and whom they could all blame if everything went wrong. Further, it is highly relevant, in my view, that in the months after Mr Jemai joined Otkritie, he developed what was obviously a close relationship not only with Mr Kondratyuk but also with Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev. In particular, he generally attended the lavish parties – and, as I have said, also went skiing with Mr Kondratyuk in the days immediately preceding the Second Trade. Given such a close relationship, it seems to me somewhat unrealistic to suppose that Mr Jemai was totally unaware of the massive fraud that was shortly due to be implemented – although I accept that this is somewhat speculative. Be all this as it may, it seems to me that the right approach is to consider Mr Jemai’s position having regard to the relevant events which I have already described and the evidence concerning his particular role and involvement in such events and the subsequent use made of the fraud proceeds. In that context, I propose, at least initially, to put on one side the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk. </p>

This was contradicted not only by Mr Kondratyuk (whose evidence I put on one side) but also by Mr Pinaev as well as by his colleagues (including Messrs Mufti and Gherzi) and by the contemporaneous documents (many disclosed at his request after he had committed himself to his story) showing his increasing role within Otkritie and his early active involvement in trading even though such trading may not have been extensive and been carried out under the supervision of Mr Pinaev. Even putting on one side the question as to whether or not Mr Jemai was a “trader” in the full sense of that word and accepting fully that he certainly did not have the experience of someone like Mr Pinaev, I have no doubt that by (say) February 2011, he well understood at least in general terms the operations necessary to carry out trades in relation to securities such as the Argentinean warrants including the ticketing system. His evidence suggesting otherwise was in my view disingenuous. </p>

However, that is difficult, if not impossible, to accept if only because he has given mutually inconsistent explanations of who gave him such instructions when he was asked questions about this after the balloon went up. Initially, Mr Jemai said it was Mr Urumov who gave him the instructions. A few days later he said that he could not remember who had given him instructions. Finally, he said that it was Mr Pinaev who gave him the instructions. In my judgment, the most likely explanation for these different versions of who gave Mr Jemai instructions is that, contrary to Mr Jemai’s present case, he did not act innocently on the instructions of Mr Pinaev but that Mr </p>

Be that as it may, Mr Smith's response is that the subsequent telephone conversation between Mr Pinaev and Mr Jemai a few hours later shows that Mr Jemai did not act dishonestly; that, on the contrary, what happened in that conversation was that Mr Pinaev bullied Mr Jemai into following his instructions, in effect pulling the wool over his eyes and giving him ammunition to go back to Miss Mikhailova; and that, if anything, this confirms that Mr Jemai was an innocent dupe. Mr Berry accepted that on its own that conversation could be interpreted in that way. However, as submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that Mr Jemai stood in a different position from the other individuals referred to by Mr Smith; and that notwithstanding what Mr Pinaev was telling Mr Jemai, no person in the position of Mr Jemai could honestly have believed that what Mr Pinaev said was true. Even on Mr Jemai’s own evidence, it seems to me that he simply agreed to follow Mr Pinaev’s instructions and was dishonestly reckless (in the legal ie <span style="font-style:italic">Derry v Peek </span>sense) as to whether it was true or not. Further, again as submitted by Mr Berry, if Mr Jemai was innocent, it seems inconceivable that Mr Pinaev would have trusted him to tell this lie to the middle office. The same points arise subsequently viz. later on the same day in the course of the discussions with Ms Sharipova; when Mr Shamarin raises his query about prices including currency; and, on 9 March, when Mr Jemai drafted the response to Mr Shamarin’s email (including the statement that: <span style="font-style:italic">“For this security, Argentine peso prices are strictly for the local market” </span>which was obviously untrue as Mr Jemai must have known). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, it is common ground that Mr Jemai physically made the inward trades on the buy side and entered the tickets with Mr Kounov of Adamant. In my judgment, it follows from everything I have said that in so doing he knew that the price entered for such trades was false or at the very least was dishonestly reckless as to whether such price was true or false. Even on the assumption that Mr Jemai was just an “assistant”, it seems to me necessarily to follow that at the very least, this exercise demonstrates that he knew the process necessary for booking and ticketing the trades. However, if Mr Jemai was honest, what follows is then inexplicable i.e. what he does – almost immediately – is to put into the system two purported “sell” tickets (for 800,000 and 850,000 warrants) for the supposed sale to Threadneedle. According to Mr Jemai this was done on Mr Pinaev’s instructions. However, even putting on one side the fact that Mr Pinaev denies giving such instructions, there were no accepted tickets with Threadneedle as Mr Jemai well knew: there was, in my judgment, no honest basis for Mr Jemai to put into the system these two “sell” tickets. Thus, in my view, it must necessarily follow that Mr Jemai knew that there was no sell contract with Threadneedle or at the very least that he was dishonestly reckless as to whether such sell contract(s) existed or not. The same points apply <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori </span>when on 14 March the sell tickets were changed.  </p>

Mr Jemai’s evidence was that such similarity of name was coincidental which I find difficult to accept. Fanteks is a New Zealand company registered in the name of Jevgenijs Parsins<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>(which is another name used by Mr Jemai, using the Latvian version of his forename and the family name of his biological father). Originally, Mr Jemai told the Swiss prosecutor that Fanteks was some kind of partnership with a Mr Zen Pang (which Mr Peng himself denied). However, Mr Jemai has now admitted that this is his company. Further, a few weeks after the Second Trade, Mr Jemai went to Latvia to open a bank account at Baltikums Bank in the name of Fanteks. Despite initial assertions – or at least suggestions - by Mr Jemai that he did not travel to Latvia at this time, the contemporaneous documents plainly show that this bank account was opened by Mr Jemai on or about 28 March 2011 having given the bank false information about himself and his business. In my judgment, this timing cannot be a coincidence: the overwhelming inference is that Mr Jemai set up Fanteks and opened the Baltikums bank account for the purpose of receiving his share of the fraud proceeds. </p>

Mr Pinaev’s evidence was that he never arranged this payment; that it was rather arranged by Mr Kondratyuk who asked him and Mr Urumov to agree to make the payment; that the details of the Vantax bank account were provided by Mr Kondratyuk; that he (Mr Pinaev) was not aware that it was Mr Jemai or possibly his mother or sister who had asked for this payment of US$ 400,000 to be made to Vantax; and that he was not aware that Vantax was owned by Jemai family interests. In effect, Mr Pinaev denied (or at least refused to admit) that Mr Jemai had wanted this money as an advance of his share of the share proceeds. In any event, the contemporaneous documents plainly show that the actual instructions to the bank to make the payment were given by Mr Pinaev and that both Mr Urumov and Mr Kondratyuk agreed. At the very least, it is abundantly clear that the payment was made from the Arcutes account to Vantax’s account with the knowledge and agreement of Mr Pinaev, Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Urumov. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, this explanation is not credible for a number of reasons. First, it does not address the fundamental point arising out of the fact that the sum of US$ 400,000 received by Vantax from Arcutes on 21 March was plainly the proceeds of fraud (for the reasons stated above) and virtually identical to the sum paid out by Vantax to Fanteks on 31 March. Absent a satisfactory explanation as to why these two apparently matching payments so close in time were not linked, I do not accept that the monies received by Fanteks were not related to the fraud. In essence, the evidence of Mrs Jemai was that the payment from Arcutes to Vantax was in fact a loan by Mr Kondratyuk to Jecot but paid directly to Vantax so that it could be paid on to BNP Paribas on Jecot’s behalf so that Jecot’s Russian clients would not lose credibility with the bank due to the delayed payment; and that there was, in effect, no linkage between the sum received by Vantax from Arcutes on 21 March and the virtually identical sum paid on to Fanteks 10 days later on 31 March. I do not accept that evidence. Putting aside the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk and the apparent dispute between him and Mr Pinaev as to whether the decision to make the payment was that of Mr Kondratyuk or Mr Pinaev, it is plain from the contemporaneous documents that at the very least the original payment of (say) US$ 400,000 was made from the Arcutes Bordier account with the agreement of Mr Pinaev, Mr Urumov and Mr Kondratyuk. Given my earlier conclusions, it is thus plain, as I have said, that this money was part of the fraud proceeds. Therefore Mrs Jemai’s explanation is not only inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk but at odds with the contemporaneous documents. Further, that explanation is, in my judgment, simply not credible given that the payment was made by Arcutes to Vantax so close in time i.e. within only a few days of the settlement of the Second Trade and on the very same day (i.e. 21 March) as the other first tranches were made by Arcutes to Sun Rose, Pleator and Firmly Oceans respectively.  </p>

On its face, the Arcutes-Jecot Loan Agreement is misdated and a very odd document. It was not included in the original dossier provided by Mrs Jemai to her lawyer and to the Swiss Police on 25 November 2011; and was only produced at a much later stage. In my judgment, the overwhelming inference is that it is a fake or a sham or both created by Mrs Jemai from pre-signed blank sheets probably after Mr Kondratyuk’s arrest – a topic that I consider further below. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, insofar as may be necessary, the explanation that the payment by Vantax to Fanteks was, in effect, by way of repayment of an earlier loan to Jecot is also not credible, in my view, for a number of reasons. First, such explanation is inconsistent or at least difficult to square with other evidence originally given by Mr Jemai that he did not know anything about a company called Vantax and that the Fanteks payments were consultancy commissions related to ore transactions. Second, the main document said to reflect the original loan is not contemporaneous (as is accepted by the Jemais) but, even on their case, was produced at a later stage and backdated (so they say) when it was requested by Jecot’s auditors for accounting purposes. Third, although there is the other documentation referred to by Mr Smith apparently confirming the existence of at least some loan, it is, at least questionable that such documentation refers to this supposed loan; and, in any event, it would appear that Jecot’s auditors refused to sign Jecot’s accounts because <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>most of the supposed loan contracts they requested had not been provided. Fourth, the Jemais’ story is that early repayment of the loan was agreed because Jecot’s financial situation had improved but this seems difficult, if not impossible to reconcile with other evidence which would indicate that Jecot borrowed CHF 50,000 from Ms Jemai in January 2011. Fifth, it seems at the least very odd that Mr Jemai and Ms Jemai wrote a formal letter for repayment. No metadata has been produced which might verify the date and authenticity of this document. There is an obvious suspicion that this document has also been created after the event to support the story. On its own, I accept that this point is somewhat speculative but, in my view, that suspicion is probably wellfounded when taken together with all the other evidence. Further, there is no satisfactory explanation as to the pricing mechanism apparently contained in that document given the suggestion that the market was rising rapidly. Sixth, the Jemais’ explanation of seeking and getting from Mr Pinaev the US$ 50,000 shipping costs is convoluted and inconsistent with other evidence. It would also seem to be a recent invention. Seventh, Ms Jemai accepts that she has never been repaid what she says was her “share” of the original loan made from her childhood savings. That again seems very odd (to say the least) if this story were true. Finally, in my judgment, the overwhelming likelihood is that the further payment of US$ 100,000 made by Vantax to Fanteks on 17 May 2011 was the transfer of a “bonus” Mr Kondratyuk and Mr Jemai had dishonestly procured Otkritie to pay to Mrs Jemai’s account at BSI.  </p>

That conclusion is, of course, consistent with the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk but I should make plain that I have reached that conclusion independent of such evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, it seems to me that the figures do not work – or at least it is difficult to fit the figures into a scenario where it was in effect agreed by Mr Kondratyuk that he would take responsibility for Mr Jemai’s share and, on his evidence, pay him US$ 15.8/US$ 15.4m. I have already dealt with this in part. Mr Berry submitted that in fact the figures did work – in particular because a figure of approximately US$ 15m represented 10% of the total fraud proceeds which is, said Mr Berry, what had been agreed with Mr Jemai. However, that scenario does not fit with other evidence including Mr Kondratyuk’s own initial evidence that all the main fraudsters (including Mr Jemai) were going to get the same i.e. US$ 20m out of US$ 120m which is, of course, substantially more than 10%. Moreover, I find it inherently improbable that Mr Kondratyuk would have agreed to take care of and pay such a large amount out to Mr Jemai. As stated above, Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence is that after the Second Trade was settled, Mr Pinaev and Mr Urumov said that out of the fraud proceeds of US$ 120m received by Arcutes, they would have to pay US$ 10.1m to Mr Gersamia’s colleague – although he (Mr Kondratyuk) says that he never learned who that was. This seems most improbable. In fact, as I have found, that amount i.e. US$ 10.1m was paid in effect to Mr Gersamia of which about US$ 2.5m found its way back to Mr Gherzi. It seems to me highly improbable that Mr Kondratyuk was not party to or at least aware, even in general terms, of such arrangements. If that is right, it seems very odd, indeed not credible, that Mr Kondratyuk would agree to pay Mr Jemai a sum in excess of US$ 15m out of his own share. That would mean that Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev would each get and keep for themselves some US$ 36.5m whereas Mr Kondratyuk would only receive and be able to keep about US$ 20m. In my judgment, it is not credible that Mr Kondratyuk would agree voluntarily to such arrangement. One possibility is, of course, that Mr Kondratyuk was being cheated by Mr Urumov and Mr Pinaev; and I recognise that that is what Mr Kondratyuk now says that he thought was happening at the time. However, having seen and heard Mr Kondratyuk give evidence, it does not seem to me that he is the kind of person who might easily be cheated or fobbed off. On the contrary, it seems to me that the likelihood is that Mr Kondratyuk knew full well that the sum of US$ 10.1m subsequently paid to Belux was to be used to pay off Mr Gersamia and Mr Gherzi – although I fully accept that standing alone this is largely speculative. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Moreover, there is other evidence which, in my view, supports Mr Smith’s argument that, in fact, Mr Kondratyuk regarded the entirety of this money paid to Jecot as, in effect, his own. For example, at the end of  May/early June 2011, Mr Kondratyuk told Mr Belhia of BSI Bank that he expected to receive €30m – around US$ 43m at that time. Mr Smith submitted that this reflected exactly the sum of approximately US$ 36.5m that had been received by Firmly Oceans plus the US$ 6.3m sign-on fee fraud. As submitted by Mr Berry, I accept that the figures do not work exactly (or at least as exactly as Mr Smith suggested) but it seems to me that the general point made by Mr Smith remains generally sound. There are also further contemporaneous documents when Mr Kondratyuk requested or demanded the return of the money – although there was much dispute about the circumstances in which such documents came into existence. In addition, there is a series of voice-recordings of a meeting on 4 September 2012 between Mr Jemai and Mr Kondratyuk’s brother (Mr Oleg Kondratyuk) in which the latter appears to ask for the return of Mr S Kondratyuk’s money in suitcases of cash. Mr Smith submitted that these recordings were “deadly” to this part of the claimants’ case because they plainly showed that, contrary to the claimants’ case, Mr Kondratyuk regarded the money which had been transferred to Jecot as his own. For his part, Mr Berry submitted that disputed the authenticity of those recordings. In response, Mr Smith submitted that the veracity of such recordings was supported by the evidence of Mr Jemai’s Swiss lawyer, M Miguel Oural – although Mr Berry submitted (by way of rejoinder) that this was not so or at the very least that M Oural’s evidence did not support the factual case that Mr Kondratyuk had asked for the return of suitcases of cash. The resolution of these disputes is problematic.. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that I remain unpersuaded that the claimants have satisfied the burden of proof of showing that there was any agreement that Mr Jemai’s share of the proceeds was in excess of US$ 15m or indeed in excess of the sum of US$ 400,000 that I have concluded that he did, in effect, receive through Arcutes, Vantax and Fanteks. Compared to the amounts received by all the other fraudsters, this is perhaps a relatively small sum but I am sure that he regarded it as a handsome reward for the vital role that he played in the fraud as I have described above. For the avoidance of doubt, I should make plain that this conclusion as to the amount of his share of the proceeds does not, in my judgment, reduce or otherwise affect Mr Jemai’s liability in relation to the main claims advanced against him in relation to the Second Trade. </p>

Insofar as may be material, it is also my conclusion that such sum is recoverable by OML/OFC on the basis of breach of contract; and that Mr Jemai is also liable for an account. Further, it is my conclusion that he received the sum of US$ 400,000 (but no more) by way of his share of the proceeds of fraud and that such sum is recoverable by OSL/OML/OFC although such liability is, of course, concurrent and not additional to the sum of US$ 150,933,750. </p>

On Mr Kondratyuk’s own evidence, this represented his (gross) share of the fraud proceeds. According to the evidence of Mr Kondratyuk, he then travelled with Mr Jemai from Moscow to Geneva on 1 April; on the plane, he and Mr Jemai discussed what Mr Jemai was going to do with his share of the money; and Mr Jemai told him that he intended to transfer his share of the money to his mother's company, that his mother was preparing a scheme according to which the money, based on bank transactions, would appear to be sent in exchange for the purchase of goods but that, in truth, the money would in effect be channelled through various banks (including Baltikums Bank where Mr Jemai had an old friend) and other offshore companies making it impossible to trace. In summary, Mr Kondratyuk's evidence was that he was very interested in this information; that he asked Mr Jemai whether he and his mother could do the same for him; that shortly after arrival in Geneva, Mr Jemai confirmed that he had spoken to his mother and arranged a meeting with her; that such a meeting did take place; that Mr Kondratyuk told Mrs Jemai that he wanted to hide his own share of the money obtained from the fraud; that detailed discussions then took place at that meeting between Mr Kondratyuk and Mrs Jemai with regard to a plan to hide the fraud proceeds including an appropriate fee for Mrs Jemai herself; that in order to avoid suspicion, Mrs Jemai told him that he would have to withdraw the money from Bordier Bank in multiple steps; that Mrs Jemai also said that, if asked, he should tell the bank that the money was going to be used to buy cotton and that they should enter into a fake profit sharing agreement to be signed by the directors of Firmly Oceans for presentation to M Giovanna at Bordier; and that Mr Kondratyuk agreed with this plan following which Mr Jemai sent him a fake profit sharing agreement which he signed and subsequently forwarded to Mr Giovanna.

Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence is that this was done in accordance with the plan agreed with Mrs Jemai; and that, pursuant to such plan, Mrs Jemai then opened accounts at BSI for Mr Kondratyuk's sister, Ms Demakova, and transferred his share of the fraud proceeds from the Jecot accounts to these accounts while retaining her fee. Mr Kondratyuk's evidence is that he used part of this money to buy a house in Spain and two expensive cars i.e. a Bentley and a Ferrari. </p>

However, the Jemais have put forward various other (inconsistent) stories about the ownership and control of Jecot, including the suggestion (at least at one stage) that Mrs Jemai is only a minority shareholder and not the sole controller and that Mr Jemai has no shareholding at all. The claimants say that these are false attempts to distance the Jemais from Jecot’s obvious involvement in laundering the fraud proceeds. The evidence of Mrs Jemai is that at all material times she was unaware that such monies represented the proceeds of fraud and that, on the contrary, they were paid to and received by Jecot pursuant to various ‘profit sharing arrangements’ with or ‘investments’ by Mr Kondratyuk. In support of that assertion, there has been produced by Jecot/Mrs Jemai various documents which supposedly prove the existence of such genuine commercial arrangements. However, it is the claimants’ case that these documents are fakes or shams or both and that, in truth, these transfers were all part of a massive exercise to hide, launder and/or dissipate the fraud proceeds as Mr Jemai, Mrs Jemai and Ms Jemai well knew.  </p>

As stated above, in the Swiss proceedings, Mrs Jemai denied that she or her family had any link to Vantax, except that it was a commercial partner of Jecot. Similarly, Mr Jemai also denied knowing anything about Vantax or that his sister, Ms Jemai, had any connection to Vantax. However, Ms Jemai now accepts that she signed documents relating to the incorporation of Vantax; and the corporate documents certainly record her as being the ultimate beneficial owner of Vantax as from January 2010 until at least November 2011 i.e. shortly after the fraud was discovered and having an unlimited power of attorney to act on its behalf throughout </p>

She claims to have no knowledge of Vantax’s bank (Baltikums Bank) or any dealings with it; nor any knowledge that the company she established and apparently owned and controlled subsequently received and paid out more than US$ 20 million of the fraud proceeds. </p>

This is disputed by the claimants. In particular, the claimants say that Vantax was, like Jecot, in effect beneficially owned and controlled by Mrs Jemai; that these transfers were not made for genuine business or investment purposes; and that, on the contrary, they were simply part of the exercise of money-laundering and dissipating the fraud proceeds. As already noted, default judgment in these proceedings was entered against Vantax on 9 November 2012. The claimants say that the Jemais’ chosen defence required them to disavow their obvious interest in Vantax which has been left with a judgment in excess of US$ 21m; and that in itself this is inconsistent with the suggestion that Vantax is a genuine commercial entity run at arm’s length from Jecot by third parties. </p>

The claimants say that all of these transfers were part of the same massive money-laundering exercise and dissipation of fraud proceeds. In particular, the claimants draw specific attention to (i) two payments paid on 13 and 27 April 2011 totalling US$ 250,000 paid to an account at Interactive Brokers UK Ltd (“<span style="font-style:italic">Interactive Brokers</span>”) in the name of Mr Jemai; (ii) various payments to Ms Jemai and her partner (Flavien Baré) totalling approximately US$ 400,000; (iii) various payments totalling approximately US$ 1.23m paid between about 6 October 2011 and 18 November 2011 to a company called Silver LLC (which Mrs Jemai has admitted is connected to her ex-husband and Mr Jemai’s step-father, Wahid Jemai); and (iv) a single payment of US$ 380,000 made on 21 November 2011 into an account at the Bank of Azerbaijan in the name of Mr Kondratyuk.

I reach that conclusion for the following main reasons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, there is no doubt that Mrs Jemai’s knowledge is, in effect, to be attributed to Jecot; and that she gave dishonest evidence in a number of important respects as already referred to above. In addition, it is, in my view, plain that Mrs Jemai deliberately lied about the existence and timing of activity in relation to Jecot’s account at Hinduja Bank. By way of background, Mrs Jemai gave evidence during the trial with regard to the use of this account. At a very late stage of the trial, the claimants obtained from the Swiss prosecutor certain documents relating to such account (the “Hinduja documents”). The claimants promptly gave disclosure of such documents as they were obliged to do in accordance with their continuing duty and made an application to adduce such documents in evidence which I granted. I also made provision for the service of any further evidence and submissions. In response, there was served the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> witness statement of Mrs Jemai. At that stage of the trial, Jecot was no longer represented and such statement was in effect put in evidence by Mr Jemai. There then followed detailed written submissions on behalf of Mr Jemai and the claimants. I do not propose to deal with this material at length. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that I accept the claimants’ submission that this latest statement is not only implausible but substantially and dishonestly untrue; that, in particular and contrary to Mrs Jemai’s evidence during the earlier part of the trial that the  Hinduja account was not active in March 2012 and was closed very shortly after it was opened, that account was in truth used in March 2012 to receive millions of US$ deriving from the sale of pig iron that Jecot had purchased using the fraud proceeds; that  most of the monies were then spirited off to Silver LLC, the Tajik company with a Kazakhstan bank account that is connected with Wahid Jemai and about which company Mrs Jemai’s evidence was at the very least less than frank. From the material currently available, it also seems beyond doubt that Mrs Jemai deliberately breached this court’s freezing orders and the Swiss authorities’ sequestration of Jecot’s bank accounts. </p>

In particular, the suggestion that any “investor" would hand over many millions of dollars without some form of due diligence, proper paperwork and scrutiny (all of which is virtually non-existent here) is, in my judgment, not only inherently improbable but totally lacking in credibility; so too is the suggestion that any individual in the position of Mrs Jemai would or could honestly think that this might happen. I do not consider that such due diligence might be satisfied even by what Mrs Jemai says was the purpose of Mr Kondratyuk’s trip to Azerbaijan (even if that were true which I do not accept); and it is, in any event, noteworthy that the first payment from Firmly Oceans to Jecot (more than US$ 5m) was made before that trip took place.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, it is, in my view, very significant that Mrs Jemai’s evidence with regard to such supposed transactions has not been consistent. For example, Mrs Jemai first claimed that the monies were paid to Jecot pursuant to certain “<span style="font-style:italic">Profit Sharing Agreements</span>” between Jecot and Mr Kondratyuk in respect of cotton trading.  Two such agreements were produced: the first supposedly with Mr Kondratyuk himself (<span style="font-style:italic">the “Jecot-Kondratyuk PSA</span>”); the second, between Jecot and Mr Kondratyuk’s company, Firmly Oceans (<span style="font-style:italic">the “Jecot-Firmly Oceans PSA</span>”). Each was supposedly dated 7 April 2011 (the day before the first payment of more than US$ 5m) and provided for Mr Kondratyuk/Firmly Oceans to “<span style="font-style:italic">pre-finance</span>” Jecot’s purchase of cotton from Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, in return for a 50% share of any profits.  It suffices to say that even Bordier found these agreements suspicious, calling one a “<span style="font-style:italic">synonym for corruption</span>” as they patently were and as Mr Kondratyuk himself </p>

Mrs Jemai next claimed that she had then suggested, and Mr Kondratyuk had agreed, that he would invest US$ 5.1m in the purchase of pig-iron from Ukraine; and that Mr Kondratyuk subsequently also agreed to purchase Jecot’s interest in certain cotton factories or mills in Azerbaijan for around US$ 18m, which was effected through a two-page “Sale-Purchase Agreement” dated 5 September 2011 between Jecot and a vehicle called Nadare LLP (<span style="font-style:italic">the “Nadare SPA</span>”).  Mrs Jemai also produced to the Swiss prosecutor a purported “<span style="font-style:italic">Annex</span>” to the Jecot-Kondratyuk PSA (but not the Jecot-Firmly Oceans PSA) dated 27 September 2011.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants say that both these documents are forgeries created by Mrs Jemai (with the knowledge of both Mr Jemai and Ms Jemai as well as Ms Jemai’s assistance with the drafting) at a later date and back-dated in order to give credence to Jecot’s case that the monies transferred by Firmly Oceans to Jecot were genuine investments. In support of that submission, the claimants rely upon Mr Kondratyuk’s evidence that he never signed these documents – although he does accept that what seems to be his signature appears on them. His explanation for the latter is that in November 2011, shortly before Mr Kondratyuk was arrested by the Swiss authorities, he and the Jemais met at Mrs Jemai’s/Mr Jemai’s apartment in Geneva and, at Mrs Jemai’s suggestion and under her instruction, he signed or initialled many blank sheets of paper, so that Mrs Jemai (with Mr Jemai’s and Ms Jemai’s knowledge, and Ms Jemai’s assistance with the drafting) could use them to fabricate further purported contracts or other documents to assist with the laundering of the fraud proceeds. The Jemais all say that this is a lie. This dispute – in particular the date(s) when the document was created – might have been resolved if an electronic version (including relevant metadata) had been produced as it should have been. As to this, it was originally suggested on behalf of Jecot that an electronic version could not be produced because the relevant computer was being held by the Swiss prosecutor and was not accessible. In an attempt to overcome this difficulty, I made a specific order in the course of the trial for disclosure of the electronic version (including relevant metadata). For reasons which remain obscure and after Jecot’s solicitors had ceased to act, there was a very considerable delay (some two months) before a USB stick was eventually produced supposedly with an electronic version of the document. However, the conclusion reached by the claimants’ experts, Kroll, is that two files were wiped irretrievably and that the metadata does not relate to this document or has possibly been faked. In my judgment, the overwhelming inference is that this information has been deliberately suppressed by Mrs Jemai and possibly others in order to prevent the truth coming out – in the same way that Mrs Jemai destroyed the computer server with a hammer.  </p>

However, by the supposed date of the agreement, there was not enough left for such deduction. Further, although Jecot produced certain minutes of what purported to be a Jecot shareholders’ meeting on 5 September 2011 supposedly approving the purported “sale” of the mills to Mr Kondratyuk’s company, the overwhelming likelihood is, in my judgment, that there never was any such meeting, that these so-called minutes are not genuine and that the evidence of both Mrs Jemai and Mr Kamotesov to the contrary is dishonestly false.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The documents relating to Nadare present a confused – and confusing – picture which would seem to undermine this part of the story advanced by Jecot. Thus, the documents show that Nadare was incorporated on 5 September 2011 –  the date of the Nadare SPA and the purported Jecot EGM – by two Belize members (Belize also being the place of incorporation of Vantax); and was acquired by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mrs Jemai</span> at the latest by October 2011, again through a contact at Baltikums (Mr Grigoriev(s)), where a bank account in Nadare’s name was established. Initially, Mrs Jemai proposed that Mr Kondratyuk transfer some US$ 384,000 to Nadare’s Baltikum’s account under a fake invoice for bags that she had created or procured and for which she also obtained a sealed version.  This sum was the very amount left in Firmly Oceans’ account at that time, corroborating Mr Kondratyuk’s account in his first witness statement. All of this is consistent with Nadare being a company owned or at least controlled by Mrs Jemai <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> Mr Kondratyuk. The claimants say that when it was clear that the net was closing in on the fraudsters (and Mr Kondratyuk was arrested), the Jemais decided to pretend that Nadare was <span style="font-style:italic">Mr Kondratyuk’s</span> company, and that he had spent US$ 17.8m of the fraud proceeds on Nadare’s purchase of the mills (for which purpose, after Mr Kondratyuk’s arrest, Mrs Jemai procured a power of attorney to be granted to his brother, Mr Oleg Kondratyuk so that he could effect the sham transfers of shares in two of the Mills into Nadare’s name. However, there was never any such agreement, and Mr Kondratyuk knew nothing of it. Thus, the claimants say that it was the means by which the Jemais now seek to ‘account’ for the balance of Mr Jemai’s share of the fraud proceeds.

As to the status of Vantax, I have already referred to the fact that contrary to the original assertions by Mrs Jemai and Mr Jemai, the company was originally incorporated by Ms Jemai (on her own evidence at the request of Mrs Jemai). I have also referred to the ‘digipass’ which was in effect the digital key to the operation of Vantax’s Baltikums Bank account. There is no doubt that this had the same reference number and was therefore the very same digipass which the bank documents show was at least apparently provided on opening to Ms Jemai to operate the account and which was subsequently found by the Swiss authorities in the carton bag in the basement of her apartment in Geneva as already referred to earlier in this Judgment However, Ms Jemai’s evidence was that her signature on these bank documents was forged; that she was never in Latvia at the time when she supposedly opened this bank account; that she had never been provided with the digipass and indeed had never seen or used this digipass before; that it must have been left behind by mistake by someone who had stayed in the spare room in Mrs Jemai’s apartment (probably or at least perhaps Mr Rahimov); and that it was somehow transferred to a bag of other items (including the key to Mr Kondratyuk’s Bentley) which Ms Jemai mistakenly took almost a year earlier to her apartment because she thought it contained only her own study materials. I deal below with the circumstances relating to the opening of the bank account but, in any event, I do not accept Ms Jemai’s evidence that she had never seen or used the digipass. Despite Ms Jemai’s protestations to the contrary, the overwhelming likelihood is, in my judgment, that Vantax was, in effect, beneficially owned by Mrs Jemai or, if Mrs Jemai was not the beneficial owner, at the very least, controlled or used by her with the knowledge and consent of Ms Jemai having regard, in particular, to the nature of the payments into and out of the Vantax account and the manner in which the account appears to have been operated which bear all the hallmarks of that account being used as a conduit for money-laundering purposes. Further, documents obtained by <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>order against Vantax’s registered agent in Belize include a letter from Ms Jemai to Vantax purportedly dated 21 November 2011 (the day before Mr Kondratyuk’s arrest in Switzerland), tendering her ‘resignation’ as its beneficial owner and asserting that she had gratuitously transferred it to Mr Mirzoaliev. The claimants say that this was clearly an attempt to distance the Jemais from a company that was instrumental in laundering the fraud proceeds and that these documents can only have been prepared by or at the behest of one or more of the Jemais.  Ms Jemai says that what appears to be her signature on this ‘resignation’ document was forged. Expert evidence on this issue (from Robert Radley and Dr Giles) supports the fact that her signature was forged or at least was not her “usual” signature. However, it is the claimants’ case that it can safely be inferred that if it is not Ms Jemai’s own (unusual) signature, it must be that of Mrs Jemai or Mr Jemai who had both motive and opportunity - or procured by one or more of them. On its own, I accept that that is again somewhat speculative but taken together with all the other evidence, it seems to me that that is what probably happened. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the suggestion that the transfers from Jecot to Vantax were in the ordinary course of business, it seems to me that this is demonstrably false. Even a cursory review of the bank statements reveals a pattern of circular transactions on the Vantax account indicating that it was being used by Jecot primarily as a ‘transit account’ between its own bank accounts at Crédit Suisse and BNP Paribas, to give its Swiss banks the false impression of trading activity where there was none.  Some of the transfers obviously bear false payment references (e.g. to non-existent cotton contracts). In evidence, Mrs Jemai sought to explain at least some of these payments; although I confess that I found her explanation difficult to understand. Insofar as it can be understood at all, it would seem that the avowed purpose of at least some of the circular payments was to deceive Jecot’s banks and/or its credit insurers into believing that the customer had paid for cotton, when in fact Jecot itself was supposedly financing its <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> sales; and the Vantax bank account was made available to the Jemais to use for their own personal purposes. A good illustration of the latter is a payment routed through Vantax for the benefit of Nora/Wahid Jemai, clearly funded by an incoming payment from Jecot and falsely referenced as a “<span style="font-style:italic">payment for cotton</span>”. </p>

As to the supposed repayment of the loan to Jecot, I have already dealt with this earlier in this Judgment. As to the supposed “buy/sell” deal of the Ferrari, this was not supported by any independent credible evidence and, in my judgment, is dishonestly false. The suggestion that the payments from Jecot were made in the ordinary course of business can also be seen to be demonstrably false by the fact that much of the balance of the monies paid by Vantax to Fanteks (some US$ 124,700, which Mr Jemai transferred to another account at Baltikums Bank) was used by Mr Jemai to fund a lavish lifestyle, making hundreds of payments for shopping in luxury boutiques, international travel, expensive restaurants, in London, Moscow, Geneva, Barcelona, Monaco, Ibiza and elsewhere.

Thus Vantax’s statements show that Ms Jemai received US$ 3,300 and €2,050 from Vantax on 27 September 2011 (referenced as “<span style="font-style:italic">travel expenses</span>”).  Her evidence was that the first of these payments represented reimbursement of travel expenses from Mr Rahimov in connection with her establishment of Vantax more than one year earlier (because she needed to stay longer in Latvia and had to buy new plane tickets) was lacking in credibility – as, in my view, was her explanation about taking US$ 10,000 in cash to Latvia to pay her dentist. As submitted by Mr Berry, it seems to me that the more likely explanation is that this cash was needed at least in part to help acquire Vantax. The US$ payment on 27 September 2011 happened to empty that Vantax account; and the € payment happened to be exactly the amount (when combined with other “<span style="font-style:italic">travel expenses</span>” paid to a Mr Lawson) paid into the Vantax Account by Desert Lake Finance on 22 June 2011.

On this basis, Jecot is liable to OSL/OFC/OML for damages and/or equitable compensation in the sum of US$ 35.4m and/or an account on the basis of dishonest assistance, procuring breach of contract alternatively knowing receipt. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">By way of footnote, I should add that in September and October 2011, Fanteks received another US$ 1.475m, this time from an account at ABLV Bank in Latvia held by a BVI company called Tess Group SA (“Tess”).  Mr Jemai has alleged in the Swiss proceedings that Tess was an investment company and that this sum was an “<span style="font-style:italic">intermediary commission</span>” on an iron ore transaction. However, my tentative conclusion is that these monies in fact represented part of the fraud proceeds which Mr Kondratyuk arranged to be laundered through Tess, a company which belongs to Alexander Suchkov of Quickline; that what appears to have happened is that Mr Jemai arranged for these monies to be paid away as follows viz (i) in November 2011, almost US$ 1m was transferred to Trian Inter Trading (“Trian”), another New Zealand company, ostensibly for the payment of freight on a shipment of some sort but in reality as a cash depositary for Mr Jemai; (ii) in December 2011, US$ 549,400 was transferred to another account at Baltikums Bank in the name of Lormos Global SA (“Lormos”), a BVI company owned by Mr Jemai also under his Latvian name, Jevgenijs Parsins which opened the account at Baltikums Bank just a week after Mr Kondratyuk’s arrest in Switzerland in an obvious attempt hide the money further; (iii) In January 2012, Mr Jemai caused Lormos to pay US$ 489,100 to an account at Agroinvestbank in Tajikistan in the name of an entity called Vellington Textile which he now claims was used to make a 2-year investment in “<span style="font-style:italic">machinery</span>”. There is no documentary and no independent evidence to suggest that any of these transfers were genuine commercial payments. If they were, proper documents would exist and would have been produced. Thus, my tentative conclusion is that the overwhelming likelihood is that they were not genuine commercial payments; that this supports my earlier conclusion in the previous paragraph; and that, as submitted by Mr Berry, they were merely further attempts to launder the fraud proceeds and to put them where they could be held by or for Mr Jemai but beyond the reach of the claimants. After circulating a draft of this Judgment, Mr Smith submitted that in fact it was never the claimants’ case that the monies which came from Tess represented the proceeds of fraud. It is, I think, right to say that the claimants did not assert a separate claim against Mr Jemai for dishonest assistance/knowing receipt in respect of these monies although they did (as I understood) rely upon these matters to support their other claims against both Jecot and Mr Jemai personally. It is most regrettable that this confusion has arisen; and unfortunately, it was impracticable to invite further submissions from the claimants on this point prior to the handing down of this Judgment. For this reason alone, I have decided to refrain from making any final determination at this stage with regard to the monies received by Fanteks from Tess. However, if necessary, I will hear further submissions on this point. For the avoidance of doubt, I should make plain that these matters do not alter or otherwise affect the rest of this Judgment. </p>

In summary, Mr Jemai accepts that Mr Kondratyuk met and had discussions with his mother from March/April 2011 onwards but he says is, in effect, that the arrangements made between them had nothing to do with him. In particular, it is his evidence that they had meetings without him; that other than hearing a few comments here and there when he was present at the same time as the pair of them, he knew little of what they were doing; that from what they both told him, they had decided to do a joint venture with commodities.  Once again, this evidence clashes with that of </p>

I am ready to accept that Mr Jemai may not have been involved in all the detailed arrangements which, as I have found, Mr Kondratyuk ultimately made with Mrs Jemai to launder his share of the proceeds through Jecot and Vantax. However, bearing in mind the close friendship Mr Jemai obviously had with Mr Kondratyuk and in the light of my earlier findings, in particular that together with the other fraudsters including Mr Kondratyuk, Mr Jemai was an active participant in the Argentinean Warrants Fraud for which he received US$ 400,000 as his share of the proceeds on 21 March 2011, it is, in my judgment, not credible that there were no discussions between Mr Jemai and Mr Kondratyuk as to what they would do with all this money. On the contrary, it seems to me that the overwhelming probability is that such discussions did indeed take place and that Mr Jemai introduced Mr Kondratyuk to his mother in order dishonestly to assist Mr Kondratyuk to launder what he knew was his (Mr Kondratyuk’s) share of the fraud proceeds and for that specific purpose – as indeed happened. That conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that in April 2011, Mr Jemai went with Ms Demakova to BSI Bank in Moscow to open various banks accounts including those through which certain of the fraud proceeds were subsequently routed as appears from Figure 9. On this basis, it is my conclusion that Mr Jemai is liable to OSL/OFL for damages and or equitable compensation in the sum of US$ 35.4m and/or an account. </p>

These figures require some explanation. The first is a global figure consisting of a number of separate payments viz (i) the sum of US$ 400,000 paid by Arcutes to Vantax on 21 March 2011 which, as I have already found, represented Mr Jemai’s share of the fraud proceeds and (again as I have found) was subsequently transferred to Fanteks for the benefit of Mr Jemai on 31 March 2011; and (ii) (as appears from Figure 9) the sum of US$ 20.34m originally received by Jecot from Mr Kondratyuk/Firmly Oceans and subsequently paid to Vantax’s account in Latvia at Baltikums Bank in seven tranches between 11 May 2011 and 11 July 2011, most of which was then further distributed to Qast and Ms Demakova. The second figure (i.e. CHF 32,205) relates to a single payment made by Firmly Oceans to Ms Jemai’s personal account on 6 May 2011. </p>

However, it is Ms Jemai’s evidence that she had nothing to do with these payments and certainly did not know that such monies were fraud proceeds. It is true that there is no direct evidence that she was herself involved in these payments.

In my judgment, even on Mrs Jemai’s own evidence and on the assumption that she only received AML training after the relevant events, what she was being asked to do would have sent loud alarm bells ringing in the mind of any honest individual (particularly a skilled banker like Ms Jemai) so as to prompt such individual to ask at least some basic questions which Ms Jemai failed to do let alone carry out proper due diligence. Even if she had, I doubt that any answers she might have been given would have been sufficient to assuage the suspicions of an honest individual with regard to the extraordinary exercise she was being asked to carry out. In my judgment, the overwhelming inference to be drawn from her agreement to help set up Vantax in these circumstances is that she knew that Vantax was a company which would be used for money-laundering purposes or at the very least she decided deliberately not to ask obvious question lest she discover the truth. On this basis alone, it seems to me that Ms Jemai is liable for dishonest assistance and/or knowing receipt in relation to any fraud proceeds which subsequently went through Vantax’s bank accounts (including the sums claimed) even if her evidence that her involvement in Vantax was limited to that single day in 2010. However, in my judgment, Ms Jemai’s disavowal of any further involvement in Vantax is a deliberate lie for the reasons set out below.  </p>

I have rejected that story; and it follows, in my judgment, that Ms Jemai’s evidence on this topic was deliberately false. I have also already commented on other parts of her evidence which I do not propose to repeat. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, there is no doubt that a bank account for Vantax was opened at Baltikums Bank in October 2010 (through a family friend, Mr Grigoriev) and that in January 2011 internet banking facilities were arranged for the account – although the circumstances in which these arrangements were made were hotly disputed. In particular, there was much dispute concerning the circumstances in which the bank appears to have been provided with Ms Jemai’s passport details (as certainly appeared from the bank’s own documents) if, as she said, she had no involvement in these arrangements: Ms Jemai’s evidence was that such details must have been obtained from a photocopy of her passport. In any event, it is plain that in each case, Ms Jemai’s identity (including her passport details) was used to make these arrangements. It is common ground that the signature used was forged or at least not Ms Jemai’s “usual” signature; and, for present purposes, I am prepared to assume that such “forgery” was done by someone other than Ms Jemai although I do not accept that that is necessarily so. However, as I have already stated, I reject Ms Jemai’s evidence concerning the digipass and the operation of Vantax’s bank account. Her evidence to the contrary was, in my judgment, deliberately false. </p>

Despite Ms Jemai’s protestations to the contrary, it is my conclusion that she was probably involved in the preparation of at least some of these documents.

At the very least, it seems to me that Ms Jemai is liable for knowing receipt (including for the small sum of CHF 32,205 which she received directly from Mr Kondratyuk). </p>

Further, it is my general conclusion that the claimants are in principle entitled to an account, declaratory relief and proprietary remedies in the light of my conclusions as set out in this Judgment – although, as agreed at the hearing, the precise nature and formulation of such relief and remedies will have to be the subject of further argument unless otherwise agreed.
