	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2006 and 2007 the Leipzig municipal water company (“KWL”) sold credit protection to the investment bank UBS and to two other banks (“LBBW” and “Depfa”) on four portfolios of investment grade bonds and other securities. It did so by means of a series of complex derivative products known as Single Tranche Collateralised Debt Obligations (“STCDOs”). The effect of these STCDOs was in each case that if any ten or so of the entities in the portfolios defaulted during an eight or ten year period, KWL would be liable to pay the banks tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars (or the equivalent in other currencies). These defaults duly occurred following the global financial crisis of 2008-9 and the banks now seek payment of the sums due under the STCDOs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">KWL defends the banks’ claims on the grounds that the STCDOs were void because it did not have capacity (or its managing directors who signed them did not have authority) to enter into such contracts, and that they were voidable and have been avoided on various grounds (bribery, conflict of interest and fraudulent misrepresentation). In addition, if the STCDOs were valid and binding, it contends that the losses suffered on the portfolios were caused by their negligent management by the portfolio manager UBS Global Asset Management (UK) Ltd (“UBS GAM”).</p>

The total net premium (after deducting the costs of the CDSs) on all four STCDOs was US $28.1 million plus €6.4 million. However, only about US $6 million (or €4.5 million) of this was ever received by KWL. The remainder was siphoned off by Berthold Senf and Jürgen Blatz of Value Partners Group AG, a Swiss company which purported to provide financial advice to KWL. From this net premium of over US $30 million they paid a bribe of about US $3 million to one of KWL’s two managing directors, Klaus Heininger. There is an issue whether UBS is to be regarded as the principal of Value Partners so as to be responsible in law for the payment of this bribe, but as a matter of fact nobody at UBS was aware of the bribe. </p>

It therefore concluded only the Balaba STCDO with KWL and sought other banks (in the event, LBBW and Depfa) to act as intermediaries between it and KWL on the other transactions. LBBW and Depfa concluded their STCDOs with KWL acting as principals, but having bought STCDO protection from KWL, they each entered into STCDOs with UBS by which they sold the same protection to UBS on back to back terms. The STCDOs between KWL and LBBW/Depfa have been referred to in this action as the “Front Swaps”, while the STCDOs between LBBW/Depfa and UBS have been referred to as the "Back Swaps". </p>

On 3 June 2013 that STCDO was held by the Leipzig Regional Court at first instance to be valid and binding on KWL, although the quantum of KWL’s liability to LBBW has not yet been determined. That decision on liability is subject to an appeal by KWL to the Dresden Court of Appeal. I am told that a decision on KWL’s appeal is not expected for many months, and in any case not until some time next year. The role of LBBW in the proceedings before me is therefore limited to the issues between it and UBS as to the effect of the LBBW Back Swap.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that the question of KWL’s capacity to enter into the Balaba STCDO and the authority of its managing directors to conclude such a transaction is a question governed by German law. It depends on two issues. The first is whether KWL was required by its Articles of Association to obtain the prior approval of its Supervisory Board to the transaction, which depends in turn on whether the transaction was of “fundamental significance” to KWL within the meaning of its Articles. The second is whether, if such approval was required, that requirement was so obvious to UBS that UBS’s failure to recognise it was (in short) grossly negligent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether the transaction was voidable on account of the bribery of Mr Heininger by Value Partners depends on whether for this purpose Value Partners is to be regarded as the agent of UBS. There is no doubt that, for most purposes, Value Partners was acting as the agent of KWL, with whom it had a pre-existing (and already corrupt) relationship. In principle, however, there would be nothing to prevent it from agreeing to act also as UBS’s agent, although that would put it in an impossibly conflicted position. It will therefore be necessary to examine whether there was a relationship of agency established between UBS and Value Partners and, if so, whether (albeit unknown to UBS) the bribe was paid within the scope of that relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if there was no such agency relationship, KWL contends that the dealings between UBS and Value Partners were such that Value Partners was subject to a conflict of interest which was known to UBS and to which KWL did not consent, and that the STCDO was voidable on this ground. Under this heading it will be necessary to consider whether there was such a conflict, whether UBS was aware that Value Partners was not giving disinterested advice to KWL and, if so, whether KWL gave its informed consent to that situation.</p>

The principal representations alleged to have been made by UBS concern the effect of the STCDO – that it would be virtually risk free for KWL and/or would represent a reduction in the risks to which KWL was exposed. It will therefore be necessary to consider (among other things) whether such representations were made, whether they were made dishonestly and, if so, whether they were relied on by KWL in deciding to enter into the STCDO.</p>

These were broadly to the effect that KWL was entering into the transaction in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, that it had obtained all necessary approvals, that it would assess the risks of the transactions for itself and that it was not relying on UBS for investment advice or recommendations.</p>

The market for new leases was therefore drying up. Mr Bracy was therefore looking for other opportunities for business for himself and the Municipal Securities Group. In his own words, he was anxious to “stay relevant” within UBS. Ultimately the Group was closed and Mr Bracy left UBS in June 2008. The evidence in this case shows that this was not a moment too soon.</p>

The primary concern of CRC was to make an assessment of the risk that a counterparty would default under a transaction and of what recovery might be made from it in that event. CRC would also consider the suitability of the transaction for the counterparty, although UBS’s internal policies made clear that the primary responsibility for this lay with the deal team.</p>

Certainly Value Partners purported to act as KWL’s financial adviser, although KWL contends that it should be regarded as UBS’s agent. The key principals of Value Partners were Berthold Senf, Jürgen Blatz and Julian Cox. All three were former bankers. Mr Senf and Mr Blatz had been head of CSFB’s Global Lease Finance Groups for Switzerland and Germany respectively. Mr Cox had been a managing director at Bank of America. Before forming Value Partners, Messrs Senf and Blatz had worked at a company called Global Capital Finance. Although it would appear that not everyone at Value Partners was corrupt (in particular, it appears that Mr Cox was not), for the purpose of this case it is unnecessary to distinguish between Value Partners and Messrs Senf and Blatz.</p>

In the course of this history, a corrupt relationship had developed between Mr Heininger and Messrs Senf and Blatz. It began with extravagant gifts and expenses paid luxury trips, but by April and May 2005 it had escalated to outright bribery, with a cash payment of €945,945 paid to Mr Heininger in connection with a cross-border lease concluded by KWL, together with a donation of €150,000 to the Leipzig football club which he supported. The corruption extended (unknown to UBS) to the transactions in issue in this case, with Mr Heininger, Mr Senf and Mr Blatz conspiring to extract the greater part of the upfront premium paid to KWL for their own personal benefit. To some extent this was notionally authorised by an engagement letter, dated 31 May 2006 but signed by Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer on 14 June 2006, which purported to confer on Value Partners all proceeds of the transaction in excess of €4.5 million.</p>

It seems to me, however, that the extent to which there would have been any real cooperation from these individuals is highly speculative and that it is not surprising that KWL would not have wished to rely on evidence from patently dishonest witnesses.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a very substantial volume of documentary evidence, much of it in the form of contemporary emails and their attachments. There has been very extensive – and, I see no reason to doubt, full – disclosure from UBS and Depfa which for the most part provides a more or less comprehensive view of contemporary events as they unfolded. The disclosure from LBBW is probably less full, but that is largely due to the more limited scope of the issues affecting LBBW which arise for decision in this trial and the more limited scope of the disclosure which it was required to give as a result. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to its documentary disclosure, including data from no fewer than 48 custodians, UBS and UBS GAM called oral evidence of fact from 14 witnesses (and tendered one more whose attendance, in the event, was not required). These included almost all those individuals who had a material involvement with the transactions in issue (but not Mr Ryan, although at one time UBS indicated that it intended to obtain evidence from him), despite the fact that most of the witnesses are no longer employed by UBS. In at least one important case (I refer to Mr Bracy) it must have been obvious to UBS that the witness’s evidence under cross examination was unlikely to advance its case and that the co-operation which the witness was prepared to give would be limited (despite his central role, Mr Bracy produced an initial witness statement of only eight pages). In my view there is force in the submission made by UBS that it has gone to considerable effort to ensure that a full picture of relevant events is before the court. For that it is to be commended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In contrast, documentary disclosure from KWL has been limited. Some important documents (which in some respects contradicted the evidence of KWL’s main witness, Dr Schirmer) were only disclosed during the trial after KWL’s witnesses had given evidence. KWL called only four witnesses, Dr Schirmer and three members of its Supervisory Board. Some potentially important witnesses were not only not called, but exercised rights which apparently they have under German law to refuse to permit disclosure of their emails. These included Mr Reichardt and Ms Barth (now Mrs Heininger). Ms Barth appears to have held KWL’s key archive of documents relating to the transactions, so her refusal to permit disclosure of her emails was particularly regrettable. It would seem likely that both of these, and others too, would have had relevant evidence to give and that, as a result of their refusal to allow disclosure, documents which might have thrown important light on the extent to which the transactions in issue and aspects of Mr Heininger’s relationship with Value Partners were (or for that matter were not) known about and understood within KWL have not been produced. Ms Barth, for example, was one of those who accompanied Mr Heininger and others on a luxury trip to Dubai, paid for by Global Capital Finance, in October 2003. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The consequence of this lack of disclosure and evidence from KWL has been twofold. First, there is no doubt that the picture which I have of events at KWL and the knowledge of various individuals is incomplete, although whether in important respects is difficult to say. Second, the sheer volume of material and the number of witnesses from the UBS side has inevitably meant that the main evidential focus of the trial (19 days in all) has been taken up with an intense scrutiny of the evidence of the UBS witnesses. I bear both these points in mind when making my findings of fact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In making those findings I am principally guided by the contemporary documents and by the inherent probabilities of the case, judged as best I can in the light of the documents and my overall assessment of the witnesses. Inevitably, when giving evidence about events so long ago (for the most part in 2006 and early 2007), witnesses cannot be expected to have a detailed or accurate recollection of events, let alone of such matters as precisely who said what at particular meetings or what they knew at particular times. The usual difficulties of recollection (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin SGPA SA v Credit Suisse (UK) Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 3560 (Comm) at [15] to [22]) are aggravated in this case by the effect of hindsight. These were transactions which went so disastrously wrong that it is natural for witnesses to have persuaded themselves by a combination of hindsight and wishful thinking, in some cases perfectly honestly, that they did or said or thought things (or that they did not) at the time, or that they had less to do with the transactions than was in fact the case. There was also a tendency for some witnesses to be defensive about the role which they played and (in my view) to give evidence, not of what they actually did but of what they now wish they had done. Such evidence was not necessarily dishonest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should also record that with so many witnesses and with four separate parties involved, it was necessary for the trial to proceed in accordance with a fairly tight timetable. Without this, the trial could easily have taken much longer. I am grateful to all parties for ensuring that the timetable was adhered to. I am satisfied that the time available afforded all parties a proper opportunity to put their respective cases. Nobody suggested otherwise. Inevitably, however, the need to work to such a timetable means that some avenues may not have been as fully explored in cross examination as they might otherwise have been. I have borne this in mind.</p>

In the event FINRA made no findings whether Mr Bracy was guilty of making fraudulent expenses claims, but the evidence before me made it abundantly clear that he was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, I have no doubt that Mr Bracy understood perfectly well that KWL’s priority in entering into these transactions was to obtain upfront cash, and that for this purpose it was prepared to accept some additional risk. That was made very clear to him in his dealings with Value Partners. However, he was concerned that to present this to CRC as KWL’s objective would be likely to result in approval being refused. He took steps to ensure, therefore, that the deal was presented to CRC as an exercise in risk reduction, for example by briefing Mr Heininger about the line which he should take when he met Mr Linfoot, a representative of CRC, on 30 May 2006. In the event, Ms Short and Mr Bawden refused to approve the transaction anyway, but this was nevertheless an attempt by Mr Bracy to mislead UBS’s own control function. For tactical reasons neither party emphasised this aspect of Mr Bracy’s evidence, UBS because it had no interest in further undermining his evidence and KWL because its case was that the purpose of the transaction was in fact to reduce risk and was represented to it as such by UBS. However, I have no doubt that this is in fact what happened. </p>

His evidence that he had merely pretended to co-operate, stringing Messrs Senf and Blatz along while hoping that the issue would go away, was quite obviously a pack of lies. The “letter for K” episode only emerged clearly in the course of Mr Bracy’s cross examination, although UBS has not denied that it was aware of this incident before his evidence began. It casts important light on the nature of Mr Bracy’s relationship with Value Partners. As I shall explain, he knew from the outset that Mr Senf and Mr Blatz were not acting in KWL’s best interests. In connection with the “letter for K” episode it appears to have come as no surprise to him that they were acting dishonestly to cover up an inappropriate relationship with Mr Heininger. His reaction to their request was not that of an honest man.</p>

When those contemporaneous documents were authored by Mr Bracy, as many of the important documents in the case were, I bear in mind also his tendency to boast about his achievements to his superiors and to exaggerate the importance of his own role. Messages of that kind cannot necessarily be taken at face value.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two further points concerning Mr Bracy are important. The first is that UBS expressly accepted in the course of its opening submissions that for the purpose of any question about what UBS knew or should have known, what Mr Bracy knew or should have known would count as the knowledge of UBS. At a later stage of the trial a question arose whether that acceptance covered issues arising out of the “letter for K” episode which gave rise to amendments of their pleadings by other parties after Mr Bracy had given evidence. I consider that it did not. Nevertheless the admission did apply (and is accepted by UBS to apply) to all issues on the pleadings as they then stood. These included in particular KWL’s agency/bribery, conflict of interest and misrepresentation defences (see [16] above) and UBS’s claim for damages for misrepresentation against KWL (see [17] above). Accordingly, any issue about the scope of UBS’s admission will only matter if the position of Mr Bracy was materially different in relation to the “letter for K” episode on the one hand and the other issues where it is accepted that his knowledge is to be regarded as the knowledge of UBS on the other. In my view his position was materially the same for all these purposes. I would add that the admission made by UBS as to the position of Mr Bracy was inevitable on the evidence which I heard.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that at the pre trial review in this case an application by KWL to amend its pleading to allege that employees of UBS (principally Mr Bracy) knew of, or turned a blind eye to, the fact that Value Partners intended to misappropriate money for itself out of the upfront premium payable to KWL was refused, although KWL’s application to amend did not go so far as to allege that UBS knew that Mr Heininger was acting corruptly for his own benefit. KWL did not seek to appeal against that application or renew its application at the trial, even after the evidence about the “letter for K” episode emerged. In those circumstances it is not open to KWL to advance a positive case that UBS was aware, either that Value Partners intended to misappropriate money for itself or that it proposed to bribe Mr Heininger. Nevertheless the evidence about the “letter for K” episode does show beyond any possibility of doubt that Mr Bracy knew from September 2006 at the latest that Messrs Senf and Blatz were dishonest and in my judgment it is equally clear that it did not surprise him in the slightest that they were acting dishonestly to cover up an inappropriate relationship with Mr Heininger even if he was not aware of the precise respects in which it was dishonest. </p>

To some extent, I would accept that he was right to do so. However, I consider that he knew more about the relationship between Mr Bracy and Messrs Senf and Blatz than he was prepared to accept. For example, he was privy to the suggestion that Value Partners would promote UBS GAM as portfolio manager in return for payment which he described as merely “cheeky” (see [214] below); he was a recipient of Mr Maron’s list of potential clients to be approached by Value Partners and must have understood the inappropriateness of what was proposed (see [190] below); he was aware that the scandal surrounding Mr Heininger in October 2006 was the result of gifts made by Messrs Senf and Blatz but told others within UBS that they were irrelevant (see [469] below); despite this, he attended the South Africa safari with Mr Bracy and Messrs Senf and Blatz in late October 2006 at which this scandal must have been discussed (see [469] below); and he was responsible for (but claimed to have forgotten) the “transaction overview” document produced in November 2006 in which the amount of the Balaba STCDO premium was not stated and which misleadingly implied that the fact that this premium was sufficient to cover the cost of the single name CDS was merely an incidental benefit of the transaction (see [471] below). All this suggests that he either knew that there were things which were seriously wrong with Value Partners or at any rate that he deliberately turned a blind eye to that possibility because he did not want to know.</p>

Mr Lancaster was an honest witness, doing his best to assist within the inevitable limits of memory when speaking about events which took place for the most part eight years ago. He was prepared to make appropriate admissions. Indeed, some of the admissions which he was prepared to make under skilful cross examination went too far. For example, he agreed that it was likely that UBS had at some point obtained a copy of the Freshfields advice to KWL when it is clear, in my judgment, that this never happened (see [293] below). He admitted also that the Freshfields capacity opinion provided to UBS was equivocal on the issue of whether Supervisory Board approval for the transaction was needed. I shall need to consider that opinion further in due course, but this was not how UBS or Mr Lancaster saw the matter at the time.</p>

His attitude is perhaps summed up in the contrast between two e-mails which he sent, one to Mr Bracy in January 2007 (“Wots the scoop on the VP railway lease portfolio, big guy? Hungry, hungry …”) and the other, only a few weeks later, in which he argued that Mr Bracy and his group should be excluded from remuneration for any future Value Partners’ work (“I don’t count VP in this 25/50% arrangement since Oscar and I’s direct relationship is perfectly adequate (probably better than Steve’s in the sense that they come to us to actually get stuff done ...

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Dattani was in many ways a candid and engaging witness, but his evidence did not inspire confidence in his ability as a portfolio manager. Although experienced in structured finance, before joining UBS in October 2004 he had no experience in managing a portfolio of reference names in a CDO. The Balaba STCDO portfolio was only the second CDO which he had ever managed. It is therefore surprising that he was left to manage these STCDO portfolios, which had a combined value of several hundred million dollars, with no real supervision by anyone else with appropriate experience. Rather he was left to seek assistance if he thought it was necessary but this, as he explained, did not happen very often. Indeed, on at least one occasion, in August 2007, he was reluctant to have a discussion with credit analysts about some of the financial entities in the KWL portfolios when one of his superiors, Mr van Klaveren, suggested that he should. That may have proved to be an expensive mistake. It is now the main thrust of KWL’s complaint that the portfolios were far too heavily exposed to financial entities.</p>

KWL submits that Dr Schirmer was “an obviously honest and thoughtful witness”. I did not find him to be so. Rather, he was an unreliable and in important respects untruthful witness. I understand that he still faces the possibility of criminal proceedings in Germany. Some aspects of his conduct demonstrate a serious dereliction of his duty as a managing director of KWL.

These were meetings which took place at least monthly, attended by the two managing directors and the heads of KWL’s various departments. The minutes were only disclosed by KWL after Dr Schirmer had given this evidence. They contained no reference to any such discussion.  </p>

But this cannot be right. Freshfields’ 26 May 2006 letter of advice to KWL stated very clearly that whether prior Supervisory Board approval was required was an open question and said nothing about subsequent notification (see [133] below). If Dr Schirmer read the advice as he claimed, he signed the transaction documents knowing that there was no Supervisory Board approval in place, despite the advice which Freshfields had given. This would have been seriously culpable. It is more likely that he never bothered to read the advice and that his evidence that he had was untrue.</p>

At the time this letter was signed, the net proceeds for the Balaba transaction were already known to be US $21.1 million. Even if Dr Schirmer did not know this (which he probably did not) he was grossly negligent not to inquire when his evidence was that the purpose of the transactions was to raise funds for KWL. The result was that KWL had agreed to sign away the majority of the proceeds from the Balaba transaction and was in effect giving up all proceeds from any future transactions. Faced with this, Dr Schirmer’s reaction in cross examination was to deny having signed the letter. This was obviously untrue. The document bears what certainly appears to be his signature. He had never before denied having signed it and KWL had never contested the authenticity of the document or of Dr Schirmer’s signature.</p>

However, instead of using the presentation which UBS had provided, Mr Heininger used his own highly misleading presentation, which he gave twice, once to KWL’s Finance and Construction Committee, and once to the Supervisory Board itself. Dr Schirmer was present at both meetings. His evidence was that he did not concentrate on Mr Heininger’s presentation, because he was focussed on two subsequent agenda items for the Supervisory Board, in particular on one relating to an increased project budget for which he was responsible. I do not accept this. I find that Dr Schirmer was content to allow Mr Heininger to mislead the board. </p>

KWL placed some emphasis on this trip as evidencing a corrupt relationship between Value Partners and UBS, on the basis that nobody from KWL was invited. In fact, it is clear that Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer were invited and were expected to attend. On 13 September 2006 Mr Heininger told a friend, Martina Konz, that he was going to “travel for a few days with a couple of friends (the usual ones) to South Africa at the end of October”. Two days later, he emailed Dr Schirmer to say that he had arranged an appointment for them both for vaccinations against hepatitis A, typhoid and malaria. Dr Schirmer denied being invited to South Africa, or any knowledge of such a trip, but that denial is not credible. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact it is clear why Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer pulled out of this trip at a late stage. It was because of a scandal which had erupted in the Leipzig press concerning allegations of inappropriate trips to stay in a luxury hotel in Dubai (Mr Heininger and others, but not Dr Schirmer) and a 2002 trip on Concorde (Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer), paid for in both cases by Mr Senf’s and Mr Blatz’s former company, Global Capital Finance. Others in Leipzig were also said to be implicated. These allegations were being investigated by accountants appointed by the KWL Supervisory Board. In those circumstances, to go on a luxury safari paid for by Value Partners would not have been politic.</p>

This was not true. The different explanation which he gave in evidence, that the Concorde flight was necessitated by a religious holiday the previous day on which as a religious man he was reluctant to travel, was an explanation never previously advanced which did not make sense. The fact is that he did travel on the holiday in question, even if only as far as Paris.</p>

They claimed that no further contractual relationships had taken place between “the involved parties” since October 2003. But that was thoroughly misleading in circumstances where they both knew that Messrs Senf and Blatz were being handsomely paid, in their new incarnation as Value Partners, for their role in connection with the Balaba and LBBW STCDOs and had invited them on a South African safari as a thank you.</p>

But in the storm of excitement about this whipped up by the Leipzig press, Dr Schirmer clearly thought that it was. Instead of acknowledging that this had happened, he preferred to try and lie his way out of trouble and to cover up his and Mr Heininger’s other more recent dealings with Value Partners.</p>

Dr Schirmer must have realised from the lies told by Mr Heininger in which he had colluded that this relationship was highly inappropriate and had resulted in Mr Heininger becoming compromised, even though (as I accept) he did not know the full extent of Mr Heininger’s corruption. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixth, during late 2006 and 2007 there was a police investigation into Mr Heininger and Value Partners, which included a search for documents relating to transactions with Value Partners. This was a highly sensitive issue at KWL, although Mr Heininger remained in post. In addition, beginning in September 2007, Bettina Kudla, the Deputy Mayor for Finance of Leipzig and a member of the KWL Supervisory Board, began to ask questions about the performance of the single name bonds for which, unknown to her, KWL had purchased credit protection by means of the CDSs. Dr Schirmer was aware of these enquiries, but instead of the honest response, which would have been to explain that the risk of a default on these bonds had been removed by the purchase of the CDSs and replaced by the different risk under the STCDOs, he and Mr Heininger gave stalling and misleading replies. His explanation for this made no sense at all. It is clear that he continued to conceal the existence of the transactions from the Supervisory Board, most likely because acknowledging them would bring to light the lies he had told to the Supervisory Board in 2006. Even when the existence of the CDSs was finally admitted in 2008, there was no mention of the STCDOs or of the involvement of Value Partners. Ms Kudla followed up a reference to credit default insurance with further questions, in particular asking whether there were CDOs involved and whether KWL had received anything for entering into this insurance, but once again Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer provided responses which were in part false and in other respects misleading. </p>

Also in October 2009, Mr Heininger had approached KWL’s Supervisory Board and shareholders seeking approval for a transaction involving the replacement of the MBIA bond, to be funded through the sale of the MBIA CDS. The response of the Supervisory Board was to engage KPMG to provide an independent examination of the proposal. On 23 October, LVV wrote to Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer to confirm KPMG’s engagement and asked them to cooperate in providing documents relating to both the cross-border leases and the UBS transaction, including the “consultancy agreement with UBS”, together with Value Partners’ “assessment” of the UBS transaction. Against this background, in November 2009, Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer decided to fabricate evidence, signing a new engagement letter between KWL and Value Partners, backdated to 17 May 2006.</p>

By this time he knew that Mr Heininger had been charged with corruption involving Value Partners and that KPMG had been engaged to investigate.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no sufficient basis to conclude, and no party suggested, that Dr Schirmer was aware of the monetary bribes paid to Mr Heininger, in connection with either the cross-border lease or the STCDOs, or of the fact that most of the premium generated by the STCDOs would be diverted to Value Partners. But I find that a time must have come when Dr Schirmer must have been aware that Value Partners or its predecessor had adopted a practice of providing extravagant and inappropriate perks to Mr Heininger which can only have meant that it was making lucrative profits from its role in connection with the cross-border leases and the STCDO transactions. That ought to have caused him to question whether Value Partners was giving disinterested advice to KWL. By the time of the 7 September 2006 board meeting it must have been apparent to him that something was wrong, and by the time of the expenses scandal in October 2006 he must have realised that the whole relationship with Value Partners was improper. From then on, for reasons which are not clear but which probably arose from a concern for his own position, he was prepared to collude with Mr Heininger in a cover up. The most likely explanation is that having begun to tell lies about the 2002 Concorde trip and knowing of the much more recent dealings with Value Partners, he felt unable to allow the truth to be known. However, although he could and should have asked some searching questions, I am not persuaded that Dr Schirmer in fact appreciated the impropriety of the relationship with Value Partners before September 2006.</p>

However, it must be said that they remained in ignorance of these matters in large part because of the Supervisory Board’s complete failure to exercise proper oversight over Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer, or even to ask basic questions, for example at the board meeting of 7 September 2006.

Such funds were generated because the Trust would be domiciled outside Germany and would therefore, because of tax rules applicable in different jurisdictions, be able to take advantage of deductions for depreciation which KWL itself was not able to realise. It was this which made possible the making of an upfront payment to KWL. However, the risk for KWL was that, if it failed to make rental payments as they fell due or failed at the end of the term to pay the price required to buy back its assets, it would lose control of the infrastructure for the supply of water and sewage facilities to the citizens of Leipzig which was the whole reason for its existence.</p>

If KWL had wished to purchase such a free standing hedge, and if it had the necessary funds, there was no reason why it could not have done so. That would not have eliminated its existing risk altogether, as it would still be exposed in the event of a default by both the defeasance provider and UBS (a “double default risk”), but it would have reduced it. However, to purchase such protection would have cost KWL money, the “spread” (i.e. the premium over Libor/Euribor, expressed in basis points or “bps”, each basis point being 1/100 of 1%) in return for which the protection seller (here UBS) agrees to make a payment if the entity concerned defaults. Such a free standing purchase of credit protection was of no interest to KWL. Its object in entering into the transactions was to generate cash.</p>

Subsequently, however, “synthetic” CDOs were developed, in which a CDO was structured based on a portfolio of CDS contracts referencing such bonds instead of the bonds themselves. In such a synthetic CDO, the arranging bank creates the portfolio by selling CDS protection in the market against an agreed set of reference entities. A synthetic CDO can be structured on an unfunded basis, in which case the investors make no up-front payment but instead take on the risk of having to make a future payment in the event of sufficient defaults occurring in the portfolio to impact their tranche. In such a structure, the investors effectively sell credit protection against the performance of the underlying portfolio of reference entities, with each tranche of the CDO taking on a different part of the risk of that portfolio. The STCDOs in this case were synthetic and unfunded.</p>

However, although at first sight this diversification looks like a spreading of risk over a large number of different entities (there were initially 100 entities in the Balaba portfolio and 160 entities in each of the other portfolios), in fact each portfolio was only as good as whatever turned out to be its (approximately) seven to ten weakest members over the term of the STCDO in question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The risk to which KWL was now exposed was to be mitigated by management of the portfolio. Thus, in contrast with a static or unmanaged portfolio, steps could be taken to remove entities which appeared to be at risk of future default. For this purpose KWL engaged UBS GAM to manage the portfolio. Removing an entity from the portfolio meant that UBS GAM would have to arrange (in effect) for another participant in the credit market to take on the credit risk of the entity concerned, thereby releasing KWL from its obligation. However, if that entity was perceived as a credit risk, its spread was likely to have widened, meaning that anyone taking on the credit risk would need to be compensated for doing so. Removal could therefore be costly, with the cost being incurred in the form of a loss of subordination in the KWL tranche. But loss of subordination meant that fewer defaults would be required to reach the attachment point of the tranche. Knowing when to remove a deteriorating name or one which was at risk of deterioration therefore required careful judgment, and sometimes involved balancing the need to avoid a potential default against the loss of subordination which might have to be incurred to effect the removal. Moreover, it is a feature of STCDOs that they must remain fully invested. Removal of one or more entities must be balanced by the addition of others.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A. What I would say is that one reason why these STCDOs were a profitable business line for the bank is because it was almost impossible, given the complexity of the negotiations and structuring, for the client to be running two banks in competition up to the last minute, okay? The client pretty much, given the cost and complexity of the process, had to select a bank and then stick with that bank during the execution. When you know as a bank that you're in sole position on a highly complex product, where there's 200 different ways to move around value -- 200 is a figurative -- figure of speech, but many different ways to move around value, then it is difficult for the client to make a detailed comparison. And without the detailed comparison, it's hard for the client to negotiate, to make the kind of detailed push-back that you're asking for. In other words, the only way a client could really, at the last minute, push UBS to extract the best price would have been if there had been a second bank in there, say Deutsche Bank, also simultaneously pricing the same product, and if the client had been able to say, ‘Well, UBS, Deutsche is a million dollars better than you, can you improve by a million dollars? Yes or no?’ My point is there was only one bank in for that, you know, execution process, and that was UBS, so the client had kind of, without perhaps realising it, voided their ability to create price tension within the transaction.  Obviously we weren't going to point that out to them. And they gave us their target and we -- you know, we could hit it, they were happy.</p>

Whether exposure to an STCDO is more or less risky than exposure to an individual bond will depend on a number of factors, including the identity of the bond issuer, the contents of the STCDO portfolio, the attachment and detachment points of the tranche and the extent to which the portfolio is diversified.

Suppose the portfolio contained thirty entities rated BBB or lower (as the Balaba STCDO portfolio did). The likelihood that between seven and ten of them will default over an 8-year period is higher than the risk of the German Government defaulting over that same period. In such a stark case the credit protection seller is therefore obviously in a worse position under the STCDO than it was when facing the single-name risk.

In that way the risk of exposure to a risk affecting an individual sector or a single national economy is reduced. But if the entities in the portfolio are too concentrated, the tranche will be exposed to multiple defaults affecting a single sector. The extent to which risks are common to a number of entities so that one default is likely to lead to others is known as “correlation”. </p>

Instead of being exposed to the idiosyncratic risk of four single names as it was before, KWL was now exposed (at any rate once the attachment point was reached) to the idiosyncratic risks of all 100 (or as the case might be 160) entities in the respective portfolios.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One simple way to compare the risks is to compare the premiums payable for taking them on. A credit default swap is in effect a policy of insurance against the risk of a default of a single named entity, while an STCDO is in effect a policy of insurance against the risk of default of the single tranche. In relation to each transaction, the premium paid by KWL for single name protection (the CDS) was much smaller than the premium paid by UBS for protection from the risk of default on the tranche (the STCDO). By way of example, KWL paid US $1.6 million for protection against the risk of default by Balaba, while UBS paid US $22.7 million (some 14 times as much) for an equivalent amount of protection on the Balaba STCDO. Moreover, this latter figure was itself substantially less than the total premium (which also included UBS’s profit and other charges) which UBS received from selling the same protection in the market. It would be misleading to say that the STCDO risk was therefore 14 (or more) times greater than the single name risk, but such a striking difference in the figures does at least suggest that the STCDO carried a significantly higher risk.</p>

Just as an individual bond may be given a rating, so too may an STCDO. The rating represents the ratings agency’s perception of the creditworthiness of a given entity and is obtained by financial modelling using extensive historical data. Inevitably, a model can never be fully accurate and cannot predict with certainty the circumstances in which an entity will or will not default. It must be borne in mind also that the modelling exercise for an STCDO is not in all respects the same as for an individual bond. In general, however, it would be expected that if the risk of default under an STCDO was lower than the risk of default under an individual bond, the STCDO would have a higher rating than the provider of the bond. Conversely, a lower rating for the STCDO would suggest a higher degree of risk than for the single name. </p>

Notwithstanding his somewhat technical explanation of why this did not contradict his earlier evidence as an expert witness in Australian proceedings (<span style="font-style:italic">Bathurst Regional Council v McGraw Hill International (UK) Ltd</span>), I found this hard to reconcile with his evidence in those proceedings to the effect that it was possible to make meaningful comparisons across different asset classes by reference to ratings and that it was important to investors to be able to do so. In fact the ratings agencies strove hard to ensure consistency in rating as between corporate bonds and CDOs and, as I understood his evidence, Dr Ellis came to accept that there was a valid comparison to be made, at any rate as a starting point, although other factors also needed to be taken into account. </p>

In December 2007 Moody’s introduced changes to the model used to calculate CDO ratings which resulted in the downgrading of many STCDOs, while further changes were introduced in 2009 (after the chastening experience of the 2008 financial crisis) which resulted in a more rigorous approach to the rating of CDOs. Ironically, the evidence of KWL’s risk expert, Ms Terri Duhon, was that at any rate in 2004-5 many structuring banks regarded an STCDO as a slightly safer investment than a corporate bond with the same rating, although not in any way that could be quantified. Although she did not accept this, I see no reason to suppose that the position was different in 2006-7. However, that perception would not apply if (as here) the ratings were different.</p>

Some of the UBS witnesses suggested that such premium is not taken into account by Moody’s in rating an STCDO. This would mean that the premium received could be set against the reduced rating when considering the overall risk position. It is correct that sometimes Moody’s did not take such premium into account, particularly if the premium was payable over the life of the STCDO rather than upfront. In this case, however, where the premium was paid upfront, Moody’s made clear that the premium had already been taken into account in arriving at the ratings. In other words, it was because of the premium that the STCDOs were rated as highly as they were. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">UBS submits that the premium is relevant in a different sense when assessing the overall change in risk. That was because the Moody’s ratings model (which involves a complex analysis of historical data) showed low “expected loss” figures for the STCDO. For example, the Balaba STCDO “expected loss” figure was about US $2 million. It was suggested to Ms Duhon, initially by reference to the Balaba STCDO figures although the same point applies similarly to the other STCDOs, that for the risk of an expected loss of only about US $2 million over an eight year period, receipt of an immediate net upfront premium of US $21.1 million represented a reduction of KWL’s overall financial risk. However, I accept Ms Duhon’s evidence that this is not a valid comparison. The “expected loss” figure produced by the ratings model is no more than a probability weighted number calculated by reference to a large number of historical scenarios. It does not represent a reliable prediction of what KWL could actually expect to lose. Indeed, if this were a valid comparison, it would lead to a conclusion that the higher the premium, the less risky the STCDO, which is clearly not the case as Mr Czekalowski made clear (see [137] above).</p>

Moreover, it was recognised that for two products with the same rating, the spread applicable to an STCDO would generally be higher than the spread of a corporate bond. It was this phenomenon of “spread pickup” which enabled traders to create an arbitrage between the two products. Nevertheless, allowing for these considerations and for the fact that spread is not exclusively a reflection of credit risk, the fact that a lower rated STCDO had a significantly higher spread than a corporate bond would provide a good indication that the STCDO should be regarded as carrying greater overall risk.</p>

However, even allowing for the fact that the spreads take account of a wider range of factors than just the perceived risk of default and for the phenomenon of “spread pickup”, the differences are striking. I accept Ms Duhon’s evidence that while spreads are not an absolute measure of risk, these figures do provide a reasonable relative measure of risk, suggesting that the STCDOs would be perceived by the market as carrying greater risks than the individual bonds.</p>

They all suggest that the risks to which KWL was exposed by entering into the STCDOs were greater than the risks to which it had been exposed under the individual bonds. If it had not been for the fact that many of the UBS factual witnesses, as well as UBS’s risk expert Dr Ellis, devoted a great deal of time and effort to an argument that no meaningful comparison could be made between the single name risks and the STCDO risks, it might have been thought that it was obvious that the latter were materially greater than the former. In this context I found the evidence of Ms Short a welcome contrast to that of other witnesses. Although some UBS witnesses and Dr Ellis were eventually persuaded to agree that the STCDO risks were greater, Ms Short needed no such persuading. Asked by Mr Tim Lord QC for KWL whether the effect of the transaction initially proposed (whereby all four individual bonds would be replaced by STCDOs entered into directly with UBS) would be to reduce KWL’s risk overall, she said this:</p>

As already noted, even the lowest rated Balaba STCDO was A rated by Moody’s which meant that it was “considered upper-medium grade and … subject to low credit risk”. Based on historical data, the risk of sufficient defaults to exhaust the tranche over an eight to ten year term could be calculated as no more than (at most) a few percentage points. The various portfolios were made up of investment grade bonds and similar securities and it would have taken dramatic economic events in order for sufficient defaults to occur to reach the attachment points of the KWL tranches, let alone to render KWL liable for the full value of its notional. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A.  I would regard it as bearing significant risk.  It is -- the way tranche structures work is that you have X number of defaults in a portfolio that can actually happen before your principal is affected. I can't remember the exact number, but I think six or seven names had to default in the market. There are 200 names in the reference portfolio that they were investing in. Six or seven names of those had to default before their principal was affected. After that point, their principal is getting marked down very aggressively. The tranche width, as you can see, is 1.5 per cent, which is quite thin in these sort of transactions. The subordination level is quite low. So there was significant risk in that transaction. But as I said, I took significant comfort from the fact that GAM, UBS, had basically structured this deal for them, they were trying to reorganise their credit exposures, but there was risk in that deal.</p>

Moreover, that this represented a real risk over the 8 to 10 year term of the STCDOs was not only foreseeable but was actually foreseen by Mr Bawden of UBS’s Credit Risk Committee. With some prescience he insisted on recording his refusal to approve the transaction even after UBS’s top management had overruled CRC’s initial refusal. He did so precisely because of the risk of such “an extreme stress event”:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the STCDOs involved a low, but nevertheless real, significant and foreseeable risk of the loss of the full value of KWL’s notional, resulting in a potential liability of several hundred million dollars. That risk was materially greater than the risks to which KWL was already exposed under the single name bonds. As a result of the events of 2008 and the defaults which followed over the next couple of years the STCDOs were starkly exposed as being what in truth they always were – speculative transactions involving massive potential liabilities which were thoroughly unsuitable for a municipal water company such as KWL, even one which was keen to raise money on the international capital markets. Even then, however, the portfolios as originally assembled would not have resulted in a total loss of KWL’s investment. In the event it was only because of the changes to the portfolio made by UBS GAM that such losses occurred. Whether UBS GAM’s management was negligent is one of the issues to be considered in this judgment.</p>

These were approved by KWL’s Supervisory Board and were already in place before UBS had any dealings with KWL. UBS played no part in marketing or structuring them. They were highly complex. Only entities with some level of financial sophistication, or at any rate with access to specialist advice, would have entered into such transactions. The fact that KWL had entered into these leases therefore said something to UBS about KWL, but this should not be overstated. KWL remained a municipal water company and the four cross-border leases which it concluded were four out of a large number of such leases entered into by municipal or municipally-owned entities during this period.</p>

Global Capital Finance had been engaged by KWL pursuant to an Engagement Letter signed in July 2002 by Mr Blatz and Mr Senf on the one hand and by Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer on the other. In July 2005 KWL entered into an agreement with Value Partners under which KWL handed over all regular reporting and monitoring tasks to Value Partners for all previously concluded and future cross-border leases.</p>

He was charged and later convicted with having accepted bribes and with tax fraud. Mr Hanss (managing director of KWL’s main shareholder LVV and of KWL’s sister company LVB) was convicted for the same reason in June 2011. Allegations about Mr Heininger’s trips to Dubai and a Concorde trip to New York in November 2002 by Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer were to surface in the Leipzig press in September 2006 and play an important part in the story (see [445] below).

Investment to upgrade its outdated facilities was badly needed and it was required by the city authorities not only to keep its prices down but to make a contribution to other municipal infrastructure projects. Local sources of funding had been utilised as far as they could be. KWL sought, therefore, to explore the possibility of new sources of funding in the international capital markets. That had already been the motivation for the cross-border leases but that source of funding was drying up, partly because the tax loopholes which had made such transactions worthwhile were being closed and partly because KWL had now leased all of its relevant infrastructure assets. The raising of funds was primarily Mr Heininger’s responsibility.</p>

One likely source of such information was literature obtained in March 2006 from a German financial consultancy company called Due Finance. This discussed in very general terms the possibility of restructuring such leases by means of credit default swaps. It identified two possible motivations for concluding such arrangements. One was to generate additional yield. The other was to reduce risk by enhancing the creditworthiness of the risks to which a company was exposed. The article warned, however, that “it is obvious that both goals cannot be achieved at the same time”. </p>

What he was interested in was generating additional yield, principally for his own corrupt benefit. His email to Nadja Teichert of Value Partners of 9 March 2006 shows a recognition that in order to obtain a financial benefit from this type of transaction it was generally necessary to accept an increased risk. No doubt he would not have wanted to increase the risks to which KWL was exposed to a dangerous level, not least as that would increase the risk of exposure of his own conduct (as eventually occurred), but I see no reason to doubt, and I find, that Mr Heininger was from the outset prepared to accept some increase in risk as the necessary price of obtaining upfront cash. This is in accordance with other evidence which he gave in Germany, to the effect that so long as the rating of the STCDOs was higher than KWL’s own shadow rating, he regarded the STCDO risk as acceptable. </p>

Some UBS witnesses agreed with this as a general proposition. However, it is necessary to examine the contemporary documents to see what was actually being said by UBS on particular occasions and what was important to KWL. It is also necessary to bear in mind the difference between what was being said by and to KWL as the reason for the transaction and the effect which it could be expected to have on the one hand and what was being said to UBS’s Credit Risk Committee in order to obtain approval for the transaction on the other. The UBS deal team and in particular Mr Bracy understood that in order to obtain that approval, it would be necessary to present the transaction to CRC as one which was suitable for KWL because it reduced KWL’s overall risk. But that is very different from saying that this was actually what motivated KWL to conclude the transaction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bracy’s evidence was different. He said that he contacted Mr Blatz at the beginning of April 2006 in connection with a potential new product called “MATILDA” which he had been developing, that he did so as part of a process of testing whether there was any market appetite for such a product, and that it was Value Partners who proposed a restructuring of KWL’s cross-border leases by means of CDOs. Essentially his evidence painted a picture whereby the STCDO transactions were brought to UBS by Value Partners in something very close to what was intended (before the issue of intermediation arose) to be their final form.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At all events, a telephone conversation took place between Mr Senf and Mr Blatz of Value Partners and Mr Bracy of UBS on 6 April 2006. This was the first communication between them relating to what became the STCDOs and was to lead to what I find to be the arrangement between them which KWL contends comprises an agency relationship or, at the least, gave rise to an obvious conflict of interest. In some ways it might seem difficult to make findings about this and other conversations between three participants, two of whom (Messrs Senf and Blatz) did not give evidence in the trial and whose accounts given in other proceedings suffer from the disadvantage that they are dishonest criminals, while the third (Mr Bracy, who did give evidence) was also dishonest and a thoroughly unsatisfactory witness. Nevertheless the available documents and the way in which matters developed make the position reasonably clear. I make the following findings as to this particular conversation:</p>

It was not at all clear from Mr Bracy’s evidence exactly what this product was. Whatever it was, it had not been developed by Mr Bracy beyond a vague and general concept. It is probable that any discussion of it was quickly dropped and never re-emerged, in favour of a discussion of CDOs and how they could be used to generate additional yield by restructuring cross-border leases.</p>

However, they asked about this in general terms, making clear that they did not know much about this topic.</p>

It presented them with an ideal opportunity to profit further at KWL’s expense, and moreover to do so with very little risk to themselves. While the STCDOs would involve exposing KWL to potentially crippling liabilities if sufficient entities within the portfolios defaulted within their term, the risk of this happening, although real (and the higher the premium, the greater the risk), was thought to be very low.</p>

If he did, the explanation and the sending of a textbook introduction to CDOs would have been not only unnecessary but somewhat patronising. It would not have been a promising start to a revival of what Mr Bracy hoped would be a relationship which was critical to his future prospects in circumstances where the market for cross-border leases (where his expertise lay) was ceasing to exist. The fact that Mr Senf needed to be told what “CDO” stood for and that Mr Bracy thought it would be useful to send these materials indicates that Value Partners did not have expertise in relation to STCDOs. While Mr Senf and Mr Blatz would no doubt have been capable of understanding the material sent to them without undue difficulty (in Mr Bracy’s phrase, that would not have been “a heavy lift” for the people at Value Partners), they cannot have held themselves out to Mr Bracy, or been regarded by him, as experienced advisers in this field. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, Mr Bracy was at all times extremely concerned to ensure that he was appropriately rewarded by UBS for his efforts to secure this transaction and any further transactions concluded through Value Partners, and that he was not cut out of any deal by the UBS bankers in London. He was employed in the Municipal Securities Group in the United States, which had no STCDO or structuring expertise, and he was therefore dependent on the structuring team in London to bring such deals to fruition. He had previous experience of a similar deal where he had been cut out and was anxious that this should not happen again. He recognised, correctly, that his only contribution to the deal consisted of his relationship with Value Partners, and that others in London (in particular UBS’s Debt Capital Markets group, the group responsible for marketing structured CDOs in Europe, headed by Mr Jordan who would typically have filled the client relationship role) would have no scruples about excluding Mr Bracy if they could in order to take the credit for the profit which UBS could be expected to make from the deal. Mr Sanz-Paris was the only member of the London structuring team that Mr Bracy trusted and he was concerned that a mechanism should be put in place to reward him before the Debt Capital Markets group and in particular Mr Jordan got a chance (as he saw it) to muscle in on his deal. This reflected what appears to have been a predatory culture within UBS, at any rate at that time, whereby UBS staff would not only (as it were) eat what they killed, but would fight each other if necessary for a share of the prey. It was this concern which lay behind Mr Bracy’s request to Mr Sanz-Paris to keep the matter confidential.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, it was made clear by Value Partners that this STCDO should deliver the maximum up front yield, and that this was what the as yet unnamed client wanted. In order to achieve this, an “aggressive structure” should be adopted. This was to be contrasted with a more “moderate” (i.e. lesser risk) structure. The relationship between risk and return was therefore well understood by Value Partners and, as I find, by Mr Heininger.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, Mr Bracy referred to Value Partners’ high level of confidence that they could “deliver the client”. In context this is a revealing and important phrase which accurately characterised the role which Value Partners was to play. It is also one which, at this stage, would have been premature if Value Partners was acting as a genuinely independent adviser to KWL with KWL’s best interests at heart. It was premature because so far (as Mr Bracy knew) Value Partners had only a limited understanding of STCDOs and had seen no information about what an STCDO tailored for KWL might look like in terms of attachment point, tranche width, portfolio names, credit rating and upfront premium. Without that information it was far too early to form a view about whether an STCDO would be in KWL’s best interests. Nevertheless Value Partners apparently felt “very strongly” that it could “deliver the client”. Taken in isolation and out of context this may perhaps appear an innocuous phrase, but in my judgment the evidence as a whole demonstrates that the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners was that the latter’s agreed role was to advise their existing clients (and subsequently even to seek out new clients for whom they would purport to act in an advisory role) to conclude STCDOs with UBS (in other words, to “deliver the client” to UBS) and to do so, moreover, regardless of whether that was in the clients’ best interests. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the comment that “these guys have more to come as well” demonstrates that this was intended to be an ongoing arrangement, not limited to the as yet unnamed KWL, and that this had been discussed between Value Partners and Mr Bracy. It seems highly likely, viewing these early messages in the light of what came later, that the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners was in place from a very early stage.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That this was how Mr Bracy and Value Partners saw their arrangement at a slightly later stage is put beyond doubt by an e-mail sent by Mr Bracy to Value Partners on 11 July 2006. It is convenient to mention this now, out of sequence, because it casts important light on the next message which Mr Bracy sent, on 10 April 2006. In the 11 July e-mail Mr Bracy sent to Value Partners a list of cross-border lease deals which he had obtained from a Mr Ed Maron. At that time Mr Maron did not work for UBS but for a different company, BTM, although Mr Bracy was hoping to and subsequently did recruit Mr Maron as his assistant at UBS. Mr Bracy saw this list as Mr Maron’s “leverage … that can lead to restructuring opportunities”. It is apparent, therefore, that Mr Bracy expected that his superiors who would be making the decision whether to offer Mr Maron a job would be made aware of the use to which he intended to put the list – this was his “leverage” to obtain employment at UBS. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Leaving to one side the fact that Mr Bracy must have realised that Mr Maron (who at that time was still employed by a competitor) can have had no legitimate business providing this list to Mr Bracy, what is significant is the use to which Mr Bracy intended that Value Partners should put this client list:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus Value Partners were to approach potential clients on Mr Maron’s list offering to act as “the advisor to the client” to restructure the client’s leases. The advice which they would then give to the client would be to restructure by means of CDSs and STCDOs, as in the case of KWL, and they would ensure that such deals were brought to UBS and not elsewhere. This would enable Mr Bracy and Value Partners to “keep control of the process” and to maximise their own remuneration at the client’s expense.</p>

Accordingly the email was not put to him in cross examination for any explanation which he might be able to offer. UBS submits that it would therefore be unfair to allow KWL to rely on it. However, Mr Bracy was extensively cross examined by Mr Lord on behalf of KWL about his relationship with Value Partners generally, including with regard to the “letter for K” episode described below. He had a full opportunity to explain what this relationship was and I have rejected his explanation. I am satisfied that there is no injustice to UBS in taking this email at face value. </p>

I am not persuaded, however, that this would have happened. On the contrary, it seems that UBS in the person of Mr Sanz-Paris himself knew that Value Partners’ role as an adviser to prospective clients was being compromised, but chose to ask no questions about this, and that Mr Bracy’s superiors in the Municipal Securities Group were told what was proposed. As appears from Mr Bracy’s 1 September email quoted above, he had sent the list to Mr Sanz-Paris. Mr Bracy made no secret within UBS of the purpose for which Mr Maron had sent him this list. His email to Mr Sanz-Paris makes this clear. It is therefore probable that Mr Sanz-Paris and indeed others were also aware of the purpose to which the list was to be put.  </p>

This was highly exaggerated. Value Partners was never envisaged to be a part of UBS’s staff or to be integrated into UBS’s internal operations, and those UBS witnesses who described this suggestion as absurd were correct. Nevertheless the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners for Value Partners to deliver clients to UBS was as I have described it.</p>

This was publicly available information, but no doubt it was convenient for Value Partners to have the list in this form. Although Mr Bracy denied this, the reason for sending this list must have been to identify potential counterparties for Value Partners to approach in order to “advise” them to conclude STCDOs with UBS. Although this was not spelled out in the same way as it was to be in the case of Mr Maron’s list, there was no other reason for Mr Bracy to send this list to Mr Senf.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">UBS places some reliance on a document dated 19 April 2006 in which Value Partners wrote to Mr Heininger with advice about diversifying the risk of default by the individual defeasance providers to which KWL was exposed. After identifying those existing risks the letter described the “<span style="color:#000000">objective of the transaction” as being “to specifically substitute these existing individual risks with a diversified product, and thus achieve a broadly positioned risk diversification for KWL”. This seems puzzling. As already indicated, Value Partners knew that the real objective of the transaction (certainly Mr Heininger’s, to whom the letter was addressed, and for different reasons also Dr Schirmer’s, although the letter was not addressed to him) was to generate funds. The letter went on to identify “the key elements of the transaction”, namely to hedge the existing single name risks by diversification into a portfolio of 150 to 160 reference credits over a wide spread of different regions, sectors and companies, with t</span>he <span style="color:#000000">underlying credit quality of the portfolio “adjusted to the relevant specific risk profile of KWL” and confirmed by a rating from Moody's or Standard &amp; Poor’s. In addition, it stated that KWL would benefit from the active management of the portfolio by a professional portfolio manager, thus allowing the substitution of individual credits, in order to be able to react to changes in the rating of individual credits or even industrial sectors. In this way, said Value Partners, “it is guaranteed that the credit quality remains constant and improves constantly throughout the loan period”. Finally, the letter added, as if this were not the real driver for KWL’s interest in this transaction:</span></p>

In particular, the subsidiary role in the proposed transaction attributed to an increased return, when in fact this was the principal motivation for the transaction and was a factor which Value Partners continued to emphasise in its dealings with UBS even when it was made clear that an increased return would mean greater risk, raises a question as to the real purpose of this letter. It was found by the German court to have been a later concoction. Although this was not (and could not really have been) explored in the evidence before me, in view of the oddities identified above that finding seems likely to be correct.</p>

Richard was <span style="color:#000000">Richard Isgard, a lawyer friend from their CSFB days who had nothing to do with this transaction but whose role appears to have been to arrange for strippers to entertain Messrs Senf and Blatz from time to time when they visited Mr Bracy in the United States. It is apparent, therefore, that Messrs, Senf, Blatz and Bracy were already confident that they would be able to make the transaction happen and were joking about a celebratory closing party together, even though they had not yet even begun to discuss terms. It is apparent also (and was apparent to Mr Sanz-Paris to whom Mr Bracy forwarded Mr Senf’s email) that Value Partners’ priority (which it attributed to the client) was not low risk but high premium.</span></p>

However, the email is not necessarily to be understood in this way. A request for competitive pricing is equally capable of meaning (and in my judgment did mean) no more than that UBS should quote the highest possible premium. I do not accept that Mr Sanz-Paris and Mr Mehta understood it at the time as meaning that they were in competition with other banks. There was no evidence of any real competition and the cosy relationship between Value Partners and Mr Bracy makes it unlikely that Value Partners was indeed shopping around.

This did not go down well with Mr Senf, who queried whether it constituted “aggressive pricing” as requested. Mr Bracy commented to Mr Senf that UBS could show results that would increase the value upfront but with slightly higher risk (“we could go into lower rated paper …<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Italic';color:#000000"> </span>we can show results that could increase the 4-5 million upfront but with slightly higher risk.

The engagement letter stated that Value Partners would be paid a success fee of "3.5% of the notional trading volume of the underlying cross-border leasing portefeuille (approx.

This would be for KWL to decide, advised as necessary by Value Partners. In view of the fees which could be charged for such management, this could be a valuable role. Value Partners was clearly aware of this and sought to exploit the influence which it would have in choosing the manager. On 28 April 2006 Mr Blatz emailed Mr Bracy suggesting that Value Partners was “in a position to promote UBS as being the CDO manager over the term - of course, we would expect to receive a fair compensation for that!” Picking up on Mr Bracy’s earlier joke about the closing party which the lawyer Richard Isgard would arrange, Mr Blatz added that “Of course, that would also increase the pot we can spend for our closing party”.</p>

When Mr Bracy was asked about it, he said that he did not understand that any payment would be kept secret from KWL and that he had no idea what was meant by the pot for the closing party. This was untruthful. Mr Bracy knew precisely what the “pot” was and, even though Mr Blatz was probably not to be taken literally in saying that this was how any “compensation” would be spent, the reference to spending the compensation on a closing party to be arranged by Richard Isgard made clear that this was money which KWL was not going to hear about or benefit from.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Value Partners’ request for such “compensation” was evidently meant to be taken seriously. It was followed up in a later e-mail from Mr Senf asking for a response. Mr Bracy passed the suggestion on to Mr Sanz-Paris who discussed it with Mr Czekalowski. Eventually on 2 May 2006 Mr Bracy responded to Value Partners that payment for the promotion of UBS GAM involved an “appearance of impropriety” and therefore could not be considered. Ms Short’s evidence was that Value Partners’ suggestion represented a breach of its fiduciary duty to KWL which ought to have caused the UBS deal team to have nothing more to do with Value Partners. I accept that evidence as demonstrating the response of an honest and fair minded banker in a control function. Mr Mark Northway of LBBW, another honest and fair minded banker in a business role, said that he regarded Mr Blatz’s proposal as “highly inappropriate as it put Value Partners in a position in which it was prioritising its own interests above those of its client, KWL” and that if he had known about this he would, as a minimum, have required confirmation from KWL that it was informed of, and comfortable with, its adviser's resulting conflict of interest. It is therefore striking that Mr Bracy was prepared to pass the suggestion on within UBS rather than squashing it straight away and that Mr Sanz-Paris too saw nothing seriously wrong with it. He described it in evidence as merely “cheeky” rather than as indicative of a more serious problem. </p>

The episode illustrates the blunting of sensibility on the part of members of the UBS deal team, who were quite content to continue to deal with Value Partners on this highly lucrative transaction and did not even think of ensuring that KWL was aware that this request had been made.</p>

It is clear too that the choice of UBS GAM was promoted by the UBS deal team, and that the choice was made before negotiations took place to determine what level of fees UBS GAM would charge. The later claim by the deal team in their submission to the UBS Credit Risk Committee that UBS GAM had been selected independently and without the involvement of the deal team was not true.

He followed this by forwarding to Mr Blatz and Mr Senf a draft term sheet together with a spreadsheet showing the “transaction economics”. This set out the gross and net benefits to be anticipated from the proposed restructuring, with a projected total net benefit to KWL of just under US $19.5 million, although this was based on a funded restructuring rather than a synthetic STCDO portfolio. He explained that the figure of US $19.5 million was based on AA-rated CDOs but that “if the client desires to see an approximately $30 million benefit (or greater)”, UBS could and would show them that number, although “the rating for such a return on the CDO would be lower than AA (probably A or A+).” He went on to explain that UBS would prepare a matrix showing the return available at different ratings and that “This way it could be demonstrated to the client that we can achieve in a managed portfolio a range of economic benefit depending on the rating and risk profile the client desires.” Once again, therefore, the relationship between premium and risk was explicit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus Mr Bracy was envisaging a future role for Value Partners whereby it would act as “an exclusive finder for clients” for UBS, with priority over UBS’s own internal marketing department. Any such role was obviously inconsistent with Value Partners acting as an adviser providing independent advice to potential counterparties. Mr Bracy’s evidence was that this was “just talk” and to a large extent it was, as the idea that UBS’s own marketers would acquiesce in such a formal relegation of their own position was fanciful. Mr Sanz-Paris was at pains to say that the suggestion did not make sense to him and that there had been no conversation with him as described by Mr Bracy, who was either making it up or had misinterpreted him. I accept that is so. However, Mr Bracy must have intended – and believed -- that the suggestion would be taken seriously by Value Partners. He would not have written an e-mail which he knew that Mr Senf and Mr Blatz would disregard as hopelessly unrealistic or which would make him look silly in their eyes. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At about the same time Mr Bracy forwarded to Value Partners an exchange of emails with a UBS analyst in Washington in which he had requested information about legal and political developments regarding cross-border lease arrangements which he could pass on to Value Partners. He referred to Value Partners as a firm with which UBS had a “strategic relationship”, and asked for regular updates which could be transmitted “to our collective clients as we are expanding our joint initiative in Europe”. By itself a request for such updates would be entirely innocuous, but in the context of Mr Bracy’s other dealings with Value Partners described above it appears that he saw Value Partners as working with him to bring business to UBS and wanted Value Partners to be aware of this. Indeed the only expanding “joint initiative” with Value Partners in Europe was the arrangement whereby counterparties to whom Value Partners was supposedly providing independent advice would be delivered to UBS for the conclusion of lucrative STCDOs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bracy also emailed his boss in UBS’s Municipal Securities Group to explain what he was doing.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was information that could only have come from Value Partners. Mr Bracy said in evidence that the expression “captive clients” referred merely to good clients who valued Value Partners’ advice, but I consider that Mr Bracy’s contemporary language is a better reflection of the way he actually saw the relationship between Value Partners and its clients and that the sense of this (and probably even the language used: “captive clients … that will do what they recommend”) reflects what Mr Senf and Mr Blatz had told him. (Indeed in a later email, dated 24 April 2007, Mr Bracy contrasted the “control” which Mr Senf had over KWL with his relationship with another potential client). The parties to whom the relationship was to be “mutually beneficial” were UBS and Value Partners. Once again, it is evident that Mr Bracy saw the relationship as one in which UBS and Value Partners would work together to deliver the latter’s “captive clients” to UBS for STCDO transactions with a total expected transaction volume of US $500 million. His purpose in writing was to ensure that his boss knew what he was doing and to ensure that his efforts on behalf of UBS were appropriately rewarded by what he described as “an equitable split of firm revenue”. He was not, therefore, on a frolic of his own unknown to more senior management. On the contrary, he was anxious that his superiors should be aware of – and should ensure an appropriate reward for – the work he was doing on behalf of UBS.</p>

He explained that the meeting needed to give Mr Heininger especially “the confidence in the product (I think we will pick the synthetic way) and in the timeline”. This too is language suggesting that Value Partners saw themselves as working together with Mr Bracy to persuade KWL to do the deal. Mr Senf went on to instruct Mr Bracy:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This seems an odd instruction. Previously Value Partners had emphasised its client’s “high yield minded” and “very much money minded” approach and the importance of “competitive” and “aggressive” pricing. Clearly that was based on conversations with Mr Heininger. Risk management had not featured as a significant priority. Now it was telling UBS to avoid mentioning figures and to emphasise the advantages of an STCDO for managing risk. The inference must be that it did not want Dr Schirmer, who was making a first appearance in the negotiations at the proposed meeting and who was described rather dismissively by Mr Senf as speaking English badly and coming because he “just want to be part of the party”, to hear figures which would indicate what premium KWL could expect to receive. There was certainly material provided in the course of the negotiations from which Dr Schirmer could have discovered the amount of the proposed premium, and there was nothing to stop him from asking any question he wanted to, but it does appear that Value Partners sought to keep him so far as possible in the dark about some important aspects of the transaction and succeeded in doing so. </p>

Separately, Mr Mehta also sent a presentation for use at the meeting the following day. Once again the risk/return relationship was obvious.</p>

Dr Schirmer’s evidence demonstrated that he failed completely to understand what was being said at the meeting, which was conducted in English, a language he did not understand. His understanding, such as it was, was derived from occasional summaries provided in German by Mr Heininger. In those circumstances it is in my view safe to conclude that the UBS representatives worked through the presentation which Mr Mehta had prepared, but for the most part it is not possible to go any further than this with any degree of confidence.</p>

It is apparent that, unless Mr Heininger deliberately misled him, Dr Schirmer failed completely to understand what was being said. UBS described his evidence, with justification, as a grotesque misstatement of what the transaction was about, but a misunderstanding which did not come from anything said by UBS.

Mr Bracy and others in the deal team regarded this necessity as something of a nuisance. They understood that for this purpose it would be important to emphasise the risk diversification aspects of the STCDOs. Certainly the view of UBS’s CRC would have been that an essentially speculative transaction designed primarily to achieve an upfront cash premium for KWL which exposed it to even a modest risk of liabilities running into hundreds of millions of dollars would have been a thoroughly unsuitable transaction for a municipal water company. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the need to obtain UBS’s internal approval for the deal largely explains the increasing emphasis on risk reduction which appears in the documents from this time. These were not statements intended to persuade KWL. Mr Heininger and Value Partners had already made clear that their main priority was upfront cash and were about to do so again. Rather they were statements designed to overcome or sidestep the anticipated “usual complications”. This appears with particular clarity in the briefing of Mr Heininger for a due diligence meeting with CRC on 30 May 2006 (see [286] to [289] below).</p>

Mr Bracy said that he had explained that this would only be possible if the tranche for the Balaba STCDO was rated A (rather than AA, in accordance with the example which had been used in the presentation at the meeting). He reported that Value Partners’ response was that this “has already been decided”. This decision must have been made by Value Partners and Mr Heininger following the 9 May 2006 meeting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was therefore apparent to UBS that KWL had determined that it had a minimum cash requirement of US $30 million and that it had decided to accept a lowering of the rating on the Balaba STCDO from AA (as originally discussed) to A in order to achieve this. Subsequently, on 19 May 2006, Mr Sanz-Paris sent an email to Mr Senf and Mr Blatz in which he pointed out that KWL was “moving from a 30 year AAA asset to a combination of a (AA 10yr + AAA 20yr)” and that this “might not conclude in a reduction of risk (as per agencies)”. It was thus made explicit to KWL that the Balaba transaction would not necessarily result in an overall reduction of risk, at any rate as assessed by the ratings agencies. Value Partners understood this and I see no reason to doubt that Mr Heininger did too.</p>

Mr Linfoot and Mr Bunce also accepted this. However, these witnesses were not at the 9 May 2006 meeting either. Mr Linfoot was part of CRC while Mr Bunce was part of UBS’s top management. They did not see the way in which the transaction was presented to KWL and were not privy to Mr Bracy’s conversations with Value Partners. They only saw how it was presented to the CRC. Despite the witnesses’ acceptance of this proposition, I do not accept it. It simply does not accord with the contemporary documents.</p>

Why this was needed is not clear. Although such a presentation was prepared by Mr Tilo Kraus of DCM (who had just been added to the UBS deal team) and was sent to Value Partners on 15 May 2006, Value Partners did not send it on to KWL but instead used it as the basis for a document of their own (called “Beschreibung UBS Produkt” or “Description of UBS product”), which they sent to Mr Heininger and Freshfields on 18 May 2006. Mr Senf emphasised to Freshfields, whose role was to advise KWL and also to prepare a capacity opinion for UBS, that their assessment should focus on the “optimisation” of existing contracts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kraus’s presentation was described as “a short paper outlining the benefits of a CDO strategy in a leasing context”. It described the various “risk minimising” objectives of such a restructuring, an expression which is relied on by KWL as demonstrating the way in which UBS presented the transaction to KWL. As Mr Kraus’s presentation itself was never forwarded to KWL, KWL cannot rely on the statements contained in the presentation itself as constituting representations made to it, but it does suggest that the statements in the presentation constituted evidence of what would have been represented to KWL at the 9 May 2006 meeting. I do not accept this. The author of the presentation, Mr Kraus, had not been at the 9 May meeting and at that time had not even been a member of the deal team. Although he must have been briefed by members of the deal team in order to write his presentation, there is no proper basis on which to conclude that his “risk minimising” language was what the UBS representatives had said at that meeting. I should also note that his presentation also referred to achieving a “present value” from the transaction of approximately US $20 to US $30 million. Thus, despite the Value Partners’ request that “numbers” should not be mentioned at the 9 May 2006 meeting, the approximate level of expected benefit (albeit described in terms of “present value” rather than upfront cash) was stated in this document which Mr Kraus expected to be provided to KWL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One element of the transaction costs consisted of UBS’s “collateral hedge costs”. These were costs in connection with the single name credit default swaps. On 16 May 2006 Mr Julian Cox of Value Partners asked for a breakdown of the costs which UBS proposed to charge, commenting that the figures so far provided “seem wildly excessive for the credits in question”. This innocent query (it was after all to be expected that an independent adviser would scrutinise and if appropriate challenge UBS’s figures where it could in order to negotiate the best possible deal for its client) provoked a strong reaction from Mr Cox’s colleagues at Value Partners and from Mr Bracy.

The fact with Julian is that he is sensitive that his ‘intellegence’ on pricing matters is not being respected (generally, not specifically to this deal), as he is the ‘numbers’ person in their shop. The fact is that they are not talking to anyone else about doing the deal. He got his information from a guy at csfb who does not have the full picture. I am not suggesting that Julian is to be ignored and that his points should not be addressed. However, that is Berthold's and Juergen's problem which they know and want to manage within their shop. Also, they are the ones who are talking to the client directly (not Julian) as he will not be joining them in NY next week as well. Frankly, they had no idea he was going to send the e-mail so it caught them of guard as well, as I mentioned earlier that we had a very productive conversation before Julian weighted in.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, it is equally apparent that Mr Cox (who appears not to have been part of the arrangement between Mr Bracy on the one hand and Messrs Senf and Blatz on the other) was sat upon by Mr Senf and Mr Blatz to make sure that he did not cause further trouble.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the confirmation that KWL and Value Partners were “not talking to anyone else about doing the deal” was extremely valuable information, as Mr Czekalowski’s and Mr Adam Johnson’s evidence made clear (see e.g. [130] above). It left UBS free to maximise its profit from the deal free of any competition from another bank. Although Mr Bracy and Mr Sanz-Paris tried to suggest that if KWL had been talking to other banks about this deal, they would not have thought it worthwhile to spend their valuable time working on it, and therefore (by implication) that it was in KWL’s interests to tell UBS this in order to demonstrate KWL’s commitment to the deal, I do not accept this. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, all this was clear to Mr Bracy and Mr Sanz-Paris.

If Mr Sanz-Paris was still in any doubt about this after the request to be compensated for promoting UBS GAM, this incident must have removed that doubt.</p>

On 16 May 2006 Mr Senf emailed both of these to Mr Bracy, combined in a single PDF document. He added the comment that the downgrading had nothing to do with KWL itself, but was due to its shareholder LVV, and that Mr Bracy should therefore “use the papers however you want”. Mr Bracy acted on this suggestion by causing the two ratings to be split into two separate documents and passing on only the out of date higher rating to Mr Sanz-Paris. This rating then featured reasonably prominently in the deal team’s application for approval of the deal.</p>

However, he could not think of anything that would have constituted such a good reason. Other UBS witnesses, in particular Mr Bawden, said that Mr Bracy would have been fired if what he had done had been known. Certainly he should have been. There is, however, no evidence that Mr Bracy revealed what he had done to anyone else at UBS and it seems unlikely that he would have been so foolish as to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Various documents were signed on 24 May 2006. First there was an Engagement Letter, signed by Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer on 24 May 2006 and by Mr Sanz-Paris and Mr Lancaster on about 30 May 2006. It was stated as confirming “our understanding concerning the proposed project to restructure current lease defeasance assets with a more efficient alternative (the ‘Product’), with the main objective to diversify KWL's credit exposure” and appointed UBS “as exclusive structurer and swap counterparty”. A number of conditions precedent to the closing of the transaction were set out, including at paragraph 3(ii) that:</p>

The publicly available commercial registry confirmed that the two managing directors were authorised to conduct business and sign documents on behalf of KWL. Thus, although the letter was in a sense self-authorising (Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer signed a letter confirming their own authority), it was supported by KWL’s entry on the commercial register.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because it was a large, complex and unusual transaction, the transaction was subject to an internal UBS approvals procedure known as “TRPA” (Transactions Requiring Prior Approval). This required sign off from all of UBS’s control functions, including Credit Risk Control and various others. As part of the TRPA process, the deal team prepared a TRPA submission document summarising the transaction, together with a suitability memo. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">While responsibility for coordinating the TRPA submission and suitability memo fell to Mr Lancaster, most of the drafting was done by others. A first draft of the TRPA submission was prepared by Mr Mehta and circulated to Mr Sanz-Paris, Mr Lancaster and Mr Kraus for completion and comments on 18 May 2006. It described the transaction as having been “developed jointly” between UBS and KWL’s advisers (i.e. Value Partners), a statement which was dropped from the final version of the TRPA, and identified Mr Bracy as one of those responsible for the marketing. Mr Bracy said that this was mistaken, that there was no marketing involved because the transaction was brought by Value Partners to UBS, and that his name had to be put on the document somewhere in order to ensure that his role in introducing Value Partners was recognised. I do not accept this. The draft was accurate in describing Mr Bracy as having played a marketing role. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is of some significance in view of what was to be said later (see [323] below) that the draft submission did not suggest that the transaction had been conceived or marketed by Value Partners or that it had been brought to UBS essentially as a finished concept in the way that Mr Bracy claimed in his evidence. Indeed, he was later to have no hesitation in claiming the credit for having originated the transaction, writing in a review of his past and future activities dated 14 December 2006:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This even goes so far as to claim that it was Mr Bracy who “utilised” Value Partners as his advisers to “bring [the transaction] into the firm” – a claim which, in my judgment, was substantially accurate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The suitability memo was drafted by Mr Kraus and Mr Mehta. It was produced in response to a request from Mr Linfoot of CRC pursuant to UBS’s Suitability Policy. This involved two elements: product suitability, which related to the type of client to which a given product type was relevant, and client suitability, which was concerned with whether the specific product was appropriate for the specific client. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before the final TRPA request was submitted on 30 May 2006, there were various exchanges between Mr Linfoot and the deal team. These included an explanation by the deal team that KWL required the transaction to be executed by 7 June 2006 “due to Board unavailability after that date”. This was probably intended to refer to the Executive or Management Board consisting of Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer, rather than to KWL’s Supervisory Board. Certainly, on 26 May 2006 Mr Sanz-Paris advised Mr Linfoot that there was Executive Board approval for the transaction.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A related question then arose whether KWL needed the approval of its shareholders in order to enter into the transaction. Mr Sanz-Paris was reluctant to raise this question, expressing the view that it was sufficient that there was board approval (by which he meant Executive Board approval, although he probably did not apply his mind to the distinction between the Executive and the Supervisory Boards) and that Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer would be signing the contracts. He also advised that UBS would be obtaining a copy of an opinion from Freshfields to the KWL board which would deal with the question of KWL’s capacity and authority and which was to be submitted to the KWL board. It is not clear on what basis Mr Sanz-Paris said this. In fact UBS never got a copy of the advice which Freshfields provided to KWL, although it did obtain a separate Freshfields opinion addressed to UBS itself, as to which see [331] to [368] below. Mr Linfoot was rightly concerned to understand what internal approvals for the transaction KWL was required to have.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One upshot of these exchanges was that a due diligence meeting was arranged for 30 May 2006, at which Mr Linfoot would seek to ensure that KWL understood properly the nature and risks of the transaction, that the transaction was suitable for KWL, and that whatever approvals were necessary had been or would be obtained. The meeting was to take place in London and to be attended by Mr Heininger. In advance of the meeting Mr Linfoot sent a list of the questions which he proposed to ask so that Mr Heininger knew what to expect. These included questions as to KWL’s rationale for entering into the transaction, its prior experience with credit derivatives, its internal approval requirements, and what advice it had received to “fully understand the risk/mitigants of CDO swaps”. Value Partners expressed surprise at the length of these questions.</p>

The e-mails which Mr Bracy sent at about this time were more concerned with the line which Mr Heininger should take in order to satisfy CRC than with the actual reason for the transaction. For example, Mr Bracy wrote on 29 May 2006 that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Mr Bracy knew that the primary purpose of the transaction for KWL was not risk diversification but the obtaining of an upfront premium. If this had not been the case, KWL would not have insisted on a premium of US $30 million at the expense of having to accept a lower credit rating. Similarly Mr Bracy had no basis to think that KWL had sought advice from the various professionals listed and (as he confirmed in evidence) had no knowledge of what approvals were necessary or had been obtained. These were simply things which he was telling Value Partners to make sure that Mr Heininger would say at the meeting.</p>

Mr Bracy therefore set out the approach which Mr Heininger should adopt at the meeting, whether or not these things were actually true. It was also important, and was emphasised as part of the line which Mr Heininger was to take, that KWL understood that there was some risk, however limited, that it could lose its entire investment.</p>

The pre-meeting duly took place on 30 May 2006, attended by Mr Bracy and Mr Sanz-Paris, by Mr Senf and Mr Blatz, and by Mr Heininger.

One query raised by Mr Linfoot was why KWL was keen to buy protection on the CDSs from UBS when UBS was actually rated lower than the single names for which KWL was buying protection. Mr Mehta commented, “they picked up on it … heheh”. It is apparent that the deal team viewed CRC as a nuisance which probably did not fully understand the transaction and which stood in the way of profitable business, with which it was not necessary to be completely truthful. That attitude became even more apparent after CRC refused to approve the transaction and the deal team escalated the position to senior management (see [300] below). At that time, in exchanges among members of the deal team, Mr Bracy referred to “killing the credit monster” and, while Mr Sanz-Paris did not go so far as to describe Ms Short as a witch, he did refer to escalation as “the silver bullet”. It is apparent, as Ms Short acknowledged, that the deal team viewed CRC as the enemy. Such an attitude ran obvious risks of storing up future trouble.</p>

It stated also that KWL’s major shareholder, LVV, was aware of the transaction, as a result of the fact that Dr Schirmer was a managing director of LVV as well as of KWL. The memo made clear that KWL intended to notify its Supervisory Board of the transaction at the board’s next regular meeting in September, and therefore reiterated that the Supervisory Board would not be asked to give its prior approval to the transaction.

Instead, and in essence, profitability was presented as a reason to go ahead regardless of those concerns, taking (as it were) whatever damage to UBS’s reputation might arise in the future on the chin in favour of booking a large immediate profit with the expectation of more to come. </p>

He accepted in evidence that his advocacy was based upon the facts that (as his emails to senior management urged) the deal was very profitable compared to other business which UBS might do and that UBS would lose out on other similar deals if this one did not proceed. Mr Rodgers said in evidence that all he meant was that UBS would lose the opportunity to bid for other deals in competition with others, but I do not accept this. It is obvious that he envisaged a flow of business directed from Value Partners to UBS. Mr Rodgers also argued in his emails to senior management that the risk to KWL of being required to pay out was very low and that this was “not a bad trade for KWL”. I accept that this was his view. There was, however, as he acknowledged, a significant element of advocacy in the arguments which he put forward and it seems to me, having heard extensive evidence as to the risks of the transaction to KWL, that Mr Rodgers’ arguments were flawed as well as being unduly coloured by his view that the transaction was (in his words) “overwhelmingly shareholder positive”. CRC, and in particular Mr Bawden and Ms Short, took a more cautious and realistic view that although the risks might be low, they were nevertheless real.</p>

This took place on the evening of 2 June 2006. The outcome of the meeting was that it was confirmed that UBS’s compliance and legal control functions approved the transaction, but CRC and another function, Market Risk Control, were not prepared to do so on the grounds of the credit and reputational risks to UBS. It was suggested that one way in which the credit risk concern could be dealt with was for UBS to deal directly with KWL for only part of the overall transaction, with the balance to be “intermediated” by another bank. This would limit the KWL credit risk to which UBS would be exposed, leaving the other bank to take the balance of this risk. Mr Bunce and Mr Ryan were very supportive of the transaction, but no final decision about it was reached.</p>

In a further conversation on the following day, Mr Senf advised that this meant that KWL would require a minimum return of US $20 million on the first leg of the transaction, and that Mr Heininger understood the position, although Dr Schirmer’s understanding was “not so much”. By this stage, therefore, the setback must have been explained to Mr Heininger.</p>

Mr Heininger did speak good English and had been much more involved in the transaction. It is apparent that Mr Bracy wished Dr Schirmer to be kept in the dark about some aspect of the transaction’s figures. Mr Kraus claimed not to remember this email, but ventured the suggestion that it referred to the fact that the final figures would not be known until the trades to make up the portfolio were executed after the closing, so that figures should not be mentioned which might later turn out to be wrong. I do not accept this. Mr Bracy said that this request came from Value Partners. It was similar to the instruction given much earlier not to talk about “absolute numbers” (see [225] above). It must have been obvious to Mr Bracy – and to Mr Kraus – that far from providing independent advice to KWL, Value Partners was keen to ensure so far as possible that one of the two managing directors of KWL who were to sign the contracts did not have a full understanding of the transaction (as in fact he did not). UBS assisted Value Partners to achieve this objective by passing on and complying with this instruction. It is true that Dr Schirmer could easily have found out about the premium, for example if he had taken more care to examine the documents which he signed, albeit that they were in a language which he did not understand, and that UBS and Value Partners must have realised this, but that does not detract from the intention that, if possible, he was to be kept in the dark.</p>

Mr Jenkins personally made the decision to accept the reputational risk. The deal was seen as just too profitable to turn away despite the risk involved. Ms Short, who was present, had no hesitation in accepting this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second condition, if the transaction was to close as intended on the same day, there was little or no time for anyone in Germany to become sufficiently familiar with it or with KWL to give an informed approval, and it was never explained by reference to what criteria any such approval should be given. In fact, although he had been forewarned and no doubt briefed earlier to some extent by telephone, Mr Prelle of UBS in Germany confirmed his support for the deal within only 35 minutes of being requested to do so. His approval was, therefore, an essentially meaningless formality. It would be surprising if the UBS senior management who imposed this condition ever expected it to be anything else.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third condition, that the KWL Supervisory Board should be informed of the transaction, was intended to ensure that the board could not claim later not to have known about it. However, it begged the question what would happen if, when told about it, the board disapproved of the transaction. It is no answer to say, as Mr Czekalowski did in his evidence, that the transaction could if necessary be unwound, albeit at a cost. First, depending on market movements in the meanwhile (as UBS knew, the Supervisory Board was not due to meet until September 2006), the cost might be prohibitive. Second, if the transaction was within the managing directors’ authority so that KWL was legally bound, why should UBS agree to unwind it, giving up a substantial profit to which (on this hypothesis) it was fully entitled as well as the management fees which UBS GAM could expect to earn? Assuming that the board did not object, the requirement of subsequent notification would have provided UBS with some protection against the reputational risk, but nothing more than that. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Pursuant to this third condition, on 8 June 2006 Mr Sanz-Paris sent a presentation, headed "Collateralised Debt Obligations - Presentation to KWL", <span style="color:#000000">to Mr Heininger for him to present at KWL's next </span>Supervisory Board <span style="color:#000000">meeting. This spelled out that assuming a recovery rate of 40%, there would need to be 5.8 defaults in the portfolio before KWL would begin to suffer losses on its tranche (i.e. losses would begin to occur upon the 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> default) and that after 8.3 defaults (i.e. upon the 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> default), KWL would have suffered the full loss of its notional and would be obliged to pay UBS £153 million. It is notable that although the presentation referred to KWL’s investment in the STCDO as being “to diversify the risk concentration and achieve an enhanced yield”, and although it had from the outset been made clear to UBS that at least one important objective of KWL was to achieve a substantial upfront cash premium, there was no mention in the presentation of the fact that the enhanced yield was to take the form of upfront cash, let alone of the amount of the premium. Consistently with Value Partners’ instruction to Mr Bracy which he in turn passed on to Mr Kraus (see [314] above), even the KWL Supervisory Board was not to be told about one of the most important features of the transaction.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth condition, that UBS should keep on file Value Partners’ marketing material to KWL, was intended, as Mr Bunce agreed in cross examination, to provide evidence on UBS’s files that Value Partners had the necessary expertise and had marketed the transaction properly to KWL. This posed a problem because, as the deal team knew, there was no such marketing material. Mr Czekalowski discussed this with Value Partners and then proposed to Mr Ryan that in order to fulfil this condition a letter should be obtained from Value Partners stating that it had “conceived and marketed the structure to KWL”, that it “had a mandate from KWL prior to approaching UBS for execution” <span style="color:#000000">and that it had “explained to named senior management of KWL the risks of and the structure of the Transaction and that KWL understood and has accepted the structure and any and all associated risks”.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first two of these statements were not correct and, although he would not accept it, Mr Czekalowski knew this. Value Partners had not conceived or marketed the transaction and did not simply approach UBS to execute an already developed transaction for which it already had a mandate from KWL. The transaction had been conceived in its general outline by Mr Bracy (who was credited with responsibility for marketing in UBS’s own TRPA documents: see [278] above) in his initial discussions with Value Partners. This outline had then been proposed to Mr Heininger who had responded enthusiastically to the idea of a transaction which could generate US $30 million in cash. It had then been marketed to KWL by UBS, for example at the 9 May 2006 meeting, and in the course of this marketing, the transaction had been developed to meet KWL’s requirements (for example, to accept a lower A, instead of AA, rating in order to maintain a total premium of the order of US $30 million).</p>

Mr Bawden was asked repeatedly in cross examination whether in his 23 years at UBS there was any other transaction with a value of over US $100 million where there had been a decision to proceed even though he had not been persuaded of the transaction’s suitability and went so far as recording that he had not approved such suitability. Although he was obviously uncomfortable with the question, he was unable to identify any other occasion when this had happened. Nor did anyone else.</p>

The background to this request was that it was well known that questions could arise regarding the capacity of municipal or municipal-owned bodies to enter into derivative contracts, and it was recognised that if such transactions went wrong and the municipal entity was called upon to pay, it might well defend a claim on the ground of lack of capacity to enter into such contracts or lack of authority on the part of the individuals who signed the relevant contracts. It was therefore vitally important to ensure that a municipal counterparty had capacity, that the individuals who were to sign had authority to do so, and that all necessary formalities for the validity of the transaction had been properly complied with.</p>

That appears to be precisely what Freshfields had wrestled with in the draft opinion prepared for KWL the previous day which had concluded that the issue was “open to question”. Moreover, whatever precisely it was that Freshfields were saying in paragraph (c) that they had not verified (“whether the transactions … have been authorized in accordance with the Articles of Association”), they were making a positive statement in paragraph (b) that “the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents by KWL, and the performance of its obligations thereunder, do not violate … the Articles of Association of KWL”. </p>

Frankly, as a lawyer [I interpose that Mr Bracy was qualified as a lawyer in the United States and had previously worked in a well known US law firm], I’m not clear if they have ‘standing’ to question motivation.” This was an extraordinary intervention, to which Mr Lancaster responded that the “key issue” was that this question “impacts that the client can actually do this trade”.

However, it is not surprising that Freshfields would not give an unqualified statement that the STCDO would be enforceable come what may. There was always the possibility that there might be some vitiating factor of which Freshfields were not and could not be aware – some misrepresentation by UBS is an obvious example – and I doubt whether any law firm would have been willing in effect to guarantee the enforceability of the STCDO regardless of such possibilities.</p>

The first is whether the transaction was “of fundamental significance” to KWL. If so, under KWL’s Articles of Association the prior approval of the Supervisory Board was required. If not, the managing directors had authority without needing such approval. The second matter is whether, assuming that prior Supervisory Board approval was required under the Articles, this was so obvious to UBS that it could not have failed to realise this.

Unless those statements were heavily qualified elsewhere in the opinion, or were falsified by the surrounding circumstances, in ways which ought to have brought home to UBS that Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer did not have authority to bind KWL to this transaction, UBS can hardly have been grossly negligent if it relied on what Freshfields told it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As already indicated, the contracts were signed on 7 June 2006 after senior management approval had finally been obtained. The parties celebrated with dinner at a restaurant. The Balaba transaction then traded on 8 June 2006 with UBS conducting an auction of the CDS hedges for the portfolio. The auction was successful, with the result that KWL received a net premium of US $21.1 million (higher than the US $20 million for which KWL had stipulated) and tranche subordination of 3.6% which was also slightly better than had been anticipated. The premium was paid into KWL’s account at Wilmington Trust in the United States from which (unknown to UBS) it was subsequently extracted and distributed among Mr Heininger, Mr Senf and Mr Blatz.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the contract documentation, including the figures which resulted from the auction, was eventually dated 8 June 2006.  The gross STCDO premium figure of US $22.7 million was included in the contract and was therefore available for Dr Schirmer to see, but it appears that he did not see it and continued under the mistaken impression that there was no immediate upfront cash premium. </p>

That issue needs to be seen in the context that in the warm glow of a transaction which had made a profit of some US $20 million for UBS, Mr Bracy was encouraged by the most senior management of the bank to develop the relationship with Value Partners and was given a free hand to do so with no real supervision of his activities.</p>

This recorded that “KWL's main objective in doing this transaction is to diversify the risk of its underlying crossborder lease portefeuille”.

By the time this letter was signed it was already known (to Mr Heininger and Value Partners although not to Dr Schirmer) that the transaction would not generate “an interest rate advantage over the term of the transaction” but an upfront premium, the net amount of which for the Balaba transaction alone was US $21.1 million. Therefore this letter on its face not only substantially increased the fee to which Value Partners was entitled on that transaction as well as entitling it to the entirety of any premium earned on the remaining legs, leaving only a small fraction of the total for KWL, but did so in a misleading way. The letter was also misleading in stating that KWL’s main objective had been risk diversification when Dr Schirmer’s evidence was that it was to raise finance. I find that Dr Schirmer signed the letter because he was prepared to do what Mr Heininger asked him to do, without asking questions even though it was in a language which he did not understand, and in all probability without attempting to understand what he was signing.</p>

It was Mr Bracy on behalf of UBS who was to have charge of that relationship. (Later, when Mr Ryan met Value Partners in September 2006, he described Mr Bracy as “your point guy at UBS”).

On this occasion, however, Mr Bracy was concerned because the Zurich client with whom Value Partners had influence (someone called “Beat”) might not be the person with authority to decide where the business should go:</p>

During June and July 2006 UBS approached a large number of German banks. Its general approach was to tell the prospective intermediary that it would bear no market risk, only credit and reputational risk, and that the CDO tranche risk would be transferred back to UBS. It proved difficult, however, to arouse much interest. By the end of August there were only two banks interested. One was Dresdner Bank, which dropped out shortly afterwards on 4 September. The other was LBBW, which at that stage was only interested in intermediating the GECC transaction.</p>

Mr Bracy was not involved in any of the discussions with LBBW, although he remained the link between the UBS deal team in London and Value Partners and was active in impressing on the deal team KWL’s desire to have matters concluded before its Supervisory Board meeting on 7 September.</p>

Mrs Schmidt said that it was unusual for a municipal water company to be selling credit protection and asked if UBS had a legal opinion as to the enforceability of the transaction. Mr Kraus replied that UBS had a capacity opinion from Freshfields and another from Allen &amp; Overy. He said that he would check whether these could be provided to LBBW, but did not go so far as to promise that they would be. He explained some of the background to the transaction, saying that KWL had entered into it “from a risk consideration point of view, but also and maybe also a little bit more from a return consideration point of view”. He explained also that if KWL had approached UBS to sell protection solely to generate premium, that would have been blocked by UBS’s internal control functions, but the element of hedging a single name risk had made a difference and also enabled the lawyers to justify the deal from a capacity and suitability point of view.</p>

This explanation was that in order to minimise the existing concentration risk on KWL’s single name bonds, UBS had sold CDS protection to KWL, and KWL in return would sell protection on three CDO tranches managed by UBS with a portfolio of entities rated AA-; UBS had completed one such transaction with KWL and now had no credit lines left for KWL, which was why it was now looking for an intermediary for the remaining tranches.

However, in a telephone conversation between Mr Sanz-Paris and Mrs Schmidt on 9 August, Mr Sanz-Paris indicated that UBS could probably increase this fee to 1.5 million (although he appears to have meant US dollars and Mrs Schmidt thought he meant euros) just for the GECC transaction.

Mr Weishaupt’s focus here was on the nature of the transaction rather than the separate question as to the authority of particular individuals to commit the enterprise to the transaction in question. From an early stage of the negotiations with UBS, LBBW was alive to the fact that capacity needed to be checked. It was to become a question in those negotiations whether the risk as between UBS and LBBW that KWL might not have capacity (in other words, whether LBBW would be liable to pay UBS under the Back Swap even if KWL did not have capacity to conclude the Front Swap) was a risk to be borne by LBBW or UBS.</p>

There was, however, no express agreement as to any legal consequence which would flow from the fact that this next step would be taken.

Mr Weishaupt wanted the opinion to be addressed to LBBW as he at any rate now understood that the risk of the STCDO being invalid or unenforceable might be a risk which LBBW was taking. He wanted to ensure that Freshfields would be answerable to LBBW for their opinion and he was not prepared to go ahead with the transaction until he had an opinion which he regarded as satisfactory.

In fact, Mr Christoph Zengerling, an LBBW structurer, had given the file the codename of “Feuerwasser”, with the comment “after all, the water works are playing with fire here...” LBBW’s credit request recognised also a risk that in the event of a “default” by KWL, it would be liable to make payments to UBS. However, it considered the risk of default by KWL to be acceptably low. It did not address here what the position would be if KWL did not pay in circumstances where there was no “default” because KWL was under no liability to pay. Nor, for that matter, did it spell out that there could only be a “default” if there was an obligation to pay in the first place. Credit approval was given on 31 August 2006.</p>

LBBW appears to have been under the impression, at least at one stage, that the deadline existed because there was an existing KWL board approval which would expire if the deal was not concluded by then, so that KWL would have to begin its internal approval process all over again. However, it is not clear on what this understanding was based. It was not correct. I am unable to find that this was information given to LBBW by UBS, although Mr Sanz-Paris had said back on 15 August that KWL wanted to conclude the deal before its Supervisory Board meeting on 7 September and it may have been a misunderstanding of something which he or someone else had said. </p>

However, this could not be reconciled with KWL’s premium requirements (namely that it should receive a premium of about US $8 million although, as explained at [392] above, this was in fact entirely for the benefit of Value Partners, as Mr Heininger knew: in fact the net premium from the LBBW transaction was €6.4 million). The solution adopted was to extend the term of the STCDO from eight to ten years, which would enable a higher premium to be achieved (reflecting the fact that exposure to the tranche would exist for a longer period). In exchange for this LBBW was able to negotiate an increase of €500,000 in its fee, which was eventually fixed at €2 million for the GECC transaction alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another point which was important for LBBW was to have direct contact with KWL as part of its due diligence process. This took place in a telephone conversation on 6 September 2006 between Mr Northway, Mrs Schmidt and Mr Heininger. In the call, summarised in an email of the same day, Mr Northway discussed with Mr Heininger a number of risks, including the facts that KWL would bear the default risk of the entities in the portfolio and might lose the full amount of the notional, that there was a thin tranche structure with an attachment point of 3.6%, that the initial subordination might be reduced with no chance to rebuild, that ratings were a matter of opinion and that ratings of synthetic products were particularly volatile, and that it was for KWL to satisfy itself about any conflict of interest which might exist within UBS. I see no reason to doubt that Mr Heininger understood these points. LBBW followed this call with the email summary referred to above to which was attached a presentation which had been prepared by UBS (a version of what UBS had sent KWL in respect of the Balaba deal, but adapted for the LBBW deal) and a risk disclosure letter for KWL to sign which referred (among other things) to KWL’s acceptance of “the speculative nature of the Transaction”. Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer signed this and returned it to KWL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Yet another point which LBBW wanted to check arose out of the fact that whereas the Back Swap with UBS was to be subject to an ISDA Master Agreement, the Front Swap with KWL was to be subject to a German Master Agreement (a <span style="font-style:italic">Rahamenvertrag</span>). There was therefore the possibility that the two swaps might not be fully back to back, with different calculations needing to be made under each of them.

UBS relies on it as showing that although they were intended to be aligned as far as possible, the Front and Back Swaps were nevertheless understood to be two independent transactions and that, far from LBBW’s liability to UBS being dependent on KWL’s liability to LBBW (let alone actual payment by KWL), it was recognised that the sums payable under the two contracts might be different.</p>

However, instead of using the slides which Mr Sanz-Paris had sent him on 8 June 2006, which he had promised to use (see [322] above), and which UBS had subsequently translated into German for KWL’s benefit, Mr Heininger used a presentation of his own devising. After a brief summary of the existing cross-border lease arrangements, it contained little more than a definition of “credit derivative” taken from Wikipedia stating that such a derivative “practically operates like insurance cover”, and a list of eight “advantages” of such a transaction.

Indeed the presentation did not even spell out that KWL had by now concluded two such transactions, with UBS and with LBBW. It ought to have been apparent from advantage number 8 that the presentation was referring to a concluded (as distinct from potential future) transaction, but it appears that the Finance Committee and Supervisory Board members failed to appreciate this. Although Dr Schirmer, who was present, had not grasped that an upfront premium had been paid, and therefore did not realise that the reference to interest payments over time was misleading, he was content to allow Mr Heininger to mislead the committee and board members in other respects and did not intervene to clarify anything which Mr Heininger said (see [93] above). </p>

Because my reading of the articles was that local newspapers had picked up potential expenses, one of which involved a trip to New York, albeit on Concorde, to close a transaction, as it turned out. Another involved, you know, a conference room meeting in Dubai. These are normal practice in the capital markets. Now, a person who is not involved in capital markets might read those as very unusual: why would you be taking Concorde, why would you go to Dubai for a weekend? But every bank in the world entertains clients. Many people have to travel to New York at short notice to close transactions with particular deadlines. So your reading of that is -- my reading of it might be a little bit different to the way you are summarising.</p>

The accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers were instructed to examine Mr Heininger’s and Dr Schirmer’s business trips. Although Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer knew very well that the investigation was concerned with trips involving the predecessors of Value Partners, when they spoke to PwC they said nothing about the very substantial sums which Value Partners would earn as a result of the transactions with UBS and LBBW which had been the subject of very recent trips to London and New York with Value Partners.</p>

This was a lie and was shortly to be exposed as such, when Mr Heininger had to admit that there had been no such investors present. The Supervisory Board agreed that the investigation should continue. </p>

It is not possible on the evidence to reach a firm conclusion as to why some board members were so willing to support Mr Heininger when other individuals had been suspended in the past when similar allegations had been made. It may have been because, under his leadership, KWL was achieving considerable financial success. Its 2006 accounts prepared in March 2007 described the 2006 financial year as the most successful year in KWL's corporate history, with an annual result before profit transfers exceeding both the previous year's results and forecasts. Or it may have had to do, as hinted at in some of the press comment, with political rivalry between different parties represented on the KWL Supervisory Board. These matters were not, however, explored in evidence, no doubt because of the limitations of KWL’s disclosure. Be that as it may, it was not suggested to Dr Schirmbeck when he gave evidence that he was in any way personally corrupt or complicit in the corruption emanating from Mr Senf and Mr Blatz.</p>

A careful reading of the PwC report on Dr Schirmer would have revealed that he had visited London for contract negotiations with UBS in May 2006 and for the closing of an agreement in June, described as a “financial investment”, and that the trip had been arranged by an employee of Value Partners, a company which had been formed by employees of Global Capital Finance. (Oddly there was no mention of this in the equivalent report on Mr Heininger). This ought to have rung alarm bells with the Supervisory Board, bearing in mind the concern about Global Capital Finance, but it did not. It is fair to say, however, that rather surprisingly PwC (who knew why they were being asked to carry out their investigation) did not draw particular attention to the fact that a new “financial investment” contract had been concluded in which employees of Global Capital Finance were involved.</p>

In brief, it decided that travelling first class and by Concorde was not appropriate for KWL management, that no gifts had been accepted, and that the statements about the trip to Dubai made by Mr Heininger should be accepted. These statements included that the invitation had come from the “arranger” of the cross-border leases (i.e. Global Capital Finance) which was contrary to his initial explanation, that “no further contractual relationships between the parties (investor, arranger, LVB)” had taken place, and that “no further such trips on invitations of the business partners had taken place”. This was deliberately misleading in view of the continuing relationship with Value Partners, the concluded Balaba and LBBW transactions in which Value Partners had been involved, the fact that Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer had intended to go on the safari referred to below, and that it appears that trips with Mr Senf and Mr Blatz were sufficiently common for Mr Heininger to have described it as a trip “with a couple of friends (the usual ones)” (see [94] above). Dr Schirmer knew that what Mr Heininger was saying about the absence of further contractual relationships involving Value Partners was misleading but took no steps to correct him.   </p>

But he and Dr Schirmer kept their jobs. This was not the end of the matter, as the Saxony anti corruption unit decided to open an investigation into KWL’s cross-border leases, but it did bring to an end for the time being the intense press speculation surrounding KWL and the position of Mr Heininger. </p>

However, Mr Bracy did not give up hope of finding a way to help his friends in their hour of need.

This “concept” was a letter from Mr Bracy’s multi-talented lawyer friend Richard Isgard (see [208] above) to confirm Mr Heininger’s attendance at a conference in Dubai, and thus to provide a business justification for the trip. It appears that no such letter from Mr Isgard was ever forthcoming, although Value Partners did subsequently obtain a letter dated 2 November 2006 from a different lawyer, David Lieberman of the well known firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP in New York, confirming that various meetings were held in their office on dates in November and December 2002. I should make clear that there is no reason to think that the contents of this letter were untrue or that Mr Lieberman (who is a partner in the firm) was aware of the purpose for which it was required.

Their confidence was well founded. The facts that Mr Bracy responded as he did, apparently without surprise or qualms of conscience, and that he was the one who suggested that those he had approached to provide false evidence might need an incentive to co-operate, strongly suggests that so far as he was concerned, and even though he was not aware of the bribe paid to Mr Heininger, the dishonesty of Mr Senf and Mr Blatz was not news.

I find that incredible, in circumstances where Mr Bracy had accepted that Mr Senf and Mr Blatz’s requests for the “letter for K” had been frequent and urgent and the situation was still unresolved. It is impossible to reconcile with the earlier suggestion that the absence of Mr Czekalowski would enable Mr Bracy and Value Partners to “talk more freely” (see [462] above). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Sanz-Paris too had no recollection, so he said, of business being discussed much on the trip. He accepted that by this time he had known of the allegations against Mr Heininger (indeed it is apparent from an email he sent on 19 October 2006 telling others in UBS that the allegations were “irrelevant” that he had discussed them with Mr Senf), but sought to give the impression that when the group returned to their hotel after each day’s activities, he would escape to his room as quickly as he could. I do not accept that evidence. If Mr Sanz-Paris did not ask about the current status of the allegations against Mr Heininger, allegations about inappropriate hospitality paid for by the very people who were paying for the luxury safari which he was currently enjoying, that can only be because he knew that this was a sensitive subject and positively did not want to know. Otherwise the last minute absence of Mr Heininger from the trip and the potential impact of the allegations on the final KWL transactions which remained to be concluded would have been obvious talking points. Indeed LBBW had just told UBS that because of these allegations it was losing interest in participating in a further transaction (see [479] below).</p>

Mr Senf and Mr Blatz knew Mr Bracy well, but they did not know Mr Sanz-Paris anything like so well. I think it unlikely that they would knowingly have exposed their dishonesty to him quite so blatantly. Mr Bracy too would have been taking a major and unnecessary risk by telling Mr Sanz-Paris about this incident and I am unable to find that he did so. Thus I conclude that Mr Sanz-Paris did not know about the “letter for K” episode. He did, however, know enough to realise that there was something seriously wrong about Mr Senf and Mr Blatz (see [82] above).</p>

This was misleading. Contrary to the suggestion in the fourth bullet point, achievement of a substantial net premium had always been fundamental to the transaction, not a lucky side product arising from favourable market conditions. Moreover, the overview did not say that in the case of one of the two completed transactions the net premium had been US $21.1 million and in the case of the other it had been €6.4 million. It is impossible to conclude that the omission of these figures was other than deliberate.  </p>

Certainly the document was too specific to KWL to have been required as some kind of general marketing tool for Value Partners, as was suggested on behalf of UBS. Other documents from this time suggest that KWL’s auditors were about to begin their usual audit process and it may be that it was required as a summary which could be provided to them. Mr Sanz-Paris may not have known the precise purpose for which the document was required, but he must have been instructed (and must in turn have instructed Mr Mehta) that the net premium figures should not be included. UBS would otherwise have had every reason to take credit with KWL for having met its requirement for upfront cash so handsomely. Mr Sanz-Paris knew, therefore, that the overview document was intended to give somebody, either within or connected to KWL, a misleading impression. That remains the case even if the person intended to be misled had other means of finding out the truth, for example by calling for the transaction documents.</p>

Mr Lord told me on instructions that in the event the document was sent to Value Partners but in the end was not passed on to KWL. It is therefore something of a mystery, but it remains a document which Value Partners wanted and which Mr Sanz-Paris was willing to provide, knowing it to be a very misleading summary of the transaction.</p>

For that purpose LBBW’s Leipzig branch held a due diligence meeting with Mr Heininger on 2 October 2006, for part of which Mr Sanz-Paris was present. In what Mr Sanz-Paris described as “a true grilling”, LBBW asked Mr Heininger whether he understood the impact of potential defaults and the risk that KWL might suffer significant losses, to which Mr Heininger responded that he did.</p>

There were different views about this within LBBW. Some people were very concerned about being associated with the negative publicity, while others discounted it on the basis that the Leipzig press was very aggressive and there was probably no substance in the allegations. In the end the former view prevailed, although it is also fair to say that market movements meant that a further transaction in the latter part of 2006 would have been less profitable anyway, so that the fee available to LBBW on an AAA rated STCDO would have been minimal. On 25 October 2006 LBBW told UBS that a further transaction could cause it problems internally due to the “noise around KWL … with respect to the management of the company.” It finally pulled out of any further transaction on 7 January 2007.</p>

Depfa was first introduced as a potential intermediary at the end of November 2006. The approach to Depfa was made via Tarek Selim, who worked in UBS’s Structured Product Sales department in Germany. He remained the primary point of contact with Depfa during the negotiations, with most communications from UBS being routed through him, although his role was limited to the passing on of messages. Mr Selim’s main contact at Depfa was Ravi Gidoomal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As with LBBW, UBS presented the transaction to Depfa as an “intermediation trade” in which the “CDO tranche risk is transferred back to UBS via a single back to back swap”, with UBS being appointed as “Calculation Agent” under both the Front and Back Swaps (cf. [409] above). Also as had happened with LBBW, almost all the negotiations took place between UBS and Depfa, with very little involvement of KWL. On 5 December 2006, Mr Selim sent Mr Gidoomal a set of draft transaction documents prepared by Mr Lancaster, and an initial conference call to discuss the trade was arranged for the following day. Later on 6 December 2006 Mr Gidoomal sent an email to his superior setting out a brief explanation of the proposed transaction, noting that “UBS have no more credit line available to KWL so looking for a counterparty to intermediate trade” via a back-to-back swap, with Depfa being paid “$1-1.5m upfront as an intermediation fee”. His email reported also that “KWL have board approval for trade so keen to execute in Q1”. These statements must represent what he had been told by UBS as the reason why UBS wanted to involve Depfa in the transaction. It was of course not correct that the KWL board had approved the trade, at any rate if that was a reference to the Supervisory Board.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Depfa was keen to expand into this kind of transaction with public sector entities and was therefore interested in this opportunity.

That might suggest that Depfa saw itself as taking the risk that KWL did not have such capacity. On the other hand, Depfa stated also that it was not “taking outright CDO risk in this trade”, a statement which UBS never corrected and which would be wrong if it turned out that KWL did not have capacity to enter into the STCDO: in that event, Depfa would be taking the “CDO risk” as it would be liable to UBS in the event of sufficient defaults to reach the attachment point of the tranche. </p>

Mr Lancaster (who was at this point under the impression that such approval existed) suggested that he should speak directly to Freshfields, adding that if Depfa’s legal department was not happy with the transaction, this was something which UBS needed to know.

On 5 March 2007 they told Mr Wiehler that both “the client” (a reference to KWL) and they themselves did not want to change an opinion which had been accepted twice in the past – that is to say, by both UBS and LBBW.

However, there is an issue as to what Dr Reichert-Facilides meant in his email by saying that a Supervisory Board resolution was “not an issue for the LO but a question of Depfa's business policy” (and therefore what he had said to Mr Wiehler about this). KWL’s case is that what Dr Reichert-Facilides said was that the question whether Supervisory Board approval was required would not be dealt with in the legal opinion and that Depfa would have to make a commercial judgment about this. Superficially, that is one possible interpretation of the brief wording of Dr Reichert-Facilides’ note, but it does not make sense. The question whether Supervisory Board approval was required was plainly a legal, not a commercial, question. It is hard to see how Dr Reichert-Facilides could have told Depfa that it would have to make a commercial judgment about what was obviously a legal question. If Dr Reichert-Facilides had told Mr Wiehler that Freshfields were not prepared to opine on this question and that Depfa would have to make a commercial judgment whether to go ahead with the transaction with no comfort from Freshfields on a basic question which might mean that the whole transaction was invalid, Mr Wiehler would undoubtedly have reported that and sought guidance from his superiors in Depfa, for example by bringing the point to the attention of the credit committee. But he did not. In fact he appears not to have followed up on this conversation within Depfa at all, whatever it was that he had agreed to discuss internally.</p>

However, I accept this as the most probable interpretation of </span>Dr Reichert-Facilides’ note in the circumstances, and therefore of what was said in the telephone conversation.

He only realised this much later, in December 2008, when he needed to provide the opinion to Depfa’s auditors. At that point Freshfields did provide a signed opinion, addressed to Depfa, in the terms which had been agreed. They agreed also to backdate the opinion to 28 March 2007 in order to save Mr Wiehler from the embarrassment of having to admit his mistake, although it is fair to say that the opinion did contain the terms which had been agreed as at that date. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Meanwhile, in November 2006, Value Partners indicated that it was arranging meetings with potential clients in Argentina and asked if Mr Sanz-Paris could attend. In fact the trip went ahead in December 2006 with Mr Czekalowski. In the course of this trip, Value Partners and UBS identified an opportunity for an asset management deal involving Argentinian farmland. In addition, UBS was discussing various other possible transactions with Value Partners during the period the Depfa transactions were being negotiated (albeit none of them came to fruition). These discussions did not involve Mr Bracy. Despite their protestations of loyalty and friendship towards him, Messrs Senf and Blatz were quite happy to drop him when he was no longer useful to them, while Mr Czekalowski was also keen to cut him out of any share in the remuneration for future deals. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">UBS agreed that it would compensate Value Partners directly for its role in sourcing the Argentine farmland transaction. A draft Introducing Agreement was therefore drawn up under which Value Partners would act as an adviser to UBS for the purpose of introducing contacts and business opportunities and would be rewarded with a monthly payment and additional amounts to be agreed on the closing of any transactions resulting from such introductions. As initially drafted, the Introducing Agreement recited that UBS AG and Value Partners had: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the reference to “restructuring lease defeasance assets” was later deleted because of the risk of a conflict of interest in relation to existing clients. The final version, dated 5 March 2007 (though possibly not signed until later) applied to farmland and real estate management transactions, together with other transactions as might be agreed. In the event, however, apart from the Argentine farmland transaction itself, UBS did no further business with or through Value Partners.  Both parties rely to some extent on this Introducing Agreement. UBS emphasises the respects in which this agreement was different from what had happened in relation to KWL, the fact that references to lease restructuring had been removed, and the fact that it came later in time, before the Depfa transactions were concluded but after the structure of the KWL deals had been fixed. KWL points out that despite the removal of the express wording (which it regards as merely cosmetic) the agreement was capable of being applied to lease restructurings and that it represented something similar to the arrangement for Value Partners to be paid a fee for introducing clients which had been rejected as involving an appearance of impropriety as long ago as April 2006. However, the terms of the Introducing Agreement were never applied to any of the KWL transactions and in the event I have been able to make findings as to the nature of the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners which did apply at the time of the KWL transactions. That being so, the Introducing Agreement has, in my view, very limited relevance to the issues in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">UBS GAM’s management of the portfolios leading up to and following the global financial crisis is addressed below. As is well known, there was a downturn in the US housing market from about mid 2006 which got steadily worse, exposing lenders in the “subprime” market to the risk of losses. By about mid 2007 a global liquidity crisis (the “credit crunch”) was beginning to take hold. Eventually the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 precipitated an unprecedented upheaval in the global financial markets. Less than a fortnight later, on 26 September 2008, Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy. Between 7 and 9 October 2008 the Icelandic government nationalised large parts of the national banking sector. This turmoil in the markets led directly to the first Credit Events in the Reference Portfolios. The risk that further defaults would reach the attachment point of the KWL tranches was apparent. The STCDOs were, as one UBS CRC man put it to Mr Linfoot in October 2008, “looking like one sick puppy”.</p>

The conditions included, among other things, a further opinion from Freshfields and a copy of KWL’s Supervisory Board approval for the restructuring. However, although it was discussed from time to time during 2009, this proposed restructuring did not proceed. This remained the position in early 2010 when Mr Heininger was finally arrested. </p>

The Supervisory Board had employee and political appointments, most of them with no business experience. It could not tell employees what to do or compel the management to act in a particular way. It could not stop the managing directors doing something within their power under the Articles. Subject to the limits imposed by KWL’s Articles, the managing directors had full power to run the company, including entering into contracts. Contracts would only be taken to the Supervisory Board if they required specific authorisation. That was very rare. Mr Müller could not recall any contracts being submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval during his membership of it.

Even if the counterparty is aware of the possibility that Supervisory Board approval may be required and fails to investigate, that will not of itself amount to gross negligence. It will only do so if there exist massive or solid objective facts which cry out for investigation. Mere ambiguity or doubt about the managing director’s authority or a risk that he does not have authority will not satisfy the test of evident abuse. The test is satisfied only where the abuse is obvious.</p>

However, that “I’ve started so I have to finish” approach does not in my judgment fairly reflect the experts’ evidence viewed as a whole. That evidence is rather to the effect that there is no duty to make inquiries about internal restrictions on the authority of the managing directors in the absence of massive or solid objective facts which cry out for investigation. If that is the position, the extent of any inquiries which are then required to be made must depend on all the circumstances of the case, including whatever information is then obtained, which may have the effect of assuaging the counterparty’s initial suspicions so as to render further inquiry unnecessary. </p>

[LBBW] neither had any positive knowledge of an abuse of the power of representation, nor must it have imposed itself [on LBBW] that the representative was using his power of representation in an obviously suspicious manner … As described above, the abuse of the power of representation is obvious only in circumstances of massive/solid suspicious objective facts, as opposed to merely suspicious objective facts … Matters can be deemed objectively obvious only when, according to the circumstances given, an inquiry with the principal being represented imposed itself on the contracting party … In this regard, an objective breach of duty is necessary, which is clearly and obviously recognisable to everyone ... A merely negligent lack of knowledge is not sufficient, as the legal regulation of Section 37 par. 2 of the German law on limited liability companies … does not have the purpose of requiring business counterparties to regularly check the power of representation of the Managing Directors …, and intends instead to protect the trust in sufficient authority of representation being given. For a breach of fiduciary duty to be clearly obvious in this sense, it is thus not sufficient if, from the vantage of the third party, the violation of internal obligations potentially is an obvious conclusion ... Likewise, the mere knowledge that the Articles of Association contain a reservation as to approval is not sufficient for determining that this was clearly obvious. On the contrary, [any such determination] must be based on specific circumstances ... The – disputed – assertion by [KWL] that [LBBW], or respectively BW-Bank, who had prepared the credit application for [LBBW] had access to [KWL’s] Articles of Association is thus already without relevance. The Articles of Association do not contain any express requirement to the effect that the conclusion of the CDS/CDO transactions requires the approval of the supervisory boards.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the meaning of “fundamental” (or, strictly, the German word “<span style="font-style:italic">grundsätzlich</span>” of which “fundamental” is a translation), it is not suggested that this is a term of art under German law. It is therefore to be given its ordinary meaning. It is not sufficient, therefore, that the transaction is merely “significant” for KWL. Rather, at least if paragraph 2 of Section 8 of the articles had stood alone, it would be expected that in order to qualify as being “of fundamental significance”, a transaction would have to be something going to the essence or even the existence of KWL. However, the term must be considered in its context, and I would accept that the concept of “fundamental significance” derives some colour from the relatively low values specified in the Supervisory Board’s Rules of Procedure for other categories of transactions where approval is required. (These Rules are not publicly available, so that an outsider would not know what value thresholds had been determined). The specific example of a dispute with a shareholder does not include any value threshold, but does represent (particularly bearing in mind KWL’s position as a quasi public body) a matter of some constitutional significance within KWL. Overall, it is clear that the scope of the managing directors’ authority is such that only transactions of very considerable importance to KWL require prior approval of the Supervisory Board.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Applying this test, I conclude that the transactions were “of fundamental significance” within the meaning of KWL’s Articles because of the sheer scale of the exposures which KWL was undertaking and the potential consequences for KWL if even the relatively low risk of a total loss of its notional were to materialise. The total notional value at stake over all four transactions was equivalent to over US $400 million dollars, of which about half was attributable to the Balaba transaction. This can be compared with KWL’s total annual sales of €145 million during the most recent financial year and its high capital expenditure requirements (between 30% and 50% of its sales revenue) in order to upgrade its facilities and comply with applicable water quality standards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is evident from these figures that the total loss of its notional investment would be disastrous, and might possibly be fatal, for KWL, at any rate without significant additional support from its shareholders. It is clear also that, notwithstanding the cross-border leases which it had previously concluded, the transaction was not part of the ordinary course of KWL’s water supply business and was beyond the scope of any in-house expertise on which KWL could draw. It would be surprising, in such circumstances, if an unusual transaction which could have such serious consequences for KWL were not to be regarded as being of fundamental significance within the meaning of the Articles even if, as I have accepted, in absolute terms the risk that these consequences would occur remained relatively low (see [159] above). The position might have been different if the effect of the Balaba transaction had been to reduce KWL’s overall risk, but I have found that its effect was to increase the risks to which KWL was exposed.  Whether to accept those risks was a matter of commercial judgment, but in a case of such significance KWL’s constitution entrusted the judgment to the Supervisory Board as well as the managing directors. It could only be authorised if the managing directors wanted to proceed and the Supervisory Board agreed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">KWL relies also on the fact that Supervisory Board approval had been obtained (and therefore, it says, must have been needed) for the original cross-border leases, and that in 2009 when consideration was being given to unwinding two of the single name CDSs in order to purchase additional subordination, UBS had insisted on Supervisory Board approval being obtained (see [522] above). However, I would not rest my decision on these matters. Neither situation is directly comparable. Approval for the original leasing transactions was required in any event pursuant to other provisions of the Articles of Association and did not depend on whether those transactions were “of fundamental significance”, although I would be inclined to accept that they were. The fact that approval was sought and obtained can therefore shed no real light on what was regarded as falling within the “fundamental significance” paragraph, even assuming this to be a legitimate process of construction of the Articles. In 2009 the effect of what was proposed would have been to eliminate the single name protection afforded by the CDSs and thus to leave KWL doubly exposed to losses (a) in the event of default by the single names and also (b) if the additional subordination purchased proved insufficient to stave off losses under the STCDOs. In any event 2009 was after the crash when banks and others were viewing such transactions in a very different way from how they had been viewing them beforehand and the circumstances of the proposed transaction were very different from those of 2006.</p>

In any event, whether a transaction is “of fundamental significance” is primarily a matter for the court and not for the Supervisory Board to determine.

If that assumption had been known to be unfounded, as in fact it was, it would seem likely that Freshfields would have expressed themselves differently. It is unnecessary to explore in this judgment why Freshfields, having concluded that the position was unclear, did not advise KWL in stronger terms that, if only as a precaution, it would have been prudent to obtain Supervisory Board approval before proceeding. The fact is that, at least so far as appears from the evidence before me, they did not.</p>

The experts agreed that this would be necessary if the transaction is one which the shareholders are likely to oppose, especially one which exposes the company to exceptional risk. Whether shareholder approval was required seems to me to depend on what assumption is made about whether Supervisory Board approval would be sought. If the Balaba STCDO had been presented by Mr Heininger to the Supervisory Board as a transaction which would generate upfront cash for KWL of almost US $22 million, it seems likely that the board (on which the shareholders were represented) would have been prepared to approve it. In any event, if the transaction had been presented to the Supervisory Board for approval, as it should have been, there would be no need for additional approval by the shareholders. That would not have been necessary to protect the interests of KWL. However, if the transaction was not to be presented to the Supervisory Board, application of the tests referred to above would mean that shareholder approval would have been required.</p>

That is because, even allowing for the fact that it represented an increase in risk which it was imprudent for KWL to undertake, it was a means of raising the cash which KWL needed in order to fulfil its investment objectives (see [164] above).

Similarly, it is nothing to the point that UBS did not want to have to obtain Supervisory Board approval, as that would have been an additional hurdle to surmount before a profitable deal could be concluded. It is also important that I have found as a fact that UBS never received the opinion provided to KWL by Freshfields, which stated that the need for supervisory board approval was “open to question” (see [293] above). Many of KWL’s submissions on this issue were premised on UBS having received this opinion. If it had done so, and had therefore known for a fact that Freshfields’ own view was that the need for Supervisory Board approval was “open to question”, matters might well have appeared differently.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The German law experts agreed that the involvement of lawyers acting for KWL in the transaction was a highly relevant consideration. In my judgment UBS was right to rely on the Freshfields opinion. This stated positively and unequivocally, in paragraphs (b) and (c), that KWL had the requisite corporate capacity to enter into the Balaba transaction; that the execution and delivery of the contractual documents by KWL and the performance of its obligations thereunder did not violate any applicable corporate laws or KWL’s Articles of Association; and that the contractual documents had been duly executed on behalf of KWL (see [339] above). Those statements were inconsistent with any want of authority on the part of the signatories who had “duly executed” them. </p>

KWL does not suggest that this was a case of “fraudulent collusion” or that UBS should have thought that it was. Accordingly, the overall effect of this sentence was to add to, rather than to subtract from, the comfort provided to UBS. Far from saying that this was a point on which Freshfields were not prepared to opine and which UBS must therefore investigate fully for itself, the paragraph was telling UBS that this was a point about which it need not be concerned. Indeed, in the case of the Balaba STCDO Freshfields were not even asked to say positively that Supervisory Board approval was not required.</p>

On the contrary, UBS was under no duty as a matter of German law to investigate whether KWL’s Articles required any particular level of approval, or whether the transaction was “of fundamental significance” for KWL. That is the kind of evaluation which a counterparty is not required to undertake. Nor was UBS under any obligation to examine the Articles at all, even though it had a copy of them. It was entitled to rely on the fact that KWL’s own solicitors had provided an opinion which, whatever else it did, provided not the slightest positive indication of the need for Supervisory Board approval of the transaction, let alone of the existence of massive or solid objective facts to demonstrate such a need. UBS was entitled to take the view that, if it had been plain for everyone to see that such approval was required, it would undoubtedly have been plain to Freshfields, who would have said so. Indeed UBS would reasonably have concluded that if Freshfields had thought that such approval was required, or even if they were uncertain about the matter, they would have advised KWL in strong terms not to go ahead with the transaction without first obtaining such approval.</p>

It submits that the opinion was “so carefully hedged as to be virtually meaningless”. In this connection KWL relies on assumption 2(h) that the validity of the transaction documents was not affected by “any violation of procedural or substantive requirements which is not evident from the face of the documents”; and on the limited nature of the statement which Freshfields were prepared to make about the enforceability of the transaction in a German court (see [358] above). It is KWL’s case that these statements were “deliberately equivocal … and expressed no view as to whether the transactions are enforceable under German law in the particular circumstances of the case”. This must mean, I suppose, that it was Freshfields who were being “deliberately equivocal”.</p>

I do not accept this. It is far fetched. There is no reason to suppose that assumption 2(h) was intended, let alone that it should reasonably or fairly have been understood, substantially to negate the opinions expressed in paragraphs 4(b) and (c). Mr Lancaster did not understand it as doing so. Moreover, as already explained, I attach no significance to what was said about enforceability. I doubt whether any law firm would have been willing to provide an unqualified statement that the transaction would be enforceable. </p>

I am not prepared to conclude that this is what Freshfields intended to do.

However, the assumption included by Freshfields in this first draft was concerned primarily with KWL’s motivation rather than the effect of the transaction. It was understandable that Mr Lancaster should wish to have the assumption removed. UBS would not want an opinion stating that the validity of the transaction was dependent on KWL’s motivation for entering into it, a point which (if it ever came to the crunch) would be bound to cause disputes. Certainly Mr Lancaster understood, for so long as Freshfields wished to retain the assumption, that it was an important point because it affected what Freshfields were prepared to say about whether KWL had the capacity to enter into the transaction. But he was not an expert on German law and it was reasonable for him to take the view that it was up to Freshfields to decide whether as a matter of German law this assumption needed to be retained as a qualification to their opinion. They decided that it did not.</p>

The fact that CRC regarded the transaction as unsuitable for a financially unsophisticated counterparty, or that Value Partners repeatedly insisted that KWL’s priority was to generate premium when it was not immediately apparent to UBS for what purpose the money was to be used, or that the deadline imposed by KWL appeared to be arbitrary, fall far short of the massive or solid objective facts required as a matter of German law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Viewed from UBS’s perspective, the position was that KWL had entered into the cross-border leases with Supervisory Board approval and was therefore already exposed to the risk of default of the single name defeasance providers; by entering into the STCDOs it was (or at any rate ought to have been) raising liquid finance; and the ratings of the STCDOs were such that they were regarded as being of high quality and subject to very low credit risk, or in the case of the Balaba STCDO, of low credit risk. Although I have found that the STCDOs increased the risks to which KWL was subject, and have criticised the reasoning of some of those within UBS who regarded the deal as “not a bad trade for KWL” (e.g. Mr Rodgers: see [303] above), that was a view which was genuinely held. KWL’s own risk expert, Ms Terri Duhon, was enthusiastic about STCDOs as a product, describing them as “kind of funky in that they were quite cool products actually, we liked them”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Leaving on one side the bribery and conflict issues which are still to be considered, it was at any rate not grossly negligent for UBS to regard it as a matter of commercial judgment for KWL, given the pre-crash circumstances as they existed in June 2006, whether the increase in risk which the STCDOs represented was worth taking in order to secure the benefit of the substantial premiums which KWL ought to have received and which UBS understood that it would receive. That would depend, in part, on whatever pressures KWL’s management was facing, including from the Supervisory Board but also from its shareholders in the City of Leipzig, to increase its liquidity, and on the purposes to which such funds were to be applied. With hindsight it is obvious that the risks involved were unacceptable. Even at the time it was apparent to some, for example Ms Short in CRC, that this transaction was unsuitable for a company like KWL and involved significant risk. But so far as UBS was concerned, that was a decision for KWL to make and it was not obvious to UBS that only the Supervisory Board could make that decision. It may have been in UBS’s own interests, for example from the point of view of reputational damage if the transaction went wrong, to probe these matters more rigorously than it did and to insist on Supervisory Board approval (and after all, CRC’s concerns about suitability were focused on protecting UBS’s position: UBS owed no duty to KWL not to enter at arm’s length into a transaction which was unsuitable for KWL), but in the absence of some advisory relationship German law places no burden on a bank in the position of UBS not to do so. In addition, Mr Heininger had assured UBS, both in writing in the Risk Disclosure Letter and the Letter of Authority and orally at the 30 May 2006 due diligence meeting, that no further approval was required. He had been managing director of KWL for many years and UBS had no reason to regard him as dishonest. It was not grossly negligent to accept his assurance.</p>

I did not understand UBS’s description of the matter in this way to mean that it was resiling from its admission that Mr Heininger was bribed and, in any event, it would not in my view be just to permit it to do so when this was the basis on which the trial was conducted. Undoubtedly Mr Heininger was bribed to cause KWL to enter into the transactions, albeit that he was from the outset a willing and even enthusiastic participant as a result of having already been corrupted by Messrs Senf and Blatz in their previous business together and that the money with which he was bribed was KWL’s own money, part of the premium generated by the transaction. </p>

The result, according to KWL, is that the law will treat Mr Senf and Mr Blatz as agents of UBS for the purpose of bringing about the STCDO transactions with KWL.

The law here is as stated by Robert Goff LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost</span> [1986] 1 AC 717 at 743B to 745C in a passage which is worth quoting at length:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“There is a singular dearth of authority in this country on the legal position of a principal whose agent bribes the servant of a third party in order to induce the third party to enter into a contract with his principal. In all the English cases, the briber appears to have been himself the principal, or (as in the original <span style="font-style:italic">Panama</span> case, LR 10 Ch App 515) the servant or agent of a principal who has authorised him to enter into the transaction which gave rise to the bribe, so that there was no doubt that the bribe could be imputed to the principal. I shall however first of all consider the liability of the principal in damages, where his agent has without his authority, or indeed knowledge, bribed the servant of the third party to induce the third party to contract with his principal. It is now established that the claim against the briber for damages, which appears in origin to have been a claim for equitable fraud, should be regarded as a claim in damages in tort: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Mahesan</span> case [1979] AC 374, 383, per Lord Diplock. Accordingly, the liability of the principal for the agent's tort must depend upon the principles of vicarious liability, in so far as those principles are applicable in the case of an agent who is not a servant. Certainly, the principal cannot be liable unless the agent was acting in the course of his employment as such or (as is sometimes said) in the course of his authority. For an example where a principal was so held liable, we have the authority of the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlyn v John Houston &amp; Co</span> [1903] 1 KB 81. That was a case in which one partner was held liable in damages to the plaintiff for the conduct of another partner in bribing a servant of the plaintiff to communicate to him information concerning the plaintiff, where it was within his authority to obtain such information by legitimate means. Collins MR said, at p. 85: </p>

The test is that which is applied to this case by the learned judge. Was it within the scope of the authority given to Houston to obtain this information by legitimate means? If so, it was within the scope of his authority for the present purpose to obtain it by illegitimate means, and the defendants are liable.’</p>

It was argued before us by Mr Alexander that this is not the law, and that only where the bribe can be imputed to the principal as having been within the agent's authority is the third party entitled either to rescind, or determine, the contract with the principal: in practical terms, this is likely to occur only where the agent's bribe was actually authorised by his principal, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co v India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Co.</span>, LR 10 Ch App 515, because it is difficult to imagine a case where such a bribe, if not actually authorised, is within the agent's ostensible authority.

In that case it was held by a majority of the Supreme Court that, where the agent acted in the course of his employment in making a bribe to the third party's own agent, the third party could on this ground justify his repudiation of the contract with the bribing agent's principal.

Indeed, it can be argued that the case of rescission is stronger than the case of vicarious liability for damages …”</p>

It is (at least <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span>) sufficient to enable KWL to avoid or rescind the contract if Value Partners was acting as the agent of UBS and paid the bribe to Mr Heininger in the course of its employment as agent, despite the fact that payment of the bribe was unknown to and unauthorised by anyone at UBS. Accordingly two questions arise. The first is whether Value Partners was the agent of UBS. If so, the second question is whether in paying the bribe to Mr Heininger it was acting within the scope of its agency relationship with UBS. I defer consideration of a third question, whether avoidance or rescission (for present purposes the terms are interchangeable) is an appropriate remedy, until after I have dealt with all three of the grounds on which KWL contends that the STCDO was voidable. UBS submits that rescission should be refused on the grounds that it would be disproportionate and that KWL does not have “clean hands”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Undoubtedly Value Partners was the agent of KWL. There was an existing (and already corrupt) relationship between Value Partners (and its predecessor Global Capital Finance) and KWL which ante-dated any contact with UBS. In early 2006 Mr Heininger had discussed with Messrs Senf and Blatz the possibility of restructuring KWL’s cross-border lease arrangements in order to generate additional funds. In those early discussions, which took place before the initial contact with Mr Bracy on 6 April 2006, it was apparent that any such restructuring would not only be for the legitimate purpose of raising funds for KWL, but would also involve the personal enrichment of Mr Heininger and the corrupt exploitation by Value Partners of its relationship with Mr Heininger and thus with KWL. Indeed, personal enrichment was throughout the primary motivation for all three of these dishonest individuals. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the outset, KWL was introduced to UBS as a client of Value Partners, as in fact it was. It was not even named for a few weeks after the discussions began, but was referred to anonymously as one of Value Partners’ clients. Moreover, the relationship between KWL and Value Partners was formalised by the engagement letter dated 26 April 2006 signed by Mr Heininger (see [212] above), as it happens the day before Value Partners identified its client as KWL. This leaves no room for doubt that Value Partners was acting as KWL’s agent in connection with the proposed transaction. It was precisely because Value Partners was known to be KWL’s agent that its request to be paid “fair compensation” for recommending UBS GAM as the portfolio manager ([214] above) was obviously improper. The Risk Disclosure Letter signed by Mr Heininger on 24 May 2006 ([272] above) also referred to KWL having obtained advice from such advisers as it deemed necessary, which in context was evidently a reference to Value Partners.</p>

But the consent must have been given by each of them, either expressly or by implication from their words and conduct.

From as early as April 2006 there was in place an arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners whereby Value Partners would advise clients which it had represented in connection with cross-border leasing transactions to conclude STCDOs with UBS. It described this arrangement in terms of “delivering the client” to UBS. Indeed, Mr Bracy described Value Partners to his boss in May 2006 as having “captive clients”, including KWL, who would in practice do what Value Partners recommended (see [223] and [224] above). He later made clear his understanding that in practice Value Partners would exercise a degree of “control” over clients in directing business to UBS (see [399] to [403] above). It was quite clear to Mr Bracy and to Value Partners that the purpose of their arrangement was to make money for Value Partners and (indirectly) for Mr Bracy, regardless of whether the transaction was in the clients’ best interests. All this went well beyond an understandable desire to do business or further business together if suitable opportunities arose.</p>

In any event, Mr Bracy was not slow in claiming credit for having established such a valuable relationship with Value Partners, for example in the “captive clients” email sent to his boss in the Municipal Securities Group. It was therefore an arrangement which must be regarded as having been made between UBS (acting by Mr Bracy) and Value Partners, and not by Mr Bracy acting on a frolic of his own. That is further underlined by the warm congratulations extended to Mr Bracy by UBS’s senior management once the Balaba transaction was concluded and the explicit encouragement given to him to develop the relationship further (see [371] to [390] above). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I conclude, therefore, that the relationship between UBS and Value Partners was such as to amount in law to an agency relationship. Its role as agent of UBS was for the purpose of procuring KWL to enter into the STCDO with UBS. That conclusion is not precluded by the terms of the letter dated 8 June 2006 in which Value Partners expressly represented and agreed with UBS that it had conceived the transaction and marketed it to KWL and that it had been mandated by KWL before the transaction was brought to UBS. Even if that letter had been expressed in more explicit terms, for example by stating that Value Partners had not acted as the agent of UBS, such a statement could not prejudice KWL if in reality the facts were such, as I have found that they were, to constitute Value Partners the agent of UBS. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with Lord Pearson’s statement in the<span style="font-style:italic"> Garnac Grain</span> case set out at [594] above that an agency relationship will exist if the parties have agreed to what amounts in law to such a relationship, even if they have professed to disclaim it and with Lord Wilberforce’s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Branwhite</span> that the relationship of principal and agent may be found to exist even if its existence is denied by the parties themselves. In any event, UBS knew that the statements in the letter were not true (see [324] above). The letter was simply the deal team’s way of getting round the problem that Value Partners had not produced any marketing materials which UBS could retain on file in order to satisfy the approval conditions imposed by its senior management.</p>

As Lord Wilberforce put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Branwhite</span>, the relationship which must be found to exist is consensual, not contractual.

(The question whether Mr Heininger’s knowledge should be attributed to KWL is considered more fully below in the context of the “conflict of interest” defence which was the context in which it was addressed by the parties). While it was UBS’s case that Dr Schirmer knew that the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger was improper, it was not suggested that Dr Schirmer, or indeed anyone else at KWL, knew about the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners for the delivery of Value Partners’ clients to UBS.</p>

This is not the same as asking whether UBS authorised payment of the bribe. Plainly it did not. But that is not the issue.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">No case was cited in which a bribe was paid by an agent who was in an agency relationship with both parties to the transaction, although UBS did cite <span style="font-style:italic">Nayyar v Denton Wilde Sapte</span> [2009] EWHC 3218 (QB), [2010] PNLR 15 in this connection. A question arose whether the defendant firm of solicitors was vicariously responsible for the conduct of a solicitor employed by the firm who encouraged the claimants to pay what they knew was intended to be a bribe. The solicitor was employed by the firm not only to provide legal advice to clients but also in a business development role. The claim failed in any event on the ground of <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa</span> in view of the claimants’ knowledge of the intended purpose of the payment, but Hamblen J also held that the claim against the firm would have failed on the ground that the solicitor was acting outside the scope of her employment. That was because, on the facts, the solicitor was not acting as a solicitor (whether performing an advisory or a marketing role) but as a deal broker with a personal stake in the deal in question. The test applied to determine whether the firm was vicariously liable for her conduct was whether that conduct was so closely connected with her employment that it would be fair and just to hold the employer responsible, a test which would be satisfied if the conduct was in the ordinary course of or reasonably incidental to the employment. However, the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Nayyar</span> and the issues which arose there are rather different from those arising in the present case. The decision illustrates that a principal’s responsibility for the acts of an undoubted agent or employee will only extend to acts within the scope of the agency or employment, but does not address the problem of dual principals, where an agent’s misconduct may be within the scope of conflicting duties owed to each.</p>

While I see no reason to disagree with anything in those paragraphs, I do not think that they are directed to any issue about whether or not a bribe paid by an agent should be regarded as having been paid within the scope of his agency so as to render the principal responsible for the bribe. Rather they are concerned to identify what constitutes a bribe for the purposes of civil claims. They show that English law takes a broad view of this in order to protect the party whose agent or employee is bribed, so that (for example) it is unnecessary to show dishonesty by the giver or recipient of the bribe and unnecessary to show that the bribe in fact influenced the recipient to act in a way which he would not otherwise have done.</p>

That involves a consideration of the scope of the agency relationship. If it was so acting, however, the enforcing party must accept the legal consequences of the bribe even if the agent was also the agent of the other party and even if the payment of the bribe was also within the scope of that other agency. It cannot avoid those consequences on the ground that the agent paid the bribe in breach of the fiduciary duties which it owed to the other party, as Value Partners undoubtedly did on the facts of this case. That is so regardless of which agency relationship was first in time or more firmly established. It makes no difference, therefore, that KWL had an established relationship with Value Partners which ante-dated any contact with UBS. Nor does it matter that the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger was already corrupt.</p>

First, they represent a straightforward application of the law as set out by Robert Goff LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost</span>. Second, a principal who enters into an agency relationship with an intermediary who is also the agent of the other party knows or ought to know that the agent owes conflicting and potentially irreconcilable duties. That is a risk which the principal runs. Third, as already noted, the policy of the law is to view bribery in commercial transactions with particular stringency, as explained by Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">FHR European Ventures</span> (and see also the material collected by Hamblen J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Nayyar</span> case at [83] to [96] of his judgment). To hold that a principal was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> responsible for a bribe paid by its agent acting within the scope of the agent’s employment would run counter to that policy. The fact that the agent also happens to be the agent of the other party, or that payment of the bribe also represents a flagrant breach of the fiduciary duties which the agent owes to that other party, does not provide sufficient justification for doing so.</p>

In one sense an agent remunerated by commission is always subject to a conflict of interest. A financial adviser who will not be paid if no transaction is concluded has an obvious short term interest in ensuring that it is, although it may be in the client’s interest not to do the deal. A wise adviser may take a longer term view, preferring to keep a long term relationship with a satisfied client, but experience suggests that not all advisers can be relied on to act in this way. However, the conflict of interest to which KWL contends that Value Partners was subject goes well beyond the kind of conflict which exists when any agent is remunerated by commission. It consisted of the close relationship between UBS and Value Partners, whereby UBS held out to Value Partners the incentive of lucrative further business so that it would be in Value Partners’ interests to ensure that this first deal with KWL would be concluded regardless of KWL’s interests. </p>

It is available whenever, without his principal's knowledge and consent, the agent has put himself in a position where his interest and duty may conflict. A principal is entitled to the disinterested advice of his agent free from the potentially corrupting influence of an interest of his own. Any such private interest, whether actual or contemplated, which is not known and consented to by his principal, disqualifies him: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Panama</span> case, LR 10 Ch App 515, 528-529 and <span style="font-style:italic">Parker v McKenna</span> (1874) LR 10 Ch App 96, 118.

For this purpose they must establish that they were deprived of the disinterested advice of their agent by or at least to the knowledge of the plaintiffs. Is this condition satisfied? I have no doubt that it is. It is, of course, immaterial whether the initiative for the agent's taking an interest of his own came from the agent himself or from the other party to the transaction. It must also be immaterial whether the other party provided it directly or knowingly assisted the agent to obtain it, for example by diverting to himself or an associate a payment intended for his principal. In all the reported cases, the other party has provided it himself and has been fully aware of the agent's personal interest. There is, accordingly, no direct authority on the degree of knowledge which he must possess of the existence of the agent's personal interest. With one reservation to which I shall come in a moment, however, and which goes only to the facts of which knowledge must be proved, I accept the submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs that nothing less than actual knowledge or wilful blindness will suffice. In particular, constructive notice will not do.”</p>

The first is whether Value Partners was subject to a conflict of interest. The second is whether it had been put in this position by, or whether the conflict was known to, UBS. The third is whether the conflict was without the knowledge and consent of KWL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the first two of these questions, KWL relies on essentially the same facts as it relies on for the purpose of its agency argument. It contends that agency represents a paradigm case of conflict of interest but that in any event, even if there was no agency, the facts demonstrate that Value Partners was in a position where its duty to KWL and its interest in obtaining further business with UBS were in conflict. On the findings which I have made, in particular that there was an agency relationship between UBS and Value Partners, it is obvious that the first two of the questions identified above must be answered affirmatively. The same is also true if (contrary to my decision above) the facts which I have found are not sufficient to amount in law to a relationship of agency. UBS does not seriously challenge this and expressly accepts that on this issue Mr Bracy’s knowledge would count as the knowledge of UBS. What the position would be if the facts were otherwise, I cannot tell. That would have to depend on what alternative facts were to be found. With that qualification, however, I would hold that there were on any view numerous indications that Value Partners was encouraged and intended to steer lucrative further business in UBS’s direction by exercising the “control” which it claimed to have over its clients. That was sufficient to amount to the kind of “perverse incentive” to conclude the contract regardless of KWL’s interests which will give rise to a conflict of interest (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Dennard v PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span> [2010] EWHC 812 (Ch) at [218]). Mr Bracy understood this. As already indicated in my discussion of the agency issue, this went well beyond the understandable wish which a bank and a financial adviser might properly have to do further business together if suitable opportunities arise in the future. It was apparent also from the conduct of Value Partners that its aim was to drive the transaction through regardless of KWL’s interests. An example is the way it sought to brush aside the issues which arose in the course of preparation of the Freshfields capacity opinion (see [344] to [351] above). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ultimately, the real battleground was over the third question, whether the conflict was without the knowledge and consent of KWL, the issue here being whose knowledge is to be attributed to KWL. UBS contends that the relevant knowledge was that of one or both of KWL’s managing directors, Mr Heininger and Dr Schirmer. Mr Heininger was certainly aware that Value Partners was not providing disinterested or even honest advice to KWL. He was a party to the conspiracy with Value Partners to defraud KWL by siphoning off the greater part of the premium to which KWL was entitled. Dr Schirmer also, according to UBS, although not complicit in or aware of the fraud, was aware of an inappropriate relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger, the managing director who was primarily responsible for dealing with the Balaba transaction.</p>

The damage said to have been suffered as a result of this negligence was the company’s liability to the defrauded banks. In substance, therefore, the company was the perpetrator of the frauds and only a victim of them in an indirect sense.

Lord Walker and Lord Brown, however, did decide the case by reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">Hampshire Land</span> principle, holding that it did not apply when the director with the relevant knowledge was also the sole beneficial owner of the company and its directing mind and will, exercising exclusive control over it (“the sole actor exception” -- see in particular [167], [168] and [174] <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Walker and [197] to [201] <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Brown).

In liquidation, the company brought a claim against its two directors, one of whom was its sole shareholder, and others. Some of those others applied to have the claim struck out on the ground of <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa</span>. Patten LJ, with whom Lord Dyson MR and Rimer LJ agreed, held that the critical question was whether the conduct of the directors was to be attributed to the company, in which case the action was to be regarded as an action between co-conspirators, and that whether the conduct of an agent was to be attributed to a company depended upon the context. He distinguished at [34] and [35] between two categories of case. The first was what he called “the liability cases”, where the issue arose as between the company and the defrauded third party. In such cases the company was not to be treated as a victim of the fraud but as a perpetrator, so that the conduct of the agent was to be treated as the conduct of the company. The second category (described by Lord Walker in<span style="font-style:italic"> Moulin Global Eyecare</span> as “the redress cases”) consisted of cases where the company was seeking compensation from the agent for breach of its duties owed to the company. In such cases the company was to be regarded as the victim of the agent’s conduct and the agent could not defeat the claim by attributing the unlawful conduct for which he was responsible to the company. For this purpose it made no difference whether the unlawful conduct was directed against a third party or against the company itself, or whether the company had other directors or shareholders who were innocent of the fraud. Patten LJ referred at [80] to the need for a “nuanced approach to the question of attribution and not a mechanistic application of a rule regardless of the circumstances and the nature of the claim”. He held that the Court of Appeal was not bound by <span style="font-style:italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span> to apply the sole actor exception to a claim by the company for conspiracy against its directors and others. The <span style="font-style:italic">Hampshire Land</span> principle therefore applied and the action was allowed to proceed.</p>

The gradual accretion of learning about primary and secondary victims, with or without additional refinements such as “targeting” or “vehicle of fraud”, can be seen as having missed the point. The crucial distinction depends on the nature of the proceedings in which the issue of attribution arises. On one side there are what Patten LJ (in <span style="font-style:italic">Bilta</span>, para 34) called the liability cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic">El Ajou</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Meridian</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">McNicholas</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Morris</span>. In them a company is being sued by a third party (which may be an official body) because the company is responsible for dishonest conduct on the part of one or more of its directors or employees. Here the fraud exception does not apply, even if the company is in some sense a victim. On the other side are what may be called the redress cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Gluckstein v Barnes</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Belmont</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Beach</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Bilta</span> itself. In cases of this sort a company is seeking to make its own delinquent director or employee (probably by then an ex-director or ex-employee), or an accomplice of such a person, accountable for the loss that the company has suffered. That is the situation in which the fraud exception applies, because it would be absurd and unjust to permit a fraudulent director or employee to be able to use his own serious breach of duty to his corporate employer as a defence.”</p>

But the issue here is not whether Mr Heininger’s misconduct should be attributed to KWL so as to make his actions in law the actions of KWL. Indeed, to hold that it should would mean that in law there was no misconduct, since Mr Heininger’s only victim was KWL and a company cannot defraud itself. That would be an absurd conclusion. Rather the issue is whether Mr Heininger’s <span style="font-style:italic">knowledge</span> of his misconduct with Value Partners, which naturally he concealed from KWL, should nevertheless be attributed to KWL. The context in which that issue arises is for the purpose of determining whether KWL gave its informed consent after full disclosure (as Lord Neuberger put it in <span style="font-style:italic">FHR European Ventures</span> at [5]) to the breach of duty by Value Partners which resulted in the loss of the greater part of the premium to which it was entitled. In my judgment it is clear that it did not. There is no principle of attribution which requires me to hold that a company is deemed to know of and consent to a conspiracy to defraud it hatched between a director and an agent of the company. Accordingly I hold that for the purpose of the “conflict of interest” issue, UBS cannot rely on the knowledge of Mr Heininger.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position of Dr Schirmer is different. UBS does not suggest that he was a party to or aware of the conspiracy to siphon off the premium (indeed, he was under the impression that there was no upfront premium: see [236] above), or that he was aware of the close relationship between UBS and Value Partners, but it does contend that he was aware that the relationship between Value Partners and Mr Heininger was inappropriate as a result of the generous gifts and benefits provided to Mr Heininger, such that he knew or must be taken to have known that Value Partners was not providing disinterested advice to KWL. This submission fails on the facts. <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> makes clear that only the principal’s actual knowledge of and consent to the agent’s conflict of interest will deprive the principal of a remedy. As already indicated I am not persuaded that Dr Schirmer in fact appreciated the impropriety of the relationship with Value Partners before September 2006, even if he ought to have done so (see [105] above). No case is advanced by UBS on the basis that KWL lost its right to complain of a conflict of interest as a result of Dr Schirmer’s belated recognition at or after that time of an inappropriate relationship with Mr Heininger and (for the avoidance of doubt) it is too late for any case to be advanced now. (Indeed UBS’s case on attribution was only advanced for the first time in the course of closing submissions. While I have addressed that case on its merits, it would be wrong to speculate on other ways in which it might have been put which have not been tested in evidence). Moreover, knowledge that there was something inappropriate about Mr Heininger’s relationship with Value Partners would hardly count as “full disclosure” of the conflict of interest to which Value Partners was subject, as required by Millett J in <span style="font-style:italic">Logicrose</span> and Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">FHR European Ventures</span>.</p>

In the course of the trial KWL abandoned any case based on negligent or innocent misrepresentation and confined its case to fraud. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether documents such as the Engagement Letter or the Risk Disclosure letter give rise to any contractual estoppel (cf. cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 386, [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 and <span style="font-style:italic">Springwell Navigation Corp v JP Morgan Chase Bank</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1221, [2010] 2 CLC 705).

In principle I would accept this so far as relevant, save that in the context of a case now confined to fraud, KWL would need to show that the opinions were not honestly held and not merely that the individuals concerned had no reasonable basis for holding them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that there is a degree of tension between the first three representations relied on by KWL, while the fourth (as KWL accepts) adds little or nothing because the respects in which UBS’s communication of the risks is alleged to have been misleading is by reason of the first three representations. The first representation is that the transaction would be virtually risk free for KWL, whereas the second and third representations appear to acknowledge that there would in fact be some risk. The second representation is to the effect that KWL’s overall risk would be reduced as a result of the STCDOs, while the third representation is to the effect that the risk of default was fairly represented by the credit ratings. But as KWL was at pains to emphasise, the credit ratings themselves demonstrated that the effect of the STCDOs was to increase and not to reduce KWL’s overall risk (see the table at [145] above). It is therefore very difficult to see how all of these representations could have been made by UBS and could have influenced KWL in its decision whether to enter into the STCDOs. So if a representation was made which had some influence on KWL’s decision making, which was it – (a) that the transaction involved virtually zero risk, (b) that KWL would be subject to some albeit reduced risk, or (c) that even though the credit ratings showed that the risk would be increased, nevertheless that did not fairly characterise the position as another way of measuring the risk showed that the increase in risk would be even greater? While it is open to a litigating party to advance different and even mutually contradictory cases in the alternative, a party who chooses to do so runs the risk that they may detract from each other. When the alternative cases involve allegations of fraud, that risk applies with particular force.</p>

To have described the mezzanine tranche as having “virtually zero” risk in the context of these examples would therefore have been incoherent.

It is abundantly clear from the documents related at length in the detailed narrative section of this  judgment that he understood perfectly well that the transaction did involve risks for KWL and that he was content for KWL to undertake those risks. His attitude, which was not derived from anything said by UBS, appears to have been that so long as the STCDO had a credit rating which was higher than KWL’s own shadow rating, that represented an acceptable risk. Mr Heininger understood in particular that it was only by accepting a level of risk that the transaction would generate the premium which he and Value Partners proposed to siphon off, away from KWL. </p>

The closest his evidence came to a suggestion that a representation that the transaction would be risk free for KWL had been made at this meeting was his understanding that UBS would bear the risk of the portfolio losing its value, so that the only risk for KWL would be the insolvency of UBS. It is obvious, however, that nothing of this kind was actually said by UBS.

At this stage the way in which this balance was to be struck had not yet been decided, and it would therefore not have made sense for UBS to make any representation comparing the overall risk with KWL’s existing arrangements. Nor did it do so. Indeed the example discussed at the meeting was of an AA rated tranche, but almost immediately afterwards Value Partners made clear that KWL was content to opt for a lower rated A tranche in order to maximise the premium which it would receive. The presentation did refer to “diversification” (the point of which is generally to reduce risk by spreading it) and to “reducing single event credit risk”, but went on to specify that what was being reduced by diversification was “unsystematic risk”, that is to say the risk of losses occurring as a result of features specific to any one company as distinct from features of the economy or a sector of the economy as a whole. It did not say that entry into an STCDO would reduce KWL’s overall risk, but made clear that whether this would happen would depend on various matters, including principally “KWL’s risk/reward appetites”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that UBS’s presentation materials contained numerous references to diversification, although generally to diversification of unsystematic risk, and that the concept of diversification implies a reduction in risk. However, in considering whether there was an implied representation as alleged, the statements made by UBS must be considered as a whole. Taking them as a whole and in context, it is clear that from the very beginning UBS made clear to KWL the relationship between risk and return, and the fact that KWL had a choice to make, so that the higher the premium, the greater the risk which KWL would have to undertake. It is clear too that UBS repeatedly described the risk by reference to the credit rating which the STCDO would be able to achieve. It was therefore always possible for a comparison to be made between the proposed STCDO rating and the rating of the existing single name bonds. That comparison would demonstrate, at any rate once KWL settled on the rating which it would accept, that the STCDO involved a lower rating and therefore higher risk than the single name bonds. For example, Mr Sanz-Paris’s email of 19 May 2006 (see [245] above) spelled out in terms that the Balaba transaction would not necessarily result in an overall reduction of risk. Dr Schirmer effectively accepted this, saying that if he had understood that what was being discussed at the 9 May 2006 meeting was an AA rated STCDO, he would have understood that this was more risky that the AAA rated single name bonds. This is fatal to the implication of the representation on which KWL relies as (even if Dr Schirmer did not realise this) that is what was being discussed.</p>

It is not altogether clear to what KWL is referring here, but I assume it to be the fact that the initial draft of the Freshfields capacity opinion contained, in assumption (k), an assumption that the transaction would be entered into by KWL to reduce its existing risk exposure (see [338] above). However, it was for Freshfields to determine whether this assumption was indeed critical to the question whether KWL could proceed with the transaction. After considering the matter further they decided to remove the assumption from the final version of the opinion. I can see no basis here for any implication of a representation that the transaction would in fact reduce KWL’s overall risk.</p>

Whenever it was presented with a choice between lower risk and higher premium, KWL invariably elected to take the money. I see no reason to doubt that Mr Heininger fully understood the risks involved and understood likewise that the effect of the transaction was to increase the risks to which KWL was exposed. I find that he was prepared to run those risks, which he regarded as acceptable, in order to benefit personally from the bribe which he was to receive. For this purpose he was the relevant decision maker. There is nothing in Dr Schirmer’s evidence, and certainly no evidence which I accept, to suggest that he was ever conscious of the representation which KWL claims to have been made, apart perhaps from his unimpressive evidence about the 9 May 2006 meeting with which I have already dealt. Moreover, to the extent that the position of Value Partners as the only recipient of Mr Kraus’s German language presentation is relevant, there is no reason to suppose that Value Partners ever believed that the effect of the transaction was to reduce KWL’s overall risk. The strong probability is that Value Partners understood the transaction perfectly well and that all it cared about was getting its hands on as much of the premium as possible. Once again, therefore, I would if necessary have found that UBS had rebutted the presumption of inducement.</p>

KWL says that this was impliedly represented by (a) a statement allegedly made by Mr Sanz-Paris and Mr Czekalowski at the 9 May 2006 meeting that the credit rating represented the probability of default, and (b) statements in the illustrative presentations sent to Value Partners by Mr Bracy on 10 April 2006 that “Rating serves as proxy for credit risk” and referring to the risk of default associated with investments with certain ratings over time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a rather complicated representation, which requires some further explanation. KWL’s case is that the meaning which these statements would convey to a reasonable recipient was that UBS’s own assessment of risk of loss to KWL was as implied by the credit ratings. However, KWL contends that although this was one way of assessing the risk of loss, UBS was in fact using a different method, namely the “market-implied” probability of default, which can be derived from credit default swap spreads by means of complex financial modelling, and which showed a higher risk (cf. the comparison of spreads in the table at [152] above, although as indicated at [151] a simple comparison of the spreads is not appropriate). It was this modelling which was used in order to derive the premium for the STCDO. KWL’s case is that in presenting the ratings-implied risk without also presenting the market-implied risk, UBS impliedly represented that there was no other measure of which it was aware that produced a different and significantly worse default probability of default.</p>

The only respects in which this transaction was alleged to have been marketed by UBS in an unfair or misleading way formed the subject of the first three representations dealt with above and (perhaps) the other defences on which KWL relies. If KWL succeeds on those issues, its reliance on this fourth representation adds nothing, while if it fails on those issues its reliance on this somewhat artificial misrepresentation case will not assist it. In the end KWL accepted that this way of putting its case did not add very much. On the facts of this case, I do not think it adds anything. I would prefer to leave the debate referred to above to be decided in a case where the relevant unclear, unfair or misleading conduct does not form the subject matter of an independent claim or defence. In any event there was no evidence at all that the statement that UBS was regulated by the FSA formed any part of KWL’s thinking in deciding to enter into the STCDO or that Mr Heininger or Dr Schirmer ever pondered the implications of such a statement.

To the extent that KWL had a legitimate rationale for the transaction it was to raise money, the rationale of which Dr Schirmer was aware, although he was under a false impression as to the upfront nature of the premium, in part at least because Mr Heininger and Value Partners, with the UBS deal team’s assistance, did their best to ensure that he did not find out about the existence or amount of the premium. But Mr Heininger’s real motivation, of course, was the fraudulent scheme with Value Partners to siphon off the greater part of the premium for his and Messrs Senf and Blatz’s own personal benefit. Mr Heininger knew that this statement was untrue, and that he was deceiving the CRC by making it, but so too did UBS in the person of Mr Bracy who knew that the rationale for the transaction was to generate cash, even though he did not know about the fraudulent scheme. Indeed, this was the false line which Mr Bracy had told Mr Heininger to take at the meeting in order to ensure that the transaction was approved.</p>

It was not true, as Mr Heininger must have known, that KWL had an opinion from Freshfields which confirmed this. The opinion provided to KWL by Freshfields was much more equivocal (see [333] above). However, my decision on the issue of evident abuse means that UBS has not been prejudiced by any falsity of this statement.</p>

As a result it claims damages from KWL and in addition invokes the “unclean hands” principle to the extent that KWL seeks equitable relief in the form of rescission. The damages which UBS claims consist of the losses suffered by it on the hedges which it took out in the market at the time of the transaction. Although there was no exploration at the trial of the precise amount which would be recoverable on this basis, I understand that disclosure of the relevant hedging documents was provided and I accept that the sum would be broadly equivalent to the sum payable under the STCDO, albeit that a precise calculation may be somewhat complex. If necessary, there would have to be an inquiry as to the precise figure, with credit being given (as UBS accepted) for the sum payable to KWL pursuant to the GECC, MBIA and Merrill Lynch single name CDSs.</p>

The object of such an assessment would be to put UBS as the innocent party in the position in which it would have been if the warranty had been true. But in that event, that is to say if KWL had been acting in good faith and in the normal course of its business, and if all the other statements had been true, the transaction would have gone ahead and UBS would have entered into precisely the same hedges as it did in fact enter into. However, it would remain the case that Value Partners, for this purpose to be regarded as the agent of UBS, had paid a bribe to Mr Heininger, and that to the knowledge of UBS (in the person of Mr Bracy) Value Partners was not providing disinterested advice to KWL. Accordingly, subject to the “unclean hands” issue, the transaction would still have been voidable and would have been avoided by KWL, leaving UBS unable to recover under the STCDO and facing the same hedging losses as it has in fact faced. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Perhaps as a result of this difficulty, UBS seeks to rely not on the contractual but on the tortious measure of damages for fraud, putting the innocent party in the same position as if the representation in question had not been made. It contends that without the good faith warranty it would never have entered into the transaction at all and would not, therefore, have suffered the hedging losses which it has suffered. I accept that if KWL had refused to sign (for example) the Risk Disclosure Letter containing the good faith warranty, that would have constituted a red flag for UBS, and it is unlikely that the transaction would have been concluded. I accept also that Mr Heininger who signed the letter knew that KWL was not entering into the transaction in good faith and knew also that if he had refused to sign, UBS would have been unlikely to proceed further. Thus he intended UBS to rely on the statements in the letter, which he recognised as a letter of some importance. In this respect, as in other statements that he made, he was acting dishonestly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I accept KWL’s submission that the loss suffered by UBS on its hedging contracts was not caused by its entry into the Balaba STCDO. The real and effective cause of the loss was not that UBS entered into its hedging contracts or even that it entered into the Balaba STCDO. Rather it was that the Balaba STCDO is unenforceable by UBS as a result of matters for which UBS is responsible -- the bribery of Mr Heininger by UBS’s agent Value Partners and/or its knowledge of the conflict of interest to which Value Partners was subject. Accordingly its claim for damages fails as a matter of causation. A similar analysis applies to the hedging contracts concluded by UBS in order to generate the premium and profit required for the LBBW and Depfa transactions. If those Back Swaps are valid and enforceable, UBS will have suffered no loss. If they have been rescinded for misrepresentation by UBS, an issue addressed below, it is UBS's own misrepresentation which is the cause of its loss on those hedging contracts.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is in my view a sensible result. As KWL submitted, if its case on bribery by an agent of UBS and/or conflict of interest to UBS’s knowledge is correct, as I have held that it is, it would be surprising if UBS could somehow recycle its claims by reliance on what are essentially ancillary warranties and representations by KWL. Indeed, the due diligence meeting, the Engagement Letter and the Risk Disclosure Letter are in substance aspects of the Balaba transaction which by reason of the bribery and conflict of interest must be viewed as a tainted transaction. If the transaction can be avoided on those grounds, it is hard to see what independent validity could remain for the Engagement Letter and the Risk Disclosure Letter. They form part of the transaction documents into which KWL was induced to enter. If KWL is entitled to rescind the STCDO transactions then these letters will likewise be avoided. In this respect the position is different from that considered by Andrew Smith J in <span style="font-style:italic">Credit Suisse International v Stichting Vestia Groep </span>[2014] EWHC 310 (Comm), a judgment delivered after conclusion of the argument in this case. He held that certain of the derivatives in issue in that case were void for want of capacity on the part of the Dutch social housing association which had purported to conclude them. However, it was not disputed that the association did have capacity to make various representations and warranties contained in the ISDA Master Agreement and in a Management Certificate. Andrew Smith J referred to previous authority to the effect that an entity cannot expand its capacity by estoppel or contract, but held that the claimant bank was entitled to rely on a representation and warranty that the transactions in question were in compliance with the association’s articles of association (see [287] to [322] of his judgment). The issues raised by that decision do not arise here. If the STCDO itself is voidable by reason of bribery and/or conflict of interest, the representations and warranties in these ancillary documents can have no independent life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular the bribery of Mr Heininger, for which I have found that UBS was responsible in law, was intended to induce him to do whatever was necessary for the transaction as a whole to be concluded. That included telling lies at the due diligence meeting and signing the Engagement Letter and the Risk Disclosure Letter. A party whose agent bribes the managing director of its proposed counterparty should not be very surprised to find that the same man has lied to it in the course of negotiating the transaction in question. Similarly, if UBS knew that KWL was not being properly advised as to entry into the STCDO itself, it cannot have thought that it was receiving proper advice about ancillary agreements such as the Engagement Letter and the Risk Disclosure letter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, although there was in this case an express warranty of good faith, in many such transactions it will be implicit, and will go without saying, that the parties are acting in good faith. To hold that the consequences of avoidance of a transaction for bribery or because of a party’s knowledge of an agent’s conflict of interest can themselves be avoided by reliance on a warranty of good faith could lead to serious inroads into important equitable principles which are intended to promote good faith in business dealings.</p>

That was a case where a lender had disclosed that it might make some payment to the borrower’s agent, but did not disclose the amount of the payment or that it had in fact been paid. The Court of Appeal held that there was no informed consent to the payment by the borrower, who was entitled to equitable compensation from the lender in the amount of the payment, but not to rescind the loan and its related legal charge. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Assuming that there is such a discretion to refuse rescission, the facts of that case seem far removed from the present case. Here UBS is responsible in law for a substantial bribe paid by its agent to KWL’s managing director and it chose to deal with KWL through Value Partners knowing that Value Partners was failing in its duties as an agent owing fiduciary duties to KWL. Indeed the whole point of Mr Bracy’s arrangement with Value Partners was that the latter should abuse its position as a trusted adviser in order to deliver its clients to UBS. Rescission in such circumstances is not unfair or disproportionate in my view, despite the losses which UBS has suffered on its hedging contracts. A bank which enters into a corrupt arrangement with a financial intermediary who purports to be representing the other party to the transaction is not in a strong position to invoke general equitable principles as a matter of discretion and must take the consequences of its actions. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the approach of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost</span> (see the passage cited at [588] above). Far from giving effect to the “wider policy considerations” referred to by Lord Neuberger in the <span style="font-style:italic">FHR European Ventures</span> case which dictate a stringent approach by the court in cases of bribery (see [578] above), it would undermine them.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“158. There is no dispute that there exists in English law a defence to a claim for equitable relief, such as an injunction, which is based on the concept encapsulated in the equitable maxim 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands'. Mr Nicholls accepted that the doctrine applies to a claim for an anti-suit injunction where the claim is based on an allegation that the defendant has started proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction in breach of contract because the claimant and defendant had agreed to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts. It is clear from the speech of Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">Donohue v Armco Inc</span> [2002] CLC 440 at [24] that this defence is distinct from that of there being 'strong reason’ not to grant an anti-suit injunction. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">159. It was common ground that the scope of the application of the 'unclean hands' doctrine is limited. To paraphrase the words of Lord Chief Baron Eyre in <span style="font-style:italic">Dering v Earl of Winchelsea</span> (1787) 1 Cox Eq Cas 318 at 319 the misconduct or impropriety of the claimant must have 'an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for'. That limitation has been expressed in different ways over the years in cases and textbooks. Recently in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corp v Privalov</span> [2008] EWHC 1748 (Comm) Andrew Smith J noted that there are some authorities in which the court regarded attempts to mislead it as presenting good grounds for refusing equitable relief, not only where the purpose is to create a false case but also where it is to bolster the truth with fabricated evidence. But the cases noted by him were ones where the misconduct was by way of deception in the course of the very litigation directed to securing the equitable relief. <span style="font-style:italic">Spry: Principles of Equitable Remedies</span> (8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn, 2010) suggests that it must be shown that the claimant is seeking 'to derive advantage from his dishonest conduct in so direct a manner that it is considered to be unjust to grant him relief'. Ultimately in each case it is a matter of assessment by the judge, who has to examine all the relevant factors in the case before him to see if the misconduct of the claimant is sufficient to warrant a refusal of the relief sought.”</p>

That raises some questions as to the relationship between the “unclean hands” doctrine and any more general power to refuse rescission as being “unfair and disproportionate” as in<span style="font-style:italic"> Hurstanger Ltd v Wilson</span>. If a case fails by a narrow margin to come within the scope of the “unclean hands” doctrine, is there nevertheless (and if so in what circumstances) a broader power to refuse rescission on the ground that it would be unfair?

The first is that “the equity sued for" by KWL is rescission of the contract, when it was the corrupt relationship between its own managing director and Value Partners which led to these transactions being entered into. This is in essence a re-run of UBS’s “bigger picture” argument and I reject it for the same reasons. </p>

Despite the old fashioned language (“an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for”), it is apparent that if an equitable remedy is to be refused on the grounds of “unclean hands”, there will need to be a close connection between the remedy sought and the misconduct in question. Hence the <span style="font-style:italic">Spry</span> formulation that the applicant for equitable relief must be seeking “to derive advantage from his dishonest conduct in so direct a manner that it is considered to be unjust to grant him relief”.</p>

Moreover the reason why the principal lie told by Mr Heininger, namely that KWL was entering into the transaction in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, was untrue was that he had been bribed by UBS’s own agent Value Partners with whom UBS in the person of Mr Bracy had entered into a corrupt arrangement, albeit that the intention to give and receive a bribe ante-dated the agency relationship. It seems to me in those circumstances that the requirements of the “unclean hands” doctrine are not satisfied and that, on the contrary, to allow UBS to enforce the transaction by denying KWL the right to rescind it would itself work an injustice. </p>

However, the Balaba transaction was only the first part of the transaction as a whole. The parties had intended that all four single name bonds be restructured by UBS, and that this should happen in early June 2006, but UBS’s CRC and senior management were unwilling to sanction the remaining parts of the transaction unless UBS found one or more intermediary banks willing to act as the party taking the credit risk on KWL.

The same facts may give rise to different remedies, and as the present case demonstrates it will often be impossible to distinguish between the payment of a bribe or secret commission properly so-called and the diversion of the principal's money into the agent's pocket.

In my judgment it is clear that they did. Although Mr Bracy and indeed Value Partners played a less prominent role in the negotiation of the LBBW and Depfa STCDOs, they continued to play some part, while other members of the UBS deal team such as Mr Czekalowski and Mr Sanz-Paris were fully involved. In any event, these later contracts were, as between UBS and KWL, all part of what was seen as a single transaction, with UBS taking the lead in finding banks which were prepared to act as intermediaries, stepping into a structure which had already been established. As KWL submits, it would make no sense for KWL to have a remedy against UBS in relation to the Balaba STCDO but not in relation to the other STCDOs, when in substance all four STCDOs formed part of a single transaction and the bribery and conflict of interest which give rise to a remedy in the case of Balaba continued to operate in the case of the other STCDOs. </p>

This plea was mentioned briefly in UBS’s written submissions but was not developed orally. I reject it. The arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners to deliver clients to UBS did not come to light until after disclosure in the course of these proceedings. Indeed the full extent of that relationship as shown by the “letter for K” episode only emerged during the trial. The relevant limitation period is six years from the date when KWL discovered the fraud or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it (section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980).

Those CDSs were concluded directly with UBS but represent in each case the other half of the STCDO transactions concluded with LBBW and Depfa. The effect of my decision on KWL’s damages/indemnity claims is effectively the same as if, from KWL’s point of view, those STCDOs had been rescinded, as KWL will be indemnified by UBS against any liability thereunder (although see further [791] and [799] below). It follows in my view that KWL cannot retain the benefit from the CDSs. One way to give effect to that view would be to say that KWL must give credit against any damages claim for sums due to it under the CDSs. However, it is preferable, in my judgment, to hold that one aspect of the practical justice which has to be achieved in rescinding the Balaba STCDO is that the various CDSs must also be unwound in order to put both UBS and KWL as nearly as possible into the position in which they would have been if these transactions had not been concluded.

Although UBS was not aware of that bribe, I have held that UBS was responsible in law for its payment, and thus for the fact that KWL did not receive this money. Accordingly justice does not require that KWL restore this element of the premium to UBS. That would be a travesty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of fact, the sums siphoned off by Value Partners were not in fact received by KWL either, but in my view they are in a materially different position from the bribe paid to Mr Heininger. While the effect of the arrangement between Mr Bracy and Value Partners was to constitute Value Partners as UBS’s agent for the purpose of delivering KWL to UBS as a contractual counterparty so that payment of the bribe was within the scope of that agency, it could not be and was not suggested that Value Partners was acting as UBS’s agent in siphoning off the greater part of the premium. On the contrary, that was done in its capacity as KWL’s agent pursuant to a letter signed by both of KWL’s two managing directors (see [391] above). So far as UBS is concerned, therefore, this part of the premium was paid in accordance with KWL’s instructions. The fact that KWL’s own agent then misappropriated it is a matter for which KWL is responsible. There is no good reason why this part of the premium should not be repaid to UBS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the remaining CDSs are concerned, UBS’s claim for return of premium on the STCDOs is (or at any rate should be) confined to the net STCDO premium after deduction of the CDS premia, which therefore need not be considered further. In addition, however, KWL claims US $66,916,676 from UBS, being the sum due to it on the Early Termination of the GECC, MBIA and Merrill Lynch single-name CDSs which were “in the money” for KWL. UBS acknowledges this as a credit to which KWL is entitled by way of set off against its claim to recover under the Balaba STCDO, but that set off only exists on the basis that, contrary to what I have held, the Balaba STCDO is enforceable against KWL. KWL contends that it is not only entitled to rescind the Balaba STCDO and to be indemnified by UBS for any liability which it may have under the LBBW and Depfa Front Swaps, but also to recover the (almost) US $67 million due to it on Early Termination of these three CDSs. This would be a fairy tale ending for KWL to this otherwise rather sad story. It would mean that this transaction, in which KWL was defrauded by its own crooked managing director and corrupt agent, and which was disastrously affected by the worst financial crisis in living memory, had turned out to be massively profitable for it after all.</p>

This plea was introduced by an amendment during the trial, following the evidence of Mr Bracy and in particular the emergence of what I have called the “letter for K” episode (which Depfa characterises as the “October cover-up”). This revealed that, certainly as of October 2006 and therefore before the intermediation transaction was even presented to Depfa, Mr Bracy knew that Messrs Senf and Blatz were dishonest. A similar but more wide ranging amendment was also made by LBBW, although by October 2006 the LBBW transaction had already been concluded. It is therefore convenient to consider first the position of Depfa. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground between UBS and Depfa that when the transaction was first presented to Depfa, UBS informed it that the reason why an intermediary was required was because UBS’s internal credit lines were full, and that it was therefore unable to conclude the transaction directly with KWL itself. It follows, as is also common ground, that UBS impliedly represented that if it had had sufficient credit lines, it would have contracted with KWL directly. This was true. The need for intermediary banks arose from CRC’s unwillingness to accept full credit exposure to KWL on all four STCDOs and was the solution devised by UBS’s senior management to resolve that problem. Depfa contends, however, that it was implicit in what it was told about this by UBS, in the fact that UBS told Depfa that it had done due diligence on KWL, and in the fact that the transaction was presented to Depfa at all, that UBS was also impliedly making the further representations set out at [733] above. In essence, it says that if those matters had not represented UBS’s state of mind, it could not as a reputable bank have presented this transaction to Depfa, and that Depfa was therefore entitled to understand that these representations were being made to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first two representations on which Depfa relies are more problematic. A representation that an opportunity or a proposed transaction presented to a bank is “proper and viable” is rather vague, while a representation that a bank "did not have any significant concerns as to the validity and enforceability” of a transaction begs the question of what is meant by a "significant concern". (In view of my conclusion that there was no evident abuse of the KWL managing directors’ power of representation in entering into the Balaba STCDO, Depfa’s third proposed representation need not be further considered). Recognising this, in closing Depfa reformulated its "proper and viable" representation by reference to the particular facts of this case so that the representation relied on was that the intermediation opportunity was "proper and viable in that there was no bribe, fraudulent misrepresentation or conflict of interest". However, to regard UBS as making a representation in these very specific terms seems rather unrealistic. (As I have found that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation by UBS, what matters here is the absence of a bribe or conflict of interest).</p>

The evidence of Mr Sanz-Paris quoted above illustrates the difference. His evidence was clear that Depfa was entitled to assume that UBS did not have such knowledge, despite the fact that it also explained that Depfa should undertake its own due diligence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether the "no knowledge of dishonesty" representation was false depends in part on the issue considered below whether the knowledge of Mr Bracy is to be regarded as the knowledge of UBS. Depfa does not suggest that anybody in UBS apart from Mr Bracy and Mr Maron was aware of the "letter for K" episode which (in Depfa’s case) gives rise to this misrepresentation case. I have accepted that Mr Bracy did not tell others about this. However, Depfa indicated that although it made no positive case itself, it would rely on any findings which I might make as between UBS and KWL as to the knowledge of others within UBS. In this regard I have found that even though Mr Sanz-Paris did not know about the “letter for K” episode, he knew enough to realise that there was something seriously wrong about Messrs Senf and Blatz (see [470] above). I conclude, therefore, that the "no knowledge of dishonesty" representation was false because UBS knew of the dishonesty of Value Partners, regardless of the issue concerning the attribution to UBS of Mr Bracy's knowledge about the “letter for K”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for the “no knowledge of taint" representation, Depfa does not suggest that anybody at UBS was aware of the bribe paid to Mr Heininger or that the knowledge of Value Partners is to be attributed to UBS for this purpose. However, the position regarding conflict of interest is more complex. Mr Bracy at least was aware of the facts giving rise to the conflict of interest on the part of Value Partners and on this point UBS accepts that his knowledge counts as UBS’s knowledge (see [80] above). I find that Mr Bracy was a sufficiently experienced banker to appreciate that his arrangement with Value Partners was inappropriate and did involve such a conflict. On occasions, for example, he recognised expressly the need to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest when he was in fact actively creating one. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether Mr Bracy or others actually understood that the consequence in law of such a conflict would be that any transaction entered into through Value Partners would be vulnerable to rescission, as distinct from the risk of (for example) regulatory intervention, seems more doubtful. For the most part Mr Bracy did not attempt to keep his close relationship with Value Partners a secret from others within UBS. On the contrary he boasted about it to his bosses, did everything he could to play up Value Partners’ role (even referring to “an extension of our staff”: see [200] above) and apparently without shame sent his friend Mr Maron’s list of clients for Value Partners to approach to Mr Sanz-Paris, as well as envisaging that the use to which this list would be put would impress his boss in the United States sufficiently to give Mr Maron a job ([198] above). All this suggests a collective blindness within some parts of UBS to obvious considerations of business propriety, but it is hard to think that UBS would so actively have pursued transactions which it knew were liable to be set aside. However, as the "no knowledge of taint" representation was a representation that UBS did not know the transaction to be tainted by a conflict of interest, and not a representation that UBS did not know that the transaction was liable to be set aside, I find that the representation was false. Mr Bracy at least had that knowledge and in my judgment so did Mr Sanz-Paris.</p>

UBS submits that (as I have accepted) nobody in UBS apart from Mr Bracy and Mr Maron knew about the "letter for K" episode; that their knowledge is not to be regarded as the knowledge of UBS; that by the time of the Depfa transaction, Mr Bracy was effectively no longer involved, and played no part in the decision to approach Depfa, in any provision of information to Depfa, or in any discussion or negotiation with Depfa; and that he was therefore not responsible for the making of any representation to Depfa. It is simply a case, according to UBS, of one agent or representative of UBS making a statement believing it to be true, even though another agent or representative not responsible for the representation and not being aware of its being made knows facts making it untrue.</p>

He was entrusted with responsibility for the fostering and further development of this relationship by the senior management of UBS following the closure of the Balaba transaction, with little or no supervision, and was encouraged in this connection to “continue to push intra-divisional opportunities”, to “stay connected to Value Partners and involved with future transactions”, to explore ways in which UBS could “create value” for Value Partners and to exercise his entrepreneurial skills (see [371] to [390] above). It is obvious in those circumstances that, as Value Partners’ point of contact within UBS, he was authorised to receive information from and communicate with Value Partners. He was asked to provide the “letter for K” in that capacity. However, as I have found, while this episode demonstrated the dishonesty of Value Partners, it was not the original source of Mr Bracy's knowledge of that dishonesty, but merely a further confirmation of what was by then already apparent to him (see [465] above). As Mr Nicholas Peacock QC for LBBW put it, vividly but also accurately, “<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">Mr Bracy did not know of the true depth of Value Partners’ corruption (nor of Mr Heininger’s participation in that corruption) but he did know, to put it bluntly, that Value Partners was willing to sell its clients’ interests (including the interests of KWL) down the river if there was money to be made”.

The reason for the approach to Mr Bracy was (among other things, but largely) to help Mr Heininger keep his job as a managing director of KWL which was critical to any further transactions with KWL. Mr Bracy’s willingness to assist Value Partners and Mr Heininger was to protect the prospect of further business with clients of Value Partners, not only in general but specifically with KWL.</p>

He knew about the press allegations concerning inappropriate gifts to Mr Heininger but (at best) deliberately refrained from asking about this while enjoying Value Partners' hospitality. He knew that Mr Blatz had asked him (and he had agreed) to produce a misleading document, the "transaction overview". He was fully involved, more visibly than Mr Bracy so far as Depfa was concerned, in the presentation of the intermediation opportunity to Depfa and the subsequent negotiations. His evidence set out at [741] above shows that he would have understood the "no knowledge of dishonesty" representation to have been made to Depfa or any other potential intermediary.

I reject that suggestion. First, I accept the evidence of the Depfa witnesses that Depfa was not in fact aware of the press articles concerning Mr Heininger. Second, the allegations in the press articles concerning the acceptance of luxury trips and gifts provided in connection with KWL’s conclusion of cross-border lease transactions were of a different order of seriousness from the fact that (to the certain knowledge of UBS in the person of Mr Bracy) Mr Heininger and Value Partners were dishonestly acting together to deceive KWL. Indeed Mr Geoghegan of Depfa could reasonably take the view that by the standards of investment banking the press allegations were no more than a storm in a teacup (see [445] and [446] above). But no sensible person would think that a conspiracy to fabricate false evidence to deceive (in Mr Heininger’s case to deceive his employer and in Value Partners' case to deceive its client) fell into the same category.</p>

If that is right, then Depfa cannot obtain any benefit under them and all three parties would be restored to the position in which they would have been if the transaction had not been concluded. Depfa’s witnesses regarded the Front and Back Swaps as a single package, and were of the view that if one fell away, both would fall. Accordingly Depfa does not resist KWL’s assertion but points out, correctly in my view, that the legal basis for it is unclear. In particular it is unclear how Depfa would be able to bring about the rescission of the Front Swaps, on the grounds only that the Back Swaps were invalid, if KWL had wished to maintain them.</p>

Alternatively, if it is required to enforce the Front Swaps and succeeds in doing so, it would not object to passing on to UBS any proceeds in fact paid to it by KWL, subject to deduction of its costs.  </p>

In this case that is easily accomplished by requiring Depfa to undertake, as a condition of its entitlement to rescind the Back Swaps, not to seek to enforce the Front Swaps against KWL. That gives effect to Depfa’s right to rescind as the victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation by UBS. It gives effect to the substance of the position which is that, regardless of the correct legal analysis, the Depfa Front and Back Swaps undoubtedly comprised a single commercial package. It ensures that Depfa does not receive an unjust windfall. And it is an undertaking which, as I understand it, Depfa is willing to give as it does not wish to enforce the Front Swaps independently of any liability which it may have under the Back Swaps.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite this, UBS submits that rescission of the Back Swaps is not an available remedy because it cannot be restored to the position in which it would have been if the transaction had not been concluded. This is because, come what may, it has suffered losses on the hedging contracts into which it entered in order to provide the premium, as well to cover its costs and make its  profit. I accept that it has suffered such losses, but do not accept that this means that rescission is not available. In <span style="font-style:italic">Halpern v Halpern</span> [2007] EWCA Civ 291, [2008] QB 195, a question arose whether rescission for duress was an available remedy in circumstances where full restitution of the pre-contractual position would not be possible.

On the other hand, the example used by a Professor Burrows] -- an illegitimate demand for payment for work carried out -- does point to the difficulty of too rigid a rule. To expand the example, one may imagine someone persuaded by improper means to pay an excessive amount for work done on his house, for example re-tiling of his roof. It is hard to see why it should matter whether the improper means was a threat or a fraudulent misrepresentation. In either case, one would expect the law to find a means to enable him to recover his money, without requiring him to undo the work to the roof. It may be open to debate whether he should be required to give any credit for the value of the work done, assuming it was a value to him. But there could be no justification for any such counter-restitutionary requirement, if the evidence was that the re-tiling had not in fact been needed.</p>

Returning to the question posed by the preliminary issue in this case, a definitive response is not possible or appropriate, until the facts have been found. I would be inclined to agree with the deputy judge that rescission for duress should be no different in principle from rescission for other ‘vitiating factors’. However, the practical effect of counter-restitution, in the terms explained by Lord Blackburn in the <span style="font-style:italic">Erlanger</span> case 3 App Cas 1218, will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. In the present case, if (contrary to Christopher Clarke J’s expectations) the defendants are able to establish that their consent to the compromise agreement was procured by improper pressure (whether that is characterised as duress or undue influence), it would be surprising if the law could not provide a suitable remedy. The form of the remedy, whether equitable or tortious, is a matter which cannot sensibly be decided until the facts are known, not only as to the nature and effect of the improper pressure, but also as to the identity and significance of the documents destroyed.”</p>

Its position is factually different in that the “letter for K” episode occurred after the LBBW transaction had been concluded. However, as I have found that this episode merely confirmed what Mr Bracy already knew about Value Partners’ dishonesty, this difference does not affect the overall analysis. Another difference, to the extent that Mr Sanz-Paris's knowledge is relevant, is that some aspects of his knowledge arose only after the LBBW transaction had been concluded. These included his knowledge of the press allegations about Mr Heininger and whatever was or was not said about this issue during the safari trip and the request for the "transaction overview". However, this need not be further explored because the knowledge of Mr Bracy is sufficient for LBBW’s purposes. In other respects LBBW is in materially the same position as Depfa so far this aspect of the case is concerned.</p>

Mr Bracy was fully involved in the LBBW transaction (see [408] above) just as he was subsequently involved in the Depfa transaction. I accept also the evidence of the LBBW witnesses, in particular Mr Northway, that LBBW did rely upon them. If LBBW had known the true position, it would have had nothing to do with this transaction. Indeed, although the later and less serious press allegations concerning Mr Heininger gave rise to different views within LBBW, they were at least a significant factor in LBBW’s decision not to participate in further transactions regarding the Merrill Lynch and MBIA bonds (see [478] and [479] above). As with Depfa, UBS relies on entire agreement and non-reliance clauses, but this reliance is ill founded for the same reasons as already discussed above.</p>

Subject to the complication that its claim under the Front Swap is before the German courts and that this court has no jurisdiction in relation thereto, LBBW is in the same position as Depfa in not wishing to seek any windfall recovery under the Front Swap in the event that it is entitled to rescission of the Back Swap. The formulation of an undertaking not to enforce the Front Swap may need to reflect damages claims which LBBW seeks to pursue against UBS, for example for any costs of the proceedings against KWL in Germany which it is unable to recover there. Such claims are not presently before me. In principle, however, there is no reason why LBBW should not give a similar undertaking to Depfa as a condition of rescission of the Back Swap and, as I understand it, LBBW is willing to do so.</p>

However, the two swaps are separate contracts involving different parties and were deliberately structured in this way. In those circumstances I agree with Mr Railton for Depfa that the legal basis on which the Front Swap would fall away as a result of rescission of the Back Swaps is not clear. It is possible to imagine circumstances in which an intermediary bank would wish to rescind the Back Swaps while a client in the position of KWL might wish to maintain the Front Swap. That could occur, for example, if in the days before the financial crisis the client took the view that losses under the STCDO would not occur and was anxious to retain an attractive premium. Accordingly I would not have upheld KWL’s first ground of resistance to Depfa’s claim under the Front Swaps.</p>

Applying these principles, it is difficult to characterise the relationship between UBS and Depfa as a relationship of agency, at any rate in which UBS was the agent and Depfa the principal. Rather they were acting on opposite sides of the Back Swap contract, with UBS describing itself as the arranger of the transaction for KWL (see [488] above). Moreover, although from a commercial point of view it might have made sense to speak of UBS carrying out the later parts of the transaction through intermediaries, it was always understood that the reason why this was necessary was that UBS was not willing to contract with KWL directly and accordingly that all three parties, UBS, KWL and the intermediary bank, would contract as principals.</p>

Thus one consequence of the bribery of Mr Heininger for which UBS is responsible and the Value Partners conflict of interest of which UBS was aware is that KWL is entitled to damages from UBS the effect of which will be to indemnify it against any liability to Depfa on the Front Swaps (see [716] above).</p>

Although the misrepresentation had been made before the managing director's appointment as the shareholders' agent, it had a continuing effect right up until the conclusion of the sale. In <span style="font-style:italic">Cramaso v Ogilvie-Grant</span> a representation was made to an individual who subsequently decided to conclude the contract using a newly formed partnership. It was held that on the facts the parties had proceeded with the negotiation and conclusion of the contract on the basis that the accuracy of the representation continued to be asserted by the representor, implicitly if not expressly, after the identity of the prospective contracting party had changed and that it had continued to have a causative effect, so as induce the conclusion of the contract with the new partnership.

I have already dealt with the applicable legal tests and have concluded that Supervisory Board approval was required in the case of the Balaba STCDO. There is no reason to reach a different conclusion on that point in the case of the Depfa Front Swaps. Accordingly the issue is whether Depfa was guilty of gross negligence in the demanding sense required by German law. This issue is concerned with Depfa’s own conduct, principally that of Mr Wiehler, the Depfa lawyer responsible for this transaction. On this issue KWL does not contend that any negligence of UBS is to be attributed to Depfa, although in any event I have found that UBS was not grossly negligent in relation to the Balaba transaction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although there are many similarities between the factual position of UBS in relation to the Balaba transaction and the position of Depfa, there are two important differences. The first is that, as a result of the Balaba and LBBW transactions, Depfa was dealing with a situation in which KWL had already concluded two very similar previous STCDOs which it was given to understand had been notified to the KWL Supervisory Board without objection. It was entitled in my view to take some comfort from this. The second is that Mr Wiehler on behalf of Depfa did apply his mind to the specific question whether Supervisory Board approval for the transaction was required and raised this expressly with Freshfields, whereas Mr Lancaster for UBS had focused primarily on other issues. KWL relies on this, submitting that having raised the issue in this way, Mr Wiehler was negligent in failing to insist that the issue should be conclusively resolved, either by a Supervisory Board resolution approving the transaction or by an unequivocal statement by Freshfields that such approval was not required under KWL’s Articles.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is true that the information provided by UBS to Depfa changed dramatically in the course of the negotiations. First UBS told Depfa that KWL had board approval for the transaction (see [481] above). Then it sent a copy of the Supervisory Board minute of the 7 September 2006 meeting which merely took note of a presentation by Mr Heininger ([484]). It appears that Mr Wiehler was under the impression, right up until early March 2007, that Supervisory Board approval existed. His question at that stage was not whether it was necessary, but whether it was sufficient ([500] and [501]). At this stage, Mr Lancaster realised that Supervisory Board approval had not been given and changed tack, requesting Freshfields to include a statement in their opinion that this was not necessary ([502]). Mr Wiehler also requested Freshfields to address this issue in their opinion, and it was this which led to the telephone conversation of 6 March 2007 with Dr Reichert-Facilides ([505] to [510]). I have found that the result of that conversation was not, as KWL contends, that Freshfields told Mr Wiehler that they were not prepared to say that Supervisory Board approval was not required and that in those circumstances Depfa would have to make a commercial decision whether it wished to proceed, but that Freshfields told Mr Wiehler that Depfa did not need to concern itself with whether Supervisory Board approval was required and that it was for this reason that the topic would not be dealt with in the opinion. As a German lawyer himself, Mr Wiehler was very familiar with the concept that a third party contracting with a company need not enquire into the authority of the managing directors and is entitled to proceed on the basis that they have authority in the absence of massive or solid grounds for suspecting otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ultimately, therefore, despite the initial muddle about whether Supervisory Board approval existed, Mr Wiehler was reassured by Freshfields on this issue. Even if the reason for Freshfields' reluctance to address the issue of Supervisory Board approval in their opinion was their own uncertainty on the point (see [333] above), a matter on which I make no finding one way or the other, Mr Wiehler had no way of knowing this. Certainly his conduct can be criticised in some respects, as he himself admitted. He did not discuss his conversation with Dr Reichert-Facilides internally within Depfa as he had said he would ([507]). He omitted to obtain a signed copy of the final Freshfields opinion ([512]). He never obtained a copy of KWL’s Articles, despite having asked for them several times ([513]). And he never quizzed Mr Lancaster about the changes in the information provided to Depfa. </p>

The fact is that Mr Wiehler had Freshfields' agreement to the terms of an opinion materially to the same effect as that given to UBS and LBBW and he had been expressly advised by Freshfields that Depfa need not be concerned with the issue whether Supervisory Board approval for the transaction had been obtained. In these circumstances I consider that the need for Supervisory Board approval was not obvious and that Mr Wiehler cannot be regarded as grossly negligent for failing to realise that in fact such approval was essential to the validity of the transaction. </p>

It could therefore be said, more succinctly, that LBBW’s case is that "paid" means "paid"; Depfa’s case is that "paid” means "payable"; and that UBS’s case is that "paid” means "calculated and payable on the assumption that the Front Swap is valid and enforceable whether or not it actually is”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The purpose of clause 6 was to provide that in the event of Early Termination of the Front Swap, the Back Swap would also terminate, thus maintaining the back-to-back nature of the two contracts. It did this by providing that Early Termination of the Front Swap (defined as “the Portfolio Swap”) would constitute an “Additional Termination Event” under the Back Swap, with the same Early Termination Date and the same amount payable under each swap. That the amount would be the same was further ensured by a provision that for each swap UBS would be the "Calculation Agent". The clause represents, therefore, a special regime under the Back Swap applicable only in the event of Early Termination of the Front Swap. The circumstances in which it would be most likely to be invoked were where KWL failed to make a payment which was due under the Front Swap, which in turn was most likely to happen in the event of KWL becoming insolvent. Because of the calculation methods which apply under the ISDA Master Agreement, the calculation which would then be required might result in an amount due to KWL under the Front Swap (situation “(A)” in clause 6) or might result in an amount due to the intermediary bank (situation “(B)”). </p>

As UBS explained the matter to both LBBW and Depfa, that was the purpose of involving intermediary banks when UBS would otherwise have contracted directly with KWL. There was some debate as to what was meant by "credit risk", a term which was not contained in the contract but which was used by the parties in their negotiations. Although I would accept that the meaning of this expression will depend on the context, and that a wider meaning is sometimes possible, in the present context it refers to a party’s (i.e. KWL’s) failure to meet its financial obligations and does not extend to the risk of non payment in circumstances where (for example, because the Front Swap is void or has been validly avoided) there is no obligation to pay.</p>

The “Portfolio Swaps Floating Payment Date” means “each date that a Floating Amount is due and payable by [KWL] to [LBBW or Depfa] pursuant to and in accordance with” the Front Swap. The "Equivalent Portfolio Swaps Floating Amounts" means, for each such date, “an amount determined by [UBS] equivalent to the amount payable by [KWL] to [LBBW or Depfa] pursuant to and in accordance with” the Front Swap on the "Portfolio Swaps Floating Payment Date”.</p>

In other words, clause 3 cannot apply if no payment is due and payable by KWL to LBBW/Depfa. Thus the intermediary bank’s payment obligations depend on sums being due and payable under the Front Swaps and, therefore, on the validity and enforceability of those Swaps. If the Front Swaps are invalid and unenforceable, nothing is due and payable under them and therefore nothing is due and payable under the Back Swaps.</p>

If KWL has no obligation to pay the intermediary bank, the intermediary bank has no obligation to pay UBS. If KWL does have an obligation to the intermediary bank, the intermediary bank has a corresponding obligation to UBS regardless of whether KWL has actually made payment. </p>

I do not accept this. These were transactions which UBS had arranged and which it presented to the intermediary banks. It is not self-evident that the each of the intermediary banks should bear the risk that the transactions were fundamentally flawed in some way. If the Front Swaps were flawed, this was much more likely to be by reason of something for which UBS (not LBBW or Depfa) was responsible.

However, I do not regard that opinion evidence as being of any relevance to an issue of construction. In any event, if UBS put forward contract wording which indicated that it would bear the risk of invalidity of the Front Swaps (as in my view it did), the point put to Mr Northway goes nowhere.</p>

That demonstrates, according to UBS, that it was LBBW and Depfa who were understood to be bearing the risk of the Front Swap being invalid. I do not accept this argument. Even assuming this to be a matter of relevant background, the fact that LBBW and Depfa obtained opinions from Freshfields does not necessarily mean that, as against UBS, they were accepting liability under the Back Swaps even if the Front Swaps were invalid. It would in any event have been sensible for them, for example from a reputational point of view, to take appropriate steps to ensure the validity of the Front Swaps into which they were to enter and which (if KWL failed to pay) it would be for them, not UBS, to enforce. Again, however, and in any event, this consideration cannot override the clear meaning of the contract. </p>

As I understand it, UBS does not suggest this. Its case is that payment is due under the Back Swaps regardless of KWL’s liability under the Front Swaps whether or not there is an Early Termination. I have rejected that case. But LBBW (although not Depfa) does contend that Early Termination of the Front Swaps makes all the difference, and that once it occurs, the intermediary bank is only obliged to pay UBS upon actually receiving payment from KWL. Thus in the present case, even if KWL is under an obligation to pay LBBW as the Leipzig Court has held, LBBW is so far under no obligation to UBS (save perhaps for an obligation to sue KWL) because so far KWL has not discharged its obligation.</p>

Thus in the very situation where an intermediary bank would be needed, because UBS was not prepared to take the credit risk and had made this clear to LBBW and Depfa, the Back Swap would have failed to achieve its purpose.</p>

But it counters this objection to its construction by contending that it was an equal objective of the transaction that the intermediary bank should not take the market risk -- in other words, that the intermediary bank should not be left in a situation where it is liable to UBS without having recovered from KWL. I do not accept this. Certainly the contracts were intended to be back-to-back, but the whole purpose of the three party structure was that the intermediary bank should contract as a principal and should bear the credit risk of KWL. It was for this that the intermediary banks earned their fees. Moreover, even LBBW accepts that the intermediary banks did take the market risk in the case of payments falling due from KWL before an Early Termination.</p>

While the literal wording of the clause suggests that payment is only due to UBS once an equal amount has been "paid" by KWL to the intermediary bank, that is plainly not the intended meaning of the clause. So to construe the clause would defeat the object of the contract. The problems to which I have referred fall away if the word "paid" is understood to mean "payable", as Depfa submits that it should be. That is in my judgment a permissible construction and I hold that it is correct. Although the construction of each clause depends on its own context, I note that there is at least one case of the highest authority where the phrase "actually paid" has been held not to require actual payment (<span style="font-style:italic">Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan</span> [1997] AC 313).</p>

That would have to be an implied obligation owed to UBS as there is no such express obligation in the Back Swap. But it involves considerable difficulties. How far would LBBW be required to pursue such proceedings? Who would be entitled to decide whether to accept any offer of settlement? And so on.

But a payment regime which distinguishes between Early Termination of the Front Swaps and other situations is not in fact the case which UBS wishes to make. Accordingly, in order to give effect to the case which it wishes to make, that LBBW and Depfa should bear the risk of invalidity of the Front Swaps regardless of Early Termination, UBS suggested in closing that if necessary further clauses of the Back Swaps should also be rectified: that the reference to sums being “payable” by KWL under the definition of Portfolio Swap and/or under clauses 2 and 3 of the confirmations should be replaced with the same underlined wording as proposed for clause 6 and, again if necessary, the reference to the “Portfolio Swap” should be supplemented by adding the words “or purported Portfolio Swap”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient to consider separately the issues of credit risk and validity risk. The effect of my decision on construction is that LBBW does bear the credit risk of KWL, at any rate using "credit risk" in the sense of risk that KWL would fail to meet its obligations. This is so, not only during the currency of the Front Swaps (as LBBW accepts), but also in the event of their Early Termination. I have reached that conclusion by construing the word "paid" in clause 6 of the Back Swap as meaning "payable". Accordingly this aspect of UBS’s claim does not arise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the event, although UBS submits as part of its rectification case that LBBW was to bear the credit risk of KWL, it has not formally advanced a claim for rectification of the Back Swap to give effect to this independent of its case on the validity risk. Thus it has not formally pleaded that, if LBBW’s construction of clause 6 is correct, the LBBW Back Swap should be rectified by the simple replacement of the word “paid” in clause 6 with “payable”. However, I should record that if it is not a legitimate conclusion as a matter of construction that “paid” in clause 6 means “payable”, I would have been willing to reach the same result by way of rectification. It was always the mutually expressed intention of the parties that LBBW should bear the credit risk of KWL. That was indeed the purpose of involving LBBW as an intermediary between UBS and KWL. This appears from the way in which UBS first described the transaction to LBBW (see [409] above) and the way in which the negotiations then developed, right through to LBBW’s express acknowledgment on 6 September 2006 that it was taking the credit risk of KWL ([433] above). Mrs Schmidt of LBBW accepted in her evidence that this exchange shows that both parties were proceeding on the basis that the credit risk of KWL was being taken by LBBW. I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The only reason why LBBW now suggests that it should not bear this credit risk in the event of Early Termination of the Front Swap is the language of clause 6 of the confirmation discussed above. However, although the clause with this wording was included in the draft contracts from the very beginning, nobody focused on it during the parties' negotiations and even the LBBW witnesses admitted candidly that they only noticed its potential significance after the event. It is clear, in my judgment, that if (contrary to my decision above) clause 6 is to be construed as contended for by LBBW, the clause fails to reflect accurately the parties' common and mutually expressed intention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add for clarity that UBS submits (and on occasions suggested to LBBW witnesses) that the expression "credit risk" extended to cover any failure by KWL to make payment under the Front Swap, even if no such payment was due, for example because the Front Swap was void for want of capacity or had been validly avoided. Although UBS was able to point to some documents, including some definitions in LBBW’s own published accounts, which suggest that the expression "credit risk" may sometimes be used in this wider sense, that is clearly not the sense in which it was used in the message of 6 September 2006. If "credit risk" covered non-payment for any reason, it would not have made sense for LBBW to say that it would be left “only” with the credit risk. Indeed the way in which UBS’s submissions deal separately with credit risk and validity risk implicitly recognises that "credit risk" is being used in the narrower sense of failure to meet an obligation. If “credit risk” covered everything, there would be no need to discuss “validity” or “<span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>” risk separately.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as validity risk is concerned, UBS relies on the exchanges on 22 and 23 August 2006 as showing that the parties’ intention was that LBBW would be liable under the Back Swaps even if the Front Swaps were invalid or avoided (see [414] to [424] and [436] above). However, while the issue was raised in the parties’ negotiations, my findings set out in those paragraphs mean that there was no common continuing intention or outward expression of accord that the validity risk would be borne by LBBW. The parties were in fact unable to agree about this issue and left it that LBBW would obtain an opinion from Freshfields. They did not agree (as UBS submits) that LBBW <span style="font-style:italic">needed</span> to get an opinion from Freshfields, merely that LBBW would in fact do so. It is possible that they envisaged that, once LBBW had done so, the topic of validity risk might be revisited but, if they did, that never happened. Each party may have hoped that it had said or done enough to shift the risk onto the other if the point was not raised again. It seems inconceivable, however, that either party thought that the other had actually agreed that it would bear the risk about which they had been arguing in the emails leading up to the 23 August 2006 telephone conversation. If they had, that would have been an important point which would certainly have been confirmed in writing following the conversation.</p>

The question, therefore, is whether this was necessarily implicit in these exchanges. In my judgment it was not. Under the Front Swaps, Depfa was on any view exposing itself to reputational damage if those swaps went wrong, as it would be Depfa who would then have to enforce them and against whom, at least in the first instance, any allegations of invalidity would be likely to be made, as has in fact happened. It was therefore necessary for Depfa to take such steps as it considered appropriate to make itself comfortable with that risk, regardless of the position between UBS and Depfa under the Back Swaps. Consequently the fact that Depfa took such steps, carrying out its own due diligence and obtaining an opinion from Freshfields, did not necessarily mean that in addition to taking reputational risk, it would also have a financial liability to UBS under the Back Swaps if the Front Swaps proved to be invalid. Mr Lancaster and Mr Sanz-Paris accepted that this was so when it was put to them in cross examination. I consider that they were right to do so.</p>

The advantages of such a management agreement, whereby the portfolios would be continuously monitored and prompt action would be taken to minimise the risk of defaults, were emphasised by UBS during the parties' negotiations leading to the initial Balaba transaction, for example at the 9 May 2006 meeting (see [230] above).</p>

Although some of the entities originally included in the Balaba and LBBW STCDO portfolios defaulted, the defaults would not have reached the attachment points of the KWL tranches and there would therefore have been no loss at all to these portfolios. The Depfa STCDO portfolios would have suffered a loss of some US $92 million, although as a matter of fact that is only because of the presence in the initial portfolios of two entities which Mr Dattani was to remove. KWL’s case is that the management of the portfolios by UBS GAM was in breach of its obligations and that, as a result, it is entitled to recover by way of damages from UBS GAM any liability which it may have under the STCDOs either to UBS or to the intermediary banks. KWL pleaded a case that the initial composition of the portfolios was also negligent, but this case was abandoned shortly before the trial. Accordingly this aspect of the case is concerned with the management of the portfolios from the time when the STCDOs were concluded up until about the third quarter of 2008. By that time it is accepted by KWL that world economic conditions meant that it was too late to do much or anything to avoid losses. Once again, this claim will not arise on the findings which I have made, so I will state my reasoning and conclusions as briefly as I can.</p>

Unlike some other investors, KWL had only one interest so far as the management of the portfolios was concerned, and that was to avoid defaults reaching the attachment point of its tranches. It had received its premium upfront and, whatever happened, would not be entitled to any further return. It therefore had no interest in the portfolios being managed to produce an income. It was a long-term investor who would hold the portfolios for the duration of the STCDO (eight years in the case of Balaba and ten years in the other cases) and was therefore not interested in the portfolios being managed for short or medium term trading gains. Its only concern was to avoid defaults which would render it liable to UBS or the other banks on the credit protection which it had sold them. In these respects its interests were rather different from those of other types of investor in STCDOs such as banks trading for their own account (as UBS did during this period, with disastrous results) or hedge funds. What Mr Dattani had to do, therefore, was to focus exclusively on taking steps to minimise the risk of defaults in the portfolios.</p>

It described the way in which UBS GAM would carry out ongoing monitoring of portfolio fundamental and market characteristics, together with “ongoing assessment of impact of different market scenarios on risk/reward profile of different tranches”. This last point was particularly relevant to KWL, whose concern was not with the portfolio as a whole or on the equity or senior tranches, but with the impact of whatever happened on its particular junior mezzanine tranches.</p>

Those standards were as set out in the pitch book. This is important. It means that UBS GAM's obligation was not merely to exercise reasonable care by the standards of a competent portfolio manager, an obligation which would leave some scope for different approaches and strategies to be followed, but to follow the particular conservative strategy described in the pitch book -- specifically, to maximise diversification, minimise risk concentration and avoid what would reasonably be regarded as “big bets” on any particular sector; and to ensure continuous monitoring of potential defaults in order to implement when necessary an early exit strategy. If Mr Dattani failed to follow the strategy described in the pitch book, UBS GAM would necessarily be in breach of its obligations.</p>

Essentially, UBS GAM took a concentrated bet on financials, bond insurers, risky consumer lenders, and banks that were known to have high -- and rising -- levels of leverage before the credit crisis struck. These sectors were all highly correlated with each other. By July 2008 exposure to these sectors had been ramped up to above 40 per cent in all three portfolios. The subsequent defaults as the crisis intensified came from within these sectors and the very high overlap between the portfolios meant that total loss was suffered (or virtually total loss priced in via unwind) across all four STCDOs.’</p>

Far from maximising diversification and minimising concentration of risk, Mr Dattani’s approach had been to concentrate on highly correlated financial entities, bond insurers, risky consumer lenders, and banks that were known to have high and rising levels of leverage.

For example, UBS GAM’s expert, Mr Powell, was able to make the point that many portfolio managers regarded financial entities as low risk and defensive investments compared to (for example) industrial stocks and that this remained the position well into 2008, albeit that some in the market had identified danger signals. He demonstrated also that many of the financial entities held by UBS GAM were also held in other CDO portfolios. Mr Hale too was prepared to say that, by reference to the strategies followed by portfolio managers in general, it was a reasonable strategy to remain concentrated in financial entities at least up to a certain point, after which it would be difficult to reduce that weighting because of the cost in subordination from trading out of financial entities with wide spreads, and that although there was an opportunity to do this in early 2008 after Bear Stearns was rescued by the US Government, some people would have taken the view that financials were still a safe investment.</p>

Whatever may be said about the merits of a concentration in financial stocks as a portfolio management strategy in the 2006-8 period in the abstract, UBS GAM’s contractual obligation was to maximise diversification and avoid what the pitch book described as "big bets" on particular sectors. As noted at [88] above, on at least one occasion, in August 2007, he was reluctant to have a discussion with credit analysts about some of the financial entities in the KWL portfolios when one of his superiors, Mr van Klaveren, suggested that he should in view of the weighting of these entities in his portfolios. (It should nevertheless be made clear that as well as his concentration on financial entities generally, Mr Dattani included within the portfolios not only what might be regarded as mainstream defensive financial names, but also a number of higher risk financial entities, such as Kazakh and Icelandic banks which he himself described as "marginal names").</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears also that he misunderstood the contractual regime within which he was required to work. His evidence was that he was required when substituting Reference Entities into the portfolio to maintain or improve what was called the "Moody's Metric". The Moody’s Metric is an expression of an entity’s rating in numerical form, ranging from 1 for an Aaa-rated entity to 21 for a C-rated entity. The Portfolio Management Agreements contained a provision to the effect that, in short, if a certain Moody’s Metric (the “Hurdle MM”) for the portfolio as a whole was breached, then further substitutions were only permissible if they maintained or improved the Moody’s Metric of the portfolio or if KWL consented to the substitution. However, that provision did not apply unless and until the Hurdle MM was breached. It appears that Mr Dattani did not understand this. He described the Moody’s Metric as the “contractually agreed measure of risk" when it was no such thing, and appears to have believed that all his trades were required to improve the Moody’s Metric and, conversely, that any trade which did improve the Metric was desirable whether or not it increased the risk of defaults.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Dattani’s focus on the rating tended not to give proper weight to the relevance of spreads as a measure of risk. Spreads were more volatile than ratings. If the creditworthiness of any particular name was deteriorating, that would be reflected by the market in an increased spread (although there could also be other reasons why spreads might widen, unrelated to possible default). It might also result in due course in a downgrading of the name's rating, but a downgrading by the rating agency would tend to lag the market by a period of time. Unless both factors were taken into account, the result could be misleading. What might appear to be an attractive spread for a given rating might in reality represent an increasing risk with which the rating agency had not yet caught up. It was therefore important not only to monitor the position of existing names in the portfolios whose spreads were widening in order to ascertain the reason for this occurring, but also to take care when adding a name to the portfolio that a high spread relative to the rating was not a signal of deteriorating credit quality.</p>

This had the effect of improving the Moody’s Metric but increasing risk by reference to spreads, the measure which, particularly in the difficult market of 2007 – 2008, provided the most up-to-date information as to the risks of default.

Rather it appears that such analysis as Mr Dattani carried out consisted of little more than looking at credit analysts’ reports. But the credit analysts were focused on individual names. What was needed was proper analysis of the impact of potential scenarios on the KWL tranches, as described in the pitch book.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As mentioned above, there was one quarter (Q4 2007) when no report at all was provided. It became clear at the trial that the reason for this was to cover up a costly error made by one of Mr Dattani’s staff. What happened was that a trade on 18 October 2007 resulted in the Depfa STCDO portfolio breaching the Hurdle Moody’s Metric due to an error by a subordinate who rated one trade but executed a different one by mistake. Mr Dattani then carried out trades which had the effect of restoring the Moody’s Metric to its level before the mistake occurred. However, in what appears to have been a deliberate decision, no mention was made of any of this to KWL at the time and no quarterly portfolio management report was produced for this period. Nevertheless KWL was left to bear the transaction costs (in the form of reduced subordination) of the trades which had to be carried out as a result of UBS GAM’s own error. Apparently Mr Dattani saw nothing wrong with this, although Mr Richard Slade QC for UBS GAM rightly accepted in closing that this should not have happened. As Mr Dattani rather surprisingly put it:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly, the trades carried out in this period were harmful to KWL. They included the acquisition of Aiful and Takefuji, two Japanese entities which went on to default, an increase of exposure to Lehman Brothers which went on to default, and the acquisition of two further risky exposures (Cemex and Washington Mutual) which went on to default but which UBS GAM managed to remove from the portfolio (albeit at a cost to KWL) before they did so. It is, I suppose, possible that Mr Dattani would have added these entities to the portfolios at some point in any event, but the fact is that both were added in consequence of the October 2007 error.</p>

So if something is going to migrate from investment grade to high yield, and you haven't picked it up at investment grade, by the time it migrates to high yield, it is too late, because it has already widened. So there you make a slightly different -- I wouldn't call it a "bet", but a choice: is the name a default risk?  If it is, then obviously you need to still think about removing it, and if you come to the conclusion that it is default risk, you need to look at where it's trading. And if it's trading very wide, you need to look at what the recovery would be. So there are a series of decisions which are needed to be made in a CDO portfolio which are not required for a cash portfolio.</p>

The significance of the definition is that there is no limit to the number of "Credit Impaired" names (as distinct from other names) which the manager is permitted to trade out of the portfolios. </p>

This was not a point explored in the evidence, either of Mr Dattani or of the experts, and the point made by reference to the table appears directly to contradict the evidence which Mr Dattani not only gave, but confirmed when I checked that I had understood him correctly, as set out above. Since the contractual definition of "Credit Impaired" expressly requires an exercise of judgment by the portfolio manager, some evidence would be required of the nature of the judgments which Mr Dattani made. But there is none. They may have been removed for entirely different reasons. Or they may in some cases have been removed consistently with the strategy which Mr Dattani described.  I am prepared to assume that the names referred to in the UBS GAM table could reasonably have been regarded as credit impaired and were in fact removed from the portfolios. There is support for this in some of the portfolio reports, although these do not show at what stage in their decline the entities in question were removed and this was not addressed in the evidence. However, it does not follow that Mr Dattani was following a strategy of removing names where he foresaw a risk of a future decline. If he was, the evidence which he gave set out above would be very strange. Nor does the fact that some names were removed counter the evidence that his strategy was to concentrate on, not to diversify away from, financial entities.</p>

Mr Hale’s view was that he should have done so from about July 2007, when the credit crunch was having an impact. Mr Powell favoured a later date. But it is not apparent that Mr Dattani ever considered this properly. His quarterly reports continued up to and including the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 to recite the mantra that “we remain cautious and hence overweight sectors which are heavily regulated for capital adequacy purposes”, although reports from about April 2008 added the qualification that while trading out of exposures to financial entities would increase diversity, “spreads in non-financial names do not permit this at this point in time”. This too is inconsistent with any suggestion of an early exit strategy.</p>

Although UBS GAM submits that its management was constrained by the initial composition of the portfolios which had been constructed so as to generate a high upfront premium for KWL, I do not accept that this provides an answer to KWL’s essential complaint that the management approach adopted by Mr Dattani was not as set out in the pitch book, but involved an undue and unnecessary concentration of risk which was not properly monitored as the situation developed. Certainly it was not Mr Dattani’s evidence that he was unable to provide the service to which KWL was entitled. It was Mr Hale’s evidence, which I accept, that there was nothing out of the ordinary about the ratings required by KWL and the spreads on the names included within the initial portfolios in order to generate the premium for KWL which would have rendered management in accordance with the pitch book unduly difficult.</p>

Taken at face value some of these were damning comments, but I have not founded my decision on them.

To illustrate this simply, I consider that Mr Dattani’s inclusion of three Kazakh banks in the Balaba portfolio represented an undue concentration of somewhat exotic risk. However, a prudent manager might well have taken the view that to include one such bank would be acceptable. How is the court to say whether the bank which would properly have been included was the one which went on to default (JSC BTA)? There is currently no evidence which would enable such a decision to be made and, even if the experts were sent away to think about this question, it is unlikely that they could provide a sensible evidence-based view. That difficulty, however, would be multiplied many times over in any attempt to reconstruct a notional carefully managed portfolio. It would be necessary not only to unwind the trades actually carried out by Mr Dattani whereby names which went on to default were added to the portfolios when they should not have been, but also to postulate notional trades which Mr Dattani would or should have carried out instead, for example to remove names which he was anxious to remove. It would be necessary also to take account of the impact of any such trades on the portfolios’ subordination. This would be an impossible exercise. In my judgment the law does not require that it be undertaken.</p>

That is to say that any competent manager should (and on the balance of probabilities would) have done at least as well as if there had been no management at all. Having trumpeted the advantages of portfolio management as a means of minimising the risk, and taken the fees payable for managing the portfolios, UBS can hardly suggest otherwise. The Balaba and LBBW STCDO portfolios would have suffered no loss at all if they had not been managed. In the case of the Depfa portfolios, with no management there would have been a loss of some US $92 million but only as a result of the presence in the original portfolios of two entities which Mr Dattani removed. However, I accept KWL’s submission that if Mr Dattani removed them, the probability is that any competent manager exercising an appropriate standard of care would also have done so. Necessarily this represents something of a broad brush approach, but in my judgment it is realistic and does not involve the making of unduly generous assumptions in favour of KWL (cf. the reservations expressed by Hamblen J in <span style="font-style:italic">Porton Capital Technology Funds v 3M UK Holdings Ltd</span> [2011] EWHC 2895 (Comm) at [237] to [245] concerning earlier cases in which a "generous" approach had been applied).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">UBS is not entitled to enforce the Balaba STCDO. Although KWL had capacity to enter into this STCDO because UBS was not grossly negligent in failing to appreciate the need for prior Supervisory Board approval under KWL’s Articles, KWL was entitled to rescind and has validly rescinded the STCDO on either of two grounds. The first is that although Value Partners was generally the agent of KWL, as a result of the arrangement reached between Mr Bracy of UBS and Value Partners whereby Value Partners would deliver clients to UBS, there was also an agency relationship between UBS and Value Partners. The bribe which Value Partners paid to KWL’s managing director Mr Heininger was paid within the scope of that agency relationship so as to make UBS responsible for it in law. The second ground is that to the knowledge of UBS, Value Partners was subject to a conflict of interest as a result of its dealings with Mr Bracy to which KWL did not give its informed consent. However, KWL’s further claim to be entitled to rescind the Balaba STCDO for fraudulent misrepresentation by UBS fails. UBS did not make the representations which KWL alleges.</p>

Those losses were caused by the fact that the STCDO transactions are unenforceable and have been rescinded as a result of conduct for which UBS is responsible in law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I observed at the outset, neither UBS nor KWL emerges with credit from this saga. For UBS it has been a case study in how not to conduct investment banking in an honest and fair way. It is to be hoped that the events described belong to a bygone era. As most of the main participants have moved on, and many of them are no longer employed in the banking industry, there is room to believe that to be so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For KWL too, it is to be hoped that these events are firmly in the past. It is apparent, however, that for many years KWL was run by a criminal who was able to plunder the company for his personal gain and (at least in some respects) to enlist the support of his fellow managing director in covering his tracks. He was able too to hoodwink the Supervisory Board whose task it was to provide oversight of his activity, but who displayed remarkable complacency when the warning signs were there to be seen.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Heininger’s greed and dishonesty could easily have been catastrophic for KWL. They would have been if it had not been for the fact that the dishonest advisers with whom he was in bed overreached themselves by entering into a corrupt arrangement with a maverick banker at UBS who was allowed far too much autonomy, with a view to ripping off not only KWL but their other clients as well.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Two final observations. First I express my thanks to all counsel and solicitors engaged in this case for the quality of their submissions and the co-operation which ensured the efficient process of the trial. Second I note that the outcome here and in Germany may be said to illustrate that the money and effort expended on jurisdictional disputes are sometimes misdirected. KWL fought hard to resist the jurisdiction of the English court and to have all these issues decided in Germany. There is therefore some irony in the fact that, as events have turned out and although there are good reasons why this is so, it lost the case in Germany against LBBW and has substantially, although not entirely, succeeded here. Litigation is not like football. It is not always an advantage to play at home.</p>
