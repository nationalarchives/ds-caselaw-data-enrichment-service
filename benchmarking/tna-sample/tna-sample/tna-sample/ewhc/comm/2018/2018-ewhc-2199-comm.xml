The Defendants sought to set aside the WFO on a number of grounds, including material non-disclosure, and raised various jurisdiction challenges.  At the conclusion of the hearing I announced my decision that the WFO should be discharged for non-disclosure, and no fresh order granted, and gave reasons.  I reserved judgment in relation to all the issues which I did not address.  This is my full judgment, including amplified reasons in relation to nondisclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in support of which the WFO was granted arise out of what the Claimants contend was a dishonest conspiracy between the First Defendant, Mr dos Santos, the former Chairman of FSDEA, and his friend and business partner, the Second Defendant, Mr Bastos, who is the 95% beneficial owner of the Quantum group of companies which include the Third to Twentieth Defendants.  It is the Claimants’ case that, pursuant to this conspiracy, Mr dos Santos placed some US$5 billion at the disposal of the Quantum group to manage and invest on FSDEA’s behalf, when the Quantum group manifestly lacked the appropriate or any qualifications and experience for such a mandate; that in the event, most of the US$5 billion has not been invested at all and has simply been used by the Quantum group to extract what were described as an extraordinary levels of fees (amounting to some US$406 million); that of the limited proportion which has been invested, the investments have not been made in the interests of the Claimants but have mostly been channelled into other projects belonging to Mr Bastos; and that in addition, as part of the same conspiracy, Mr dos Santos committed FSDEA to pay around US$153 million to the Quantum and other companies controlled by Mr Bastos, under contracts for various purported services, which contracts, if genuine at all, were manifestly uncommercial and were intended mainly to divert money from FSDEA into the pockets of Mr Bastos<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span>without FSDEA receiving anything of remotely commensurate value in return.  The Defendants’ case is that they are the victims of political change in Angola and a desire on the part of those now in power to get their hands on money which the previous regime sensibly and appropriately invested on a long-term basis for the people of Angola; and that the allegations are a spurious and flawed attempt to achieve this political objective.   </p>

Its Chairman from 2012 to May 2013 was Dr Armando Manuel, who had been the Economic Adviser to President dos Santos.  In 2012 its other directors were Mr dos Santos and Mr Gonçalves.  In May 2013 Dr Manuel became the Minister of Finance of Angola, and shortly after FSDEA was renamed in June 2013, Mr dos Santos was appointed Chairman.  Mr Fortunato was at that time appointed a director.  Mr dos Santos remained Chairman until his removal in January 2018.  His fellow directors were Mr Gonçalves and Mr Fortunato until the autumn of 2016, when Mr Gago replaced Mr Fortunato.  Mr Gago had before that acted as Director of the Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 2013 until 2015.  He remains a director of FSDEA.  Mr Gonçalves remained a director of FSDEA until January 2018, since when he has acted as a consultant to it.   There is a dispute as to the degree of involvement that the other directors had in the running of the fund.   </p>

It provided for cash and security accounts to be held in FSDEA’s name.  It did not in terms require the accounts to be at the London branch, although references to the London branch address and UK regulatory standards suggests that that was what was envisaged, and the accounts were in fact established at the London branch.  </p>

The ISAs were governed by Angolan law and provided for arbitration in Luanda, Angola under ICC Rules conducted in the Portuguese language.  Two Consultancy Agreements (“the CAs”) were made with the Sixth Defendant (“QGAI”) in relation to the establishment of two further funds to invest in the hotel sector and in infrastructure projects.  Each of the Limited Partnerships had a management agreement with the Fourth Defendant (“QGIAM”) under which the latter was entitled to an annual management fee of 2% (infrastructure) or 2.5% (other funds) plus in each case 20% above a rate of return of 8%. </p>

Part of FSDEA’s complaint is that it and the Limited Partners had no visibility or control over the monies in those accounts, which were under the control of the General Partners exercising their powers of management in relation to the Limited Partnerships.  Only part of this had been invested by the time of the freezing order.   Approximately US$2.27 billion remained at Northern Trust in liquid form at the time of the WFO, and has been secured.  The balance, apart from deduction of fees, was paid into a number of investment projects of the kind envisaged, including projects controlled by Mr Bastos. For example, it is said that the hotel partnership (the Eighth and Fifteenth Defendants) invested US$157 million in a hotel project in Angola in which Mr Bastos had an interest (although this figure is difficult to reconcile with Table 4 of the EY Report – defined in paragraph 14 below); and the infrastructure partnership (the Seventh and Fourteenth Defendants) invested US$180 million into the Port of Caio in Angola, which Mr Bastos had a concession to develop.  These are said to be stark examples of the conflicts inherent in the appointment of Quantum to manage FSDEA’s funds with Mr Bastos able to dictate the terms of major transactions from both sides of the table. </p>

The Angolan government commissioned a report from Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) regarding the operation of the FSDEA, which was produced on 15 December 2017 (“the E&amp;Y Report”).   Mr dos Santos was removed as Chairman of the FSDEA on 12 January 2018.  Notice of termination of the IMA was given on 16 February 2018 and took effect two months later, on 17 April 2018.  The Liquid Portfolio was put into the hands of a replacement investment manager.  The Claimants brought these proceedings and applied for the WFO on 27 April 2018.  In the light of some of the asset disclosure given by the Defendants pursuant to the WFO, E&amp;Y updated their report on 9 July 2018 (“the Updated E&amp;Y Report”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos benefited at all from any of the arrangements complained of.  Following the termination of the IMA, the Liquid Portfolio has remained within FSDEA’s control.  Although FSDEA’s case is that Quantum was manifestly ill qualified to undertake the investment management role of the Liquid Portfolio, there is not in fact any particularised allegation that QGIM acted negligently in the choice of investments or otherwise in the handling of the Liquid Portfolio during its time as investment manager.  The complaint is not about the performance of the Liquid Portfolio investment, but about the level of fees set contractually under the IMA at 1% plus 20% above the benchmark hurdle, which EY describe in their report as “high given the size of the portfolio”, a relatively slight basis for an allegation of fraud.  The total of such fees over the life of the IMA was US$81.83m according to the Updated E&amp;Y Report.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the argument in respect of the WFO has focussed on the Illiquid Portfolio.   The amount of the Illiquid Portfolio was US$3 billion, but at the time of the WFO some US$2.27 billion remained in the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust in London.  By letters in March 2018 Northern Trust and their solicitors had made clear to the Claimants that they would not deal with those funds without the written instructions of both sides, and would not change their position without giving the Claimants prior notification.  In my view those assurances removed any risk of dissipation in justifying an order freezing that sum, which was more than two thirds of the amount frozen by the WFO.  This was the subject matter of material non-disclosure on the without notice application to Phillips J, to which I return below.  The Updated E&amp;Y Report suggests that a total of US$454m was invested in projects in the seven Mauritian funds, with the balance presumably being accounted for by fees.    </p>

This is not a case in which any of the Defendants are accused of extracting sums to which there was no contractual entitlement.  The thrust of the complaint is the creation by Mr dos Santos of that contractual entitlement.    </p>

The services to be provided by QGIM under the IMA were investment management services which involved determining how the Liquid Portfolio was to be invested in various short-term investments.  That management function was to be, and was, carried out in Switzerland where Quantum had its place of business.  That aspect of its business was regulated and supervised by the Swiss financial authorities, as the preamble to the IMA recorded at paragraph C.  QGIM had no custody of the assets, in London or elsewhere.  The IMA did not identify any place for the receipt of those instructions, which only became London as a result of FSDEA’s choice of custodianship, which might originally have been elsewhere than London and could at any time have been changed to a different location.  On any view, therefore, it cannot be said that the IMA provided for any part of the services to be performed in London.  It is true that QGIM’s investment management in Switzerland in the event resulted in instructions from Switzerland to London to the custodian of the funds in London, but that does not make London the place of performance of the services to be provided under the IMA.  Those services do not consist solely or even primarily of the investment instructions, but rather the investment management activity in determining what investments to make, which took place in Switzerland, as envisaged by the IMA. </p>

However I accept Mr Edey QC’s submission that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly characterised as being in a “matter relating to contract” so that allocation of jurisdiction falls to be determined in accordance with Article 5(1), not Article 5(3); and that accordingly Switzerland is the allocated jurisdiction for the same reason as for the contractual claims under the IMA.  This is because the equitable claim for breach of fiduciary duties depends upon the existence of the IMA: the duties are said to arise by virtue of the relationship created by the IMA.  The Claim Form describes them as “arising by virtue of the IMA and/or the authority thereby vested in QGIM to…handle and otherwise deal with assets belonging to the FSDEA”.

If the obligation arises from the unconscionable disregard of the duties of an agreement, such as those imposed upon a person who has with the agreement of the other party placed himself in a fiduciary relationship with that other, such as an agent to his principal, the matter should be seen as one relating to a contract and the fiduciary aspect of the claim as going only to define or augment the remedies available to the claimant.”   </p>

It is a claim to the property itself, and is only asserted against the holder of the property or one who is in a position to give effect to the proprietary interest.  Accordingly, in the current context the question is whether, assuming that there is a sufficiently arguable case that QGIM holds such property, the claim to enforce the proprietary interest in respect of the property against QGIM falls within Article 5(3).  Mr McGrath QC submitted that the proprietary claim fell within Article 5(3) as being in a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi delict.  Mr Edey submitted that if the proprietary claim passed the threshold merits test of raising a serious issue to be tried, it did not fall within Article 5(3).

Mr Edey submitted that there could be no proprietary claim for property which was transferred pursuant to contracts where those contracts had not been avoided or rescinded.  He accepted that the Claimants retained a beneficial interest in the investments in the Illiquid Portfolio, but submitted that those interests were held on the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreements which were long term contracts (of 10 or 15 years), such that there was no immediate entitlement to possession.  He submitted that property passed in full under the contracts (the IMA and the Limited Partnership Agreements), and unless and until they were avoided there could be no vesting of any equitable interest in the transferor.  Until very shortly before the hearing before me the Claimants had not suggested that the agreements were invalid or had been avoided, and indeed had proceeded on the basis that they remained validly in place.  Mr McGrath sought to argue before me that they were void, alternatively voidable and had been rescinded.  In my view Mr Edey was correct to submit that it was too late to run such an argument, which gave rise to issues of election and affirmation, and to allow the Claimants to do so would have been unfairly prejudicial to the Quantum Defendants, who would have been able to deploy arguments of election and affirmation.  Accordingly the question whether there is a serious issue to be tried that the Claimants have a proprietary claim falls to be addressed on the footing that the sums transferred were paid in accordance with contracts which are not void and have not been rescinded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that footing, Mr McGrath submitted that where a contract split the legal and equitable interests so as to confer a legal title whilst retaining an equitable title, there is no need to rescind or avoid the contract in order for the transferor to assert the equitable proprietary right to the property.  That was, he submitted, the effect of the contractual arrangements in this case because the funds were always invested for benefit of the Claimants who retained an equitable interest throughout; the Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in the name of FSDEA and funds for the Illiquid Portfolio were transferred into the Limited Partnership accounts by instructions from FSDEA to QGIM which expressly purported to retain “ultimate beneficial ownership” in the funds.  This argument does not work for the fees in respect of the Liquid Portfolio, where it was intended by the IMA that legal and beneficial interest in the fees should pass to QGIM.  However, the main issue on this point was whether there was a sufficiently arguable proprietary claim to the sums transferred in the Illiquid Portfolio because the challenge is aimed at the proprietary element of the WFO, which is confined in amount to $3 billion to reflect such transfer. So far as that is concerned I was referred to a number of authorities on each side.  This is an issue which raises difficult questions of law which will have to be applied to the facts once established.  I am inclined to the view that the Claimants have met the relatively low merits threshold of a serious issue to be tried.  However I do not propose to explore the legal issues in this judgment which would fall to be addressed in the light of the fact specific circumstances once established, nor to </p>

The passage relied upon does not support the suggested principle, and the suggested principle is inconsistent with the essence of the tort which is that if lawful means are deployed a conspiracy can only be unlawful if it involves a predominant intention to injure the claimant.  If the predominant intention is to benefit the conspirators, by definition the predominant intention cannot be to injure the claimant, even if such injury is the inevitable result and even if it is intended.  The lawful means conspiracy does not surmount the merits threshold of raising a serious issue to be tried on the facts alleged by the Claimants in this case, which clearly involve an allegation that the alleged conspirators were motivated by a desire to benefit themselves without any animus against the Claimants.   </p>

The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence before me simply did not purport to address the question whether Angolan law recognised a liability based on facts which would in English law establish liability for unlawful means conspiracy or dishonest assistance constructive trust.  Accordingly, even if the appropriate law is Angolan law, the Court proceeds on the evidential assumption that Angolan law does not differ from English law in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is not a case where fragmentation can be avoided.  The starting point is that there are arbitrations in Mauritius which involve the disputes between the Limited Partners and the General Partners in relation to the Illiquid Portfolio, to which the Limited Partnerships are arguably properly joined parties.  There are also winding up proceedings commenced by the Limited Partners in Mauritius which will raise some of the issues which arise in these proceedings.  There is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention over certain of the claims against QGIM (D3) and over the proprietary claim against QGAI (D6), who must be sued in Switzerland; and in any event, even were jurisdiction otherwise to be established, any claims by FSDEA against QGIM would have to be stayed in favour of arbitration in Portugal.  It is FSDEA’s case that the IMA (and therefore its arbitration clause) governs the Illiquid as well as the Liquid Portfolio.  Accordingly, on the Claimants’ case, all the tortious and contractual claims by FSDEA against QGIM will have to be dealt with in that arbitration.  On any view, and even if the arbitration is confined to the issues in relation to the Liquid Portfolio, that will involve an examination of the circumstances in which the Quantum group came to be appointed, which raises many of the issues at the heart of the dispute in these proceedings.    </p>

These allegations of breach are of what occurred in Angola and are clearly more suitably tried in Angola, not only because they are governed by Angolan law, but also because the Public Probity Law imposes duties expressed in terms of generality which take their content from their Angolan context.    Article 3 provides: that “<span style="font-style:italic">Public agents should, in performance of their duties, be guided by the following principles: (a) principle of legality (b) principle of public probity (c) principle of competence (d) principle of respect for public property (e) principle of impartiality (f) principle of the pursuit of public interest….(j) principle of prudence (k) principle of loyalty to public institutions and entities and to the higher interests of the State.</span>”  The subsequent articles develop these principles, again using language of some generality (e.g. “<span style="font-style:italic">the highest criteria for public professionalism</span>”).  These duties are properly to be interpreted in accordance with the cultural standards and norms of Angolan public life at the time, which is clearly a matter on which the Angolan court is better equipped than the English Court. </p>

Under the IMA, FSDEA could have chosen to establish the custodian accounts at any bank anywhere, for example in New York.  The funds were dollar denominated and the Liquid Portfolio was invested in a range of international securities in the usual way.  The centre of gravity for the allegations in relation to investment of the Illiquid Portfolio is not in London, from where the funds were to be transferred to be invested in projects, but in the places where the events giving rise to the complaints arises: Switzerland for the decision to set up Mauritian limited partnerships and Angola or elsewhere in Africa in relation to investment in projects where a conflict of interest is complained of.  The fact that a London branch of a US Bank was chosen by FSDEA as the place of custody is of no significance to the issues in the case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points which are relevant to the current applications deserve emphasis.   The importance of the duty has often been emphasised in the authorities.  It is necessary to enable the Court to fulfil its own obligations to ensure fair process under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the necessary corollary of the Court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, which is a basic principle of fairness.  Derogation from that basic principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy.  If the court is to adopt that procedure where justice so requires, it must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the evidence and argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests, but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make.  It is a duty owed to the court which exists in order to ensure the integrity of the court’s process.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that although the principle is often expressed in terms of a duty of disclosure, the ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation of the application is fair in all material respects: see Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Memory Corporation v Sidhu</span> (No 2) [2000] 1 WLR1443, citing formulations from, amongst others, Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bank Mellat v Nikpour</span> [1985] FSR 87, 92, Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Siporex Trade v Comdel Commodities</span> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428, 437 and Carnwath J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Marc Rich &amp; Co Holding v Krasner</span> (18 December 1998).  This is again the consequence of the exceptional derogation from the principle of hearing both sides.  The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided.   In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case.  The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one.  He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument.  It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the duty is not confined to the applicant’s legal advisers but is a duty which rests upon the applicant itself.   It is the duty of the legal team to ensure that the lay client is aware of the duty of full and frank disclosure and what it means in practice for the purposes of the application in question; and to exercise a degree of supervision in ensuring that the duty is discharged.   No doubt in some cases this is a difficult task, particularly with clients from different legal and cultural backgrounds and with varying levels of sophistication.  But it is important that the lay client should understand and discharge the duty of full and frank disclosure, because often it will only be the client who is aware of everything which is material.  The responsibility of the applicant’s lawyers in this respect is a heavy one, commensurate with the importance which is attached to the duty itself.  It may be likened to the duties of solicitors in relation to disclosure of documents (see CPR PD31A and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedrich v Standard Bank London Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 905). </p>

Moreover, Mr Morris did not draw attention to the fact, as he should have done, that the August 2012 contract and December 2012 addendum were each signed not by Mr dos Santos but by Dr Manuel.   The sub-paragraph also made an unfortunate error in referring to the fees under the addendum contract as being $44 million for 6 months, amounting to $264 million.  That would indeed have been breathtaking, to use the epithet applied to fees in the Claimants’ skeleton argument, but was wrong: the fees were $44,000 monthly, giving a total of $264,000 for 6 months. </p>

The false impression is reinforced by the assertion at para 31 of the E&amp;Y report that no proposals were requested from any of the four potential managers, i.e. including Quantum, which implied that there had never been a formal proposal from Quantum.  </p>

However it seems likely that the existence of the prior appointment, the 2012 IMA other appointments, and the 2012 proposals were known to those at FSDEA with conduct of the case; and to Mr Gonçalves who was on the Board throughout the period, remains an adviser to FSDEA and who provided a witness statement subsequently; I say he was on the board throughout the relevant period because although in his own statement he describes himself as being on the board from October 2012, Mr Morris in his fifth affidavit says he was on the board from March 2012; and Mr Gonçalves refers to seeing one of the presentations in May 2012 at paragraph 26 of his subsequent witness statement; it seems likely that the circumstances of the 2012 appointment and presentations were known also to Mr Gago, working in a role equivalent to company secretary from late 2013 and on the board from 2016, from whom Mr Morris did take instructions at the time of the without notice application; I say that because Mr Gago records in his witness statement that he was told about how the Petroleum Fund had operated in 2012 by Dr Manuel and Mr Gonçalves and gives evidence about it.  At the least, the circumstances of the 2012 presentations and appointments are matters which reasonable enquiries should have revealed.  The 27 September 2013 letter should have been identified and disclosed. </p>

FSDEA granted a waiver in relation to the disclosed projects and conflicts dealt with in accordance with the policy.  The disclosure included a hotel project in Luanda in which $157m had been invested which was the subject matter of particular criticism by Mr Morris in his first affidavit.

Mr Morris says that he and the team preparing the application were unaware of it because it was part of a set of over 750 documents which his firm held as a result of their involvement in Project Rainbow, not all of which had been reviewed.   Mr McGrath accepted that the letter ought to have been disclosed had Norton Rose Fulbright been aware of it, but sought to excuse its non-disclosure on the grounds that it was reasonable for Mr Morris to have remained unaware of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept that submission.  Given the gravity of the allegations and size of the freezing order being sought, it was incumbent on Norton Rose Fulbright to devote sufficient resources to examining all the documents it held which might contain relevant material, so that it could be satisfied that it could fulfil the duty to make a fair presentation if a without notice application was to be made.  The Project Rainbow material fell within this category, and its size provides no excuse for a failure to consider it all unless constraints of time or expense made this impossible.  Neither applies in this case.  This is especially so in circumstances in which Project Rainbow material was relied on by Mr Morris to make criticisms of Quantum: if it was interrogated for that purpose it should have been fully interrogated.   In any event Mr Fortunato was obviously aware of the letter, as a countersignatory, and reasonable inquiries would have extended to all the board members in place at the relevant times, including Mr Fortunato, who it is apparent from Mr Morris’ fifth witness statement was available to assist with the evidence on the application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a failure to present the stance of Northern Trust fully or fairly.  By letters of 23 February 2018 and 4 March 2018, Northern Trust made clear to FSDEA that it would not for the time being take any action to allow movement of funds from the accounts without joint and express written instructions from both FSDEA and Quantum and that it would give prior notification if it intended to change that position.  In a letter of 16 March 2018 from Northern Trust’s solicitors, largely addressed to requests for disclosure, Northern Trust reiterated that there would be no change of position without prior notification.  The first two letters were referred to in a narrative section of Mr Morris’ Affidavit but were not identified in the section on risk of dissipation, were not referred to in the skeleton argument and were not drawn to the judge’s attention.  The latter was referred to in the narrative at paragraph 147 only in respect of disclosure of documents, but was referred to at paragraph 190 of Mr Morris’ first affidavit and in the Claimants’ skeleton at 109(3) in sections addressing the risk of dissipation.  In each case the letter was referred to by treating Northern Trust’s statement that it would give prior notice as no more than a then current intention which might change without any prior warning because Northern Trust might feel obliged to follow Quantum’s instructions.  This was to mischaracterise the correspondence as a whole, which suggested that Northern Trust were caught between conflicting claims and would not take steps without the agreement of both parties.  Had the Judge been shown the correspondence, or had it fairly summarised, he would likely have concluded that there was no real risk of dissipation of any of the $2.2 billion held at Northern Trust, and in any event not without the Claimants being given sufficient advance notification to afford an opportunity to come before the Court again in those changed circumstances if necessary.  That is my view, with the result that in respect of this aspect of nondisclosure, the Claimants have not made out a case of risk of dissipation in respect of over two thirds of the amount covered by the Freezing Order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This last paragraph reflects what I said on this issue when giving judgment on the nondisclosure points at the conclusion of the hearing.  Since then, on 9 August 2018 Mr Morris wrote to the court enclosing a seventh affidavit in which he explains that there were without prejudice communications with Northern Trust in March 2018.  He had not consulted his notes when making his first affidavit, but had gone back to them in the light of the non-disclosure arguments at the hearing before me, and was now able to tell the court, having secured a limited waiver of privilege for this purpose, that in those discussions Northern Trust had “made observations with regard to the prospect, at or around the time of preparation of [Mr Morris’ first affidavit] of [Northern Trust] making a stakeholder application under Part 86 of the Civil Procedure Rules” (which it is now known was an application which was in fact prepared and about to be issued at the time of the WFO, which overtook it).  As Mr Morris fairly accepts, this confirms that what he said about Northern Trust’s stance in paragraph 190 misled the Court as to the level of risk that Northern Trust might pay out from the Limited Partnership accounts without notice.  It is regrettable, to say the least, that this matter was only drawn to the court’s attention after the hearing and after I had announced my decision in relation to non-disclosure.   </p>

None are of sufficient significance to warrant separate consideration, save one.  In the skeleton argument put before Phillips J on the without notice application, it was said that no proprietary injunction was sought against Mr dos Santos or Mr Bastos.  In fact such an order was sought in paragraph 5(5) of the draft order put before the Judge, and such an order was made by him.  Mr McGrath has apologised for this mistake (the mistake being in the skeleton, not in the order sought), and submitted that because the Judge had clearly read the order with care he was not misled and appreciated that such an order was in fact being sought against Mr dos Santos and Mr Bastos.  Had there been no room for argument that a proprietary order was justified against Mr dos Santos and Mr Bastos personally this error might have assumed less significance.

The court will take into account the importance of the matters which were not disclosed, the nature and degree of culpability, and the adverse consequences to a claimant of losing protection against a risk of dissipation of assets.  It is not sufficient to justify regranting the order that it would be justified had the material matters been disclosed and a fair presentation made, because one important factor in weighing the interests of justice is the penal element of the sanction, which it is in the public interest to apply in order to promote the efficacy of the rule by encouraging others to comply.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the breaches taken cumulatively are serious and substantial.  They do not relate to a few, merely peripheral, matters, but to numerous matters at the heart of the Claimants’ case.  The Court was being asked to infer a dishonest conspiracy by which Mr dos Santos sought improperly to benefit his friend and associate Mr Bastos, and a consequent risk of dissipation, from four central allegations, namely (1) that Mr dos Santos was solely responsible for appointing Quantum without any proper selection process; (2) that Quantum was not properly qualified for the task; (3) the extraordinarily high and unjustified level of fees charged; and (4) the funds being used to benefit entities owned by or associated with Mr Bastos involving an undisclosed and inappropriate conflict of interest.  The non-disclosures go to one or more of these central elements of the Claimants’ case.  Proper disclosure would have put a very different complexion on the application, and it is no answer for the Claimants to say that the subsequent evidence put before the court to deal with them raises disputes which are sufficient to surmount the merits hurdle of a good arguable case.   Occasional errors in preparing the material in a case of this size and complexity can perhaps be understood.  But the unfair presentation in this case in the respects I have identified goes far beyond the odd accidental slip, and goes to the central elements of the case alleging dishonesty in support of a US$3 billion freezing order and proprietary order.  There was no urgent timescale in preparing the application, which was not precipitated, as sometimes happens, by an imminent threat of movement of funds.  The matter had obviously been under consideration for many months, at least since the E&amp;Y Report in December 2017 and Mr dos Santos’ dismissal in January 2018.  The application evidence must have been weeks in the preparation.  There is no suggestion that there was any restriction on the funding available to Norton Rose Fulbright to use a large team to make the necessary inquiries and to consider all the documents available.  Given the size of the freezing order sought, and the allegations of dishonesty being made, it was incumbent on the Claimants and their legal advisers to make the fullest inquiry into the central elements of their case if they were to proceed without notice.  Although Mr Morris emphasised in his first affidavit the limits on the inquiries which had been made by his firm, that does not excuse a failure to make the necessary inquiries or the presentation of incomplete material in an unfairly one-sided way.  </p>

I do not find that there was any deliberate breach on the part of the Claimants’ legal team.  It is less clear whether that is so of the personnel at FSDEA itself.  Some, at least, of the material would have been readily available to anyone in a senior position and the necessity to disclose it obvious to anyone aware of the duty of disclosure.  Because privilege attaches to communications between Norton Rose Fulbright and their clients, it is impossible to identify whether any individual was aware of the duty and deliberately failed to comply with it.  What can be said, however, is that the failures were serious and should not have occurred had the duty been properly understood and complied with by the Claimants themselves.  There was therefore a high degree of culpability in the failures, even though I do not find that anyone deliberately set out to abuse the court’s process.   </p>

I should make clear, however, that I would reach the same conclusion even if satisfied of a risk of dissipation, as was implicit in my decision announced at the conclusion of the hearing. The breaches of duty are sufficiently serious and culpable to warrant discharging the WFO and not granting fresh relief, irrespective of the other grounds of challenge.   </p>

A freezing order is not intended to stop a corporate defendant from dealing with its assets in the normal course of its business.  Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.  If the defendant is not threatening to change the existing way of handling their assets, it will not be sufficient to show that such continued conduct would prejudice the claimant’s ability to enforce a judgment.

The accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support such an inference: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos received anything from the investments of the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio, whether by receipt of part of the fees or otherwise.  There is no evidence to suggest that he has any control over the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio.  There is no suggestion or evidence that he has used offshore structures to hold or deal with his own assets.  There is no evidence of any change of behaviour in any way by Mr dos Santos as a result of the investigations into the transactions in question, of which Mr dos Santos was likely aware for at least several months prior to the without notice application, having been dismissed on 12 January 2018.  Nor is there any evidence that he conducted his affairs any differently in the politically changed environment after the summer of 2017 when his father stepped down as President.  The allegation of a risk of dissipation by him is no more than mere assertion unsupported by any solid evidence.  There was some suggestion in Mr Morris’ evidence that his asset disclosure pursuant to the WFO was incomplete so as to support such an inference, but his solicitor’s letter of 10 July 2018 adequately addresses the points made and leaves no evidence on which the court could conclude that his asset disclosure is incomplete or inadequate.   </p>

Again, the accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support an inference of a sufficient risk of dissipation: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  The particular facts of Mr Bastos’ criminal conviction many years ago, for which he ultimately was fined CHF4,500, do not support the inference of a current risk of dissipation.  There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by The Quantum group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way in the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons.  There is no evidence to suggest that the fact or threat of either the claim itself, or the freezing order, has caused or would cause any of them to act in a way which differed from their previous practice so as to make any adverse effect on the claimants’ ability to enforce a judgment something which could properly be characterised as “unjustified”.  This applies with equal force to the Mauritian Limited Partnerships: the evidence is that such  structures are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&amp;Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective explained at the time by Mr dos Santos to Mr Gonçalves (see above).   The Liquid Portfolio and the majority of the Illiquid Portfolio are secured without the need for a freezing order.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that Mr Bastos or the relevant Quantum Defendants intend to deal with the monies invested in the projects or the projects themselves otherwise than by way of promotion of the success of those projects.  There is no suggestion that Mr Bastos or the Quantum Defendants have taken any sums other than those to which there is a contractual entitlement; nor that they have dealt with them otherwise than in accordance with those contractual arrangements.  The complaint about the execution of those contractual arrangements does not support a risk of dissipation.  As the Claimants’ skeleton argument itself put it, this is not a routine case of “hands in the till” type fraud. </p>

Whilst the dilatory nature of that disclosure is properly the subject of criticism, full purported compliance has taken place, and there is a hotly contested issue whether there has been any failure to give a full and accurate account of the defendants’ assets.  It is not clear from the evidence ultimately put before me on the point that there has been any failure to attempt full compliance in a way which would provide any support for a finding of a risk of dissipation.  </p>

There is no evidence to suggest that Mr dos Santos has, or has ever had, any sums to which a proprietary claim could attach.  So far as Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants are concerned, I have said that I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the Claimants have established a serious issue to be tried, but the contrary is plainly arguable and a proprietary claim may well not be capable of being established.  There is no real evidential basis for concluding that the funds in the Illiquid Portfolio which have been invested in projects have not been well invested, or that in the absence of an injunction they would not continue to be managed so as to promote their profitability.  The adverse effects of the proprietary order on Mr Bastos himself appear to have been serious: he has been unable to say with certainty that any of his assets can be divorced from those received ultimately from FSDEA because his modus operandi has always been to take income through his corporate vehicles from the Quantum group as dividends so that funds have inevitably become mixed.  The effect of the proprietary injunction is therefore effectively to prevent Mr Bastos having access to any funds other than the permitted living allowance.     </p>

Leaving aside the payment of fees, the investment of those funds was for the benefit of the Claimants who retain their equitable interest in the assets, as is and has always been common ground.  In fact, over $2.2 billion remains uninvested in accounts at Northern Trust which are sufficiently secured for the time being.  Accordingly, any present quantification of the loss is limited to (1) the fees taken by the Quantum Defendants and other Bastos related companies and (2) such loss as could be established by reference to the value of the projects in which investments have been made.  In relation to the fees there is an argument that the amount of loss is not the full amount of the fees but only the amount by which they exceeded what would have been charged by another investment manager or service provider in any event.  I have already dealt under the heading of nondisclosure with the failure fairly to address the position of Northern Trust, which itself meant that a freezing order could not be justified in the sum of US$3 billion or anything like it.  In the light of my other conclusions, it is not necessary for me to determine what, if anything, had been established as a sufficiently arguable quantum of loss for the purposes of identifying the proper amount of any freezing order or proprietary injuntion. </p>

The Defendants sought to set aside the WFO on a number of grounds, including material non-disclosure, and raised various jurisdiction challenges.  At the conclusion of the hearing I announced my decision that the WFO should be discharged for non-disclosure, and no fresh order granted, and gave reasons.  I reserved judgment in relation to all the issues which I did not address.  This is my full judgment, including amplified reasons in relation to nondisclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in support of which the WFO was granted arise out of what the Claimants contend was a dishonest conspiracy between the First Defendant, Mr dos Santos, the former Chairman of FSDEA, and his friend and business partner, the Second Defendant, Mr Bastos, who is the 95% beneficial owner of the Quantum group of companies which include the Third to Twentieth Defendants.  It is the Claimants’ case that, pursuant to this conspiracy, Mr dos Santos placed some US$5 billion at the disposal of the Quantum group to manage and invest on FSDEA’s behalf, when the Quantum group manifestly lacked the appropriate or any qualifications and experience for such a mandate; that in the event, most of the US$5 billion has not been invested at all and has simply been used by the Quantum group to extract what were described as an extraordinary levels of fees (amounting to some US$406 million); that of the limited proportion which has been invested, the investments have not been made in the interests of the Claimants but have mostly been channelled into other projects belonging to Mr Bastos; and that in addition, as part of the same conspiracy, Mr dos Santos committed FSDEA to pay around US$153 million to the Quantum and other companies controlled by Mr Bastos, under contracts for various purported services, which contracts, if genuine at all, were manifestly uncommercial and were intended mainly to divert money from FSDEA into the pockets of Mr Bastos<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span>without FSDEA receiving anything of remotely commensurate value in return.  The Defendants’ case is that they are the victims of political change in Angola and a desire on the part of those now in power to get their hands on money which the previous regime sensibly and appropriately invested on a long-term basis for the people of Angola; and that the allegations are a spurious and flawed attempt to achieve this political objective.   </p>

Part of FSDEA’s complaint is that it and the Limited Partners had no visibility or control over the monies in those accounts, which were under the control of the General Partners exercising their powers of management in relation to the Limited Partnerships.  Only part of this had been invested by the time of the freezing order.   Approximately US$2.27 billion remained at Northern Trust in liquid form at the time of the WFO, and has been secured.  The balance, apart from deduction of fees, was paid into a number of investment projects of the kind envisaged, including projects controlled by Mr Bastos. For example, it is said that the hotel partnership (the Eighth and Fifteenth Defendants) invested US$157 million in a hotel project in Angola in which Mr Bastos had an interest (although this figure is difficult to reconcile with Table 4 of the EY Report – defined in paragraph 14 below); and the infrastructure partnership (the Seventh and Fourteenth Defendants) invested US$180 million into the Port of Caio in Angola, which Mr Bastos had a concession to develop.  These are said to be stark examples of the conflicts inherent in the appointment of Quantum to manage FSDEA’s funds with Mr Bastos able to dictate the terms of major transactions from both sides of the table. </p>

Following the termination of the IMA, the Liquid Portfolio has remained within FSDEA’s control.  Although FSDEA’s case is that Quantum was manifestly ill qualified to undertake the investment management role of the Liquid Portfolio, there is not in fact any particularised allegation that QGIM acted negligently in the choice of investments or otherwise in the handling of the Liquid Portfolio during its time as investment manager.  The complaint is not about the performance of the Liquid Portfolio investment, but about the level of fees set contractually under the IMA at 1% plus 20% above the benchmark hurdle, which EY describe in their report as “high given the size of the portfolio”, a relatively slight basis for an allegation of fraud.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the argument in respect of the WFO has focussed on the Illiquid Portfolio.   The amount of the Illiquid Portfolio was US$3 billion, but at the time of the WFO some US$2.27 billion remained in the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust in London.  By letters in March 2018 Northern Trust and their solicitors had made clear to the Claimants that they would not deal with those funds without the written instructions of both sides, and would not change their position without giving the Claimants prior notification.  In my view those assurances removed any risk of dissipation in justifying an order freezing that sum, which was more than two thirds of the amount frozen by the WFO.  This was the subject matter of material non-disclosure on the without notice application to Phillips J, to which I return below.  The Updated E&amp;Y Report suggests that a total of US$454m was invested in projects in the seven Mauritian funds, with the balance presumably being accounted for by fees.    </p>

The question therefore is where the services were, and were to be, provided by QGIM under the IMA.   FSDEA contends that this is London where the Northern Trust accounts were held.  I am unable to accept this submission.  The services to be provided by QGIM under the IMA were investment management services which involved determining how the Liquid Portfolio was to be invested in various short-term investments.  That management function was to be, and was, carried out in Switzerland where Quantum had its place of business.  That aspect of its business was regulated and supervised by the Swiss financial authorities, as the preamble to the IMA recorded at paragraph C.  QGIM had no custody of the assets, in London or elsewhere.  The IMA did not identify any place for the receipt of those instructions, which only became London as a result of FSDEA’s choice of custodianship, which might originally have been elsewhere than London and could at any time have been changed to a different location.  On any view, therefore, it cannot be said that the IMA provided for any part of the services to be performed in London.  It is true that QGIM’s investment management in Switzerland in the event resulted in instructions from Switzerland to London to the custodian of the funds in London, but that does not make London the place of performance of the services to be provided under the IMA.  Those services do not consist solely or even primarily of the investment instructions, but rather the investment management activity in determining what investments to make, which took place in Switzerland, as envisaged by the IMA. </p>

However I accept Mr Edey QC’s submission that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly characterised as being in a “matter relating to contract” so that allocation of jurisdiction falls to be determined in accordance with Article 5(1), not Article 5(3); and that accordingly Switzerland is the allocated jurisdiction for the same reason as for the contractual claims under the IMA.  This is because the equitable claim for breach of fiduciary duties depends upon the existence of the IMA: the duties are said to arise by virtue of the relationship created by the IMA.  The Claim Form describes them as “arising by virtue of the IMA and/or the authority thereby vested in QGIM to…handle and otherwise deal with assets belonging to the FSDEA”.

If the obligation arises from the unconscionable disregard of the duties of an agreement, such as those imposed upon a person who has with the agreement of the other party placed himself in a fiduciary relationship with that other, such as an agent to his principal, the matter should be seen as one relating to a contract and the fiduciary aspect of the claim as going only to define or augment the remedies available to the claimant.”   </p>

It is a claim to the property itself, and is only asserted against the holder of the property or one who is in a position to give effect to the proprietary interest.  Accordingly, in the current context the question is whether, assuming that there is a sufficiently arguable case that QGIM holds such property, the claim to enforce the proprietary interest in respect of the property against QGIM falls within Article 5(3).  Mr McGrath QC submitted that the proprietary claim fell within Article 5(3) as being in a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi delict.  Mr Edey submitted that if the proprietary claim passed the threshold merits test of raising a serious issue to be tried, it did not fall within Article 5(3).  He submitted that it was clear from <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kalfelis v Bankhaus Schröder</span> 189/87 [1988] ECR 5565 and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Glasgow City Council</span> [1999] 1 AC 153 that Article 5(3) only covered claims which gave rise to a personal liability.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>This submission is in my view well founded.  The proprietary claim has nothing to do with any personal liability on the part of QGIM; it is a claim to property insofar as it remains in the hands of QGIM irrespective of fault; it is not based on a constructive trust (which would give rise to a claim falling within Art 5(3): see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Casio Computer Co Ltd v S </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 661<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Dexter v Harley</span> [2001] All ER (D) 79) because dishonest assistance constructive trust claims are not proprietary: see per Lord Millett in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Paragon Finance Plc v D B Thackerar &amp; Co </span>[1999] 1 All ER 400 at p. 409e-g.    </p>

Mr Edey submitted that there could be no proprietary claim for property which was transferred pursuant to contracts where those contracts had not been avoided or rescinded.  He accepted that the Claimants retained a beneficial interest in the investments in the Illiquid Portfolio, but submitted that those interests were held on the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreements which were long term contracts (of 10 or 15 years), such that there was no immediate entitlement to possession.  He submitted that property passed in full under the contracts (the IMA and the Limited Partnership Agreements), and unless and until they were avoided there could be no vesting of any equitable interest in the transferor.  Until very shortly before the hearing before me the Claimants had not suggested that the agreements were invalid or had been avoided, and indeed had proceeded on the basis that they remained validly in place.  Mr McGrath sought to argue before me that they were void, alternatively voidable and had been rescinded.  In my view Mr Edey was correct to submit that it was too late to run such an argument, which gave rise to issues of election and affirmation, and to allow the Claimants to do so would have been unfairly prejudicial to the Quantum Defendants, who would have been able to deploy arguments of election and affirmation.  Accordingly the question whether there is a serious issue to be tried that the Claimants have a proprietary claim falls to be addressed on the footing that the sums transferred were paid in accordance with contracts which are not void and have not been rescinded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that footing, Mr McGrath submitted that where a contract split the legal and equitable interests so as to confer a legal title whilst retaining an equitable title, there is no need to rescind or avoid the contract in order for the transferor to assert the equitable proprietary right to the property.  That was, he submitted, the effect of the contractual arrangements in this case because the funds were always invested for benefit of the Claimants who retained an equitable interest throughout; the Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in the name of FSDEA and funds for the Illiquid Portfolio were transferred into the Limited Partnership accounts by instructions from FSDEA to QGIM which expressly purported to retain “ultimate beneficial ownership” in the funds.  This argument does not work for the fees in respect of the Liquid Portfolio, where it was intended by the IMA that legal and beneficial interest in the fees should pass to QGIM.  However, the main issue on this point was whether there was a sufficiently arguable proprietary claim to the sums transferred in the Illiquid Portfolio because the challenge is aimed at the proprietary element of the WFO, which is confined in amount to $3 billion to reflect such transfer. So far as that is concerned I was referred to a number of authorities on each side.  This is an issue which raises difficult questions of law which will have to be applied to the facts once established.  I am inclined to the view that the Claimants have met the relatively low merits threshold of a serious issue to be tried.  However I do not propose to explore the legal issues in this judgment which would fall to be addressed in the light of the fact specific circumstances once established, nor to </p>

The passage relied upon does not support the suggested principle, and the suggested principle is inconsistent with the essence of the tort which is that if lawful means are deployed a conspiracy can only be unlawful if it involves a predominant intention to injure the claimant.  If the predominant intention is to benefit the conspirators, by definition the predominant intention cannot be to injure the claimant, even if such injury is the inevitable result and even if it is intended.  The lawful means conspiracy does not surmount the merits threshold of raising a serious issue to be tried on the facts alleged by the Claimants in this case, which clearly involve an allegation that the alleged conspirators were motivated by a desire to benefit themselves without any animus against the Claimants.   </p>

He submitted that under Article 4 of the Rome II Convention the question was governed by Angolan Law; and that there was no evidence that Angolan law recognised such causes of action.  The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence before me simply did not purport to address the question whether Angolan law recognised a liability based on facts which would in English law establish liability for unlawful means conspiracy or dishonest assistance constructive trust.  Accordingly, even if the appropriate law is Angolan law, the Court proceeds on the evidential assumption that Angolan law does not differ from English law in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is not a case where fragmentation can be avoided.  The starting point is that there are arbitrations in Mauritius which involve the disputes between the Limited Partners and the General Partners in relation to the Illiquid Portfolio, to which the Limited Partnerships are arguably properly joined parties.  There are also winding up proceedings commenced by the Limited Partners in Mauritius which will raise some of the issues which arise in these proceedings.  There is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention over certain of the claims against QGIM (D3) and over the proprietary claim against QGAI (D6), who must be sued in Switzerland; and in any event, even were jurisdiction otherwise to be established, any claims by FSDEA against QGIM would have to be stayed in favour of arbitration in Portugal.  It is FSDEA’s case that the IMA (and therefore its arbitration clause) governs the Illiquid as well as the Liquid Portfolio.  Accordingly, on the Claimants’ case, all the tortious and contractual claims by FSDEA against QGIM will have to be dealt with in that arbitration.  On any view, and even if the arbitration is confined to the issues in relation to the Liquid Portfolio, that will involve an examination of the circumstances in which the Quantum group came to be appointed, which raises many of the issues at the heart of the dispute in these proceedings.    </p>

Article 3 provides: that “<span style="font-style:italic">Public agents should, in performance of their duties, be guided by the following principles: (a) principle of legality (b) principle of public probity (c) principle of competence (d) principle of respect for public property (e) principle of impartiality (f) principle of the pursuit of public interest….(j) principle of prudence (k) principle of loyalty to public institutions and entities and to the higher interests of the State.</span>”  The subsequent articles develop these principles, again using language of some generality (e.g. “<span style="font-style:italic">the highest criteria for public professionalism</span>”).  These duties are properly to be interpreted in accordance with the cultural standards and norms of Angolan public life at the time, which is clearly a matter on which the Angolan court is better equipped than the English Court. </p>

Under the IMA, FSDEA could have chosen to establish the custodian accounts at any bank anywhere, for example in New York.  The funds were dollar denominated and the Liquid Portfolio was invested in a range of international securities in the usual way.  The centre of gravity for the allegations in relation to investment of the Illiquid Portfolio is not in London, from where the funds were to be transferred to be invested in projects, but in the places where the events giving rise to the complaints arises: Switzerland for the decision to set up Mauritian limited partnerships and Angola or elsewhere in Africa in relation to investment in projects where a conflict of interest is complained of.  The fact that a London branch of a US Bank was chosen by FSDEA as the place of custody is of no significance to the issues in the case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points which are relevant to the current applications deserve emphasis.   The importance of the duty has often been emphasised in the authorities.  It is necessary to enable the Court to fulfil its own obligations to ensure fair process under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the necessary corollary of the Court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, which is a basic principle of fairness.  Derogation from that basic principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy.  If the court is to adopt that procedure where justice so requires, it must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the evidence and argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests, but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make.  It is a duty owed to the court which exists in order to ensure the integrity of the court’s process.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that although the principle is often expressed in terms of a duty of disclosure, the ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation of the application is fair in all material respects: see Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Memory Corporation v Sidhu</span> (No 2) [2000] 1 WLR1443, citing formulations from, amongst others, Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bank Mellat v Nikpour</span> [1985] FSR 87, 92, Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Siporex Trade v Comdel Commodities</span> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428, 437 and Carnwath J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Marc Rich &amp; Co Holding v Krasner</span> (18 December 1998).  This is again the consequence of the exceptional derogation from the principle of hearing both sides.  The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided.   In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case.  The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one.  He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument.  It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the duty is not confined to the applicant’s legal advisers but is a duty which rests upon the applicant itself.   It is the duty of the legal team to ensure that the lay client is aware of the duty of full and frank disclosure and what it means in practice for the purposes of the application in question; and to exercise a degree of supervision in ensuring that the duty is discharged.   No doubt in some cases this is a difficult task, particularly with clients from different legal and cultural backgrounds and with varying levels of sophistication.  But it is important that the lay client should understand and discharge the duty of full and frank disclosure, because often it will only be the client who is aware of everything which is material.  The responsibility of the applicant’s lawyers in this respect is a heavy one, commensurate with the importance which is attached to the duty itself.  It may be likened to the duties of solicitors in relation to disclosure of documents (see CPR PD31A and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedrich v Standard Bank London Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 905). </p>

It contained a detailed investment strategy and identified the key terms of the proposed commitment and fee structure.

Moreover, Mr Morris did not draw attention to the fact, as he should have done, that the August 2012 contract and December 2012 addendum were each signed not by Mr dos Santos but by Dr Manuel.   The sub-paragraph also made an unfortunate error in referring to the fees under the addendum contract as being $44 million for 6 months, amounting to $264 million.  That would indeed have been breathtaking, to use the epithet applied to fees in the Claimants’ skeleton argument, but was wrong: the fees were $44,000 monthly, giving a total of $264,000 for 6 months. </p>

The false impression is reinforced by the assertion at para 31 of the E&amp;Y report that no proposals were requested from any of the four potential managers, i.e. including Quantum, which implied that there had never been a formal proposal from Quantum.  </p>

At the least, the circumstances of the 2012 presentations and appointments are matters which reasonable enquiries should have revealed.

FSDEA granted a waiver in relation to the disclosed projects and conflicts dealt with in accordance with the policy.  The disclosure included a hotel project in Luanda in which $157m had been invested which was the subject matter of particular criticism by Mr Morris in his first affidavit.

Mr Morris says that he and the team preparing the application were unaware of it because it was part of a set of over 750 documents which his firm held as a result of their involvement in Project Rainbow, not all of which had been reviewed.   Mr McGrath accepted that the letter ought to have been disclosed had Norton Rose Fulbright been aware of it, but sought to excuse its non-disclosure on the grounds that it was reasonable for Mr Morris to have remained unaware of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept that submission.  Given the gravity of the allegations and size of the freezing order being sought, it was incumbent on Norton Rose Fulbright to devote sufficient resources to examining all the documents it held which might contain relevant material, so that it could be satisfied that it could fulfil the duty to make a fair presentation if a without notice application was to be made.  The Project Rainbow material fell within this category, and its size provides no excuse for a failure to consider it all unless constraints of time or expense made this impossible.  Neither applies in this case.  This is especially so in circumstances in which Project Rainbow material was relied on by Mr Morris to make criticisms of Quantum: if it was interrogated for that purpose it should have been fully interrogated.   In any event Mr Fortunato was obviously aware of the letter, as a countersignatory, and reasonable inquiries would have extended to all the board members in place at the relevant times, including Mr Fortunato, who it is apparent from Mr Morris’ fifth witness statement was available to assist with the evidence on the application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a failure to present the stance of Northern Trust fully or fairly.  By letters of 23 February 2018 and 4 March 2018, Northern Trust made clear to FSDEA that it would not for the time being take any action to allow movement of funds from the accounts without joint and express written instructions from both FSDEA and Quantum and that it would give prior notification if it intended to change that position.  In a letter of 16 March 2018 from Northern Trust’s solicitors, largely addressed to requests for disclosure, Northern Trust reiterated that there would be no change of position without prior notification.  The first two letters were referred to in a narrative section of Mr Morris’ Affidavit but were not identified in the section on risk of dissipation, were not referred to in the skeleton argument and were not drawn to the judge’s attention.  The latter was referred to in the narrative at paragraph 147 only in respect of disclosure of documents, but was referred to at paragraph 190 of Mr Morris’ first affidavit and in the Claimants’ skeleton at 109(3) in sections addressing the risk of dissipation.  In each case the letter was referred to by treating Northern Trust’s statement that it would give prior notice as no more than a then current intention which might change without any prior warning because Northern Trust might feel obliged to follow Quantum’s instructions.  This was to mischaracterise the correspondence as a whole, which suggested that Northern Trust were caught between conflicting claims and would not take steps without the agreement of both parties.  Had the Judge been shown the correspondence, or had it fairly summarised, he would likely have concluded that there was no real risk of dissipation of any of the $2.2 billion held at Northern Trust, and in any event not without the Claimants being given sufficient advance notification to afford an opportunity to come before the Court again in those changed circumstances if necessary.  That is my view, with the result that in respect of this aspect of nondisclosure, the Claimants have not made out a case of risk of dissipation in respect of over two thirds of the amount covered by the Freezing Order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This last paragraph reflects what I said on this issue when giving judgment on the nondisclosure points at the conclusion of the hearing.  Since then, on 9 August 2018 Mr Morris wrote to the court enclosing a seventh affidavit in which he explains that there were without prejudice communications with Northern Trust in March 2018.  He had not consulted his notes when making his first affidavit, but had gone back to them in the light of the non-disclosure arguments at the hearing before me, and was now able to tell the court, having secured a limited waiver of privilege for this purpose, that in those discussions Northern Trust had “made observations with regard to the prospect, at or around the time of preparation of [Mr Morris’ first affidavit] of [Northern Trust] making a stakeholder application under Part 86 of the Civil Procedure Rules” (which it is now known was an application which was in fact prepared and about to be issued at the time of the WFO, which overtook it).  As Mr Morris fairly accepts, this confirms that what he said about Northern Trust’s stance in paragraph 190 misled the Court as to the level of risk that Northern Trust might pay out from the Limited Partnership accounts without notice.  It is regrettable, to say the least, that this matter was only drawn to the court’s attention after the hearing and after I had announced my decision in relation to non-disclosure.   </p>

In fact such an order was sought in paragraph 5(5) of the draft order put before the Judge, and such an order was made by him.

The sanction operates not only to punish the applicant for the abuse of process, but also, as Christopher Clarke J observed in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re OJSC ANK Yugraneft v Sibir Energy PLC </span>[2010] BCCC 475 at [104], to ensure that others are deterred from such conduct in the future.  Such is the importance of the duty that in the event of any substantial breach the court inclines strongly towards setting aside the order and not renewing it, even where the breach is innocent.  Where the breach is deliberate, the conscious abuse of the court’s process will almost always make it appropriate to impose the sanction.”   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the breaches taken cumulatively are serious and substantial.  They do not relate to a few, merely peripheral, matters, but to numerous matters at the heart of the Claimants’ case.  The Court was being asked to infer a dishonest conspiracy by which Mr dos Santos sought improperly to benefit his friend and associate Mr Bastos, and a consequent risk of dissipation, from four central allegations, namely (1) that Mr dos Santos was solely responsible for appointing Quantum without any proper selection process; (2) that Quantum was not properly qualified for the task; (3) the extraordinarily high and unjustified level of fees charged; and (4) the funds being used to benefit entities owned by or associated with Mr Bastos involving an undisclosed and inappropriate conflict of interest.  The non-disclosures go to one or more of these central elements of the Claimants’ case.  Proper disclosure would have put a very different complexion on the application, and it is no answer for the Claimants to say that the subsequent evidence put before the court to deal with them raises disputes which are sufficient to surmount the merits hurdle of a good arguable case.   Occasional errors in preparing the material in a case of this size and complexity can perhaps be understood.  But the unfair presentation in this case in the respects I have identified goes far beyond the odd accidental slip, and goes to the central elements of the case alleging dishonesty in support of a US$3 billion freezing order and proprietary order.  There was no urgent timescale in preparing the application, which was not precipitated, as sometimes happens, by an imminent threat of movement of funds.  The matter had obviously been under consideration for many months, at least since the E&amp;Y Report in December 2017 and Mr dos Santos’ dismissal in January 2018.  The application evidence must have been weeks in the preparation.  There is no suggestion that there was any restriction on the funding available to Norton Rose Fulbright to use a large team to make the necessary inquiries and to consider all the documents available.  Given the size of the freezing order sought, and the allegations of dishonesty being made, it was incumbent on the Claimants and their legal advisers to make the fullest inquiry into the central elements of their case if they were to proceed without notice.  Although Mr Morris emphasised in his first affidavit the limits on the inquiries which had been made by his firm, that does not excuse a failure to make the necessary inquiries or the presentation of incomplete material in an unfairly one-sided way.  </p>

I do not find that there was any deliberate breach on the part of the Claimants’ legal team.  It is less clear whether that is so of the personnel at FSDEA itself.  Some, at least, of the material would have been readily available to anyone in a senior position and the necessity to disclose it obvious to anyone aware of the duty of disclosure.  Because privilege attaches to communications between Norton Rose Fulbright and their clients, it is impossible to identify whether any individual was aware of the duty and deliberately failed to comply with it.  What can be said, however, is that the failures were serious and should not have occurred had the duty been properly understood and complied with by the Claimants themselves.  There was therefore a high degree of culpability in the failures, even though I do not find that anyone deliberately set out to abuse the court’s process.   </p>

I should make clear, however, that I would reach the same conclusion even if satisfied of a risk of dissipation, as was implicit in my decision announced at the conclusion of the hearing. The breaches of duty are sufficiently serious and culpable to warrant discharging the WFO and not granting fresh relief, irrespective of the other grounds of challenge.   </p>

A freezing order is not intended to stop a corporate defendant from dealing with its assets in the normal course of its business.  Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.  If the defendant is not threatening to change the existing way of handling their assets, it will not be sufficient to show that such continued conduct would prejudice the claimant’s ability to enforce a judgment.

The accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support such an inference: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos received anything from the investments of the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio, whether by receipt of part of the fees or otherwise.  There is no evidence to suggest that he has any control over the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio.  There is no suggestion or evidence that he has used offshore structures to hold or deal with his own assets.  There is no evidence of any change of behaviour in any way by Mr dos Santos as a result of the investigations into the transactions in question, of which Mr dos Santos was likely aware for at least several months prior to the without notice application, having been dismissed on 12 January 2018.  Nor is there any evidence that he conducted his affairs any differently in the politically changed environment after the summer of 2017 when his father stepped down as President.  The allegation of a risk of dissipation by him is no more than mere assertion unsupported by any solid evidence.  There was some suggestion in Mr Morris’ evidence that his asset disclosure pursuant to the WFO was incomplete so as to support such an inference, but his solicitor’s letter of 10 July 2018 adequately addresses the points made and leaves no evidence on which the court could conclude that his asset disclosure is incomplete or inadequate.   </p>

Again, the accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support an inference of a sufficient risk of dissipation: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  The particular facts of Mr Bastos’ criminal conviction many years ago, for which he ultimately was fined CHF4,500, do not support the inference of a current risk of dissipation.  There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by The Quantum group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way in the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons.  There is no evidence to suggest that the fact or threat of either the claim itself, or the freezing order, has caused or would cause any of them to act in a way which differed from their previous practice so as to make any adverse effect on the claimants’ ability to enforce a judgment something which could properly be characterised as “unjustified”.  This applies with equal force to the Mauritian Limited Partnerships: the evidence is that such  structures are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&amp;Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective explained at the time by Mr dos Santos to Mr Gonçalves (see above).   The Liquid Portfolio and the majority of the Illiquid Portfolio are secured without the need for a freezing order.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that Mr Bastos or the relevant Quantum Defendants intend to deal with the monies invested in the projects or the projects themselves otherwise than by way of promotion of the success of those projects.  There is no suggestion that Mr Bastos or the Quantum Defendants have taken any sums other than those to which there is a contractual entitlement; nor that they have dealt with them otherwise than in accordance with those contractual arrangements.  The complaint about the execution of those contractual arrangements does not support a risk of dissipation.  As the Claimants’ skeleton argument itself put it, this is not a routine case of “hands in the till” type fraud. </p>

Whilst the dilatory nature of that disclosure is properly the subject of criticism, full purported compliance has taken place, and there is a hotly contested issue whether there has been any failure to give a full and accurate account of the defendants’ assets.  It is not clear from the evidence ultimately put before me on the point that there has been any failure to attempt full compliance in a way which would provide any support for a finding of a risk of dissipation.  </p>

There is no evidence to suggest that Mr dos Santos has, or has ever had, any sums to which a proprietary claim could attach.  So far as Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants are concerned, I have said that I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the Claimants have established a serious issue to be tried, but the contrary is plainly arguable and a proprietary claim may well not be capable of being established.  There is no real evidential basis for concluding that the funds in the Illiquid Portfolio which have been invested in projects have not been well invested, or that in the absence of an injunction they would not continue to be managed so as to promote their profitability.  The adverse effects of the proprietary order on Mr Bastos himself appear to have been serious: he has been unable to say with certainty that any of his assets can be divorced from those received ultimately from FSDEA because his modus operandi has always been to take income through his corporate vehicles from the Quantum group as dividends so that funds have inevitably become mixed.  The effect of the proprietary injunction is therefore effectively to prevent Mr Bastos having access to any funds other than the permitted living allowance.     </p>

Leaving aside the payment of fees, the investment of those funds was for the benefit of the Claimants who retain their equitable interest in the assets, as is and has always been common ground.  In fact, over $2.2 billion remains uninvested in accounts at Northern Trust which are sufficiently secured for the time being.  Accordingly, any present quantification of the loss is limited to (1) the fees taken by the Quantum Defendants and other Bastos related companies and (2) such loss as could be established by reference to the value of the projects in which investments have been made.  In relation to the fees there is an argument that the amount of loss is not the full amount of the fees but only the amount by which they exceeded what would have been charged by another investment manager or service provider in any event.  I have already dealt under the heading of nondisclosure with the failure fairly to address the position of Northern Trust, which itself meant that a freezing order could not be justified in the sum of US$3 billion or anything like it.  In the light of my other conclusions, it is not necessary for me to determine what, if anything, had been established as a sufficiently arguable quantum of loss for the purposes of identifying the proper amount of any freezing order or proprietary injuntion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in support of which the WFO was granted arise out of what the Claimants contend was a dishonest conspiracy between the First Defendant, Mr dos Santos, the former Chairman of FSDEA, and his friend and business partner, the Second Defendant, Mr Bastos, who is the 95% beneficial owner of the Quantum group of companies which include the Third to Twentieth Defendants.  It is the Claimants’ case that, pursuant to this conspiracy, Mr dos Santos placed some US$5 billion at the disposal of the Quantum group to manage and invest on FSDEA’s behalf, when the Quantum group manifestly lacked the appropriate or any qualifications and experience for such a mandate; that in the event, most of the US$5 billion has not been invested at all and has simply been used by the Quantum group to extract what were described as an extraordinary levels of fees (amounting to some US$406 million); that of the limited proportion which has been invested, the investments have not been made in the interests of the Claimants but have mostly been channelled into other projects belonging to Mr Bastos; and that in addition, as part of the same conspiracy, Mr dos Santos committed FSDEA to pay around US$153 million to the Quantum and other companies controlled by Mr Bastos, under contracts for various purported services, which contracts, if genuine at all, were manifestly uncommercial and were intended mainly to divert money from FSDEA into the pockets of Mr Bastos<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span>without FSDEA receiving anything of remotely commensurate value in return.  The Defendants’ case is that they are the victims of political change in Angola and a desire on the part of those now in power to get their hands on money which the previous regime sensibly and appropriately invested on a long-term basis for the people of Angola; and that the allegations are a spurious and flawed attempt to achieve this political objective.   </p>

Its Chairman from 2012 to May 2013 was Dr Armando Manuel, who had been the Economic Adviser to President dos Santos.  In 2012 its other directors were Mr dos Santos and Mr Gonçalves.  In May 2013 Dr Manuel became the Minister of Finance of Angola, and shortly after FSDEA was renamed in June 2013, Mr dos Santos was appointed Chairman.  Mr Fortunato was at that time appointed a director.  Mr dos Santos remained Chairman until his removal in January 2018.  His fellow directors were Mr Gonçalves and Mr Fortunato until the autumn of 2016, when Mr Gago replaced Mr Fortunato.  Mr Gago had before that acted as Director of the Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 2013 until 2015.  He remains a director of FSDEA.  Mr Gonçalves remained a director of FSDEA until January 2018, since when he has acted as a consultant to it.

Part of FSDEA’s complaint is that it and the Limited Partners had no visibility or control over the monies in those accounts, which were under the control of the General Partners exercising their powers of management in relation to the Limited Partnerships.  Only part of this had been invested by the time of the freezing order.   Approximately US$2.27 billion remained at Northern Trust in liquid form at the time of the WFO, and has been secured.  The balance, apart from deduction of fees, was paid into a number of investment projects of the kind envisaged, including projects controlled by Mr Bastos. For example, it is said that the hotel partnership (the Eighth and Fifteenth Defendants) invested US$157 million in a hotel project in Angola in which Mr Bastos had an interest (although this figure is difficult to reconcile with Table 4 of the EY Report – defined in paragraph 14 below); and the infrastructure partnership (the Seventh and Fourteenth Defendants) invested US$180 million into the Port of Caio in Angola, which Mr Bastos had a concession to develop.  These are said to be stark examples of the conflicts inherent in the appointment of Quantum to manage FSDEA’s funds with Mr Bastos able to dictate the terms of major transactions from both sides of the table. </p>

The Angolan government commissioned a report from Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) regarding the operation of the FSDEA, which was produced on 15 December 2017 (“the E&amp;Y Report”).   Mr dos Santos was removed as Chairman of the FSDEA on 12 January 2018.  Notice of termination of the IMA was given on 16 February 2018 and took effect two months later, on 17 April 2018.  The Liquid Portfolio was put into the hands of a replacement investment manager.  The Claimants brought these proceedings and applied for the WFO on 27 April 2018.  In the light of some of the asset disclosure given by the Defendants pursuant to the WFO, E&amp;Y updated their report on 9 July 2018 (“the Updated E&amp;Y Report”). </p>

Following the termination of the IMA, the Liquid Portfolio has remained within FSDEA’s control.  Although FSDEA’s case is that Quantum was manifestly ill qualified to undertake the investment management role of the Liquid Portfolio, there is not in fact any particularised allegation that QGIM acted negligently in the choice of investments or otherwise in the handling of the Liquid Portfolio during its time as investment manager.  The complaint is not about the performance of the Liquid Portfolio investment, but about the level of fees set contractually under the IMA at 1% plus 20% above the benchmark hurdle, which EY describe in their report as “high given the size of the portfolio”, a relatively slight basis for an allegation of fraud.  The total of such fees over the life of the IMA was US$81.83m according to the Updated E&amp;Y Report.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the argument in respect of the WFO has focussed on the Illiquid Portfolio.   The amount of the Illiquid Portfolio was US$3 billion, but at the time of the WFO some US$2.27 billion remained in the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust in London.  By letters in March 2018 Northern Trust and their solicitors had made clear to the Claimants that they would not deal with those funds without the written instructions of both sides, and would not change their position without giving the Claimants prior notification.  In my view those assurances removed any risk of dissipation in justifying an order freezing that sum, which was more than two thirds of the amount frozen by the WFO.  This was the subject matter of material non-disclosure on the without notice application to Phillips J, to which I return below.  The Updated E&amp;Y Report suggests that a total of US$454m was invested in projects in the seven Mauritian funds, with the balance presumably being accounted for by fees.    </p>

The question therefore is where the services were, and were to be, provided by QGIM under the IMA.   FSDEA contends that this is London where the Northern Trust accounts were held.  I am unable to accept this submission.  The services to be provided by QGIM under the IMA were investment management services which involved determining how the Liquid Portfolio was to be invested in various short-term investments.  That management function was to be, and was, carried out in Switzerland where Quantum had its place of business.  That aspect of its business was regulated and supervised by the Swiss financial authorities, as the preamble to the IMA recorded at paragraph C.  QGIM had no custody of the assets, in London or elsewhere.  The IMA did not identify any place for the receipt of those instructions, which only became London as a result of FSDEA’s choice of custodianship, which might originally have been elsewhere than London and could at any time have been changed to a different location.  On any view, therefore, it cannot be said that the IMA provided for any part of the services to be performed in London.  It is true that QGIM’s investment management in Switzerland in the event resulted in instructions from Switzerland to London to the custodian of the funds in London, but that does not make London the place of performance of the services to be provided under the IMA.  Those services do not consist solely or even primarily of the investment instructions, but rather the investment management activity in determining what investments to make, which took place in Switzerland, as envisaged by the IMA. </p>

However I accept Mr Edey QC’s submission that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly characterised as being in a “matter relating to contract” so that allocation of jurisdiction falls to be determined in accordance with Article 5(1), not Article 5(3); and that accordingly Switzerland is the allocated jurisdiction for the same reason as for the contractual claims under the IMA.  This is because the equitable claim for breach of fiduciary duties depends upon the existence of the IMA: the duties are said to arise by virtue of the relationship created by the IMA.  The Claim Form describes them as “arising by virtue of the IMA and/or the authority thereby vested in QGIM to…handle and otherwise deal with assets belonging to the FSDEA”.

If the obligation arises from the unconscionable disregard of the duties of an agreement, such as those imposed upon a person who has with the agreement of the other party placed himself in a fiduciary relationship with that other, such as an agent to his principal, the matter should be seen as one relating to a contract and the fiduciary aspect of the claim as going only to define or augment the remedies available to the claimant.”   </p>

It is a claim to the property itself, and is only asserted against the holder of the property or one who is in a position to give effect to the proprietary interest.  Accordingly, in the current context the question is whether, assuming that there is a sufficiently arguable case that QGIM holds such property, the claim to enforce the proprietary interest in respect of the property against QGIM falls within Article 5(3).  Mr McGrath QC submitted that the proprietary claim fell within Article 5(3) as being in a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi delict.  Mr Edey submitted that if the proprietary claim passed the threshold merits test of raising a serious issue to be tried, it did not fall within Article 5(3).  He submitted that it was clear from <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kalfelis v Bankhaus Schröder</span> 189/87 [1988] ECR 5565 and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Glasgow City Council</span> [1999] 1 AC 153 that Article 5(3) only covered claims which gave rise to a personal liability.<span style="font-weight:bold">  </span>This submission is in my view well founded.

Mr Edey submitted that there could be no proprietary claim for property which was transferred pursuant to contracts where those contracts had not been avoided or rescinded.  He accepted that the Claimants retained a beneficial interest in the investments in the Illiquid Portfolio, but submitted that those interests were held on the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreements which were long term contracts (of 10 or 15 years), such that there was no immediate entitlement to possession.  He submitted that property passed in full under the contracts (the IMA and the Limited Partnership Agreements), and unless and until they were avoided there could be no vesting of any equitable interest in the transferor.  Until very shortly before the hearing before me the Claimants had not suggested that the agreements were invalid or had been avoided, and indeed had proceeded on the basis that they remained validly in place.  Mr McGrath sought to argue before me that they were void, alternatively voidable and had been rescinded.  In my view Mr Edey was correct to submit that it was too late to run such an argument, which gave rise to issues of election and affirmation, and to allow the Claimants to do so would have been unfairly prejudicial to the Quantum Defendants, who would have been able to deploy arguments of election and affirmation.  Accordingly the question whether there is a serious issue to be tried that the Claimants have a proprietary claim falls to be addressed on the footing that the sums transferred were paid in accordance with contracts which are not void and have not been rescinded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that footing, Mr McGrath submitted that where a contract split the legal and equitable interests so as to confer a legal title whilst retaining an equitable title, there is no need to rescind or avoid the contract in order for the transferor to assert the equitable proprietary right to the property.  That was, he submitted, the effect of the contractual arrangements in this case because the funds were always invested for benefit of the Claimants who retained an equitable interest throughout; the Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in the name of FSDEA and funds for the Illiquid Portfolio were transferred into the Limited Partnership accounts by instructions from FSDEA to QGIM which expressly purported to retain “ultimate beneficial ownership” in the funds.  This argument does not work for the fees in respect of the Liquid Portfolio, where it was intended by the IMA that legal and beneficial interest in the fees should pass to QGIM.  However, the main issue on this point was whether there was a sufficiently arguable proprietary claim to the sums transferred in the Illiquid Portfolio because the challenge is aimed at the proprietary element of the WFO, which is confined in amount to $3 billion to reflect such transfer. So far as that is concerned I was referred to a number of authorities on each side.  This is an issue which raises difficult questions of law which will have to be applied to the facts once established.  I am inclined to the view that the Claimants have met the relatively low merits threshold of a serious issue to be tried.  However I do not propose to explore the legal issues in this judgment which would fall to be addressed in the light of the fact specific circumstances once established, nor to </p>

The passage relied upon does not support the suggested principle, and the suggested principle is inconsistent with the essence of the tort which is that if lawful means are deployed a conspiracy can only be unlawful if it involves a predominant intention to injure the claimant.  If the predominant intention is to benefit the conspirators, by definition the predominant intention cannot be to injure the claimant, even if such injury is the inevitable result and even if it is intended.  The lawful means conspiracy does not surmount the merits threshold of raising a serious issue to be tried on the facts alleged by the Claimants in this case, which clearly involve an allegation that the alleged conspirators were motivated by a desire to benefit themselves without any animus against the Claimants.   </p>

He submitted that under Article 4 of the Rome II Convention the question was governed by Angolan Law; and that there was no evidence that Angolan law recognised such causes of action.  The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence before me simply did not purport to address the question whether Angolan law recognised a liability based on facts which would in English law establish liability for unlawful means conspiracy or dishonest assistance constructive trust.  Accordingly, even if the appropriate law is Angolan law, the Court proceeds on the evidential assumption that Angolan law does not differ from English law in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  I therefore reject Mr Anderson’s submission on this point. </p>

The starting point is that there are arbitrations in Mauritius which involve the disputes between the Limited Partners and the General Partners in relation to the Illiquid Portfolio, to which the Limited Partnerships are arguably properly joined parties.  There are also winding up proceedings commenced by the Limited Partners in Mauritius which will raise some of the issues which arise in these proceedings.  There is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention over certain of the claims against QGIM (D3) and over the proprietary claim against QGAI (D6), who must be sued in Switzerland; and in any event, even were jurisdiction otherwise to be established, any claims by FSDEA against QGIM would have to be stayed in favour of arbitration in Portugal.  It is FSDEA’s case that the IMA (and therefore its arbitration clause) governs the Illiquid as well as the Liquid Portfolio.  Accordingly, on the Claimants’ case, all the tortious and contractual claims by FSDEA against QGIM will have to be dealt with in that arbitration.  On any view, and even if the arbitration is confined to the issues in relation to the Liquid Portfolio, that will involve an examination of the circumstances in which the Quantum group came to be appointed, which raises many of the issues at the heart of the dispute in these proceedings.    </p>

Under the IMA, FSDEA could have chosen to establish the custodian accounts at any bank anywhere, for example in New York.  The funds were dollar denominated and the Liquid Portfolio was invested in a range of international securities in the usual way.  The centre of gravity for the allegations in relation to investment of the Illiquid Portfolio is not in London, from where the funds were to be transferred to be invested in projects, but in the places where the events giving rise to the complaints arises: Switzerland for the decision to set up Mauritian limited partnerships and Angola or elsewhere in Africa in relation to investment in projects where a conflict of interest is complained of.  The fact that a London branch of a US Bank was chosen by FSDEA as the place of custody is of no significance to the issues in the case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points which are relevant to the current applications deserve emphasis.   The importance of the duty has often been emphasised in the authorities.  It is necessary to enable the Court to fulfil its own obligations to ensure fair process under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the necessary corollary of the Court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, which is a basic principle of fairness.  Derogation from that basic principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy.  If the court is to adopt that procedure where justice so requires, it must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the evidence and argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests, but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make.  It is a duty owed to the court which exists in order to ensure the integrity of the court’s process.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that although the principle is often expressed in terms of a duty of disclosure, the ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation of the application is fair in all material respects: see Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Memory Corporation v Sidhu</span> (No 2) [2000] 1 WLR1443, citing formulations from, amongst others, Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bank Mellat v Nikpour</span> [1985] FSR 87, 92, Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Siporex Trade v Comdel Commodities</span> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428, 437 and Carnwath J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Marc Rich &amp; Co Holding v Krasner</span> (18 December 1998).  This is again the consequence of the exceptional derogation from the principle of hearing both sides.  The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided.   In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case.  The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one.  He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument.  It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the duty is not confined to the applicant’s legal advisers but is a duty which rests upon the applicant itself.   It is the duty of the legal team to ensure that the lay client is aware of the duty of full and frank disclosure and what it means in practice for the purposes of the application in question; and to exercise a degree of supervision in ensuring that the duty is discharged.   No doubt in some cases this is a difficult task, particularly with clients from different legal and cultural backgrounds and with varying levels of sophistication.  But it is important that the lay client should understand and discharge the duty of full and frank disclosure, because often it will only be the client who is aware of everything which is material.  The responsibility of the applicant’s lawyers in this respect is a heavy one, commensurate with the importance which is attached to the duty itself.  It may be likened to the duties of solicitors in relation to disclosure of documents (see CPR PD31A and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedrich v Standard Bank London Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 905). </p>

It contained a detailed investment strategy and identified the key terms of the proposed commitment and fee structure.

Moreover, Mr Morris did not draw attention to the fact, as he should have done, that the August 2012 contract and December 2012 addendum were each signed not by Mr dos Santos but by Dr Manuel.   The sub-paragraph also made an unfortunate error in referring to the fees under the addendum contract as being $44 million for 6 months, amounting to $264 million.  That would indeed have been breathtaking, to use the epithet applied to fees in the Claimants’ skeleton argument, but was wrong: the fees were $44,000 monthly, giving a total of $264,000 for 6 months. </p>

The false impression is reinforced by the assertion at para 31 of the E&amp;Y report that no proposals were requested from any of the four potential managers, i.e. including Quantum, which implied that there had never been a formal proposal from Quantum.  </p>

At the least, the circumstances of the 2012 presentations and appointments are matters which reasonable enquiries should have revealed.

The repeated thrust of the complaint was that this was an inappropriate structure and had been chosen to eliminate FSDEA’s control and visibility.  It is now accepted that Mauritian limited partnership structures are commonly used as private equity investment vehicles.  The Judge’s attention was not drawn to the fact that the E&amp;Y report described the structures used for the Illiquid Portfolio as based on a standard model and that “such models are commonly used in P[rivate] E[quity] and venture capital schemes and as collective investment vehicles and generally offer limited liability without the rigidity imposed by company law.” </p>

Mr Morris asserted in his first affidavit that no disclosure had been made of any conflicts of interest to FSDEA.  This was not true.  On 17 August 2016 Quantum wrote to FSDEA setting out potential conflicts of interest, attaching a conflicts of interest policy, and expressly disclosing transactions where a conflict could be said to arise.  FSDEA granted a waiver in relation to the disclosed projects and conflicts dealt with in accordance with the policy.  The disclosure included a hotel project in Luanda in which $157m had been invested which was the subject matter of particular criticism by Mr Morris in his first affidavit.  The letter and waiver were signed not only by Mr dos Santos but also by Mr Fortunato, against whom no allegations of impropriety are made. </p>

Mr Morris says that he and the team preparing the application were unaware of it because it was part of a set of over 750 documents which his firm held as a result of their involvement in Project Rainbow, not all of which had been reviewed.   Mr McGrath accepted that the letter ought to have been disclosed had Norton Rose Fulbright been aware of it, but sought to excuse its non-disclosure on the grounds that it was reasonable for Mr Morris to have remained unaware of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept that submission.  Given the gravity of the allegations and size of the freezing order being sought, it was incumbent on Norton Rose Fulbright to devote sufficient resources to examining all the documents it held which might contain relevant material, so that it could be satisfied that it could fulfil the duty to make a fair presentation if a without notice application was to be made.  The Project Rainbow material fell within this category, and its size provides no excuse for a failure to consider it all unless constraints of time or expense made this impossible.  Neither applies in this case.  This is especially so in circumstances in which Project Rainbow material was relied on by Mr Morris to make criticisms of Quantum: if it was interrogated for that purpose it should have been fully interrogated.   In any event Mr Fortunato was obviously aware of the letter, as a countersignatory, and reasonable inquiries would have extended to all the board members in place at the relevant times, including Mr Fortunato, who it is apparent from Mr Morris’ fifth witness statement was available to assist with the evidence on the application. </p>

The Judge did not have specifically drawn to his attention paragraph 53 of the E&amp;Y report which described 2 plus 20 as a traditional PE fee model.  Moreover, the amount of the fees which would be charged had been identified in the presentations to FSDEA in 2012, which set out the 2 plus 20 structure for the infrastructure portfolio and the 2.5 plus 20 structure for the hotel portfolio, again a matter not drawn to the Judge’s attention.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a failure to present the stance of Northern Trust fully or fairly.  By letters of 23 February 2018 and 4 March 2018, Northern Trust made clear to FSDEA that it would not for the time being take any action to allow movement of funds from the accounts without joint and express written instructions from both FSDEA and Quantum and that it would give prior notification if it intended to change that position.  In a letter of 16 March 2018 from Northern Trust’s solicitors, largely addressed to requests for disclosure, Northern Trust reiterated that there would be no change of position without prior notification.  The first two letters were referred to in a narrative section of Mr Morris’ Affidavit but were not identified in the section on risk of dissipation, were not referred to in the skeleton argument and were not drawn to the judge’s attention.  The latter was referred to in the narrative at paragraph 147 only in respect of disclosure of documents, but was referred to at paragraph 190 of Mr Morris’ first affidavit and in the Claimants’ skeleton at 109(3) in sections addressing the risk of dissipation.  In each case the letter was referred to by treating Northern Trust’s statement that it would give prior notice as no more than a then current intention which might change without any prior warning because Northern Trust might feel obliged to follow Quantum’s instructions.  This was to mischaracterise the correspondence as a whole, which suggested that Northern Trust were caught between conflicting claims and would not take steps without the agreement of both parties.  Had the Judge been shown the correspondence, or had it fairly summarised, he would likely have concluded that there was no real risk of dissipation of any of the $2.2 billion held at Northern Trust, and in any event not without the Claimants being given sufficient advance notification to afford an opportunity to come before the Court again in those changed circumstances if necessary.  That is my view, with the result that in respect of this aspect of nondisclosure, the Claimants have not made out a case of risk of dissipation in respect of over two thirds of the amount covered by the Freezing Order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This last paragraph reflects what I said on this issue when giving judgment on the nondisclosure points at the conclusion of the hearing.  Since then, on 9 August 2018 Mr Morris wrote to the court enclosing a seventh affidavit in which he explains that there were without prejudice communications with Northern Trust in March 2018.  He had not consulted his notes when making his first affidavit, but had gone back to them in the light of the non-disclosure arguments at the hearing before me, and was now able to tell the court, having secured a limited waiver of privilege for this purpose, that in those discussions Northern Trust had “made observations with regard to the prospect, at or around the time of preparation of [Mr Morris’ first affidavit] of [Northern Trust] making a stakeholder application under Part 86 of the Civil Procedure Rules” (which it is now known was an application which was in fact prepared and about to be issued at the time of the WFO, which overtook it).  As Mr Morris fairly accepts, this confirms that what he said about Northern Trust’s stance in paragraph 190 misled the Court as to the level of risk that Northern Trust might pay out from the Limited Partnership accounts without notice.  It is regrettable, to say the least, that this matter was only drawn to the court’s attention after the hearing and after I had announced my decision in relation to non-disclosure.   </p>

In fact such an order was sought in paragraph 5(5) of the draft order put before the Judge, and such an order was made by him.  Mr McGrath has apologised for this mistake (the mistake being in the skeleton, not in the order sought), and submitted that because the Judge had clearly read the order with care he was not misled and appreciated that such an order was in fact being sought against Mr dos Santos and Mr Bastos.

The court will take into account the importance of the matters which were not disclosed, the nature and degree of culpability, and the adverse consequences to a claimant of losing protection against a risk of dissipation of assets.  It is not sufficient to justify regranting the order that it would be justified had the material matters been disclosed and a fair presentation made, because one important factor in weighing the interests of justice is the penal element of the sanction, which it is in the public interest to apply in order to promote the efficacy of the rule by encouraging others to comply.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the breaches taken cumulatively are serious and substantial.  They do not relate to a few, merely peripheral, matters, but to numerous matters at the heart of the Claimants’ case.  The Court was being asked to infer a dishonest conspiracy by which Mr dos Santos sought improperly to benefit his friend and associate Mr Bastos, and a consequent risk of dissipation, from four central allegations, namely (1) that Mr dos Santos was solely responsible for appointing Quantum without any proper selection process; (2) that Quantum was not properly qualified for the task; (3) the extraordinarily high and unjustified level of fees charged; and (4) the funds being used to benefit entities owned by or associated with Mr Bastos involving an undisclosed and inappropriate conflict of interest.  The non-disclosures go to one or more of these central elements of the Claimants’ case.  Proper disclosure would have put a very different complexion on the application, and it is no answer for the Claimants to say that the subsequent evidence put before the court to deal with them raises disputes which are sufficient to surmount the merits hurdle of a good arguable case.   Occasional errors in preparing the material in a case of this size and complexity can perhaps be understood.  But the unfair presentation in this case in the respects I have identified goes far beyond the odd accidental slip, and goes to the central elements of the case alleging dishonesty in support of a US$3 billion freezing order and proprietary order.  There was no urgent timescale in preparing the application, which was not precipitated, as sometimes happens, by an imminent threat of movement of funds.  The matter had obviously been under consideration for many months, at least since the E&amp;Y Report in December 2017 and Mr dos Santos’ dismissal in January 2018.  The application evidence must have been weeks in the preparation.  There is no suggestion that there was any restriction on the funding available to Norton Rose Fulbright to use a large team to make the necessary inquiries and to consider all the documents available.  Given the size of the freezing order sought, and the allegations of dishonesty being made, it was incumbent on the Claimants and their legal advisers to make the fullest inquiry into the central elements of their case if they were to proceed without notice.  Although Mr Morris emphasised in his first affidavit the limits on the inquiries which had been made by his firm, that does not excuse a failure to make the necessary inquiries or the presentation of incomplete material in an unfairly one-sided way.  </p>

Some, at least, of the material would have been readily available to anyone in a senior position and the necessity to disclose it obvious to anyone aware of the duty of disclosure.  Because privilege attaches to communications between Norton Rose Fulbright and their clients, it is impossible to identify whether any individual was aware of the duty and deliberately failed to comply with it.  What can be said, however, is that the failures were serious and should not have occurred had the duty been properly understood and complied with by the Claimants themselves.  There was therefore a high degree of culpability in the failures, even though I do not find that anyone deliberately set out to abuse the court’s process.   </p>

I should make clear, however, that I would reach the same conclusion even if satisfied of a risk of dissipation, as was implicit in my decision announced at the conclusion of the hearing.

The purpose of a freezing order is not to provide the claimant with security; it is to restrain a defendant from evading justice by disposing of, or concealing, assets otherwise than in the normal course of business in a way which will have the effect of making it judgment proof.  A freezing order is not intended to stop a corporate defendant from dealing with its assets in the normal course of its business.  Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.  If the defendant is not threatening to change the existing way of handling their assets, it will not be sufficient to show that such continued conduct would prejudice the claimant’s ability to enforce a judgment.  That would be contrary to the purpose of the freezing order jurisdiction because it would require defendants to change their legitimate behaviour in order to provide preferential security for the claim which the claimant would not otherwise enjoy.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no solid evidence of a risk of dissipation against Mr dos Santos.  The accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support such an inference: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos received anything from the investments of the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio, whether by receipt of part of the fees or otherwise.  There is no evidence to suggest that he has any control over the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio.  There is no suggestion or evidence that he has used offshore structures to hold or deal with his own assets.  There is no evidence of any change of behaviour in any way by Mr dos Santos as a result of the investigations into the transactions in question, of which Mr dos Santos was likely aware for at least several months prior to the without notice application, having been dismissed on 12 January 2018.  Nor is there any evidence that he conducted his affairs any differently in the politically changed environment after the summer of 2017 when his father stepped down as President.  The allegation of a risk of dissipation by him is no more than mere assertion unsupported by any solid evidence.  There was some suggestion in Mr Morris’ evidence that his asset disclosure pursuant to the WFO was incomplete so as to support such an inference, but his solicitor’s letter of 10 July 2018 adequately addresses the points made and leaves no evidence on which the court could conclude that his asset disclosure is incomplete or inadequate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the same is true of the different circumstances of Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants.  Again, the accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support an inference of a sufficient risk of dissipation: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  The particular facts of Mr Bastos’ criminal conviction many years ago, for which he ultimately was fined CHF4,500, do not support the inference of a current risk of dissipation.  There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by The Quantum group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way in the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons.  There is no evidence to suggest that the fact or threat of either the claim itself, or the freezing order, has caused or would cause any of them to act in a way which differed from their previous practice so as to make any adverse effect on the claimants’ ability to enforce a judgment something which could properly be characterised as “unjustified”.  This applies with equal force to the Mauritian Limited Partnerships: the evidence is that such  structures are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&amp;Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective explained at the time by Mr dos Santos to Mr Gonçalves (see above).   The Liquid Portfolio and the majority of the Illiquid Portfolio are secured without the need for a freezing order.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that Mr Bastos or the relevant Quantum Defendants intend to deal with the monies invested in the projects or the projects themselves otherwise than by way of promotion of the success of those projects.  There is no suggestion that Mr Bastos or the Quantum Defendants have taken any sums other than those to which there is a contractual entitlement; nor that they have dealt with them otherwise than in accordance with those contractual arrangements.  The complaint about the execution of those contractual arrangements does not support a risk of dissipation.  As the Claimants’ skeleton argument itself put it, this is not a routine case of “hands in the till” type fraud. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although this was not put in the forefront of the argument on this point, complaint was also made about the history and nature of the asset disclosure by Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants pursuant to the WFO; it was said that the failure to make proper disclosure was a continuing effort to hide assets in order to protect them from a judgment.  Whilst the dilatory nature of that disclosure is properly the subject of criticism, full purported compliance has taken place, and there is a hotly contested issue whether there has been any failure to give a full and accurate account of the defendants’ assets.  It is not clear from the evidence ultimately put before me on the point that there has been any failure to attempt full compliance in a way which would provide any support for a finding of a risk of dissipation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">90.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>For similar reasons the balance of convenience would not lie in favour of granting a proprietary injunction.  There is no evidence to suggest that Mr dos Santos has, or has ever had, any sums to which a proprietary claim could attach.  So far as Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants are concerned, I have said that I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the Claimants have established a serious issue to be tried, but the contrary is plainly arguable and a proprietary claim may well not be capable of being established.  There is no real evidential basis for concluding that the funds in the Illiquid Portfolio which have been invested in projects have not been well invested, or that in the absence of an injunction they would not continue to be managed so as to promote their profitability.  The adverse effects of the proprietary order on Mr Bastos himself appear to have been serious: he has been unable to say with certainty that any of his assets can be divorced from those received ultimately from FSDEA because his modus operandi has always been to take income through his corporate vehicles from the Quantum group as dividends so that funds have inevitably become mixed.  The effect of the proprietary injunction is therefore effectively to prevent Mr Bastos having access to any funds other than the permitted living allowance.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">91.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Mr Edey submitted, correctly in my view, that the quantum of any loss suffered by FSDEA could not be put at US$3 billion or anything like it.   Leaving aside the payment of fees, the investment of those funds was for the benefit of the Claimants who retain their equitable interest in the assets, as is and has always been common ground.  In fact, over $2.2 billion remains uninvested in accounts at Northern Trust which are sufficiently secured for the time being.  Accordingly, any present quantification of the loss is limited to (1) the fees taken by the Quantum Defendants and other Bastos related companies and (2) such loss as could be established by reference to the value of the projects in which investments have been made.  In relation to the fees there is an argument that the amount of loss is not the full amount of the fees but only the amount by which they exceeded what would have been charged by another investment manager or service provider in any event.  I have already dealt under the heading of nondisclosure with the failure fairly to address the position of Northern Trust, which itself meant that a freezing order could not be justified in the sum of US$3 billion or anything like it.  In the light of my other conclusions, it is not necessary for me to determine what, if anything, had been established as a sufficiently arguable quantum of loss for the purposes of identifying the proper amount of any freezing order or proprietary injuntion. </p>

At the conclusion of the hearing I announced my decision that the WFO should be discharged for non-disclosure, and no fresh order granted, and gave reasons.  I reserved judgment in relation to all the issues which I did not address.  This is my full judgment, including amplified reasons in relation to nondisclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in support of which the WFO was granted arise out of what the Claimants contend was a dishonest conspiracy between the First Defendant, Mr dos Santos, the former Chairman of FSDEA, and his friend and business partner, the Second Defendant, Mr Bastos, who is the 95% beneficial owner of the Quantum group of companies which include the Third to Twentieth Defendants.  It is the Claimants’ case that, pursuant to this conspiracy, Mr dos Santos placed some US$5 billion at the disposal of the Quantum group to manage and invest on FSDEA’s behalf, when the Quantum group manifestly lacked the appropriate or any qualifications and experience for such a mandate; that in the event, most of the US$5 billion has not been invested at all and has simply been used by the Quantum group to extract what were described as an extraordinary levels of fees (amounting to some US$406 million); that of the limited proportion which has been invested, the investments have not been made in the interests of the Claimants but have mostly been channelled into other projects belonging to Mr Bastos; and that in addition, as part of the same conspiracy, Mr dos Santos committed FSDEA to pay around US$153 million to the Quantum and other companies controlled by Mr Bastos, under contracts for various purported services, which contracts, if genuine at all, were manifestly uncommercial and were intended mainly to divert money from FSDEA into the pockets of Mr Bastos<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span>without FSDEA receiving anything of remotely commensurate value in return.  The Defendants’ case is that they are the victims of political change in Angola and a desire on the part of those now in power to get their hands on money which the previous regime sensibly and appropriately invested on a long-term basis for the people of Angola; and that the allegations are a spurious and flawed attempt to achieve this political objective.   </p>

Its Chairman from 2012 to May 2013 was Dr Armando Manuel, who had been the Economic Adviser to President dos Santos.  In 2012 its other directors were Mr dos Santos and Mr Gonçalves.  In May 2013 Dr Manuel became the Minister of Finance of Angola, and shortly after FSDEA was renamed in June 2013, Mr dos Santos was appointed Chairman.  Mr Fortunato was at that time appointed a director.  Mr dos Santos remained Chairman until his removal in January 2018.  His fellow directors were Mr Gonçalves and Mr Fortunato until the autumn of 2016, when Mr Gago replaced Mr Fortunato.  Mr Gago had before that acted as Director of the Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 2013 until 2015.  He remains a director of FSDEA.  Mr Gonçalves remained a director of FSDEA until January 2018, since when he has acted as a consultant to it.

Five Incorporation Service Agreements (“the ISAs”) were made with the Fifth Defendant (“QGI Ltd”), to establish five funds to invest in various sectors in Africa.  The ISAs were governed by Angolan law and provided for arbitration in Luanda, Angola under ICC Rules conducted in the Portuguese language.  Two Consultancy Agreements (“the CAs”) were made with the Sixth Defendant (“QGAI”) in relation to the establishment of two further funds to invest in the hotel sector and in infrastructure projects.  Each of the Limited Partnerships had a management agreement with the Fourth Defendant (“QGIAM”) under which the latter was entitled to an annual management fee of 2% (infrastructure) or 2.5% (other funds) plus in each case 20% above a rate of return of 8%. </p>

The Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in FSDEA’s name.  QGIM was the asset manager which exercised the investment decision making and discretion from its base in Switzerland; Northern Trust’s role was executory and as custodian of the investments.  FSDEA had visibility over the Liquid Portfolio held in accounts in its name, and received regular investment reports in relation to the portfolio from QGIM.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The US$3 billion in the Illiquid Portfolio was transferred to accounts in the name of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust.  Part of FSDEA’s complaint is that it and the Limited Partners had no visibility or control over the monies in those accounts, which were under the control of the General Partners exercising their powers of management in relation to the Limited Partnerships.  Only part of this had been invested by the time of the freezing order.   Approximately US$2.27 billion remained at Northern Trust in liquid form at the time of the WFO, and has been secured.  The balance, apart from deduction of fees, was paid into a number of investment projects of the kind envisaged, including projects controlled by Mr Bastos. For example, it is said that the hotel partnership (the Eighth and Fifteenth Defendants) invested US$157 million in a hotel project in Angola in which Mr Bastos had an interest (although this figure is difficult to reconcile with Table 4 of the EY Report – defined in paragraph 14 below); and the infrastructure partnership (the Seventh and Fourteenth Defendants) invested US$180 million into the Port of Caio in Angola, which Mr Bastos had a concession to develop.  These are said to be stark examples of the conflicts inherent in the appointment of Quantum to manage FSDEA’s funds with Mr Bastos able to dictate the terms of major transactions from both sides of the table. </p>

The Angolan government commissioned a report from Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) regarding the operation of the FSDEA, which was produced on 15 December 2017 (“the E&amp;Y Report”).   Mr dos Santos was removed as Chairman of the FSDEA on 12 January 2018.  Notice of termination of the IMA was given on 16 February 2018 and took effect two months later, on 17 April 2018.  The Liquid Portfolio was put into the hands of a replacement investment manager.  The Claimants brought these proceedings and applied for the WFO on 27 April 2018.  In the light of some of the asset disclosure given by the Defendants pursuant to the WFO, E&amp;Y updated their report on 9 July 2018 (“the Updated E&amp;Y Report”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos benefited at all from any of the arrangements complained of.  Following the termination of the IMA, the Liquid Portfolio has remained within FSDEA’s control.  Although FSDEA’s case is that Quantum was manifestly ill qualified to undertake the investment management role of the Liquid Portfolio, there is not in fact any particularised allegation that QGIM acted negligently in the choice of investments or otherwise in the handling of the Liquid Portfolio during its time as investment manager.  The complaint is not about the performance of the Liquid Portfolio investment, but about the level of fees set contractually under the IMA at 1% plus 20% above the benchmark hurdle, which EY describe in their report as “high given the size of the portfolio”, a relatively slight basis for an allegation of fraud.  The total of such fees over the life of the IMA was US$81.83m according to the Updated E&amp;Y Report.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the argument in respect of the WFO has focussed on the Illiquid Portfolio.   The amount of the Illiquid Portfolio was US$3 billion, but at the time of the WFO some US$2.27 billion remained in the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust in London.  By letters in March 2018 Northern Trust and their solicitors had made clear to the Claimants that they would not deal with those funds without the written instructions of both sides, and would not change their position without giving the Claimants prior notification.  In my view those assurances removed any risk of dissipation in justifying an order freezing that sum, which was more than two thirds of the amount frozen by the WFO.  This was the subject matter of material non-disclosure on the without notice application to Phillips J, to which I return below.  The Updated E&amp;Y Report suggests that a total of US$454m was invested in projects in the seven Mauritian funds, with the balance presumably being accounted for by fees.    </p>

The question therefore is where the services were, and were to be, provided by QGIM under the IMA.   FSDEA contends that this is London where the Northern Trust accounts were held.  I am unable to accept this submission.  The services to be provided by QGIM under the IMA were investment management services which involved determining how the Liquid Portfolio was to be invested in various short-term investments.  That management function was to be, and was, carried out in Switzerland where Quantum had its place of business.  That aspect of its business was regulated and supervised by the Swiss financial authorities, as the preamble to the IMA recorded at paragraph C.  QGIM had no custody of the assets, in London or elsewhere.  The IMA did not identify any place for the receipt of those instructions, which only became London as a result of FSDEA’s choice of custodianship, which might originally have been elsewhere than London and could at any time have been changed to a different location.  On any view, therefore, it cannot be said that the IMA provided for any part of the services to be performed in London.  It is true that QGIM’s investment management in Switzerland in the event resulted in instructions from Switzerland to London to the custodian of the funds in London, but that does not make London the place of performance of the services to be provided under the IMA.  Those services do not consist solely or even primarily of the investment instructions, but rather the investment management activity in determining what investments to make, which took place in Switzerland, as envisaged by the IMA. </p>

However I accept Mr Edey QC’s submission that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly characterised as being in a “matter relating to contract” so that allocation of jurisdiction falls to be determined in accordance with Article 5(1), not Article 5(3); and that accordingly Switzerland is the allocated jurisdiction for the same reason as for the contractual claims under the IMA.  This is because the equitable claim for breach of fiduciary duties depends upon the existence of the IMA: the duties are said to arise by virtue of the relationship created by the IMA.  The Claim Form describes them as “arising by virtue of the IMA and/or the authority thereby vested in QGIM to…handle and otherwise deal with assets belonging to the FSDEA”.

It is a claim to the property itself, and is only asserted against the holder of the property or one who is in a position to give effect to the proprietary interest.  Accordingly, in the current context the question is whether, assuming that there is a sufficiently arguable case that QGIM holds such property, the claim to enforce the proprietary interest in respect of the property against QGIM falls within Article 5(3).  Mr McGrath QC submitted that the proprietary claim fell within Article 5(3) as being in a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi delict.  Mr Edey submitted that if the proprietary claim passed the threshold merits test of raising a serious issue to be tried, it did not fall within Article 5(3).

Mr Edey submitted that there could be no proprietary claim for property which was transferred pursuant to contracts where those contracts had not been avoided or rescinded.  He accepted that the Claimants retained a beneficial interest in the investments in the Illiquid Portfolio, but submitted that those interests were held on the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreements which were long term contracts (of 10 or 15 years), such that there was no immediate entitlement to possession.  He submitted that property passed in full under the contracts (the IMA and the Limited Partnership Agreements), and unless and until they were avoided there could be no vesting of any equitable interest in the transferor.  Until very shortly before the hearing before me the Claimants had not suggested that the agreements were invalid or had been avoided, and indeed had proceeded on the basis that they remained validly in place.  Mr McGrath sought to argue before me that they were void, alternatively voidable and had been rescinded.  In my view Mr Edey was correct to submit that it was too late to run such an argument, which gave rise to issues of election and affirmation, and to allow the Claimants to do so would have been unfairly prejudicial to the Quantum Defendants, who would have been able to deploy arguments of election and affirmation.  Accordingly the question whether there is a serious issue to be tried that the Claimants have a proprietary claim falls to be addressed on the footing that the sums transferred were paid in accordance with contracts which are not void and have not been rescinded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that footing, Mr McGrath submitted that where a contract split the legal and equitable interests so as to confer a legal title whilst retaining an equitable title, there is no need to rescind or avoid the contract in order for the transferor to assert the equitable proprietary right to the property.  That was, he submitted, the effect of the contractual arrangements in this case because the funds were always invested for benefit of the Claimants who retained an equitable interest throughout; the Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in the name of FSDEA and funds for the Illiquid Portfolio were transferred into the Limited Partnership accounts by instructions from FSDEA to QGIM which expressly purported to retain “ultimate beneficial ownership” in the funds.  This argument does not work for the fees in respect of the Liquid Portfolio, where it was intended by the IMA that legal and beneficial interest in the fees should pass to QGIM.  However, the main issue on this point was whether there was a sufficiently arguable proprietary claim to the sums transferred in the Illiquid Portfolio because the challenge is aimed at the proprietary element of the WFO, which is confined in amount to $3 billion to reflect such transfer. So far as that is concerned I was referred to a number of authorities on each side.  This is an issue which raises difficult questions of law which will have to be applied to the facts once established.  I am inclined to the view that the Claimants have met the relatively low merits threshold of a serious issue to be tried.  However I do not propose to explore the legal issues in this judgment which would fall to be addressed in the light of the fact specific circumstances once established, nor to </p>

The passage relied upon does not support the suggested principle, and the suggested principle is inconsistent with the essence of the tort which is that if lawful means are deployed a conspiracy can only be unlawful if it involves a predominant intention to injure the claimant.  If the predominant intention is to benefit the conspirators, by definition the predominant intention cannot be to injure the claimant, even if such injury is the inevitable result and even if it is intended.  The lawful means conspiracy does not surmount the merits threshold of raising a serious issue to be tried on the facts alleged by the Claimants in this case, which clearly involve an allegation that the alleged conspirators were motivated by a desire to benefit themselves without any animus against the Claimants.   </p>

He submitted that under Article 4 of the Rome II Convention the question was governed by Angolan Law; and that there was no evidence that Angolan law recognised such causes of action.  The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence before me simply did not purport to address the question whether Angolan law recognised a liability based on facts which would in English law establish liability for unlawful means conspiracy or dishonest assistance constructive trust.  Accordingly, even if the appropriate law is Angolan law, the Court proceeds on the evidential assumption that Angolan law does not differ from English law in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  I therefore reject Mr Anderson’s submission on this point. </p>

The starting point is that there are arbitrations in Mauritius which involve the disputes between the Limited Partners and the General Partners in relation to the Illiquid Portfolio, to which the Limited Partnerships are arguably properly joined parties.  There are also winding up proceedings commenced by the Limited Partners in Mauritius which will raise some of the issues which arise in these proceedings.  There is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention over certain of the claims against QGIM (D3) and over the proprietary claim against QGAI (D6), who must be sued in Switzerland; and in any event, even were jurisdiction otherwise to be established, any claims by FSDEA against QGIM would have to be stayed in favour of arbitration in Portugal.  It is FSDEA’s case that the IMA (and therefore its arbitration clause) governs the Illiquid as well as the Liquid Portfolio.  Accordingly, on the Claimants’ case, all the tortious and contractual claims by FSDEA against QGIM will have to be dealt with in that arbitration.  On any view, and even if the arbitration is confined to the issues in relation to the Liquid Portfolio, that will involve an examination of the circumstances in which the Quantum group came to be appointed, which raises many of the issues at the heart of the dispute in these proceedings.    </p>

The location of the accounts under the Master Custody Agreement was a matter of choice for FSDEA, not a matter of contractual agreement with Mr Bastos or the Quantum group.  Under the IMA, FSDEA could have chosen to establish the custodian accounts at any bank anywhere, for example in New York.  The funds were dollar denominated and the Liquid Portfolio was invested in a range of international securities in the usual way.  The centre of gravity for the allegations in relation to investment of the Illiquid Portfolio is not in London, from where the funds were to be transferred to be invested in projects, but in the places where the events giving rise to the complaints arises: Switzerland for the decision to set up Mauritian limited partnerships and Angola or elsewhere in Africa in relation to investment in projects where a conflict of interest is complained of.  The fact that a London branch of a US Bank was chosen by FSDEA as the place of custody is of no significance to the issues in the case.  Nothing turns on the place at which the funds or securities were held. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points which are relevant to the current applications deserve emphasis.   The importance of the duty has often been emphasised in the authorities.  It is necessary to enable the Court to fulfil its own obligations to ensure fair process under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the necessary corollary of the Court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, which is a basic principle of fairness.  Derogation from that basic principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy.  If the court is to adopt that procedure where justice so requires, it must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the evidence and argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests, but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make.  It is a duty owed to the court which exists in order to ensure the integrity of the court’s process.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that although the principle is often expressed in terms of a duty of disclosure, the ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation of the application is fair in all material respects: see Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Memory Corporation v Sidhu</span> (No 2) [2000] 1 WLR1443, citing formulations from, amongst others, Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bank Mellat v Nikpour</span> [1985] FSR 87, 92, Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Siporex Trade v Comdel Commodities</span> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428, 437 and Carnwath J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Marc Rich &amp; Co Holding v Krasner</span> (18 December 1998).  This is again the consequence of the exceptional derogation from the principle of hearing both sides.  The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided.   In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case.  The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one.  He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument.  It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the duty is not confined to the applicant’s legal advisers but is a duty which rests upon the applicant itself.   It is the duty of the legal team to ensure that the lay client is aware of the duty of full and frank disclosure and what it means in practice for the purposes of the application in question; and to exercise a degree of supervision in ensuring that the duty is discharged.   No doubt in some cases this is a difficult task, particularly with clients from different legal and cultural backgrounds and with varying levels of sophistication.  But it is important that the lay client should understand and discharge the duty of full and frank disclosure, because often it will only be the client who is aware of everything which is material.  The responsibility of the applicant’s lawyers in this respect is a heavy one, commensurate with the importance which is attached to the duty itself.

It contained a detailed investment strategy and identified the key terms of the proposed commitment and fee structure.

Moreover, Mr Morris did not draw attention to the fact, as he should have done, that the August 2012 contract and December 2012 addendum were each signed not by Mr dos Santos but by Dr Manuel.   The sub-paragraph also made an unfortunate error in referring to the fees under the addendum contract as being $44 million for 6 months, amounting to $264 million.  That would indeed have been breathtaking, to use the epithet applied to fees in the Claimants’ skeleton argument, but was wrong: the fees were $44,000 monthly, giving a total of $264,000 for 6 months. </p>

The false impression is reinforced by the assertion at para 31 of the E&amp;Y report that no proposals were requested from any of the four potential managers, i.e. including Quantum, which implied that there had never been a formal proposal from Quantum.  </p>

At the least, the circumstances of the 2012 presentations and appointments are matters which reasonable enquiries should have revealed.

Mr Morris says that he and the team preparing the application were unaware of it because it was part of a set of over 750 documents which his firm held as a result of their involvement in Project Rainbow, not all of which had been reviewed.   Mr McGrath accepted that the letter ought to have been disclosed had Norton Rose Fulbright been aware of it, but sought to excuse its non-disclosure on the grounds that it was reasonable for Mr Morris to have remained unaware of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept that submission.  Given the gravity of the allegations and size of the freezing order being sought, it was incumbent on Norton Rose Fulbright to devote sufficient resources to examining all the documents it held which might contain relevant material, so that it could be satisfied that it could fulfil the duty to make a fair presentation if a without notice application was to be made.  The Project Rainbow material fell within this category, and its size provides no excuse for a failure to consider it all unless constraints of time or expense made this impossible.  Neither applies in this case.  This is especially so in circumstances in which Project Rainbow material was relied on by Mr Morris to make criticisms of Quantum: if it was interrogated for that purpose it should have been fully interrogated.   In any event Mr Fortunato was obviously aware of the letter, as a countersignatory, and reasonable inquiries would have extended to all the board members in place at the relevant times, including Mr Fortunato, who it is apparent from Mr Morris’ fifth witness statement was available to assist with the evidence on the application. </p>

On the contrary it was suggested that at least one of the improper purposes of the drawdown into the partnership accounts was “to extract management fees by reference to the entirety of the US$3 billion, even though most of it has been sitting in cash (or cash like securities)”: see the skeleton at  para 16(5)(b), and see para 16(7) which made this criticism as a matter of “the structure by which the fees were calculated”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a failure to present the stance of Northern Trust fully or fairly.  By letters of 23 February 2018 and 4 March 2018, Northern Trust made clear to FSDEA that it would not for the time being take any action to allow movement of funds from the accounts without joint and express written instructions from both FSDEA and Quantum and that it would give prior notification if it intended to change that position.  In a letter of 16 March 2018 from Northern Trust’s solicitors, largely addressed to requests for disclosure, Northern Trust reiterated that there would be no change of position without prior notification.  The first two letters were referred to in a narrative section of Mr Morris’ Affidavit but were not identified in the section on risk of dissipation, were not referred to in the skeleton argument and were not drawn to the judge’s attention.  The latter was referred to in the narrative at paragraph 147 only in respect of disclosure of documents, but was referred to at paragraph 190 of Mr Morris’ first affidavit and in the Claimants’ skeleton at 109(3) in sections addressing the risk of dissipation.  In each case the letter was referred to by treating Northern Trust’s statement that it would give prior notice as no more than a then current intention which might change without any prior warning because Northern Trust might feel obliged to follow Quantum’s instructions.  This was to mischaracterise the correspondence as a whole, which suggested that Northern Trust were caught between conflicting claims and would not take steps without the agreement of both parties.  Had the Judge been shown the correspondence, or had it fairly summarised, he would likely have concluded that there was no real risk of dissipation of any of the $2.2 billion held at Northern Trust, and in any event not without the Claimants being given sufficient advance notification to afford an opportunity to come before the Court again in those changed circumstances if necessary.  That is my view, with the result that in respect of this aspect of nondisclosure, the Claimants have not made out a case of risk of dissipation in respect of over two thirds of the amount covered by the Freezing Order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This last paragraph reflects what I said on this issue when giving judgment on the nondisclosure points at the conclusion of the hearing.  Since then, on 9 August 2018 Mr Morris wrote to the court enclosing a seventh affidavit in which he explains that there were without prejudice communications with Northern Trust in March 2018.  He had not consulted his notes when making his first affidavit, but had gone back to them in the light of the non-disclosure arguments at the hearing before me, and was now able to tell the court, having secured a limited waiver of privilege for this purpose, that in those discussions Northern Trust had “made observations with regard to the prospect, at or around the time of preparation of [Mr Morris’ first affidavit] of [Northern Trust] making a stakeholder application under Part 86 of the Civil Procedure Rules” (which it is now known was an application which was in fact prepared and about to be issued at the time of the WFO, which overtook it).  As Mr Morris fairly accepts, this confirms that what he said about Northern Trust’s stance in paragraph 190 misled the Court as to the level of risk that Northern Trust might pay out from the Limited Partnership accounts without notice.  It is regrettable, to say the least, that this matter was only drawn to the court’s attention after the hearing and after I had announced my decision in relation to non-disclosure.   </p>

In fact such an order was sought in paragraph 5(5) of the draft order put before the Judge, and such an order was made by him.  Mr McGrath has apologised for this mistake (the mistake being in the skeleton, not in the order sought), and submitted that because the Judge had clearly read the order with care he was not misled and appreciated that such an order was in fact being sought against Mr dos Santos and Mr Bastos.

The court will take into account the importance of the matters which were not disclosed, the nature and degree of culpability, and the adverse consequences to a claimant of losing protection against a risk of dissipation of assets.  It is not sufficient to justify regranting the order that it would be justified had the material matters been disclosed and a fair presentation made, because one important factor in weighing the interests of justice is the penal element of the sanction, which it is in the public interest to apply in order to promote the efficacy of the rule by encouraging others to comply.

In that respect it is penal, and applies notwithstanding that even had full and fair disclosure been made the court would have made the order.  The sanction operates not only to punish the applicant for the abuse of process, but also, as Christopher Clarke J observed in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re OJSC ANK Yugraneft v Sibir Energy PLC </span>[2010] BCCC 475 at [104], to ensure that others are deterred from such conduct in the future.  Such is the importance of the duty that in the event of any substantial breach the court inclines strongly towards setting aside the order and not renewing it, even where the breach is innocent.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the breaches taken cumulatively are serious and substantial.  They do not relate to a few, merely peripheral, matters, but to numerous matters at the heart of the Claimants’ case.  The Court was being asked to infer a dishonest conspiracy by which Mr dos Santos sought improperly to benefit his friend and associate Mr Bastos, and a consequent risk of dissipation, from four central allegations, namely (1) that Mr dos Santos was solely responsible for appointing Quantum without any proper selection process; (2) that Quantum was not properly qualified for the task; (3) the extraordinarily high and unjustified level of fees charged; and (4) the funds being used to benefit entities owned by or associated with Mr Bastos involving an undisclosed and inappropriate conflict of interest.  The non-disclosures go to one or more of these central elements of the Claimants’ case.  Proper disclosure would have put a very different complexion on the application, and it is no answer for the Claimants to say that the subsequent evidence put before the court to deal with them raises disputes which are sufficient to surmount the merits hurdle of a good arguable case.   Occasional errors in preparing the material in a case of this size and complexity can perhaps be understood.  But the unfair presentation in this case in the respects I have identified goes far beyond the odd accidental slip, and goes to the central elements of the case alleging dishonesty in support of a US$3 billion freezing order and proprietary order.  There was no urgent timescale in preparing the application, which was not precipitated, as sometimes happens, by an imminent threat of movement of funds.  The matter had obviously been under consideration for many months, at least since the E&amp;Y Report in December 2017 and Mr dos Santos’ dismissal in January 2018.  The application evidence must have been weeks in the preparation.  There is no suggestion that there was any restriction on the funding available to Norton Rose Fulbright to use a large team to make the necessary inquiries and to consider all the documents available.  Given the size of the freezing order sought, and the allegations of dishonesty being made, it was incumbent on the Claimants and their legal advisers to make the fullest inquiry into the central elements of their case if they were to proceed without notice.  Although Mr Morris emphasised in his first affidavit the limits on the inquiries which had been made by his firm, that does not excuse a failure to make the necessary inquiries or the presentation of incomplete material in an unfairly one-sided way.  </p>

Some, at least, of the material would have been readily available to anyone in a senior position and the necessity to disclose it obvious to anyone aware of the duty of disclosure.  Because privilege attaches to communications between Norton Rose Fulbright and their clients, it is impossible to identify whether any individual was aware of the duty and deliberately failed to comply with it.  What can be said, however, is that the failures were serious and should not have occurred had the duty been properly understood and complied with by the Claimants themselves.  There was therefore a high degree of culpability in the failures, even though I do not find that anyone deliberately set out to abuse the court’s process.   </p>

I should make clear, however, that I would reach the same conclusion even if satisfied of a risk of dissipation, as was implicit in my decision announced at the conclusion of the hearing.

Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.  If the defendant is not threatening to change the existing way of handling their assets, it will not be sufficient to show that such continued conduct would prejudice the claimant’s ability to enforce a judgment.  That would be contrary to the purpose of the freezing order jurisdiction because it would require defendants to change their legitimate behaviour in order to provide preferential security for the claim which the claimant would not otherwise enjoy.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no solid evidence of a risk of dissipation against Mr dos Santos.  The accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support such an inference: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos received anything from the investments of the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio, whether by receipt of part of the fees or otherwise.  There is no evidence to suggest that he has any control over the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio.  There is no suggestion or evidence that he has used offshore structures to hold or deal with his own assets.  There is no evidence of any change of behaviour in any way by Mr dos Santos as a result of the investigations into the transactions in question, of which Mr dos Santos was likely aware for at least several months prior to the without notice application, having been dismissed on 12 January 2018.  Nor is there any evidence that he conducted his affairs any differently in the politically changed environment after the summer of 2017 when his father stepped down as President.  The allegation of a risk of dissipation by him is no more than mere assertion unsupported by any solid evidence.  There was some suggestion in Mr Morris’ evidence that his asset disclosure pursuant to the WFO was incomplete so as to support such an inference, but his solicitor’s letter of 10 July 2018 adequately addresses the points made and leaves no evidence on which the court could conclude that his asset disclosure is incomplete or inadequate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the same is true of the different circumstances of Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants.  Again, the accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support an inference of a sufficient risk of dissipation: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  The particular facts of Mr Bastos’ criminal conviction many years ago, for which he ultimately was fined CHF4,500, do not support the inference of a current risk of dissipation.  There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by The Quantum group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way in the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons.  There is no evidence to suggest that the fact or threat of either the claim itself, or the freezing order, has caused or would cause any of them to act in a way which differed from their previous practice so as to make any adverse effect on the claimants’ ability to enforce a judgment something which could properly be characterised as “unjustified”.  This applies with equal force to the Mauritian Limited Partnerships: the evidence is that such  structures are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&amp;Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective explained at the time by Mr dos Santos to Mr Gonçalves (see above).   The Liquid Portfolio and the majority of the Illiquid Portfolio are secured without the need for a freezing order.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that Mr Bastos or the relevant Quantum Defendants intend to deal with the monies invested in the projects or the projects themselves otherwise than by way of promotion of the success of those projects.  There is no suggestion that Mr Bastos or the Quantum Defendants have taken any sums other than those to which there is a contractual entitlement; nor that they have dealt with them otherwise than in accordance with those contractual arrangements.  The complaint about the execution of those contractual arrangements does not support a risk of dissipation.  As the Claimants’ skeleton argument itself put it, this is not a routine case of “hands in the till” type fraud. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although this was not put in the forefront of the argument on this point, complaint was also made about the history and nature of the asset disclosure by Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants pursuant to the WFO; it was said that the failure to make proper disclosure was a continuing effort to hide assets in order to protect them from a judgment.  Whilst the dilatory nature of that disclosure is properly the subject of criticism, full purported compliance has taken place, and there is a hotly contested issue whether there has been any failure to give a full and accurate account of the defendants’ assets.  It is not clear from the evidence ultimately put before me on the point that there has been any failure to attempt full compliance in a way which would provide any support for a finding of a risk of dissipation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">90.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>For similar reasons the balance of convenience would not lie in favour of granting a proprietary injunction.  There is no evidence to suggest that Mr dos Santos has, or has ever had, any sums to which a proprietary claim could attach.  So far as Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants are concerned, I have said that I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the Claimants have established a serious issue to be tried, but the contrary is plainly arguable and a proprietary claim may well not be capable of being established.  There is no real evidential basis for concluding that the funds in the Illiquid Portfolio which have been invested in projects have not been well invested, or that in the absence of an injunction they would not continue to be managed so as to promote their profitability.  The adverse effects of the proprietary order on Mr Bastos himself appear to have been serious: he has been unable to say with certainty that any of his assets can be divorced from those received ultimately from FSDEA because his modus operandi has always been to take income through his corporate vehicles from the Quantum group as dividends so that funds have inevitably become mixed.  The effect of the proprietary injunction is therefore effectively to prevent Mr Bastos having access to any funds other than the permitted living allowance.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">91.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Mr Edey submitted, correctly in my view, that the quantum of any loss suffered by FSDEA could not be put at US$3 billion or anything like it.   Leaving aside the payment of fees, the investment of those funds was for the benefit of the Claimants who retain their equitable interest in the assets, as is and has always been common ground.  In fact, over $2.2 billion remains uninvested in accounts at Northern Trust which are sufficiently secured for the time being.  Accordingly, any present quantification of the loss is limited to (1) the fees taken by the Quantum Defendants and other Bastos related companies and (2) such loss as could be established by reference to the value of the projects in which investments have been made.  In relation to the fees there is an argument that the amount of loss is not the full amount of the fees but only the amount by which they exceeded what would have been charged by another investment manager or service provider in any event.  I have already dealt under the heading of nondisclosure with the failure fairly to address the position of Northern Trust, which itself meant that a freezing order could not be justified in the sum of US$3 billion or anything like it.  In the light of my other conclusions, it is not necessary for me to determine what, if anything, had been established as a sufficiently arguable quantum of loss for the purposes of identifying the proper amount of any freezing order or proprietary injuntion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims in support of which the WFO was granted arise out of what the Claimants contend was a dishonest conspiracy between the First Defendant, Mr dos Santos, the former Chairman of FSDEA, and his friend and business partner, the Second Defendant, Mr Bastos, who is the 95% beneficial owner of the Quantum group of companies which include the Third to Twentieth Defendants.  It is the Claimants’ case that, pursuant to this conspiracy, Mr dos Santos placed some US$5 billion at the disposal of the Quantum group to manage and invest on FSDEA’s behalf, when the Quantum group manifestly lacked the appropriate or any qualifications and experience for such a mandate; that in the event, most of the US$5 billion has not been invested at all and has simply been used by the Quantum group to extract what were described as an extraordinary levels of fees (amounting to some US$406 million); that of the limited proportion which has been invested, the investments have not been made in the interests of the Claimants but have mostly been channelled into other projects belonging to Mr Bastos; and that in addition, as part of the same conspiracy, Mr dos Santos committed FSDEA to pay around US$153 million to the Quantum and other companies controlled by Mr Bastos, under contracts for various purported services, which contracts, if genuine at all, were manifestly uncommercial and were intended mainly to divert money from FSDEA into the pockets of Mr Bastos<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span>without FSDEA receiving anything of remotely commensurate value in return.  The Defendants’ case is that they are the victims of political change in Angola and a desire on the part of those now in power to get their hands on money which the previous regime sensibly and appropriately invested on a long-term basis for the people of Angola; and that the allegations are a spurious and flawed attempt to achieve this political objective.   </p>

Its Chairman from 2012 to May 2013 was Dr Armando Manuel, who had been the Economic Adviser to President dos Santos.  In 2012 its other directors were Mr dos Santos and Mr Gonçalves.  In May 2013 Dr Manuel became the Minister of Finance of Angola, and shortly after FSDEA was renamed in June 2013, Mr dos Santos was appointed Chairman.  Mr Fortunato was at that time appointed a director.  Mr dos Santos remained Chairman until his removal in January 2018.  His fellow directors were Mr Gonçalves and Mr Fortunato until the autumn of 2016, when Mr Gago replaced Mr Fortunato.  Mr Gago had before that acted as Director of the Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 2013 until 2015.  He remains a director of FSDEA.  Mr Gonçalves remained a director of FSDEA until January 2018, since when he has acted as a consultant to it.

Part of FSDEA’s complaint is that it and the Limited Partners had no visibility or control over the monies in those accounts, which were under the control of the General Partners exercising their powers of management in relation to the Limited Partnerships.  Only part of this had been invested by the time of the freezing order.   Approximately US$2.27 billion remained at Northern Trust in liquid form at the time of the WFO, and has been secured.  The balance, apart from deduction of fees, was paid into a number of investment projects of the kind envisaged, including projects controlled by Mr Bastos. For example, it is said that the hotel partnership (the Eighth and Fifteenth Defendants) invested US$157 million in a hotel project in Angola in which Mr Bastos had an interest (although this figure is difficult to reconcile with Table 4 of the EY Report – defined in paragraph 14 below); and the infrastructure partnership (the Seventh and Fourteenth Defendants) invested US$180 million into the Port of Caio in Angola, which Mr Bastos had a concession to develop.  These are said to be stark examples of the conflicts inherent in the appointment of Quantum to manage FSDEA’s funds with Mr Bastos able to dictate the terms of major transactions from both sides of the table. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In November 2017 details of the arrangements between the Claimants and Quantum were publicly leaked and discussed in the so-called “Paradise Papers”. The Angolan government commissioned a report from Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) regarding the operation of the FSDEA, which was produced on 15 December 2017 (“the E&amp;Y Report”).   Mr dos Santos was removed as Chairman of the FSDEA on 12 January 2018.  Notice of termination of the IMA was given on 16 February 2018 and took effect two months later, on 17 April 2018.  The Liquid Portfolio was put into the hands of a replacement investment manager.  The Claimants brought these proceedings and applied for the WFO on 27 April 2018.  In the light of some of the asset disclosure given by the Defendants pursuant to the WFO, E&amp;Y updated their report on 9 July 2018 (“the Updated E&amp;Y Report”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos benefited at all from any of the arrangements complained of.  Following the termination of the IMA, the Liquid Portfolio has remained within FSDEA’s control.  Although FSDEA’s case is that Quantum was manifestly ill qualified to undertake the investment management role of the Liquid Portfolio, there is not in fact any particularised allegation that QGIM acted negligently in the choice of investments or otherwise in the handling of the Liquid Portfolio during its time as investment manager.  The complaint is not about the performance of the Liquid Portfolio investment, but about the level of fees set contractually under the IMA at 1% plus 20% above the benchmark hurdle, which EY describe in their report as “high given the size of the portfolio”, a relatively slight basis for an allegation of fraud.  The total of such fees over the life of the IMA was US$81.83m according to the Updated E&amp;Y Report.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly the argument in respect of the WFO has focussed on the Illiquid Portfolio.   The amount of the Illiquid Portfolio was US$3 billion, but at the time of the WFO some US$2.27 billion remained in the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships at Northern Trust in London.  By letters in March 2018 Northern Trust and their solicitors had made clear to the Claimants that they would not deal with those funds without the written instructions of both sides, and would not change their position without giving the Claimants prior notification.  In my view those assurances removed any risk of dissipation in justifying an order freezing that sum, which was more than two thirds of the amount frozen by the WFO.  This was the subject matter of material non-disclosure on the without notice application to Phillips J, to which I return below.  The Updated E&amp;Y Report suggests that a total of US$454m was invested in projects in the seven Mauritian funds, with the balance presumably being accounted for by fees.    </p>

This is not a case in which any of the Defendants are accused of extracting sums to which there was no contractual entitlement.  The thrust of the complaint is the creation by Mr dos Santos of that contractual entitlement.    </p>

The question therefore is where the services were, and were to be, provided by QGIM under the IMA.   FSDEA contends that this is London where the Northern Trust accounts were held.  I am unable to accept this submission.  The services to be provided by QGIM under the IMA were investment management services which involved determining how the Liquid Portfolio was to be invested in various short-term investments.  That management function was to be, and was, carried out in Switzerland where Quantum had its place of business.  That aspect of its business was regulated and supervised by the Swiss financial authorities, as the preamble to the IMA recorded at paragraph C.  QGIM had no custody of the assets, in London or elsewhere.  The IMA did not identify any place for the receipt of those instructions, which only became London as a result of FSDEA’s choice of custodianship, which might originally have been elsewhere than London and could at any time have been changed to a different location.  On any view, therefore, it cannot be said that the IMA provided for any part of the services to be performed in London.  It is true that QGIM’s investment management in Switzerland in the event resulted in instructions from Switzerland to London to the custodian of the funds in London, but that does not make London the place of performance of the services to be provided under the IMA.  Those services do not consist solely or even primarily of the investment instructions, but rather the investment management activity in determining what investments to make, which took place in Switzerland, as envisaged by the IMA. </p>

However I accept Mr Edey QC’s submission that the breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly characterised as being in a “matter relating to contract” so that allocation of jurisdiction falls to be determined in accordance with Article 5(1), not Article 5(3); and that accordingly Switzerland is the allocated jurisdiction for the same reason as for the contractual claims under the IMA.  This is because the equitable claim for breach of fiduciary duties depends upon the existence of the IMA: the duties are said to arise by virtue of the relationship created by the IMA.  The Claim Form describes them as “arising by virtue of the IMA and/or the authority thereby vested in QGIM to…handle and otherwise deal with assets belonging to the FSDEA”.

It is a claim to the property itself, and is only asserted against the holder of the property or one who is in a position to give effect to the proprietary interest.  Accordingly, in the current context the question is whether, assuming that there is a sufficiently arguable case that QGIM holds such property, the claim to enforce the proprietary interest in respect of the property against QGIM falls within Article 5(3).  Mr McGrath QC submitted that the proprietary claim fell within Article 5(3) as being in a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi delict.  Mr Edey submitted that if the proprietary claim passed the threshold merits test of raising a serious issue to be tried, it did not fall within Article 5(3).

Mr Edey submitted that there could be no proprietary claim for property which was transferred pursuant to contracts where those contracts had not been avoided or rescinded.  He accepted that the Claimants retained a beneficial interest in the investments in the Illiquid Portfolio, but submitted that those interests were held on the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreements which were long term contracts (of 10 or 15 years), such that there was no immediate entitlement to possession.  He submitted that property passed in full under the contracts (the IMA and the Limited Partnership Agreements), and unless and until they were avoided there could be no vesting of any equitable interest in the transferor.  Until very shortly before the hearing before me the Claimants had not suggested that the agreements were invalid or had been avoided, and indeed had proceeded on the basis that they remained validly in place.  Mr McGrath sought to argue before me that they were void, alternatively voidable and had been rescinded.  In my view Mr Edey was correct to submit that it was too late to run such an argument, which gave rise to issues of election and affirmation, and to allow the Claimants to do so would have been unfairly prejudicial to the Quantum Defendants, who would have been able to deploy arguments of election and affirmation.  Accordingly the question whether there is a serious issue to be tried that the Claimants have a proprietary claim falls to be addressed on the footing that the sums transferred were paid in accordance with contracts which are not void and have not been rescinded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that footing, Mr McGrath submitted that where a contract split the legal and equitable interests so as to confer a legal title whilst retaining an equitable title, there is no need to rescind or avoid the contract in order for the transferor to assert the equitable proprietary right to the property.  That was, he submitted, the effect of the contractual arrangements in this case because the funds were always invested for benefit of the Claimants who retained an equitable interest throughout; the Liquid Portfolio was held in accounts in the name of FSDEA and funds for the Illiquid Portfolio were transferred into the Limited Partnership accounts by instructions from FSDEA to QGIM which expressly purported to retain “ultimate beneficial ownership” in the funds.  This argument does not work for the fees in respect of the Liquid Portfolio, where it was intended by the IMA that legal and beneficial interest in the fees should pass to QGIM.  However, the main issue on this point was whether there was a sufficiently arguable proprietary claim to the sums transferred in the Illiquid Portfolio because the challenge is aimed at the proprietary element of the WFO, which is confined in amount to $3 billion to reflect such transfer. So far as that is concerned I was referred to a number of authorities on each side.  This is an issue which raises difficult questions of law which will have to be applied to the facts once established.  I am inclined to the view that the Claimants have met the relatively low merits threshold of a serious issue to be tried.  However I do not propose to explore the legal issues in this judgment which would fall to be addressed in the light of the fact specific circumstances once established, nor to </p>

The passage relied upon does not support the suggested principle, and the suggested principle is inconsistent with the essence of the tort which is that if lawful means are deployed a conspiracy can only be unlawful if it involves a predominant intention to injure the claimant.  If the predominant intention is to benefit the conspirators, by definition the predominant intention cannot be to injure the claimant, even if such injury is the inevitable result and even if it is intended.

He submitted that under Article 4 of the Rome II Convention the question was governed by Angolan Law; and that there was no evidence that Angolan law recognised such causes of action.  The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence before me simply did not purport to address the question whether Angolan law recognised a liability based on facts which would in English law establish liability for unlawful means conspiracy or dishonest assistance constructive trust.  Accordingly, even if the appropriate law is Angolan law, the Court proceeds on the evidential assumption that Angolan law does not differ from English law in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

The starting point is that there are arbitrations in Mauritius which involve the disputes between the Limited Partners and the General Partners in relation to the Illiquid Portfolio, to which the Limited Partnerships are arguably properly joined parties.  There are also winding up proceedings commenced by the Limited Partners in Mauritius which will raise some of the issues which arise in these proceedings.  There is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention over certain of the claims against QGIM (D3) and over the proprietary claim against QGAI (D6), who must be sued in Switzerland; and in any event, even were jurisdiction otherwise to be established, any claims by FSDEA against QGIM would have to be stayed in favour of arbitration in Portugal.  It is FSDEA’s case that the IMA (and therefore its arbitration clause) governs the Illiquid as well as the Liquid Portfolio.  Accordingly, on the Claimants’ case, all the tortious and contractual claims by FSDEA against QGIM will have to be dealt with in that arbitration.  On any view, and even if the arbitration is confined to the issues in relation to the Liquid Portfolio, that will involve an examination of the circumstances in which the Quantum group came to be appointed, which raises many of the issues at the heart of the dispute in these proceedings.    </p>

Article 3 provides: that “<span style="font-style:italic">Public agents should, in performance of their duties, be guided by the following principles: (a) principle of legality (b) principle of public probity (c) principle of competence (d) principle of respect for public property (e) principle of impartiality (f) principle of the pursuit of public interest….(j) principle of prudence (k) principle of loyalty to public institutions and entities and to the higher interests of the State.</span>”  The subsequent articles develop these principles, again using language of some generality (e.g. “<span style="font-style:italic">the highest criteria for public professionalism</span>”).

Under the IMA, FSDEA could have chosen to establish the custodian accounts at any bank anywhere, for example in New York.  The funds were dollar denominated and the Liquid Portfolio was invested in a range of international securities in the usual way.  The centre of gravity for the allegations in relation to investment of the Illiquid Portfolio is not in London, from where the funds were to be transferred to be invested in projects, but in the places where the events giving rise to the complaints arises: Switzerland for the decision to set up Mauritian limited partnerships and Angola or elsewhere in Africa in relation to investment in projects where a conflict of interest is complained of.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Three points which are relevant to the current applications deserve emphasis.   The importance of the duty has often been emphasised in the authorities.  It is necessary to enable the Court to fulfil its own obligations to ensure fair process under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the necessary corollary of the Court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, which is a basic principle of fairness.  Derogation from that basic principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy.  If the court is to adopt that procedure where justice so requires, it must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the evidence and argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests, but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make.  It is a duty owed to the court which exists in order to ensure the integrity of the court’s process.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second is that although the principle is often expressed in terms of a duty of disclosure, the ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation of the application is fair in all material respects: see Robert Walker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Memory Corporation v Sidhu</span> (No 2) [2000] 1 WLR1443, citing formulations from, amongst others, Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bank Mellat v Nikpour</span> [1985] FSR 87, 92, Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Siporex Trade v Comdel Commodities</span> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428, 437 and Carnwath J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Marc Rich &amp; Co Holding v Krasner</span> (18 December 1998).  This is again the consequence of the exceptional derogation from the principle of hearing both sides.  The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided.   In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case.  The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one.  He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument.  It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the duty is not confined to the applicant’s legal advisers but is a duty which rests upon the applicant itself.   It is the duty of the legal team to ensure that the lay client is aware of the duty of full and frank disclosure and what it means in practice for the purposes of the application in question; and to exercise a degree of supervision in ensuring that the duty is discharged.   No doubt in some cases this is a difficult task, particularly with clients from different legal and cultural backgrounds and with varying levels of sophistication.  But it is important that the lay client should understand and discharge the duty of full and frank disclosure, because often it will only be the client who is aware of everything which is material.  The responsibility of the applicant’s lawyers in this respect is a heavy one, commensurate with the importance which is attached to the duty itself.  It may be likened to the duties of solicitors in relation to disclosure of documents (see CPR PD31A and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hedrich v Standard Bank London Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 905). </p>

For example, at paragraph 94(a) of Mr Morris’ first affidavit he referred to a contract and addendum with Stampa and Equus for IT services.  This was one of the services contracts put forward as an example of companies associated with Mr Bastos extracting unjustifiably large fees.  Mr Morris emphasised in this paragraph of his affidavit that the addendum was signed on 18 December 2012, 11 months before FSDEA entered into the IMA, and </p>

Moreover, Mr Morris did not draw attention to the fact, as he should have done, that the August 2012 contract and December 2012 addendum were each signed not by Mr dos Santos but by Dr Manuel.   The sub-paragraph also made an unfortunate error in referring to the fees under the addendum contract as being $44 million for 6 months, amounting to $264 million.  That would indeed have been breathtaking, to use the epithet applied to fees in the Claimants’ skeleton argument, but was wrong: the fees were $44,000 monthly, giving a total of $264,000 for 6 months. </p>

The false impression is reinforced by the assertion at para 31 of the E&amp;Y report that no proposals were requested from any of the four potential managers, i.e. including Quantum, which implied that there had never been a formal proposal from Quantum.  </p>

At the least, the circumstances of the 2012 presentations and appointments are matters which reasonable enquiries should have revealed.

Mr Morris says that he and the team preparing the application were unaware of it because it was part of a set of over 750 documents which his firm held as a result of their involvement in Project Rainbow, not all of which had been reviewed.   Mr McGrath accepted that the letter ought to have been disclosed had Norton Rose Fulbright been aware of it, but sought to excuse its non-disclosure on the grounds that it was reasonable for Mr Morris to have remained unaware of it.  I am afraid I cannot accept that submission.  Given the gravity of the allegations and size of the freezing order being sought, it was incumbent on Norton Rose Fulbright to devote sufficient resources to examining all the documents it held which might contain relevant material, so that it could be satisfied that it could fulfil the duty to make a fair presentation if a without notice application was to be made.  The Project Rainbow material fell within this category, and its size provides no excuse for a failure to consider it all unless constraints of time or expense made this impossible.  Neither applies in this case.  This is especially so in circumstances in which Project Rainbow material was relied on by Mr Morris to make criticisms of Quantum: if it was interrogated for that purpose it should have been fully interrogated.   In any event Mr Fortunato was obviously aware of the letter, as a countersignatory, and reasonable inquiries would have extended to all the board members in place at the relevant times, including Mr Fortunato, who it is apparent from Mr Morris’ fifth witness statement was available to assist with the evidence on the application. </p>

Moreover, the amount of the fees which would be charged had been identified in the presentations to FSDEA in 2012, which set out the 2 plus 20 structure for the infrastructure portfolio and the 2.5 plus 20 structure for the hotel portfolio, again a matter not drawn to the Judge’s attention.   These fees should not have been included in the total of fees described as “breathtaking” or “extraordinary” without this being made clear.  These fees accounted for over half of the total level of fees on the figures then relied on ($263.4m out of $515.84m).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a failure to present the stance of Northern Trust fully or fairly.  By letters of 23 February 2018 and 4 March 2018, Northern Trust made clear to FSDEA that it would not for the time being take any action to allow movement of funds from the accounts without joint and express written instructions from both FSDEA and Quantum and that it would give prior notification if it intended to change that position.  In a letter of 16 March 2018 from Northern Trust’s solicitors, largely addressed to requests for disclosure, Northern Trust reiterated that there would be no change of position without prior notification.  The first two letters were referred to in a narrative section of Mr Morris’ Affidavit but were not identified in the section on risk of dissipation, were not referred to in the skeleton argument and were not drawn to the judge’s attention.  The latter was referred to in the narrative at paragraph 147 only in respect of disclosure of documents, but was referred to at paragraph 190 of Mr Morris’ first affidavit and in the Claimants’ skeleton at 109(3) in sections addressing the risk of dissipation.  In each case the letter was referred to by treating Northern Trust’s statement that it would give prior notice as no more than a then current intention which might change without any prior warning because Northern Trust might feel obliged to follow Quantum’s instructions.  This was to mischaracterise the correspondence as a whole, which suggested that Northern Trust were caught between conflicting claims and would not take steps without the agreement of both parties.  Had the Judge been shown the correspondence, or had it fairly summarised, he would likely have concluded that there was no real risk of dissipation of any of the $2.2 billion held at Northern Trust, and in any event not without the Claimants being given sufficient advance notification to afford an opportunity to come before the Court again in those changed circumstances if necessary.  That is my view, with the result that in respect of this aspect of nondisclosure, the Claimants have not made out a case of risk of dissipation in respect of over two thirds of the amount covered by the Freezing Order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This last paragraph reflects what I said on this issue when giving judgment on the nondisclosure points at the conclusion of the hearing.  Since then, on 9 August 2018 Mr Morris wrote to the court enclosing a seventh affidavit in which he explains that there were without prejudice communications with Northern Trust in March 2018.  He had not consulted his notes when making his first affidavit, but had gone back to them in the light of the non-disclosure arguments at the hearing before me, and was now able to tell the court, having secured a limited waiver of privilege for this purpose, that in those discussions Northern Trust had “made observations with regard to the prospect, at or around the time of preparation of [Mr Morris’ first affidavit] of [Northern Trust] making a stakeholder application under Part 86 of the Civil Procedure Rules” (which it is now known was an application which was in fact prepared and about to be issued at the time of the WFO, which overtook it).  As Mr Morris fairly accepts, this confirms that what he said about Northern Trust’s stance in paragraph 190 misled the Court as to the level of risk that Northern Trust might pay out from the Limited Partnership accounts without notice.  It is regrettable, to say the least, that this matter was only drawn to the court’s attention after the hearing and after I had announced my decision in relation to non-disclosure.   </p>

In fact such an order was sought in paragraph 5(5) of the draft order put before the Judge, and such an order was made by him.  Mr McGrath has apologised for this mistake (the mistake being in the skeleton, not in the order sought), and submitted that because the Judge had clearly read the order with care he was not misled and appreciated that such an order was in fact being sought against Mr dos Santos and Mr Bastos.

The court will take into account the importance of the matters which were not disclosed, the nature and degree of culpability, and the adverse consequences to a claimant of losing protection against a risk of dissipation of assets.  It is not sufficient to justify regranting the order that it would be justified had the material matters been disclosed and a fair presentation made, because one important factor in weighing the interests of justice is the penal element of the sanction, which it is in the public interest to apply in order to promote the efficacy of the rule by encouraging others to comply.

In that respect it is penal, and applies notwithstanding that even had full and fair disclosure been made the court would have made the order.  The sanction operates not only to punish the applicant for the abuse of process, but also, as Christopher Clarke J observed in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re OJSC ANK Yugraneft v Sibir Energy PLC </span>[2010] BCCC 475 at [104], to ensure that others are deterred from such conduct in the future.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the breaches taken cumulatively are serious and substantial.  They do not relate to a few, merely peripheral, matters, but to numerous matters at the heart of the Claimants’ case.  The Court was being asked to infer a dishonest conspiracy by which Mr dos Santos sought improperly to benefit his friend and associate Mr Bastos, and a consequent risk of dissipation, from four central allegations, namely (1) that Mr dos Santos was solely responsible for appointing Quantum without any proper selection process; (2) that Quantum was not properly qualified for the task; (3) the extraordinarily high and unjustified level of fees charged; and (4) the funds being used to benefit entities owned by or associated with Mr Bastos involving an undisclosed and inappropriate conflict of interest.  The non-disclosures go to one or more of these central elements of the Claimants’ case.  Proper disclosure would have put a very different complexion on the application, and it is no answer for the Claimants to say that the subsequent evidence put before the court to deal with them raises disputes which are sufficient to surmount the merits hurdle of a good arguable case.   Occasional errors in preparing the material in a case of this size and complexity can perhaps be understood.  But the unfair presentation in this case in the respects I have identified goes far beyond the odd accidental slip, and goes to the central elements of the case alleging dishonesty in support of a US$3 billion freezing order and proprietary order.  There was no urgent timescale in preparing the application, which was not precipitated, as sometimes happens, by an imminent threat of movement of funds.  The matter had obviously been under consideration for many months, at least since the E&amp;Y Report in December 2017 and Mr dos Santos’ dismissal in January 2018.  The application evidence must have been weeks in the preparation.  There is no suggestion that there was any restriction on the funding available to Norton Rose Fulbright to use a large team to make the necessary inquiries and to consider all the documents available.  Given the size of the freezing order sought, and the allegations of dishonesty being made, it was incumbent on the Claimants and their legal advisers to make the fullest inquiry into the central elements of their case if they were to proceed without notice.  Although Mr Morris emphasised in his first affidavit the limits on the inquiries which had been made by his firm, that does not excuse a failure to make the necessary inquiries or the presentation of incomplete material in an unfairly one-sided way.  </p>

I do not find that there was any deliberate breach on the part of the Claimants’ legal team.  It is less clear whether that is so of the personnel at FSDEA itself.  Some, at least, of the material would have been readily available to anyone in a senior position and the necessity to disclose it obvious to anyone aware of the duty of disclosure.  Because privilege attaches to communications between Norton Rose Fulbright and their clients, it is impossible to identify whether any individual was aware of the duty and deliberately failed to comply with it.  What can be said, however, is that the failures were serious and should not have occurred had the duty been properly understood and complied with by the Claimants themselves.  There was therefore a high degree of culpability in the failures, even though I do not find that anyone deliberately set out to abuse the court’s process.   </p>

I should make clear, however, that I would reach the same conclusion even if satisfied of a risk of dissipation, as was implicit in my decision announced at the conclusion of the hearing. The breaches of duty are sufficiently serious and culpable to warrant discharging the WFO and not granting fresh relief, irrespective of the other grounds of challenge.   </p>

A freezing order is not intended to stop a corporate defendant from dealing with its assets in the normal course of its business.  Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.  If the defendant is not threatening to change the existing way of handling their assets, it will not be sufficient to show that such continued conduct would prejudice the claimant’s ability to enforce a judgment.

There is no evidence that Mr dos Santos received anything from the investments of the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio, whether by receipt of part of the fees or otherwise.  There is no evidence to suggest that he has any control over the Liquid or Illiquid Portfolio.  There is no suggestion or evidence that he has used offshore structures to hold or deal with his own assets.  There is no evidence of any change of behaviour in any way by Mr dos Santos as a result of the investigations into the transactions in question, of which Mr dos Santos was likely aware for at least several months prior to the without notice application, having been dismissed on 12 January 2018.  Nor is there any evidence that he conducted his affairs any differently in the politically changed environment after the summer of 2017 when his father stepped down as President.  The allegation of a risk of dissipation by him is no more than mere assertion unsupported by any solid evidence.  There was some suggestion in Mr Morris’ evidence that his asset disclosure pursuant to the WFO was incomplete so as to support such an inference, but his solicitor’s letter of 10 July 2018 adequately addresses the points made and leaves no evidence on which the court could conclude that his asset disclosure is incomplete or inadequate.   </p>

Again, the accepted good arguable case of dishonesty does not support an inference of a sufficient risk of dissipation: the matters complained of were transparent to other senior figures within FSDEA at the time of Quantum’s selection and at all material times thereafter; and is in any event matched by a respectable case that there was no dishonesty.  The particular facts of Mr Bastos’ criminal conviction many years ago, for which he ultimately was fined CHF4,500, do not support the inference of a current risk of dissipation.  There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by The Quantum group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way in the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons.  There is no evidence to suggest that the fact or threat of either the claim itself, or the freezing order, has caused or would cause any of them to act in a way which differed from their previous practice so as to make any adverse effect on the claimants’ ability to enforce a judgment something which could properly be characterised as “unjustified”.  This applies with equal force to the Mauritian Limited Partnerships: the evidence is that such  structures are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&amp;Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective explained at the time by Mr dos Santos to Mr Gonçalves (see above).   The Liquid Portfolio and the majority of the Illiquid Portfolio are secured without the need for a freezing order.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that Mr Bastos or the relevant Quantum Defendants intend to deal with the monies invested in the projects or the projects themselves otherwise than by way of promotion of the success of those projects.  There is no suggestion that Mr Bastos or the Quantum Defendants have taken any sums other than those to which there is a contractual entitlement; nor that they have dealt with them otherwise than in accordance with those contractual arrangements.  The complaint about the execution of those contractual arrangements does not support a risk of dissipation.  As the Claimants’ skeleton argument itself put it, this is not a routine case of “hands in the till” type fraud. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although this was not put in the forefront of the argument on this point, complaint was also made about the history and nature of the asset disclosure by Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants pursuant to the WFO; it was said that the failure to make proper disclosure was a continuing effort to hide assets in order to protect them from a judgment.  Whilst the dilatory nature of that disclosure is properly the subject of criticism, full purported compliance has taken place, and there is a hotly contested issue whether there has been any failure to give a full and accurate account of the defendants’ assets.  It is not clear from the evidence ultimately put before me on the point that there has been any failure to attempt full compliance in a way which would provide any support for a finding of a risk of dissipation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">90.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>For similar reasons the balance of convenience would not lie in favour of granting a proprietary injunction.  There is no evidence to suggest that Mr dos Santos has, or has ever had, any sums to which a proprietary claim could attach.  So far as Mr Bastos and the Quantum Defendants are concerned, I have said that I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the Claimants have established a serious issue to be tried, but the contrary is plainly arguable and a proprietary claim may well not be capable of being established.  There is no real evidential basis for concluding that the funds in the Illiquid Portfolio which have been invested in projects have not been well invested, or that in the absence of an injunction they would not continue to be managed so as to promote their profitability.  The adverse effects of the proprietary order on Mr Bastos himself appear to have been serious: he has been unable to say with certainty that any of his assets can be divorced from those received ultimately from FSDEA because his modus operandi has always been to take income through his corporate vehicles from the Quantum group as dividends so that funds have inevitably become mixed.  The effect of the proprietary injunction is therefore effectively to prevent Mr Bastos having access to any funds other than the permitted living allowance.     </p>

Leaving aside the payment of fees, the investment of those funds was for the benefit of the Claimants who retain their equitable interest in the assets, as is and has always been common ground.  In fact, over $2.2 billion remains uninvested in accounts at Northern Trust which are sufficiently secured for the time being.  Accordingly, any present quantification of the loss is limited to (1) the fees taken by the Quantum Defendants and other Bastos related companies and (2) such loss as could be established by reference to the value of the projects in which investments have been made.  In relation to the fees there is an argument that the amount of loss is not the full amount of the fees but only the amount by which they exceeded what would have been charged by another investment manager or service provider in any event.  I have already dealt under the heading of nondisclosure with the failure fairly to address the position of Northern Trust, which itself meant that a freezing order could not be justified in the sum of US$3 billion or anything like it.  In the light of my other conclusions, it is not necessary for me to determine what, if anything, had been established as a sufficiently arguable quantum of loss for the purposes of identifying the proper amount of any freezing order or proprietary injuntion. </p>
