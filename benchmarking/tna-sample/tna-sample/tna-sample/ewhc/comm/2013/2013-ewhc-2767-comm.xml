Since early 1999 when Robert Kozel exercised an option to buy 10,000 shares it has been beneficially owned by all three Kozel brothers in equal shares. Frank Kozel is entitled to a 25% share of the profits. Texas is primarily involved in the development and production of oil and gas from wells located in the Appalachian basin with operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York State, where it has interests in over 1,800 producing oil and gas wells.</p>

But board level decisions, however informally taken, were made by the board. Mr Kozel did not have power to take such decisions unilaterally. After Mr Kozel resigned as President and CEO in 2003 Robert Kozel was in charge at Pittsburgh. Mr Kozel’s day to day involvement with Texas ceased and his overall involvement with Texas decreased (being confined to receiving drilling and other reports and being consulted as a director) save that the operation of the Collaboration Agreement was very much his responsibility. His brothers expected him, subject to any direction or decision of the Board, to take charge of it. They did not expect to be, and were not, copied in on every, or even every significant, email.</p>

But he was not paid by Texas until 2010. It appears that, until at least 2009, his real employment was at Gulf (including at an early stage acting as the interface with the Texas personnel who were performing services for Gulf under certain Management Services Agreements – see para 51) and his employment was dressed up as employment with Texas in order that he could obtain a US visa<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">

Mr Kozel said that Mr Al Khaldi had agreed to act as Texas’ representative if something did transpire in Kurdistan; but, even if that is so, as will become apparent, so far as Texas was concerned it bowed out of Kurdistan.

Gulf did not have the power to compel Texas to act nor vice versa.

He is not an expert as to the approach of investment banks seeking to raise equity or on private equity investment in oil and gas projects. His basic thesis – that Excalibur’s lack of a management team with any financial or technical competence would not have been an insurmountable obstacle to the raising of finance given the appetite for investment in Kurdistan and that can-do investment banks would assist in securing the necessary changes – was inherently unconvincing.</p>

He did not refer to the fact, of which he was ignorant, that Excalibur was, in essence, a nameplate. He was unaware when giving evidence that Excalibur had no board of directors or shareholders. In his third report he considered in some detail the example of a company called Vast, which he described as a very small player which did not appear to have any international expertise or credentials, as comparable to Excalibur.

It also had cash assets of about <br/>$ 82.5 million and an experienced management team. He initially suggested (wrongly) that it was common ground between him and Mr Wilkinson, the defendants’ expert, that the capital and appetite available for listed and unlisted private placements were the same; and said that, insofar as there was a difference, there was no reason to suppose that Excalibur could not achieve listing relatively quickly. This was (a) inconsistent with what he had said in a joint memorandum; and (b) wrong. He wrongly suggested that UBS did not get involved in Kurdistan projects.</p>

In his first report he was not prepared to opine on the likelihood of Excalibur being able to raise finance because he did not know enough about the company to express a view. In the joint report with Mr Wilkinson he said that it was speculative as to what Excalibur would have been able to do by way of fundraising and in what time frame. By the time of the third report he was clear that “<span style="font-style:italic">subject to the title defect</span>” it was far more likely than not that it would have raised the necessary finance. The content of his first and third reports had to be revised in the course of his cross examination in a significant way. He sought to advance the proposition that the Collaboration Agreement gave rise to an indirect interest without being able to identify with any precision how that might be so.</p>

That is in no sense a criticism. Valuation of an exploration opportunity is not an exact science (although there are well recognised methods). The basis on which someone considering investment may value an asset is a function of the method, assumptions and approach that he is minded to take. When, however, the court seeks to assess a value it should, in the first place, look, if it can, to a valuation provided by someone of the competence and thoroughness of Mr Rogers.</p>

But enormous costs are involved in finding out whether hydrocarbons are present at any location in commercially exploitable quantities. The results of exploration are, as it is said, binary: either the oil is there or it is not. If it is not, the expense of looking for it is wasted with serious or even catastrophic economic consequences, particularly for a small oil company, such as Gulf, without a diverse portfolio. Even if there has been a “successful” exploration well, further exploration may reveal that the necessary volume of commercially exploitable oil or gas is not there. Investing in the oil and gas business in Kurdistan involved several different types of risk: exploration, technical, and political.</p>

	      </authorialNote>. But the view may well turn out to be no more than a bad guess. Even the seepage of oil or gas from the surface, which was apparent in Shaikan, may mislead. It indicates that there was a reservoir structure at some stage with a significant amount of hydrocarbons. But it may also signify that oil has leaked away from the underground trap because the cap rock is ineffective or has been ruptured. Talisman and Niko Resources declined to farm in to Shaikan in 2008 out of concern about the effectiveness of the reservoir trap. One geologist at the University of Mosul had written a thesis with a very negative conclusion about Shaikan’s prospectivity.</p>

The presence of toxic hydrogen sulphide has been a major factor. Access to drilling locations has been difficult as a result of which Gulf International has had to carry out more difficult directional drilling. The absence of available service contractors and equipment has increased prices and required the commissioning of a new rig in Houston.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Investing in oil exploration in Kurdistan involved significant political risks. Saddam Hussein was overthrown in April 2003. In May 2003 the Coalition Provisional Authority (“CPA”) was established and lasted until the end of June 2004. On 8 March 2004 the CPA “<span style="font-style:italic">Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period</span>” came into force. The Law recognised the provinces of Dohuk, Erbil and Suleimaniyah as an autonomous region. On 15 October 2005 a new Constitution for Iraq was approved by referendum. It entered into force in<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>2006 on the formation of a government pursuant to it. Under it Iraqi Kurdistan was recognised as an autonomous region with the three provinces forming governorates, and the KRG became its regional government. By 2007 the Constitution was, therefore, only two years old and its durability uncertain.</p>

The Iraqi Federal Government, dominated by non-Kurds, disputes this. It takes the position that the PSCs awarded by the KRG are invalid. On <span style="font-weight:bold">26 November 2007</span> Hussain al-Shahristani, the Federal Oil Minister, wrote to MOL, which had just signed the Shaikan and Akri-Bijeel PSCs, declaring the annulment of all the contracts recently signed with the KRG’s Ministry of Oil and Natural Resources.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The risk that the PSCs will be annulled has receded over the years; and is now unlikely, but still possible. In 2007 it was markedly more pronounced. The Federal Government threatened to blacklist any companies entering into PSCs with the KRG. This probably accounts for the absence of the larger international oil companies (“IOCs”) from participation in the Kurdistan region upstream sector in 2007. The US Government supported the Federal Government, taking the position that US companies should deal with the Federal Government and not the KRG in respect of petroleum matters. In July 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq indicated that Hess would be excluded from licence activities in southern Iraq after it signed PSCs with the KRG. A number of companies, including Exxon Mobil, declined to participate in Kurdistan as a result of pressure from the Federal Government.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The dispute between the KRG and the Federal Government remains unresolved. As a result no Federal Petroleum Legislation has been agreed or enacted by the Iraq Council of Ministers or the Council of Representatives. When agreement is reached and a Federal Energy Law is passed, as will probably occur sometime, existing contracts may be challenged or reviewed, as in 2007 the Iraqi Oil Minister warned would happen, and such contracts might have to be renegotiated (as the price of the Federal Government approving the PSC), or they might be compulsorily altered. In my judgment, reached in 2013 in the light of the views of Mr Codd and Mr Park, the likelihood now (after hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in oil in Kurdistan) is that any amendment required would be limited to a fairly modest reduction in the value of the contractors’ terms (e.g. royalty rates, profit oil percentages) – perhaps in the order of single figure percentages. But it is impossible to be certain; and the position in 2007 was less clear. Whilst annulment or major amendment was unlikely it was still a risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Federal Government owns and controls (though its agency North Oil Company) the only currently available oil export pipeline, the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, whose use is governed by a treaty between Turkey and Iraq, and which passes through Kurdistan for a few kilometres at Faysh Khabur. As a result it has a monopoly over oil exports. Companies which entered into PSCs ran (and run) the risk that they would not have access to the pipeline and thus to the international oil market and might be limited to selling, at much lower prices, to the local market. By the time that Mr Gerstenlauer gave evidence in December 2012 Gulf, which had made minimal use of the pipeline, had done the preliminary design work, and was getting towards final construction design, for a 122 km pipeline with a capacity of about 400,000 barrels a day feeding from Shaikan into the existing Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, was waiting for the go ahead; and expected construction to start in 2013. In May 2012 the KRG had also recently announced that it was planning a new 1 million barrel a day pipeline from Kurdistan to the Turkish border to reach the border by August 2012 with a second pipeline connecting to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline intended for 2014. Up until at least the time of Mr Gerstenlauer’s first statement Gulf had trucked the small amount of oil which it exported from limited production at the Shaikan-1 and Shaikan-3 wells to Faysh Khabur.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Federal Government also has a monopoly on the marketing of official oil exports, which is carried out by the State Oil Marketing Organisation (“SOMO”). SOMO decides at what price it will sell oil that has passed down the pipeline and it collects all oil revenues. SOMO should then pay to the KRG the sale price less transportation costs. The KRG should then distribute the share due to the companies under the terms of their PSCs (some of it being a royalty to the KRG, some being cost oil, and some, to the extent that there are no costs to be paid, profit oil for the KRG and the other parties). In fact pending resolution of the Federal Oil and Revenue sharing laws SOMO has decided that the KRG shall be reimbursed a proportion of the revenues which it treats as cost oil, which is to go to the contractors to defray their costs. The value of Iraq’s total production of oil and gas is, under the Constitution, supposed to be shared between the different regions in proportion to their populations. Kurdistan’s proportion is 17% and, as I understood from Mr Codd, the KRG is waiting to receive it, although it has been paid more than cost oil from time to time. But most of the contractors have not yet received any profit oil. Receipt of this awaits resolution of the dispute with Baghdad or a new pipeline from Kurdistan to Turkey.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The oil companies are, thus, at risk that a dispute between the KRG and the Federal Government/SOMO cuts off or reduces oil revenues in which they are entitled to share. This risk is not theoretical. Oil exports began in May 2009 but were suspended by the KRG in September/October 2009 until February 2011 as a result of a dispute between the Federal Government and the KRG over the division of oil revenues. Exports were again suspended in April 2012 because the KRG did not receive its share of the revenues from SOMO for 10 months. Production had to be diverted to the local market. When payment was eventually made to the KRG it was said by the Federal Government to be for reimbursement of contractor costs. What the oil companies then received was just a lump sum. Exports were resumed from 1 August 2012, but on the basis, as Dr Hawrami made clear in a letter to the then current major exporters of oil, that this was only temporary pending payment of the substantial sums owed to the KRG from previous export periods.</p>

From 2007 onwards the position eased although personal security is still a concern. Gulf personnel stopped wearing bullet proof vests for visits after the first Erbil visit in June 2006.

Kurdistan was of particular interest because of its untapped natural resources and pro-American population (protected for a decade by the US–led No-Fly Zone). He had friends in Washington who were involved in helping the Kurds and who had maintained close ties with them, and he knew members of the US military and intelligence community with connections in Kurdistan. He made plans with Jas Dhillon, managing director of Pivotal Ventures, a USC alumnus and venture capitalist for whom he had worked in 2002 and 2003 and who had been his mentor, and David Halpert, managing partner of the New York hedge fund Prince Street Capital Management, who was interested in working on a fund to rebuild Iraq.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The IRF registered to apply to OPIC for political risk insurance. On <span style="font-weight:bold">23 June 2004</span> it entered into a framework agreement with OPIC whereby OPIC set out the terms on which “<span style="font-style:italic">it may</span>” provide a letter of commitment for one or more contracts of insurance subject to approval by the OPIC investment committee. The agreement required numerous conditions to be satisfied. On <span style="font-weight:bold">1 July 2004</span> the IRF made a further application to OPIC for political risk insurance, envisaging an initial investment of $ 50 million, with $ 25 million to follow, in respect of the construction of a ready mix cement plant. On <span style="font-weight:bold">27 July 2004</span> OPIC agreed to reserve $ 50 million capacity to issue contracts of insurance until 30 September 2004 (extendable at OPIC’s discretion and subject to renegotiation of the terms) subject to numerous conditions precedent. Nothing ever came of this. No application was ever made in respect of oil exploration.</p>

In the event the IRF never raised any money for any specific project nor was any money ever invested in it. Nor did anything come of another fund intended to focus on oil and gas ventures, called Thames Chesapeake LLP, which was to be a Cayman Islands limited partnership, whose investment manager (the “Manager”) was to be a Cayman company, which was to be owned by Excalibur and Fuel Handling Systems, a company owned by Mr Iain Kinnear (see para 129). The Manager was to own the General Partner, another Cayman company.</p>

On <span style="font-weight:bold">31 October 2004</span> he wrote a letter on IRF paper on behalf of Excalibur and the IRF to the Ministry with the proposal. In his letter he said that the IRF, which was described as a “<span style="font-style:italic">financing vehicle designed to provide US Government backing and insurance</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">will finance this project</span>” and would insure the project against political risks; that Excalibur was managing “<span style="font-style:italic">this unique US Government insured financing vehicle</span>”; and that KBR was the “<span style="font-style:italic">lead EPC contractor</span>”. In fact the IRF had no funding or commitment to funding and there was no firm commitment from OPIC to the IRF to insure. There was also no contract between Excalibur and KBR, only an expressly non contractual memorandum of understanding providing for evaluation of opportunities for a possible strategic partnership and development of ventures in Iraq where KBR would “<span style="font-style:italic">potentially conduct lead contractor functions</span>”.</p>

He was a retired member of the KRG and a continuing senior member of the KDP. At the time Dabin’s focus was on construction and real estate development but it was interested in expanding into infrastructure and petroleum projects.

Dr Yacu was Vice President of the Oil &amp; Gas Establishment, set up by Law No 38 of the Kurdish National Assembly. Mr Wempen had several meetings with Dr Yacu, who suggested that the best way for Excalibur to proceed would be to bring an independent oil company to Kurdistan to operate a petroleum block on its behalf with whom it could co-invest during exploration and development. He made it clear that whatever oil company was brought in would need to be a US company because the KRG wished to be seen to be awarding concessions to US companies. The KRG wanted a US led consortium (a) because it was friendly towards the US and grateful for its assistance; and (b) because the presence of US interests in Kurdistan would be likely to provide some form of protection against hostile incursions, including from Baghdad itself<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is unlikely that Mr Al-Qabandi gave anything approaching a commitment as opposed to suggesting a possibility. Mr Wempen had not yet met Mr Kozel, who would be the immediate person to make a decision about the prospect of either Texas or Gulf joining up with Excalibur. Mr Al-Qabandi was Gulf’s business development director and his role was to pass things on, not to make decisions about what Gulf, let alone Texas, would participate in. The likelihood is – as Mr Kozel later understood from Mr Al-Qabandi – that Mr Kinnear had thought that Gulf was US owned and had approached Mr Al-Qabandi on that footing. When it became apparent that Mr Wempen needed a US company, Mr Al-Qabandi told him of Mr Kozel’s involvement with Texas and may well have discussed the possibility of involving both Texas and Gulf.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Mr Kozel, Mr Wempen told him that there was an opportunity to acquire a licence in respect of the Taq Taq field, where oil had already been discovered (i.e. a proven field). He said that Excalibur needed an American flag oil company to operate the licence because that is what the Kurdish authorities required and was the only way in which OPIC insurance could be obtained. Mr Wempen said that Excalibur already had an institutional backer in place in the form of UBS. He wanted Texas to enter into a joint venture with Excalibur and for Excalibur to have at least 50% of the contract. He originally asked for 80% or something like it on the footing that Excalibur had UBS as a backer. Mr Kozel said he would only be interested if Texas was the operator and had at least 51% of the equity, pointing out that, however big the size of their backer, Excalibur was inviting Texas to invest millions of dollars without itself having the necessary experience or expertise. Mr Wempen understood the difference between Texas and Gulf, which Mr Kozel explained to him. Mr Kozel said that, since it was only Texas that was a US company, which is what the KRG required and Mr Wempen was looking for, Mr Kozel was, for the purpose of any deal, representing Texas. The possibility of Gulf having the chance to participate at a later stage was discussed<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Mr Wempen, he said that the KRG wanted a US company to lead the consortium and that that would help them to obtain OPIC insurance. He raised the possibility of using Texas to lead as the consortium’s named operator but with Gulf doing all the work. He did not say he had UBS backing (but that Excalibur was “<span style="font-style:italic">perfectly capable of acquiring financial backing</span>”). Nor did he offer the prospect of an interest in Taq Taq because it was already allocated. Mr Kozel himself may have mentioned Taq Taq. (In support of this he refers to the fact that a map sent to Mr Kozel after the meeting features two marked up exploration area which did not include Taq Taq). The upshot of the meeting was that it was agreed that both Texas and Gulf would be part of a consortium to bid for blocks; that the involvement of Texas was to be essentially “<span style="font-style:italic">cosmetic</span>”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="21">

In his witness statement he said that Texas did not have the necessary financial capability or technical knowledge for Kurdistan petroleum operations although in his oral evidence he acknowledged the technical expertise of the “<span style="font-style:italic">Keystone companies</span>”. I do not think it likely that at this stage Excalibur would have been reluctant to introduce Texas, a US oil company, to the KRG, which was looking for one, or that he knew enough about Texas to take the view that it lacked the necessary capabilities. In fact it had considerable experience in the conduct of oil and gas operations. The suggestion that Texas’ participation was intended to be cosmetic (thus masking the reality from someone) is not easy to square with Mr Wempen’s repeated insistence that the KRG and the US authorities knew everything about the Excalibur/Texas/Gulf consortium.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to UBS backing, Excalibur points to the fact that Mr Eric Wempen did not start at UBS until the summer of 2006 and that in 2005 Mr Wempen had had (according to his second witness statement) no dealings with UBS or any connections there. The likelihood, however, is that Mr Wempen either said or implied that he had financial backing from (or including) UBS and referred to that in support of his claim to an 80% share. He is highly likely to have wished to establish his financial credentials and he had a tendency to exaggerate Excalibur’s financial backing when talking to third parties<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="22">

In July 2003 Eric Wempen had wanted Mr Jon Paul Javellana, a Wempen family friend and a Vice President – Investments with UBS Financial Services in California, to start a security business with the Wempens in Iraq. On 7 October 2003 Mr Wempen informed a Mr Haider Hamoudi, from whom he wanted assistance in respect of private placements for Iraqi companies, that “<span style="font-style:italic">My firm is working with UBS Warburg and KPMG</span>”. This was untrue. Excalibur had no work at the time with UBS or KPMG<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">

Mr Kozel knew little about Kurdistan and the name Taq Taq meant nothing to him at this stage. Mr Wempen was hazy on the detail too (Mr Kozel recalled that he did not know its acreage). It is possible that there was a misunderstanding on Mr Wempen’s part because he had thought that there was a prospect of obtaining a licence in respect of Taq Taq, when there was not. Whether or not that is so, I do not think that Mr Kozel has simply made up the idea that Taq Taq was mentioned by Mr Wempen. Mr Kozel’s account is corroborated by his brother Robert who recalls that when he discussed the position with Mr Kozel in January 2006 it was Taq Taq of which Mr Kozel spoke as a field where there was an opportunity to obtain a licence – the unfamiliar name being a reason for his recollecting it.</p>

The team members were now said to be Mr Wempen, Jaymie Durnan, John Balfe, Jas Dhillon, Imad Jonaby, Ronald Parks, and Eric Wempen. The Summary was calculated to suggest that Excalibur had this team of financial and local experts on board. In fact Excalibur had no contractual links with any of them. Mr Kozel was not to know that: he took Mr Wempen at his word in relation to what he was saying about UBS and the IRF.</p>

But this may have been intended to signify that the counterparty could be either Texas or Gulf or both (albeit “and/or” would have been clearer for the latter). The signature block provided for execution by Mr Wempen for Excalibur and for execution on behalf of Keystone Investment Company (which does not exist and was presumably intended to be some special purpose vehicle). The first two recitals recorded that the Parties (Excalibur and Keystone) wished to collaborate to pursue and ultimately prepare bids to develop petroleum blocks in Iraqi Kurdistan and, in the event that Consortium Bids were successful, wished to develop and sell petroleum resulting therefrom through a joint venture to be established between the Parties. These are described as the “<span style="font-style:italic">Transactions</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-weight:bold">early January</span> Mr Kozel telephoned each of his father and brothers, being the other members of the Texas board, to inform them of the opportunity being presented by Excalibur for Excalibur and Texas to collaborate to bid for oil projects in Kurdistan. He had several discussions with Robert Kozel. Robert Kozel recalled Mr Kozel saying in the initial conversation that he had met Mr Wempen, through the introduction of Mr Al-Qabandi. Mr Wempen, he was told, claimed to have political and business contacts in Kurdistan and said that there were opportunities for American companies to be involved. Mr Kozel wanted to know whether the other Kozels were interested. Robert Kozel did not recall Mr Kozel mentioning Gulf in the first conversation but there were subsequent discussions about including Gulf and reference to that possibility was added to the Collaboration Agreement. He did recall mention of Taq Taq. Mr Kozel’s father and brothers thought, as did he, that the opportunity was worth looking into and were content for him to conduct further discussions with Mr Wempen on Texas’ behalf. They wanted to know the initial cost which Mr Kozel estimated at a few hundred thousand dollars.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Insofar as Kurdistan was an opportunity available to Gulf (Mr Kozel’s probably correct understanding was that since an American flag company was needed, it was not one then open to Gulf), there was a potential conflict of interest between Texas and Gulf. Mr Kozel who was on the board of both was conscious of this conflict, which was later to become marked. In the New Year he had informal conversations with Mr Roger Parsons, the non-executive Chairman, and Mr Bill Guest, the President, of Gulf to whom on Tuesday <span style="font-weight:bold">10</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">January 2006</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="24">

	      </authorialNote> he sent a copy of the draft joint venture agreement, about the Kurdish opportunity. He described it as a Texas deal. At this stage Mr Parsons and Mr Guest were not keen for Gulf to become involved in Kurdistan on top of its involvement in Algeria. This would add another exploration project in a politically unstable area when Gulf was looking towards expanding in less risky areas and away from exploration risks. But Mr Guest wanted Gulf to have the opportunity to participate at a later date.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kozel did not want a joint venture agreement, from which Texas might not be able to withdraw or which might commit it to a bid.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At this stage Mr Kozel was still in Florida, awaiting the birth of his daughter. Mr Guest in London offered to help him out in relation to Kurdistan and, to that end, approached Ms Sandy Shaw of McGrigors, Gulf’s lawyers, for a draft agreement. That firm had the relevant experience and expertise for dealing with a joint bid agreement. Texas did not have experience with a joint bidding agreement. McGrigors did the drafting and Texas paid the bill. The invoice ultimately issued was directed to Texas (at Gulf’s London address). The itemised description of the items of work charged for referred to the drafting as having been “<span style="font-style:italic">Work on Gulfkeystone Excalibur project</span>”. That does not mean that Gulf was intending to be bound, as opposed to potentially interested, in the Collaboration Agreement. Some of the items for which Texas paid were Gulf Algeria matters, which Texas paid in error.</p>

Texas was described as the company exploring the opportunity of participating in oil and gas exploration. The letter said that it included a profile for Gulf, and explained how Mr Kozel had co-founded Gulf and about its activities in Algeria. The purpose of this was in order to bolster the KRG’s confidence in Texas because of Mr Kozel’s experience. A similar exercise but with Texas and Gulf reversed was used when Gulf introduced itself to the Algerian authorities. The letter also said that it submitted qualification documents for the “<span style="font-style:italic">Texas Keystone group of associated companies</span>”. When the letter was eventually signed on 17 February 2006 these were: (i) a document describing Texas’ corporate structure, (ii) a Texas interim presentation and (iii) Gulf’s Annual Report.

The fax was sent to Mr Kozel’s Texas number for the attention of Mr Goda, who was asked to copy it to Mr Kozel. Mr Goda sent the fax by email to Mr Kozel in London. Mr Kozel duly executed the agreement on behalf of Texas (mistakenly signing as CEO when it should have been Vice Chairman) and Ms Berry emailed Mr Wempen a copy of the executed agreement. Mr Kozel thought that there would have been a discussion with his family, the Texas board members, before he actually signed, authorising him to do so. There is no record of this and I cannot tell whether it happened or not. In any event it is plain that the Kozel family were leaving the agreement for Mr Kozel to deal with and that the 70/30 split was acceptable.</p>

This is surprising. Any ordinary businessman, let alone one with a degree in Business Administration (Mr Wempen), or who was a practising lawyer (Eric Wempen), would realise that signing a contract to which Gulf was supposed to be a party, but which made no mention of it, could give rise to problems.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Eric Wempen’s evidence is that when it came to the amended draft he, at any rate, saw that there was a problem: see para 182. The analysis of which he speaks is of the most general character and does not even appear to assume that Gulf would necessarily be treated as a party <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>. I have some doubts as to how far he thought through these matters at the time that the contract was made, but I am prepared to assume that his thinking was of the nature described.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On any view Mr Wempen was in a great hurry to sign a contract. The likelihood is that, insofar as he addressed his mind to the question of parties, he was content for the agreement to be with Texas, a US oil company, on the basis that it contained terms which contemplated that Gulf might join in the bid or the Collaboration Agreement at some stage. In Mr Eric Wempen’s somewhat incoherent, or at any rate inchoate, thinking, if Gulf came in on the bid, things would probably work out all right in the end, in the sense that Gulf could not bid without becoming under some liability to Excalibur. For both of them the key thing was to sign up.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Neither of the Wempens raised any concern with Mr Kozel on the issue of Gulf being a party. At this stage, they were content to contract with Texas and wished to sign up as soon as they could in order to get back to Kurdistan with the news that they had done so. What Mr Wempen was concerned with was the interest split. Eric Wempen was prepared to take the risk involved in Gulf not being expressed as a party. So far as Mr Kozel was concerned he regarded Texas as a party and not Gulf.</p>

The Court’s aim is to discern the intentions of the parties from the words they used in the context and circumstances in which they did so. It is not for the court to “<span style="font-style:italic">improve or purify</span>” (Judge Bellacosa’s words) the agreement which the parties reached. The contract, which is the primary and often the only place to look, must be read as a whole. The Court should avoid ascribing to a contract a purely technical or unduly literal meaning or a strained or unnatural interpretation. It should not strive to find an ambiguity. If there is a genuine ambiguity, apparent to someone familiar with the customs and practices of the relevant trade or business, the Court will examine extrinsic evidence including the conduct of the parties after the contract has been made (but not the uncommunicated subjective intentions of the parties). In this latter respect New York law differs from that of England &amp; Wales.</p>

As appears from the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">Concession</span>” the agreement is drafted for use with several different forms of contract with a host government.

Thus a Consortium Bid meant an application, bid or tender by the Parties or any of them for a production sharing agreement “<span style="font-style:italic">pursuant to [the] Agreement</span>”. An application for a production sharing agreement connotes that the applicant is seeking to become a party to the agreement. Clause 8.2 required the bid to be submitted by the Operator.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is good reason for the difference. Consortium Interests can only be shares in the Collaboration Agreement. But a party to a Concession may find that the Concession, which may take several different forms, grants him interests (e.g. in or in respect of property) or subjects him to obligations (e.g. by statute) in respect of the relevant parcel of Acreage which are not confined to rights or obligations expressed in the PSC to which he is party as a result of a successful Consortium Bid. In addition the share is to be a share of, in effect, the rights and obligations in relation to the Acreage which are contained in the PSC. To share in those rights and obligations it is necessary to be a party, with others, to the PSC i.e. the contract pursuant to which they arise.</p>

	      </authorialNote> had intended to provide for indirect interests she could scarcely have done it in a more recondite or unhelpful fashion. Such an intention is left to be discerned from the definition of Participating Interest, which does not, in my view, bear the meaning attributed to it. The construction argued for requires treating a Party as participating in a Consortium Bid, even though it has no intention of becoming a party to the PSC, with the result that those who are parties to the PSC must in the first instance shoulder the liability to the KRG themselves. Moreover the agreement provides no indication as to how effect is to be given to any such indirect interest in a PSC and no mechanism relating to it – not even an agreement to agree. Mr Park suggested in his oral evidence that the default position would be for the indirect interest to be given effect to by a trust; but clause 9.2 precludes such an approach. Finally, Mr Wempen accepts that Excalibur’s payment obligations were the same whether their interest was direct or indirect. But the Collaboration Agreement contains no mechanism in respect of such indirect obligations.</p>

Clause 5.2, by way of exception, provides for the Parties to agree a program and budget pursuant to the provisions of clause 7 to cover the costs of Data acquisition, joint studies and the preparation of any Consortium Bid and, if appropriate, negotiations with the Government. All costs incurred pursuant to a program and a budget are to be joint account costs calculated and borne pursuant to the terms of the Accounting Procedure in Schedule 1. Clause 7 established an Operating Committee to consider and determine all matters relating to any Consortium Bids and to approve all proposed programs and budgets and to consider and, if approved by all Parties, to acquire Data.

Further the evidence is that the parties to upstream oil and gas industry JOAs are invariably the parties to the related host government contract: see the Park-Codd Joint Memo para 4.6 (m).

The PSC is the source of their entitlement, although the Collaboration Agreement or the mechanism provided by it (i.e. the provision that, by agreement, a participating interest may differ from a consortium interest) will in the first place determine the respective interests of the bidders amongst themselves.

The Court may imply a term into an agreement to give effect to the parties’ unexpressed but intended purpose and may do so if the promise sought to be implied is one which a reasonable person in the position of the promisee would be justified in understanding was included. The test is, however, as in English law, a strict one:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">New York law would not sanction the implication of a term simply in order to make a contract fairer, or better to accord with its own notions of commercial reasonableness. Contractual implication is not a licence to improve, rewrite or purify the parties’ own agreement – per Judge Bellacosa. A term may be implied in order to give business efficacy to a contract which would otherwise lack it: see <span style="font-weight:bold">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon</span>, 222 N.Y. 88, 91 (N.Y. 1917) in which <br/>Bowen J’s dictum in <span style="font-weight:bold">The Moorcock</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>14 P.D. 65, 68<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>was cited with approval by Cardozo J. But this does not justify the implication of a term to improve a contract that sufficiently covers the matter in hand or which makes commercial sense without it. Where the instrument contains an express covenant in regard to any subject, no covenants are to be implied in respect to the same subject matter. The rule was recently cited in <span style="font-weight:bold">RJ Capital, S.A. v. Lexington Capital Funding III, Ltd.</span>, No. 10-25 (PGC), 2011 WL 3251554, 13 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2011).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The supposed implication fails on many grounds. The Collaboration Agreement makes express provision for the manner in which the parties would acquire and give effect to an interest in a Concession. These provisions make business sense, do not lack business efficacy, and are consistent with arrangements habitually made in the industry. In those circumstances there is no room for the implication of some alternative regime providing (without saying so) for indirect interests. The claim advanced by Excalibur – to participate indirectly in one of the various modes suggested – is inconsistent with the provisions of clauses 8.6.1 and 8.7 which require the Parties who submit a Consortium Bid (in which Excalibur professes to have been indirectly participating) to be jointly bound to the National Owner and to complete the documentation to effect the award of the Concession (i.e. the PSC) and to enter into a JOA which regulates the relationship <span style="font-style:italic">inter se</span> of those who are on the PSC. If the implied term had been suggested to reasonable persons in the position of the Parties, they would neither have agreed that it was impliedly included nor that it should be.</p>

It does not permit the court to add substantive terms to the contract. Additionally, if the contract explicitly provides for a singular method for effectuating a party’s interest, the court cannot re-write that provision.

The critical question is, therefore, whether or not it was the intention of those concerned, and in particular Texas, the putative agent, that Gulf should be a party as well as Texas.

Clause 20 stipulates that the Collaboration Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties. The signature block provides that Texas is executing the agreement for and on behalf of Texas.

The consortium would be more acceptable to the KRG and have a greater chance of success if Gulf’s involvement was kept from the public gaze so that the KRG would be seen to be awarding PSCs to a US led consortium. If Gulf’s involvement was publicly known it would have been obvious that the consortium was Gulf led. The understanding was that Gulf would step out from behind the curtain after the PSC was awarded.

There was no reason for the KRG (or the public) to see it. The KRG never asked to see it, nor did it occur to Mr Kozel that they would. Moreover, it is Excalibur’s case that Parties to the Agreement and to a Consortium Bid do not have to be parties to the PSC, and that a Party to the Collaboration Agreement who is not on the PSC is nevertheless entitled to an indirect interest in it. If that be right, there seems little reason for Gulf not to be a party to the Collaboration Agreement, even if the KRG might see it. Texas and Excalibur could be on the PSC with Gulf having an indirect interest. If the intention was to avoid the possibility of the consortium being Gulf led, the Agreement was inapt for that purpose since Texas could transfer 99.9% of its direct interest to Gulf.</p>

In Excalibur’s final submissions it is said that everyone involved, including the KRG, knew that in reality Gulf was to be the <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> operator but that Mr Wempen believed that the consortium would be more attractive if Gulf’s involvement was kept from the public gaze.

The Collaboration Agreement was a joint bidding agreement and, when the bid came to be made, the identity of the bidders would be patent. If Gulf was to be a bidder, their participation would become apparent once the bid was made. If Gulf was to be an assignee of a portion of Texas’ interests under the PSC, once it had been obtained, that would be apparent also, particularly if it was to be <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> operator.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If Excalibur, Texas and Gulf had intended that Gulf should be a party from the outset, there was nothing to prevent that happening. If that was the intention, it is impossible to believe that Gulf’s solicitors would have drafted an agreement which did not name it as a party and left any assignment to Texas’ choice, or that the Gulf Board (or Mr Kozel alone) would have been prepared to have the Agreement executed in these terms, without even a side letter setting out the position, whatever might have been discussed at a lunch in Tampa two months before. The reality, as I find, is that Texas and Gulf did not intend that Gulf should be a party and Excalibur, in the person of Mr Wempen, was perfectly prepared to contract with Texas, the only US company in view, which would, so he hoped, take him forward quickly in his quest for a Concession in Kurdistan. It was envisaged that Gulf might play a part in the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the position is not ambiguous it is not open to Excalibur to rely on extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of the Agreement. As Judge Bellacosa’s evidence shows, the parol evidence rule applies to the party issue. If the terms of the Collaboration Agreement are inconsistent with Texas acting as Gulf’s agent that would be treated by a New York Court as relevant, albeit not dispositive, evidence that there was no authority and thus no agency relationship. But, as both he and Judge Pratt confirmed, under New York law the terms of the Collaboration Agreement are dispositive of the party issue <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>the terms of the Collaboration Agreement are <span style="font-style:italic">unambiguously</span> inconsistent with Gulf being a party. In such a case, of which this is one, evidence to the contrary breaks the parol evidence rule: <span style="font-weight:bold">W.W.W. Assocs. v.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur relied on three cases, which it suggested were to different effect – (i) <span style="font-weight:bold">Thomas Gordon Malting Co. v.

None of them is, in my judgment, authority for the proposition that parol evidence is admissible to prove that someone is a party to the contract if that proposition is plainly inconsistent with its terms. The position is otherwise if the contract does not make clear that X is not a principal so that the identity of the real principal is left ambiguous.</p>

No authority to which I have been referred supports this departure from the usual rule and I have doubts as to whether an intention to mislead could properly justify it. In any event, I do not regard the suggested circumstances as comparable since, firstly, all concerned are said to have known the true position and the agreement, far from hiding Gulf’s existence, contemplates it becoming a party for anything below 100%.</p>

I do not accept that the position after the Tampa meeting was that Texas was to be there for cosmetic reasons and Gulf the real partner. But even if the discussion at Tampa went further than envisaging the possibility of Gulf taking a role later, by 16 February 2006 events had moved on. The draft joint venture agreement, contemplating some sort of Texas/Gulf participation, had been rejected; the draft Collaboration Agreement had been put forward and accepted with alacrity; and amendments to add reference to Gulf as a<span style="font-style:italic"> potential</span> assignee were later added to the draft.

It had, as Mr Kozel put it, dabbled in exploration. It would not, it is said, have wanted to spend the $ 1- 5 million involved in getting to the bid stage. Robert Kozel knew virtually nothing about Kurdistan and had little involvement in it. By contrast Kurdistan was a “perfect fit” for Gulf, consistent with its international aspirations. In those circumstances the Court should readily infer that Texas was contracting for itself and for Gulf.</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>At the 10 December 2005 board meeting it was agreed to focus on an ‘A’ list of Sudan, Egypt, Oman and UAE.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. I do not accept that Texas lacked the technical ability to conduct oil and gas explorations. Whilst Texas was focussed on domestic production, Mr Kozel had a more international focus and was signing up to a deal because he thought it had potential and could be taken forward in a number of different ways. Mr Kozel had set up Gulf, with the support of his family. There was no reason in principle why Texas could not establish a “Texas Kurdistan” to take on the project if it remained of interest. Gulf itself had been formed with Texas’ investors’ capital. The conclusion of the Collaboration Agreement did not commit Texas to much. What the project might involve in terms of (a) technical expertise and (b) cost was unknown. To the extent that Texas lacked either it could access others. Texas was willing to incur some costs and ended up by paying some $ 239,000 of third party costs. It had a free hand whether to bid or not, and if it was a party and Gulf was not, it would be in control. The Collaboration Agreement had benefits from Gulf’s point of view in that it preserved the opportunity for Gulf to participate in a venture which had come Texas’ way because Texas was a US operator, without committing Gulf in any way at all. In accordance with the Kozel family way of doing things Robert Kozel was content to let Mr Kozel take the lead on the project and for the board to make decisions at the appropriate time.</p>

If that had been their understanding in 2006 or 2007, they would surely have done so. In fact Mr Wempen later invited Mr Kozel to sign a letter acknowledging Excalibur’s interest (see para 780 below) which referred to the Collaboration Agreement as being with Texas, not with Texas and Gulf. On <span style="font-weight:bold">14 November 2007</span> he suggested in an email to his brother that they could argue that Gulf’s participation in the deal would not become valid until Excalibur received a signed Deed of Adherence: see para 833. On the same day he prepared a draft email to Mr Kozel asserting that Excalibur had waived the requirement for its prior consent to an assignment in Erbil in July 2007, whether in whole or in part. In an email of <span style="font-weight:bold">28 November 2007</span> Eric Wempen observed that “<span style="font-style:italic">Not having counsel involved is what screwed you in the first place with the deed of Adherence and letting them continue with no docs in place</span>”.

He was, of course, Chief Executive Officer of Gulf and Vice Chairman of Texas. But, as he confirmed, he did not have the authority of either Board to commit either company to such a contract with Excalibur without the consent of the boards. He had authority from the Texas Board to contract on its behalf. He neither sought nor obtained the authority of the Texas Board to contract in Texas’ name on behalf of Gulf; nor from the Gulf Board to enter into the contract (in the name of Texas) on behalf of Gulf. Nor would I regard it as part of the usual authority of someone in his position to enter into an agreement of this kind without it being considered and agreed (if necessary by an appropriate majority) by the Gulf Board.</p>

The second is that he could act on behalf of the company without reference to them. As to the first, I think it unlikely that Mr Kozel said that he would be able to deliver the Gulf Board. He may have said that he would be able to get the Texas Board to embark on the venture (as in the event he did) and, in that sense, deliver. As to the second, I regard it as most unlikely that he said anything to the effect that he could act without reference to or without securing authority from either board, not least because, had he said it, it would have been inaccurate.</p>

There is no evidence that the Gulf Board even considered the idea of Texas signing the Collaboration Agreement on Gulf’s behalf. Had it authorised Mr Kozel to act, via Texas, on behalf of Gulf, it is inconceivable that there should be no reference in the minutes of any board meeting to this curious arrangement whereby Gulf would become a party, but not on the face of the document, to an agreement in which it had no specified Consortium Interest, where, in the absence of an assignment, its rights were at worst non-existent and at best unclear, and which contained terms indicating that it was not yet a party at all.</p>

As I have already held (para 295), I think it unlikely that he said that in relation to Gulf. Even if I am wrong about that I do not accept that such an expression should (in the absence of further inquiry as to what was meant) be taken as meaning that Mr Kozel was holding himself out as having authority to commit either company without reference to the relevant board. If that is what he is to be taken as saying, I do not regard it as right to treat that as a statement made (through him) by Gulf<span style="font-style:italic"> as principal</span> in relation to the position of an agent, namely himself.

In the light of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and the way in which the parties conducted themselves I do not regard this analysis as correct. The fact that from early 2007 onwards Gulf came to play an ever increasing role in the quest for a PSC in Kurdistan, including carrying out the technical work in preparation for visits to Erbil and the bid, and that the interest of the Texas Board in participating in Kurdistan waned as that of Gulf waxed, did not (subject to the question of assignment with which I deal below) alter the character of the contractual relationships (or the lack of them) between the parties, particularly in circumstances where Gulf was under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement a <span style="font-style:italic">prospective</span> party.</p>

It does not oblige them to use any endeavours to secure an interest for a Party, which has (or is deemed to have) withdrawn from the Bid and has undertaken no such obligations.

It would be extraordinary if it did this, since, if so, the non-bidding party could not have any of the obligations of a bidder foist upon him (see the proviso to clause 2.1), nor would it have to bear any of the associated costs of the bid; and yet, if and when the bid succeeded, it would be entitled (presumably at its option) to a share in the Acreage equal to what would have been its Participating Interest, if it had committed to participate, that share coming out of the share which the parties to the Bid intended for themselves. Further, so far as Akri-Bijeel is concerned there never was a Consortium Bid agreed upon. The construction contended for has the bizarre consequence, which the parties cannot have intended, that Texas and Gulf (if a party) and Excalibur were bound to seek to secure a direct participation on the PSC when Excalibur had consented not to be on it.</p>

So far as appeared to Mr Kozel, Mr Wempen, for Excalibur, did consent. That he did so was not surprising to Mr Kozel because of Excalibur’s difficulty (as matters stood in July 2007) in getting on the PSC. In any event it was a matter for Excalibur to choose. It was not incumbent on Mr Kozel to advise him. Whatever was going on in Mr Wempen’s mind did not vitiate or qualify his consent.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept this for a number of reasons. First, Texas was not involved in MOL’s bid for Akri-Bijeel or in the assignment by MOL to Gulf of a 20% interest in the block and had no opportunity to share. Under clause 2.2 (b) Texas was bound to procure that its Affiliates did not become involved in transactions falling within the scope of that clause. But Gulf was, expressly, not an Affiliate of Texas. Second, Gulf, as I have held, is not a party to the Collaboration Agreement. Third, Gulf did not bid for Akri-Bijeel and there was never any question of it doing so. The opportunity of a farm in from MOL was not an opportunity to bid for a block (i.e. “<span style="font-style:italic">the acquisition of Acreage by way of Consortium Bid</span>”) even if the farm in was approved by the KRG. Fourth, insofar as reliance is placed on clause 2.2 (a), that prevented the independent pursuit of “<span style="font-style:italic">the Transactions</span>”, which are, relevantly, defined as the pursuit and preparation of bids to acquire Acreage by way of Consortium Bid. That would preclude a party bidding independently for Acreage; but not, in my view, acquiring Acreage by way of assignment from another successful bidder. Fifth, and in any event, Akri-Bijeel was a farm in opportunity which was not realistically available to Excalibur. Excalibur would never have joined with MOL in bidding for Akri-Bijeel or sought to acquire by assignment a share of MOL’s interest. It did not wish to be on the Shaikan PSC either originally or by a farm in from Gulf and there is no reason to believe that it would have a different attitude to Akri-Bijeel. MOL would not have entertained Excalibur as a co-bidder on the block or been prepared to have it on the PSC by way of farm in, in the absence of a guarantee from Gulf, which Gulf would not provide. Nor would the KRG. If there was any breach, no substantial damage resulted from it.</p>

The Agreement provides that, upon the actual or deemed withdrawal of a party from the Bid, the withdrawer is not required to submit a Bid (proviso to clause 2.1), but remains bound by the Agreement and may not itself apply for Acreage: clause 8.5. The effect of the withdrawal of a party is that the Transaction/Consortium Bid becomes that of the remaining parties, who are entitled to proceed with it by themselves.</p>

Thereafter Excalibur was notified in writing of Gulf’s proposed participation by its inclusion as a party to the draft PSC sent to Rex Wempen on 26 July 2007, and again on 30 July 2007. Mr Wempen’s response on 29 July was to say “<span style="font-style:italic">Todd, good to hear from you. …Looks as if we are back in the driver’s seat in Kurdistan</span>”.

In relation to Akri-Bijeel, the fifth point mentioned in para 320 applies. As to (ii) even if Excalibur was not told of Dr Hawrami’s misgivings, it is doubtful that, if it had been, it would have acted differently, given that it claims an entitlement to an indirect interest without becoming a party to the PSC: see para 317 above.

In reality it was wholly unrealistic to suppose that billions of dollars could easily be raised and untruthful to say that it was ready to hand.

He asked a number of detailed questions. It is apparent that Mr Patrick thought that Excalibur was an organisation of some standing, not a one or two man band with no shareholders and no assets. Mr Wempen’s evidence was that he discussed Excalibur in detail with Mr Patrick and told him that they were a small outfit consisting of him and his brother with the help of Dabin and industry partners, and highly connected. I doubt whether the discussion was in detail, and the likelihood is that he spoke in grand sounding terms. What he did not say was that Excalibur was a company without shareholders (only Membership interests and only two at that) or assets. The likelihood is that he indicated that Excalibur had financial backing.

Mr Kozel agreed to this. Mr Samarrai met Mr Clark, Mr Kozel and Mr Al-Khaldi at Gulf’s premises and discussed structures in Kurdistan. On <span style="font-weight:bold">15 May 2006</span>, Mr Clark asked Mr Samarrai for a summary of his thoughts on the prospective areas in Kurdistan, which he produced in return for £ 1000 (2 days at £ 500 per day), and he came on the trip to Erbil in June 2006.</p>

Dr Yacu was there. Dr Hawrami came into the room with a big smile on his face; Mr Kozel was taken aback to see him; Dr Hawrami asked Mr Clark, whom he knew well, why the group had come to Kurdistan. Mr Kozel told Dr Hawrami that the purpose was as set out in Texas’ introduction letter and gave him his Texas business card. Dr Hawrami also asked about how things were going for Gulf (with which he had had a business relationship) in Algeria. He was also particularly interested in the fact that Mr Kozel owned Falcon Drilling.

He was told by Dr Hawrami not to speak further at the meeting<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="40">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> That something like this occurred is corroborated by the evidence of Mr Samarrai to the effect that Dr Hawrami told him at some time between September 2006 and November 2007 that he had told Mr Wempen off at the June 2006 meeting. He repeated that in early 2011.</p>

Mr Kozel says (but Mr Wempen disputes) that he later agreed with Mr Wempen that he should not attend further meetings at the Oil Ministry. Whether or not that was so, he did not meet Dr Hawrami more than once thereafter (August 2006) and even that is in dispute. Mr Kozel says that he turned up at Gulf’s offices but did not attend the meeting with Dr Hawrami.</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> There is a dispute as to whether these included Tawke: probably not in view of the distances involved in travelling from Erbil to Taq Taq and Tawke and the need at that time not to travel after sunset. Mr Samarrai who was on the trip said that it did not include Tawke, which he had only been to once – in early 2007.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. They were denied entry to Taq Taq where the licence was held by a Turkish consortium including Genel Enerji, into which Addax Petroleum had farmed-in in July 2005, but the drilling was being performed by personnel from a Chinese company, Great Wall Drilling, who were in some form of joint venture with a company – Taq Taq Operating Company – owned by Genel and Addax. I do not regard the fact that sites other than Taq Taq were visited as an indication that Taq Taq had never been presented as an opportunity; indeed the fact that an attempt was made to visit Taq Taq suggests that it was an opportunity that had been contemplated. I accept Mr Kozel’s evidence that it was a complete shock to Mr Wempen to find that Taq Taq had already been licensed and that he tried to blame Texas for not moving fast enough.</p>

There is a dispute as to (i) whether Mr Wempen had been asked to attend a follow up meeting in London with Dr Hawrami; and (ii) whether he attended this meeting. Mr Wempen says that he was flown over by Gulf; he, together with Azzat, attended the meeting, which lasted for 1 ½ hours; Dr Hawrami was friendly; Mr Clark gave his presentation; Dr Hawrami said that for $ 60 million the consortium could have Demir Dagh. After it Mr Kozel said that Demir Dagh was “<span style="font-style:italic">a dog</span>” and that Gulf did not have the funds for that sort of bonus.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I prefer the account of Mr Kozel. The likelihood is that Mr Wempen had not been asked to attend a meeting with Dr Hawrami, whose email to Mr Al-Qabandi of 4 August 2006 shows that he was planning to see Gulf and makes no mention of Mr Wempen. Mr Wempen came to London on his way to Kurdistan where he hoped to meet the PM. He turned up at the office with Azzat, who had been invited by Mr Kozel to London at Mr Wempen’s suggestion because Azzat was keen to get to know Texas – and Mr Wempen was keen that he should – and who was combining his visit with a holiday to see family in Holland. Neither were present at the actual meeting itself. Although Mr Wempen gives evidence of the content of the meeting, the figure of $ 60 million to which he refers is likely to be incorrect. It appears from an email<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>from Mr Clark on <span style="font-weight:bold">18 August 2006 </span>that<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Dr Hawrami mentioned a signature bonus of US $ 250 million.

The following day Mr Clark emailed Dr Hawrami with the areas of interest in order of priority (Demir Dagh, Ain Sifni, Qadir Karam, Udhaim). Excalibur relies on this sequence of events as showing that Texas was fulfilling a purely nominal role. It seems to me, however, a recognition of the fact that the Collaboration Agreement was with Texas and that any participation of Gulf would be dependent on the preparedness of the KRG to have a non US company on the PSC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kozel’s evidence is that, at this stage, he was in a very uncomfortable position. He knew that Dr Hawrami (a) wanted a US company, (b) was negotiating with Texas, and (c) would not accept Gulf, a non US company, instead of Texas. He was about to leave Gulf, from which he regarded himself as being pushed out, and did not want an interesting project to be lost if it was denied to Gulf. At the same time he was being put under immense pressure by the Gulf Board, with whom he was scarcely on speaking terms, to secure a Gulf participation, in accordance with the understanding recorded in the draft minute in June (see para 370), and did not wish to appear to be obstructive. Gulf would not accept him telling them that the offer was only open to a US company. To get them off his back he decided he would take the proposal to the Texas board, which would have to decide whether to accept it. It would also be for Dr Hawrami to decide whether the proposal was acceptable to the KRG, which, in Mr Kozel’s understanding, it would not be. If there was to be a transfer to Gulf of the whole of Texas’ interest Excalibur would have to consent as well and Mr Kozel reckoned that they would not consent to a transfer of Texas’ interest because the American flag would be lost. By proceeding in this way he thought that he was keeping his options open.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>When he wrote the email he was, he said, being a touch sarcastic – as a sort of jibe about Gulf assuming that it could be involved. In essence he was going through the motions of 100% transfer, anticipating, rightly in the event, that it would not be acceptable to Excalibur or the KRG.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On <span style="font-weight:bold">15 December 2006 </span>the Gulf Board met in Zurich. It noted RAK’s interest in taking over Gulf. This interest arose, at least in part, because Sheikh Sultan Al Qassimi was never happy with the public listing of Gulf, which meant that the board had to be reformed to reflect various regulatory requirements and led to the removal of some of his family members. The takeover would be a means of regaining control of the company.</p>

TK declared his interest as a 33% shareholder of Texas Keystone and then confirmed that Texas Keystone had agreed to this. It was RESOLVED by the board, with the exception of TK, that this represented a fair and reasonable basis for assuming a 70% interest in the application and should conclude this agreement with Texas Keystone.</span>

This is likely to be correct since the Board of Texas had not agreed this and he did not have the authority to commit Texas by himself. But he may well have said that Texas would agree (as a few months later they did) or that he would get them to agree.</p>

Whether he attended or not it is clear that the idea of a letter came from Mr Kinnear, who was concerned at the loss of a US owned Texas and the effect of an Arab owned Gulf, although it served Mr Kozel’s interests as well, since he did not want the deal to leave Texas. Mr Kinnear reiterated the need for two letters in an email to Mr Wempen on <span style="font-weight:bold">25 March 2007</span>. Mr Wempen emailed Mr Kinnear on <span style="font-weight:bold">26 March 2007</span> to say “<span style="font-style:italic">We should keep the deal with Texas if at all possible</span>”.

Article 9 required the provision by each entity constituting the Contractor of a guarantee to the KRG in respect of the Minimum Exploration Obligations, which were substantial: see Article 10.2. Mr Wempen’s evidence was that he did not recall seeing the guarantee; did not think he would have had a problem if he had seen it; and that Excalibur was not going to provide a guarantee because it was a consulting firm with no assets working alongside an operator who would be able to provide one. This, itself, would rule it out as a party to the PSC.</p>

In fact it would be jointly liable to pay the whole bonus (with rights of contribution). It was also apparent that Dr Hawrami had described the terms as non-negotiable.</p>

When such a JOA had been agreed (but not before) interest would accrue at 2% above LIBOR on due but unpaid amounts. He referred to the Accounting Procedure laid down in Schedule 1 to the Collaboration Agreement which provides for such interest on any advance required of a Party by the Operator but unpaid. In fact Schedule 1 does not have anything to do with unpaid bonuses. It relates to costs incurred pursuant to a program and budget in respect of the costs of data acquisition, joint studies and the preparation of any Consortium Bid and negotiation with the Government for any acreage: clause 5.2. It does not provide an indefinite “carry” by one Party of the other in respect of bonus obligations owed by the Parties to a PSC to the KRG.</p>

They were, no doubt, aware of the fund idea, but, in my judgment, they were not, until much later, aware of Excalibur’s true financial position, namely that it was a company without any assets, without what could properly be called backers or investors ready to go, or anywhere near it; or that the oft repeated references to “<span style="font-style:italic">our investors</span>” and the like were illusory.</p>

He gave no indication to Mr Kozel that there would be any problem. The investors were, of course, non-existent.</p>

Mr Kozel was on the way back to London. The meeting was at Mr Wempen’s suggestion. Mr Kozel handed over a package of data including geology work programmes, capital expenditure projections and contract information and contract economics based on an economic model of Mr Compton. He did some page turning. There was no detailed discussion, but it was apparent from what was there that a large amount of money had to be raised for the signature bonus and work programme budgets. This led to Mr Wempen suggesting that Mr Kozel or his father or one of his brothers should join the board of an energy fund which would finance Excalibur i.e. the Thames Chesapeake Fund. Their presence would give oil and gas credibility. Mr Kozel said that he was not interested. Mr Wempen asked him to speak to his family.</p>

Mr Picken QC suggested to Mr Kozel that this was because there was a possibility that Mr Wempen might agree to the transfer from Texas to Gulf and Mr Kozel wanted to keep him on side i.e. against the transfer. I think this is unlikely, even though Mr Wempen recorded such an invitation in an email to Mr Kinnear of 22 April 2007. Mr Wempen, with no oil or gas experience, would not be of use to Mr Kozel in any new company. Nor did Mr Kozel want, when poised to start a new company of his own, to embark on raising a fund for Excalibur. Mr Kozel was also quite likely to be able to persuade Texas not to transfer to Gulf if he was no longer part of Gulf. What Mr Kozel probably did indicate was that, if he formed a new company, Excalibur and that company could work together.</p>

The draft provided for a bidding group comprised of Texas (35%), Gulf (35%), and Excalibur + Dabin (30% to be split in unspecified proportions). It envisaged that the parties would sign a new bidding agreement based on the Collaboration Agreement, as part of which they would agree a form of joint operating agreement, the principles of which were to include the following: (a) Texas was to be the official operator and Gulf the technical operator; (b) the costs of the Joint Operations would be funded in the specified proportions; each party was to provide a guarantee or cash collateral for its share of the signature bonus and work commitment under the PSC; and (c) any party that failed to pay its share of costs by the due date would be liable to forfeit and lose its whole interest in the Area.</p>

Since it would mean a transfer of only a portion of Texas’ interest it would avoid the need for Excalibur’s consent. It would also mean that there was a majority US ownership. Mr Kozel’s evidence was that this was simply Gulf’s proposal; Mr Patrick and Mr Guest had now understood that there would be no 100% transfer of Texas’ interest to Gulf and suggested that Gulf should now come up with another arrangement. Mr Kozel had said “make me a proposal”. Mr Kozel objected to the 35%/35% proposal because Texas would, if it was to be operator, as the KRG then wished, want a 51% interest at least and he made that clear. Excalibur suggests that Mr Kozel had indicated that a 35%/35% split would be acceptable.</p>

The “<span style="font-style:italic">envoy</span>” was, according to Mr Wempen, Mr Jonathan Morrow, a partner in the law firm Hill Stern and the senior legal adviser to the KRG’s Ministry of Natural Resources. Mr Wempen had had discussions with him earlier in the year and again at this time, when, according to his evidence, Mr Morrow had told him over the telephone on a bad line as they were getting ready to get on the plane that Dr Hawrami had verbally agreed the terms. Mr Morrow was not an envoy of Excalibur. The email, Mr Wempen said, should have read “<span style="font-style:italic">his envoy</span>”.

What Mr Kozel said indicated to Mr Patrick (see the next para) that the 35% was agreed. Either he intended or was content for Mr Patrick to have that impression or he was intending to say that the idea of Gulf and Texas sharing an interest carved out from Texas’ 70% was verbally agreed (as in effect Mr Robert Kozel had done) but leaving room for a different percentage (e.g. one which would leave Texas with at least 51% of the whole).</p>

He no doubt regarded Excalibur as entitled to participate in some way if Texas and/or Gulf became parties to a PSC as his reward for introducing the deal, in a manner to be decided and subject to Excalibur bearing its share of the concomitant obligations at some stage<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="50">

It had no assets of its own to speak of and, at some time in the spring, Mr Wempen had abandoned the idea of raising money in advance of the deal. It was, therefore, in Excalibur’s interest not to seek to become a party originally (or, at any rate, in early 2007 to defer any decision) in the hope or expectation that, with the PSC signed, it could raise funds and participate in the venture either by a farm in (so that it became a party) or in some other way.

Naturally you will have to accommodate GKP and I will have to accommodate Dabin, per our respective promises to our partners. Personally, I recommend this be done after the next stage, as it would complicate things to introduce new split issues now.</span>

The likely future costs of the Kurdistan project were becoming apparent and they would be substantial. Robert Kozel had reviewed the draft PSC with its bonuses and other commitments.</p>

But in his oral evidence Mr Wempen said that it was a big presentation, too large to email, written by him, before reverting to saying that it was the 1 May 2007 letter, with an accompanying folder of documents. It is not at all clear what Mr Wempen in fact delivered for Mr Schuette to take, and why it had to be delivered by hand. I assume that it was some form of presentation of the project.</p>

It is more likely that it was a reference to some US politicians, members of the Congressional Kurdish caucus or the like. PM Barzani knew Dabin, as Excalibur’s agent, so mention of their name was unlikely to have any helpful effect. Later on 19 June Mr Wempen emailed Mr Behrends to say that he had been pushing to try to meet Mr Maguire before he, Mr Wempen, left “<span style="font-style:italic">so he could carry the packet</span>”.</p>

He appears also to have been concerned that he might lose or imperil his top secret security clearance (then under, or about to be under review) and harm his political connections if his company was party to a PSC with the KRG – which was against US policy at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kozel’s evidence is that he came back from the meeting and reported that it looked strongly as if they would get one block; and that they were waiting for Dr Hawrami to get back to them (having spoken to the PM) on the possibility of two. He told Mr Wempen that the Minister did not think that a company like Excalibur would be acceptable on the consortium – he wanted bigger companies – and that Mr Wempen would have to get himself sorted out, with the assistance of Dabin and any other contacts, if he wanted Excalibur to be approved. It was in that context that Mr Wempen said that it was not necessary or made no difference to him whether or not Excalibur was on the PSC. There were drinks on the lawn but no celebration.</p>

A joyous celebration ensued. On the following morning – Friday <span style="font-weight:bold">13 July 2007 </span>– Mr Kozel and Mr Mackertich went back to the Ministry to give the technical presentation. It was on that morning that he was told by Mr Kozel that he had the impression that Dr Hawrami no longer needed a US company named as operator. Mr Wempen said that that was fine with him and that he left everything in Mr Kozel’s hands – the final negotiations with the KRG and the final spilt between Texas and Gulf. He also said that it made no difference to him whether Excalibur was a named party to the PSC. In reply Mr Kozel said that he would not “<span style="font-style:italic">screw [him] over</span>” in Kurdistan. The group posed for a celebratory photograph in the parking lot (as they did).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a dispute as to whether the conversation between Mr Wempen and Mr Kozel took place in the evening after the meeting or the next morning. Since the meeting went on until the small hours there is not a great deal of difference. The likelihood is that Mr Wempen was told about it as soon as Mr Kozel came back from the meeting. On the evening of Thursday 12 July Mr Wempen learnt from his brother that his mother had only weeks to live (both he and Mr Kozel recall that he was called to the phone after Mr Kozel had reported back when they were having a drink at a table or on the lawn) and he was heavily shaken by the news. Mr Kozel arranged the flight for Mr Wempen to return to the United States the next morning. He flew back to Los Angeles via London.</p>

Mr Wempen says that it was as he was about to set off to the airport with Mr Mackertich. Mr Kozel does not recall when it was. I think that it was probably said at a later date in November 2007. In an email to his brother of 18 November 2007 Mr Wempen records the use of that phrase in the context of the dispute which then arose as to the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p>

In a discussion that cannot have lasted very long Mr Kozel reported truthfully on the upshot of his meeting with Dr Hawrami and its implications for Excalibur. In response Mr Wempen volunteered the fact that he did not mind whether Excalibur was on the PSC or not.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wempen did not resile from that position at any time prior to the signature of the PSC. He was also content for MOL to be a party to the PSC. As Excalibur’s Reply (para 8) and Mr Wempen’s oral evidence confirm, he consented to Excalibur not being on the PSC. He was content to adopt that stance because, as he must have recognised, Excalibur would face great difficulties in getting on the PSC, and would probably have to postpone its participation (in whatever form) until it had raised funds once the PSC had been signed and the deal struck. Mr Kozel realised that, if Excalibur did not want to be on the PSC, that would mean that it would be withdrawing from the process provided for by the Collaboration Agreement, which was designed to lead, via a bid, to a PSC and a JOA. But, if it could raise the necessary funds and become acceptable to the KRG, it might be able to participate in the PSC after that had been obtained. If Excalibur could come up with the money Mr Kozel was happy to have it on board.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="54">

The KRG Minister has advised the Company that he is prepared to consider firm proposals for blocks which have been under negotiation and invited the Company to submit a proposal for one block. He confirmed that no company would be awarded more than one block as majority partner/operator but that a company could acquire minority interests in several blocks if it wished. At meetings in Erbil last week, Mr Kozel and Mr Mackertich had made presentations to the Minister on blocks 5 [Shaikan], 6 [Ain Sifni] and 38 [Qadir Karam and Udhaim]. Mr Kozel confirmed that Texas Keystone was acting as a conduit for Gulf Keystone to acquire interests in Kurdistan and that Texas Keystone would take only the minimum equity required by the Minister to satisfy his requirement for the principal group to have an American identity. It was agreed that the Company should seek to negotiate interests in blocks 5, 6 and 38 on terms consistent with the company’s resources, subject to the final approval of the board.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As is apparent from the minute, by this stage it was looking likely that Texas would only take a small proportion of the equity to the extent required by Dr Hawrami. As matters progressed through 2007 Gulf had sought to have as much of Texas’ 70% as it could get. The proportion of its 70% interest that Texas might transfer – reflected in communications passing between Gulf (in the form of Mr Patrick or Mr Guest) through Mr Kozel to Mr Robert Kozel – had varied from a possible 100% to nil (when RAK was poised to take over Gulf) to 50% (when the RAK takeover had failed and as suggested by Gulf). Mr Kozel’s view was that, if Texas, as a US company was needed for the deal, it would want to have at least 51% and be operator. If it was not needed for the deal, it could take a much lesser percentage (or even none at all). By this stage (a) it was beginning to look likely that the operator would not have to be a US entity; (b) the Texas board wanted little involvement in Kurdistan; and (c) Mr Kozel was in the ascendant with Gulf. In those circumstances a minimal Texas participation made sense for Texas, Gulf and Mr Kozel.</p>

He puts the meeting at some point between Monday 30 July 2007 and Thursday 2 August 2007 as it was during this timeframe that Excalibur’s name was removed from the draft K 5 PSC (see para 587 below). I accept his evidence as to this meeting. Mr Kozel may have been on holiday on and after Thursday 26 July 2007, but he is likely to have been back in London by at least Wednesday 1 August 2007 because this is when Mr Cooper on 25 July 2007 suggested a meeting to discuss Gulf’s finances.</p>

Mr Kozel believes he probably showed Dr Hawrami a copy of the July draft PSC which shows Excalibur as a party. He certainly spoke of the parties. Dr Hawrami told him that Excalibur was not acceptable as a party to the Shaikan PSC because it was not an oil company or a serious player. He made it clear that he would not approve Excalibur. Mr Kozel told Mr Mackertich that Dr Hawrami wanted Excalibur removed from the PSC.</p>

They would meet from time to time either at the Lanesborough (Dr Hawrami’s favourite hotel in London in 2007) or at Gulf’s office when they were both in London. There were several (unminuted) meetings in August and September 2007. Both Dr Hawrami and Mr Kozel, who had a friendly business relationship (and socialised a bit), were peripatetic. Dr Hawrami would call up when he was in London and invite Mr Kozel to walk round to see him at the hotel a few blocks away from Gulf’s offices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that a meeting of the kind described took place is consistent with the matters to which I refer below. Dr Hawrami was considering at this time who would be acceptable on the PSC. It is clear that he, in fact, had a low opinion of Excalibur. Mr Kozel was the natural person to whom to communicate this view. That Dr Hawrami, an experienced oil man, should have held this view at this time is not surprising. Excalibur was a Wempen name plate with neither oil and gas nor financial experience. It had submitted no information to the KRG that vouched its suitability as a party to a PSC. What happened at this meeting was, in effect, a more explicit confirmation of what had been apparent from what Dr Hawrami had said in Erbil in July.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is corroboration of Mr Kozel’s account from Robert Kozel. His evidence was that he had been informed by his brother during a telephone conversation in the first half of August 2007 that Dr Hawrami had specifically informed him that Excalibur would not be allowed to participate in the Shaikan PSC. His recollection of exact words was that Dr Hawrami had said that the Kurdistan government did not “recognise” Excalibur as a legitimate oil company and would not therefore “allow them to participate”. Mr Kozel told his brother that he had informed Mr Wempen what Dr Hawrami had said.</p>

This is unconvincing. In the light of what had happened in Erbil in July such elaborate subterfuge would have been unnecessary. As will become apparent I do not accept that Gulf sought to squeeze Excalibur out.</p>

Excalibur was content for this to happen since a bid for a PSC with Excalibur (in its then state) as a party would not succeed.

Mr Wempen did not tell Mr Kozel that Excalibur thought that the Collaboration Agreement entitled it to an indirect interest. Mr Kozel did not realise that that was what Mr Wempen thought, if he did. To him it was obvious that the participation contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement was secured by bidding for a PSC. Mr Wempen did not, prior to the Shaikan PSC, have any discussion with Texas or Gulf as to the means by which any indirect interest might be recognised.</p>

But, as a threshold matter, the doctrine requires satisfaction of a two-prong test: that the material fact was information “<span style="font-style:italic">peculiarly within [the] knowledge</span>” of the defendant, and that the information was not such that it could have been discovered by the claimant through the “<span style="font-style:italic">exercise of ordinary intelligence</span>” (<span style="font-weight:bold">Black v.

Even if Gulf did not disclose what it knew of the KRG’s attitude it must have been obvious to Mr Wempen by now that Excalibur, if it was to be on the PSC, needed to get itself into a position where it was acceptable to Dr Hawrami, and that, at this stage, it was not. </p>

A more difficult question (particularly if considered in the abstract) is the extent to which it is sufficient for the company to have <span style="font-style:italic">access </span>to the necessary capabilities. As to that I would regard the defining criterion to be whether the capabilities in question can for practical purposes be regarded as those of the company. So far as finance is concerned, the backing of a financially sound parent should suffice. Similarly it would not be necessary for the relevant technical personnel to be employees of the company, provided they were available to it (e.g. because they are or can be engaged as consultants or seconded from a parent, subsidiary or other company in the group) to do the work. I would not, however, regard Article 24 as satisfied by company X if, for instance, it had no technical resources but had agreed to be on the PSC with company Y, which had them, even if Y had agreed with X that Y would provide them.</p>

It is not apparent from the list of the companies which were awarded PSCs that any of them lacked either financial or technical ability, let alone both, although in respect of some of them information is sparse. Excalibur cites the example of Impulse Energy which signed the Ain Sifni PSC alongside Hunt Oil. That was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands the day before it signed the PSC. But it is not clear to me that it lacked either capability. The KRG press release describes it as “<span style="font-style:italic">a private company that invests in the energy sector in developing economies targeting oil, gas and power</span>”, which suggests significant financial resources. It had on its board Matthew Heysel who appears to have had a background in the oil and gas industry and financial experience.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the absence of direct evidence as to Dr Hawrami’s approach it is not, I think, possible to say that Dr Hawrami would invariably require strict compliance by each participant with Article 24. Insofar as he was prepared to be flexible I would expect him to adopt a purposive approach, i.e. to apply the criteria so as to secure that the members of a group had between them the financial and technical capability to carry out the relevant operations. He might not require that each member could, alone, finance the contemplated operations. Thus, if $ 200 million was needed and A and B could each provide $ 100 million, they would not necessarily be ruled out because they could not each provide $ 200 million. The position might be different if one of them could only provide $ 5 million. Similarly he might not necessarily require all the technical knowledge and ability needed to be present in, or available to, each Person. But he would require each member of the group to have what he regarded as a sufficient degree of financial capability and/or technical knowledge and ability. A party with very little financial or technical capability would reduce the attractiveness of the consortium and its operational capability (unless the other member[s] were financially/technically very strong). I use the phrase “and/or” because both capabilities would be desirable; both would be likely to be required by Dr Hawrami, and, at the very least, one of them: as Mr Park and Mr Codd, I think, agree: see para 3.1 (o) of their joint memorandum. Origination of the deal would not be sufficient.</p>

In those circumstances it did not qualify under Article 24 either in terms or as ever likely to be applied by Dr Hawrami, and was, therefore, unacceptable to him. The fact that Excalibur had introduced Texas, and, as a result, Gulf, was not in 2007 a matter of significance. Excalibur relies on the fact that the KRG enlisted its help to get an oil company as an indication of its acceptability. But that enlistment was made by Dr Yacu and before the KRG underwent a substantial change in April 2006 and before KROGL became law.</p>

Mr Wempen’s personal finances were not enough. He had some modest income from his work at the Pentagon. But in November 2007 (see para 958 below) he could not raise $ 10,000 on his credit card to pay a lawyer: see his email of 26 November 2007. In April 2008 he and Mr Franchi contemplated providing $ 100,000 for a SPAC idea (see para 1244); but how much might have come from him was unclear.</p>

These included certain Blauner trust accounts said to be of in excess of $ 500,000, which passed or were due to pass to the brothers on the death of their mother. No disclosure has been given in relation to these accounts (or the extent of the brothers’ entitlement thereto) and I am left in doubt as to how much they could realise from them and when. In any event (a) I regard it as unlikely that the brothers would have been prepared to use hundreds of thousands of their own dollars, including the value of their houses, for the Kurdistan project; and (b) any sums that might have been used were wholly inadequate.

He has not been called, although he was an available witness. There is, therefore, no direct evidence from him as to his skills, availability, or involvement. His primary expertise was in project financing, particularly for oil pipelines – a physical and useable asset. This is something completely different to raising money for oil exploration. His c.v. reveals that he has degrees in industrial engineering and refers to the fact that he had provided “<span style="font-style:italic">production engineering and oversight and direction</span>” in relation to oil and gas operations of various oilfields whilst at Proteus Energy Corporation, of which he was acting President and COO under a consultancy agreement.

Since the contract was one which Excalibur might later join (it was not to be on the PSC at this stage) it was important to get its comments on the draft at this stage, in order to avoid going back to Dr Hawrami later with a second round of changes if Excalibur showed enough financial strength to be acceptable to Dr Hawrami but did not like some of the terms. I accept that evidence. This email was not a recognition of an Excalibur/Gulf/Texas consortium in the sense of a binding collaboration agreement to which all three continued to be  parties.

Gulf submits that, in those circumstances, it is claiming the benefit of the assignment by reference to the New York law third party beneficiary principle. The extent to which an assignment occurred and the extent to which it confers rights on Excalibur is a matter for the proper law of the putative assignment contract. For contracts concluded prior to 17 December 2009 the choice of law governing contractual obligations is determined by the Rome Convention, implemented by the <span style="font-style:italic">Contracts (Applicable Law) Act 1990</span>. By the application of Article 4 of the Convention the applicable law of the alleged oral contract is that of Pennsylvania (where Texas had its principal place of business). Since there is no evidence that the law of Pennsylvania differs from English law, the latter is to be applied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is because, unless there has been a choice of law within Article 3 (which there has not), Article 4 provides that the applicable law is the law of the <span style="font-style:italic">country</span> with which the contract is most closely connected (article 4(1)). Under article 4(2) that country is presumed to be the place where the party who is to effect the performance which is characteristic of the contract (in this case Texas as the party who is to transfer rights and obligations under the Collaboration Agreement) has its principal place of business, i.e. Pennsylvania. The article 4(2) presumption can be disapplied under article 4(5), if the characteristic performance cannot be determined, or if it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country. Neither of these conditions applies. In particular, the fact that the draft assignment contract, in circulation since November 2006 provided for New York law, is immaterial. Excalibur is not alleging that this contract ever became legally binding. Nor can it be said that the assignment contract is more closely connected with New York. The fact that the Collaboration Agreement which is the subject of the assignment contract is governed by New York law is irrelevant: the test is one of connection of the alleged assignment contract with a country, not a system of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, therefore, necessary in New York law for Excalibur (B) to show an express or implied contract under which Gulf (C) assumed the obligations of Texas (A) under the Collaboration Agreement. That contract could be between Gulf and Excalibur or between Gulf and Texas for the benefit of Excalibur. It is the law of that contract, not the law of the Collaboration Agreement, which determines whether Excalibur has rights against Gulf. Here there is said to be the assignment contract between Texas and Gulf and an assumption of burdens by Gulf entering into an indemnity agreement with Texas (“the First Indemnity Agreement”), proceeding with the Consortium Bid alongside Texas and undertaking to be bound by the rights and obligation arising from the acreage acquired in that Consortium Bid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that that party was Texas, which, as the assignor, was to effect the performance characteristic of the contract. The assumption by Gulf of liability on which Excalibur need to rely is an assumption of liability to Texas to perform the obligations of the Collaboration Agreement for the benefit of Excalibur. That assumption of liability was part and parcel of the contract of assignment. Accordingly the relevant law is that of Pennsylvania.</p>

In opening it was described as a partial assignment. In closing the agreement was said to be an agreement to a total assignment if Texas could drop out altogether (which would, in practice, require KRG consent) but a partial assignment if some minimal participation was needed i.e. an assignment of such a proportion as the KRG would allow. I shall proceed on the basis that that is the agreement relied on. In his final oral submissions Mr Picken QC said that there was an assignment because there was an agreement to assign that was acted on by Texas and Gulf. Given that the quantum of interest to be assigned was dependent on the attitude of the KRG, I do not see how there can have been an actual assignment and, in any event, it is unlikely that the parties regarded themselves as having effected one. A 100% assignment would also have required Excalibur’s consent, which might well have been forthcoming, but was never sought in or after early September 2007.</p>

The draft provided for a payment of $ 230,972.78 on completion. Mr Kozel, who was under pressure from the Gulf Board to procure an assignment to Gulf, was prepared to forward the proposal to the Texas Board. But he was not in favour of an arrangement by which, in return only for past costs, Texas assigned the whole project to Gulf, with whose board he was in conflict, and whose business approach he found insufficiently entrepreneurial. He was also interested in working on the project after he left Gulf.</p>

The draft recited (as it always had) that Texas and Excalibur were parties to the Collaboration Agreement, and that Texas now wished to assign its interest, which it was stated as being entitled to do under the Collaboration Agreement. Clause 2.1 envisaged Gulf becoming party to the Collaboration Agreement (a) by notice to Excalibur and (b) execution of the Deed of Adherence, and making the completion payment of $ 230,000. The new consortium interests were identified as follows: Gulf 70% and Excalibur 30% i.e. what was contemplated was a 100% transfer. This would require, but did not receive, Excalibur’s consent. Mr Patrick asked Mr Kozel to send the assignment documents to Texas. Mr Patrick’s email suggested that only minor changes were necessary to the draft.</p>

It also had it in mind to bid for Block K 38 or K 10 (Akri-Bijeel), for which Excalibur would not be bidding, and which the Collaboration Agreement would preclude it from pursuing independently of Excalibur: clause 2.2 (a). In those circumstances there was no advantage in it becoming a party to the Collaboration Agreement. It is apparent from Mr Kozel’s evidence that he realised that Gulf had now no need to become party to the Collaboration Agreement, and that Texas and Gulf could proceed, as he put it, “<span style="font-style:italic">straight to the PSC stage</span>”.</p>

If they wished they could, no doubt, have agreed to adopt another method. But they showed no sign of doing so.

Clause 3.3.1, which applies to a partial assignment to Gulf, provides that such an assignment shall become effective upon the execution by Gulf of a Deed of Adherence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I disagree. clause 3.2.3 is in the most absolute and general terms “<span style="font-style:italic">No transfer of all or part ... shall in any circumstances be effective</span>”. The execution of a Deed of Adherence would satisfy clause 3.2.3, which achieves the same effect as that clause. But that is no reason to regard clause 3.2.3 as inapplicable to a relevant assignment. The provision in clause 3.3.1 that an assignment shall become effective upon the execution of a deed <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> implies that it shall not become effective until then. Insofar as there is any doubt on the question, clause 3.2.3 makes the position clear. The parties who agreed clause 3, which must be read as a whole, cannot have intended that a relevant assignment should take effect without a written undertaking by Gulf to Texas and Excalibur to adhere to the Collaboration Agreement. There was no variation of this provision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur claims that it waived the requirement of a Deed of Adherence.

Giancontieri</span>, 77 N.Y.2d 157, 162 (N.Y. 1990). It is not apparent to me that it ever purported to do so. In any event the requirement is not solely for its benefit. Execution of a Deed of Adherence would benefit Texas because it would mean that Texas was not left in the position of someone who had given up rights under the Collaboration Agreement but without Gulf having – beyond any argument – assumed its obligations thereunder.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not regard this as of assistance to Excalibur. First, it does not seem to me that obligations on the part of Gulf would arise otherwise than by an express or implied assumption of liability i.e. as a result of an implied contract. Judge Bellacosa was unaware of any New York authority which showed that there could be an equitable imposition of liabilities. Secondly, I see no basis for holding that there was an assignment in equity where no Deed of Adherence was executed and there was no agreement that it was not needed. Thirdly, there were no representations and acceptance of burdens which might give rise to such an equity. It may be that, if Gulf had acted as if it had rights and obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and Excalibur and Texas had proceeded on a basis that made clear that they treated Gulf as a party to the Collaboration Agreement (notwithstanding the absence of a Deed of Adherence), that Gulf could be treated as such a party. That would, in essence, amount to the parties agreeing to vary the contractual scheme. But they did not do so.</p>

Gulf, which was facing huge expenditure, would have welcomed Excalibur if it could contribute its 30%. A number of papers were prepared for the meeting which assumed Excalibur’s participation. The budget recorded an assumption that Gulf had a 50% interest in Shaikan (K 5), with 20% for MOL and 30% for Excalibur, and that Dabin and Excalibur were not involved in the Akri-Bijeel (K 10) licence. Its Executive Summary noted the need for Gulf to raise funds in 2008 and that the most likely option would be a “<span style="font-style:italic">farm out/sale of Kurdistan in event of success...</span>”. Mr Mackertich’s technical paper assumed that Excalibur would have a 30% interest in K 5 but that its interest had “<span style="font-style:italic">yet to be finalised</span>” and that it had no interest in Block K 10.

In the latter event its interest would be held on trust for Gulf pending KRG approval of an assignment. At that stage the interest would be beneficially owned by Gulf. That could be described as an indirect interest but its terms would require no amplification. Gulf would be entitled to all the revenues and liable for all the costs attributable to the interest.

Mr Wempen said that his entire plan was to fundraise against an asset and that investment bankers had told him “you need a deal to raise a dollar”. Even if they had, that does not mean that advance preparation cannot begin until it is signed. There was a deal in the offing in the form of the PSC; but Excalibur was not to be on it.

Since it involved Gulf in carrying the expenditure it amounted to something like a 17% equity interest. Gulf obviously thought Dabin would be valuable to it in providing political and strategic information, including introducing Gulf to local leaders.

The predominant purpose of such a letter was to burnish Mr Wempen’s reputation for the future.

Since Mr Carey had the press releases there was no reason for him to downplay Gulf’s role and Mr Wempen was not a man unused to putting himself forward. A better explanation is that his “<span style="font-style:italic">default position</span>”, as he put it, was to keep his name out of the press, because of his work on security matters (Mr Carey may have known that and been teasing him).</p>

They met either at dinner or at lunch and dinner. Mr Kozel discussed with Mr Wempen the possibility of Excalibur participating in the Shaikan PSC by way of a farm out of 30% of Gulf’s interest (being 80% for this purpose because Gulf assumed that Texas would drop out). Mr Wempen sought to argue that the introduction of MOL should only dilute Gulf’s interest and not that of Excalibur. Mr Kozel’s position was that any interest of Excalibur would have to be diluted by MOL’s 20%, just as Gulf’s had been, because MOL had been needed to do the deal. Mr Kozel indicated that he considered that Excalibur did not have any interest in Akri-Bijeel and he should not seek to maintain any claim to so small an interest (i.e. 30% of 20%). He made plain that Excalibur would have to pay its share of the signature bonus if it was to be part of the deal and impressed on Mr Wempen the need to get busy and raise capital. Mr Wempen did not reveal that no progress had been made in fund raising.</p>

It is unlikely that no reference was made to a farm out. If, as is accepted, the need for money in short order was raised, it is likely that the signature bonus (which created the need) was discussed; or, at the very least, referred to, even if that was part of a discussion of the total funds to be raised. No form of interest other than a farm out was discussed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On his way home from work that evening Eric Wempen emailed his brother on his Blackberry to say “<span style="font-style:italic">UBS is interested. Need full write up</span>”. What led to that message is in dispute. As to that there seem to me two possibilities. The first is that on Monday 12 November Mr Lessen asked Mr Pinho to ask for brief details of the proposal or sent him a message to that effect; and spoke to Mr Loeffler of the Energy Department, who asked for brief background materials but did not tell Mr Pinho that he had spoken to Mr Loeffler, possibly because when he spoke to Mr Pinho he had not yet done so. He did, however, tell Mr Pinho that he had spoken to Mr Loeffler on 14 November. The other is that on 12 November 2007 Mr Lessen told Mr Pinho about his conversation with Mr Loeffler after which Mr Pinho spoke to Eric Wempen. Mr Lessen relayed to Mr Pinho Mr Loeffler’s request for brief background materials, and it was this that led to the instruction “<span style="font-style:italic">need full write up</span>”. The email of 14 November 2007 refers to this conversation, as a reminder to Mr Loeffler of how matters stood and an introduction of Mr Loeffler to Mr Pinho.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not find it necessary to decide between the two. I incline to the former since, if Mr Pinho had been told by Mr Lessen on 12 November 2007 that Mr Lessen had contacted Mr Loeffler, it is slightly surprising to see Mr Lessen repeating the fact to Mr Pinho on 14 November 2007. In favour of the latter is that Eric Wempen’s account of what happened on 12 November 2007 is that Mr Pinho said that he had spoken with the Energy Group.</p>

Eric Wempen took notes. He then went home with a view to drafting an email the next day, emailing his brother from his Blackberry on the way. The email of the next day (see paras 798-9) set out six specific requests. Curiously it makes no request for the Collaboration Agreement or the PSC even though, according to Eric Wempen, he did discuss these documents.</p>

It is not referred to in any surviving document nor does it feature in the written evidence of either brother. In his 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> witness statement Mr Wempen recalled that around 12/13 November 2007 his brother indicated that UBS would need more information to perform due diligence but could not recall whether that was his own view or he had been told it by Mr Pinho. In his 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> witness statement Eric Wempen refers to his having told his brother that he needed to put together a full write up and says that, when he received the information which Mr Wempen sent, he thought it would not be sufficient to enable UBS to evaluate the deal. He does not say that UBS had previously made a very specific request for documents.</p>

No written list of the requirements of the Energy Group was ever made by that Group or forwarded by it, directly or indirectly, to Mr Pinho. A wholly oral transmission to Mr Pinho and by him to Eric Wempen is unlikely. The only reference to Mr Lessen having spoken to Mr Loeffler on 12 November 2007 is in Mr Lessen’s email to Mr Pinho of 14 November 2007: see para 785. It is apparent from that that Mr Pinho had not himself spoken to the Energy Group on the Monday, and, if he was told on the Monday what that Group wanted, it would not have been the six items in the 13 November 2007 email.</p>

He had no specific recollection of discussing with anyone in the Energy Group the general kind of information they would be interested in learning or the general kind of documents they would be interested in seeing in relation to the Kurdistan investment. He had a recollection of a general discussion with Eric Wempen around the time of the 13 November email as to what kind of documents the Energy Group would need to evaluate the deal. He did not recall discussing with Eric Wempen that the Energy Group would be interested in the documents in para (2) and (5) of para 799 but, so he said, he understood that the Energy Group would be interested in that kind of documents.</p>

Eric Wempen had drafted it as a letter to be sent to Mr Kozel and to be signed by him as “<span style="font-style:italic">Director and Counsel, UBS AG, Stamford Branch</span>”. When Mr Wempen said that that made it look as if Eric Wempen was at a brokerage outfit Eric Wempen (who had two signature blocks) changed the signature block to refer to himself as “<span style="font-style:italic">Director and Counsel, UBS Investment Bank</span>”. The fact that a version of the Eric Wempen email had passed between the Wempen brothers before it was sent (slightly amended) lends support to the conclusion that it was not in substance dictated by Mr Pinho as a list of what the Energy Group wanted. So does the fact that, as Eric Wempen accepted, the Energy Department did not in fact request a letter dealing with Mr Wempen’s role as originator or for details of other projects. Eric Wempen was not acting officially on behalf of UBS but making it look as if he was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Eric Wempen’s statement (para 797) that he was unaware of the 6 December deadline was disingenuous. The PSC, as he knew, provided for the signature bonus to be payable within 30 days of signature. His evidence was that he did not think it applied to Excalibur and that it was for Gulf to notify Excalibur that there was a “<span style="font-style:italic">hard</span>” deadline. The former proposition assumes that Excalibur was entitled to participate in the PSC without paying its share in accordance with the timetable of the PSC (so that someone else would have to pay initially); the latter that it did not have to pay until told by Gulf that it really must. The two propositions marry up with the argument at the end of the Eric Wempen email that, whilst Excalibur was entitled to an interest in the block, payment would only be due when some further agreement was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The construction of the Collaboration Agreement put forward was untenable. The Collaboration Agreement did not deal with the question of payment of the signature bonuses, which was governed by the PSC. Both Mr Wempen and Eric Wempen were aware of the 30 day deadline in the PSC (which takes you to December 6) and had been for months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The material that was being sought by Eric Wempen was in reality material that Excalibur was seeking, dressed up as a UBS request. All that UBS had sought was brief background materials. It is unlikely that the Energy Group of UBS wanted a letter offering co-operation in other areas when it had not even begun to address its mind to this one nor expressed any interest in any others; or that it requested technical data before it had signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). The Energy Group had not (as Eric Wempen accepted) asked for a letter detailing Excalibur’s role as originator nor would it have been interested in one. Nor is it likely that the Energy Group asked for documentation concerning Gulf’s current relationship with Excalibur.</p>

The draft is muddled, perhaps because Eric Wempen did not know what had happened between Texas and Gulf. It referred to “<span style="font-style:italic">the assignment to Gulf</span>” without identifying how it arose; it said, wrongly, that Gulf had executed a Deed of Adherence, when it had not, and that Gulf was arguably an Affiliate when the Collaboration Agreement expressly provided to the contrary; and it referred to unidentified emails as constituting Excalibur’s consent to the transfer of a Consortium Interest. The email stated that the issues had been discussed “<span style="font-style:italic">briefly with outside counsel</span>”, which Eric Wempen said he included to signal that there was a real dispute rather than a claim to have had full advice.</p>

Excalibur contends that the documents show that Gulf saw itself as “in an existing relationship” with Excalibur. This imprecise formulation begs the question as to what the relationship was. The relationship was that of a party to the Collaboration Agreement (Excalibur), which had decided not to participate in the Bid which that agreement contemplated and another (Gulf) which it was expected or hoped would in fact come onto the PSC, if it could.</p>

Even if it had been wrong, it would have been a view reasonably open to Mr Patrick and was, I have no doubt, held by him. Even the Wempens themselves were alive to the problems of saying Gulf was already a party. They realised the formidable problem they faced that Gulf had never signed a Deed of Adherence; see the email of 14 November at para 847 below (“<span style="font-style:italic">We could say that Gulf’s participation in the deal will not become valid until we received a signed Deed of Adherence from Gulf…</span>”).</p>

I consider (i), (iii) and (iv) below. As to (ii) Excalibur had no entitlement to an indirect interest. Even if it did, Gulf could reasonably think that it did not. The earliest time when an indirect interest was suggested was 13 November 2007. Excalibur never clearly asserted in 2007 that the Collaboration Agreement entitled it to such an interest: or how.</p>

Unless these were a sizeable and elaborate charade they are inexplicable if there was such a plan. I am satisfied that there was no charade. It is also noticeable that, after the PSC was signed, on 8 November 2007 Mr Bilal, Gulf’s accountant, sent Mr Cooper two spreadsheets. One showed Gulf’s budget calculated on the basis that Excalibur did not have an interest in Shaikan. The other spreadsheet, sent a minute later, showed the budget calculated on the basis that Excalibur would have the funds to take up a 24% interest in Shaikan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On <span style="font-weight:bold">14 November 2007 </span>the Wempens exchanged draft emails, intended to be sent by Mr Wempen to Mr Kozel, the purpose of which was to support the contention that there was a contractual relationship with Gulf. In one of them Mr Wempen proposed to say that “<span style="font-style:italic">the easy fix</span>” was for Gulf to execute the Deed of Adherence and that “<span style="font-style:italic">according to our counsel</span>” the Transfer from Texas to Gulf was “<span style="font-style:italic">automatic on 6 March 2007 when you sent me the signed Deed</span>”: a reference to the sending by Texas of the Deed of Adherence scheduled to the Assignment Agreement. This draft alleged that delay over resolving the assignment issue was preventing the raising of capital and asked, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, for a letter “<span style="font-style:italic">acknowledging our origination and participation under the contract</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another draft contained the suggestion that there had been an agreement in Erbil in July that advance permission for a transfer was not required, that Mr Kozel was authorised to sign on behalf of the entire consortium and divide the percentages and notify the result which would take effect forthwith. A further draft called for a letter “<span style="font-style:italic">acknowledging I originated the deal</span>” and claimed that only notification of the assignment was needed for it to be effective. It also asserted an understanding that Mr Wempen and Mr Kozel were supposed to agree a funding timetable and that he was told by outside counsel it would take upwards of a month to receive Confidentiality Agreements from each institution. It was in another email, sent about half an hour later, that Mr Wempen suggested that “<span style="font-style:italic">We could say that Gulf Keystone’s participation in the deal will not become valid until we receive a signed Deed of Adherence from Gulf Keyston</span>e”. The idea may have been viewed as a false point to rebut a Gulf contention. In fact it was a good one.</p>

As Mr Wilkinson’s evidence makes plain, the interposition of a fund made Excalibur’s task in raising finance more difficult. Excalibur had no track record or experience which would commend it as a fund manager and no specialist knowledge. There was no good reason for an investor to hand over his money to the Fund, in which Excalibur showed no sign of investing, for a fee. The advice as to what to do “<span style="font-style:italic">If they ask for docs today</span>” cannot be reconciled with the idea that the Energy Group had already made a detailed demand for documents.</p>

It would be on ground floor terms in that Excalibur would have to pay its 24% of the signature bonus and become a party to the JOA and pay amounts due in accordance with it; but there would be no premium or “promote”. These terms were industry standard for a farm out. Save in two respects they were no more onerous than would have applied if Excalibur had joined in the bid and become a party to the PSC initially. The difference was, firstly, the requirement to reimburse 24% of Gulf’s past costs, whereas under the Collaboration Agreement joint account costs are borne by the parties in proportion to their interests. Such a requirement is a standard one for a ground floor terms farm out offer. The second difference was the need to accommodate Dabin’s 10% net profit interest in respect of Gulf’s share. That was to be expected if there was to be a farm out of part of that share.</p>

A direct interest was likely to be more attractive than an invitation to take some as yet undetermined indirect interest, which would have at least two disadvantages: (a) the investment would carry the risk of total loss if Gulf defaulted; and (b) Excalibur would have no place on the operating committee.</p>

Even if it had been, in the light of my findings as to the construction of, and parties to, the Collaboration Agreement, any such plan would not have entitled Excalibur to relief. The offer imposed tight deadlines (subsequently relaxed) but they reflected the deadlines in the PSC in which Excalibur claimed to be entitled to an interest. At the lowest Gulf, acting in its own interest, was reasonably entitled to regard these terms as appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wempen’s analysis of the situation was seriously unbalanced, culminating with the irrational suggestion that MOL and the KRG could retain money paid in escrow if they did not approve the deal. Even if Excalibur had the right to participate indirectly, it could not, as Mr Wempen on occasion accepted, be on more favourable terms than if it participated directly. Credit for origination did not bear on the terms for participation. If Excalibur was to take an interest derived from that of Gulf it would have to be subject to the obligations to Dabin attaching to that interest. The requirement that the KRG and MOL should consent was no different from what would have been the position if Excalibur had participated in the PSC initially. Excalibur’s root and branch objection to the farm in offer sits uneasily with the fact that a farm in to the Shaikan PSC is one of the potential remedies which it seeks in this action.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur never deployed any of the material that it had been sent by Gulf either with or without the Collaboration Agreement or the email offering a farm out. That was, no doubt, because no one ever signed an NDA. Excalibur would, in any event, have had difficulty explaining some of it. According to Excalibur’s pleading the packet of information which it was presenting to investors in early December 2007 contained (i) the draft NDA, (ii) press releases about the Consortium, and (iii) the Thames Chesapeake term sheet. In the event no investors had sufficient interest to sign a NDA. Excalibur claims that no one was interested because they could not validate their title. As will become apparent I do not accept that at these initial stages, prior to the signing of any NDA, it is necessary to have an acknowledgment of title. The first step is to interest the financier sufficiently in the project to get him to sign an NDA. Excalibur had spoken to Lazard and UBS without any request for such an acknowledgment.</p>

Mr Wempen’s evidence was that although he may have requested this at the 3 December meeting he never expected to get it because the request was an unreasonable one.

The KRG might well have been reluctant to consent to a transfer to a new party of part of Gulf’s share at a premium. Such “flipping” shortly after the grant of a concession is unattractive, not least because it suggests that the original grant may have been at an undervalue. It is not, however, apparent to me that the KRG would have ruled out a transfer by Gulf to a technically and/or financially capable company on ground floor terms.</p>

The purpose of the origination letter at this stage was simply for Mr Wempen’s future. If evidence of title had really been needed to raise finance, it would surely have been included in the list.

The model was Gulf’s general model based on its 80% interest and not the one prepared for Excalibur by Mr Compton on 23 November. It was a particularly useful tool because its output could be manipulated to work out the results on changed assumptions e.g. as to oil price, which could be presented to investors. Mr Patrick’s initial reluctance to provide information was because of concerns about possible exposure to liability towards those who might rely on it.</p>

I do not regard this as in any way sinister. Gulf used models with both 20 and 25% between 2006 and 2008. On 22 February 2008 Mr Compton emailed this very model to Mr Ainsworth, the new finance director, who had asked for “<span style="font-style:italic">economics for Kurdistan</span>”. Mr Kozel’s personal view was that 20% was the appropriate assumption for “<span style="font-style:italic">raw green field exploration</span>” in an area where the closest well dug was 45 kilometres away and it was dry. At this stage of the process these types of assumptions are, as Mr Kozel put it, little more than “<span style="font-style:italic">arm waving</span>”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur placed reliance on the following matters: Mr Compton’s economic analysis presented to the Gulf Board on 25 October 2007 (based on a 25% prospect of success) referred (in its updated version) to an EMV of $ 7.75 million for a 100% share at a discount rate of 12.5%; his email of 26 October 2007 sent to Mr Cooper, Mr Patrick and Mr Mackertich referred to an EMV (on a 25% basis and with a 12.5% discount rate) of $ 16.3 million for 100% share (approximately $ 4.9 million for Excalibur’s share, if 30% or $ 3.9 million if 24%); the Excalibur-specific model prepared on 23 November 2007, but not sent to Excalibur, referred to an EMV of minus $ 9.2 million for Excalibur’s share; an EMV of minus $ 30.5 million for an 80% interest was contained in the model that was actually sent to Excalibur on 27 November 2007. Both of the latter two variations were based on a 20% chance of success and the figures I have quoted were those produced by using a 12.5% discount rate. The calculations set out a range of rates from 0% to 20%.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not regard this as of significance. If Excalibur thought that 20% was too pessimistic it could have used the model with 25%. In any event the difference between a positive $ 4 million and a negative $ 9 million (for Excalibur’s share) is minimal in this context. Even on the former figure the upside outweighed the downside by “<span style="font-style:italic">only a very thin margin</span>”, as Mr Kozel put it. At the then assumed potential reserves of 200 MMbbl the project was essentially neutral. If investment was to be justified it would have to be on the gamble that much more oil was there. As Mr Compton put it in his paper to the board referring to the EMV of $ 7.75 million “<span style="font-style:italic">risked economics do not appear robust</span>” and, as a result of proposed changes to the contract terms, “<span style="font-style:italic">marginal</span>”.</p>

The previous communications between the Wempen brothers show that they had given up on the idea of a direct stake (as contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement) and were seeking some form of indirect interest in the project involving investment in Gulf. Mr Wempen’s oral evidence was that Excalibur had not been looking at taking a direct stake since the late summer i.e. when he had the discussion with Mr Kozel in Erbil in July. Mr Patrick may well have used the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">not </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">now</span><span style="font-style:italic"> looking</span>” in his email because he had not realised that that was the position from July onwards or because he thought that the offer of a farm in was something which had, or would have been, of interest to Excalibur. Mr Wempen probably did not mean “<span style="font-style:italic">project finance</span>” in the usual sense of the word i.e. finance where the debt is only paid out of the assets and revenues of the project itself rather than those of the borrowers. It was plain from his evidence that he was not aware of that sense and used the phrase to refer simply to finance for a project.</p>

It was simply not interested in this sort of deal. Mr Wempen conceded in evidence that that could not be blamed on Gulf. Excalibur had, however, in its pleadings blamed its failure to get anywhere with, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, Lazard on Gulf’s refusal to recognize Excalibur’s rights. Mr Wempen’s witness statement had suggested that Mr Franchi had said that Lazard had private clients keen to fund who would require documentation of Excalibur’s claim. Eric Wempen had said that it was his “<span style="font-style:italic">perception</span>” that UBS, Lazard and Gulf Finance House had “<span style="font-style:italic">difficulty getting comfortable with the fundamentals of the deal in the absence of properly documented recognition of Excalibur’s interest</span>”. Mr Wempen confirmed that what Eric Wempen said he perceived was not true in respect of Lazard. The fact that Excalibur wrongly suggested that want of documentation of interest was what put Lazard off casts doubt on the reliability of the claim that, even if that was not the case with Lazard, it was so with other financiers.</p>

Nor is he likely to have said that Excalibur had no interest in the deal: his case was that it did have such an interest. The Excalibur teaser, which UBS had received and which Mr Latimer may have seen, had offered an interest; and Mr Wempen laid claim to an interest in other communications at this time e.g. in an email of 7 December 2007 to Mr Kitterman of Peregrine (“<span style="font-style:italic">We originated the deal.

Mr Patrick had invited him to come back with ideas on the form of any indirect participation and had suggested that he talk to his financial advisers, which is what Mr Wempen hoped UBS would be.

If Mr Latimer had said anything of the kind it would have been recorded or referred to in one or other of the two emails on account of its value for any “prevention” case; and because of the Wempen brothers’ habit of expressing to each other their anger at the effect of what they regarded as Mr Kozel’s betrayal.

UBS was simply not interested in the Kurdistan deal. This was not on account of obstruction by Gulf, or want of acknowledgment of title, but for one or more, and probably all, of the following reasons. UBS was not interested in funding partial ownership in an exploration project of this type. It was not being offered an investment in a company with a direct interest in the PSC. The Thames Chesapeake Fund structure involved the unappealing complication of establishing a fund, for which Excalibur had no qualifications, with the fund taking an indirect interest in the PSC in some way via Excalibur or an Excalibur vehicle. Excalibur itself had nothing to offer other than possible access to the deal. The terms on offer in the Excalibur teaser were decidedly unattractive. Mr Wempen sought $40 million in exchange for a 10% ownership interest, but the $40 million was in respect of the costs of a 24% interest. In effect, UBS would be paying a significant premium. </p>

Financiers have little interest in who originated an opportunity; only in what it is. A letter acknowledging Excalibur’s interest was not important at the stage that Excalibur was at, namely trying to interest financiers in the deal. At that stage they will assume that the company has legal title and any representation that Excalibur had an interest would have been taken at face value. If they became interested and signed an NDA and proceeded to the “due diligence” stage it would have been necessary to establish Excalibur’s interest; and a mere letter would be insufficient. I accept Mr Wilkinson’s evidence to that effect. Mr Park says that it is important to have comfort that you have or will get an interest in the PSC so that fundraising activities are worth initiating and pursuing. That is no doubt true in general terms; but relates to someone in the position of Excalibur not any prospective investors. He also suggested that if there was no acknowledgment of interest that would mean that Mr Wempen could not go into a room and represent to investors that Excalibur had an interest. This was not an inhibition from which Mr Wempen suffered.</p>

It seems to me an unlikely thing for him to say at this stage. In the teaser sent on 3 November 2007 Excalibur had already claimed an interest. <br/>Mr Al Ghalib is unlikely to have raised documentary proof as an issue before any NDA had been signed. The email was offering “<span style="font-style:italic">all the documentation</span>” if an NDA was signed and he would have known that one signs the NDA before one gets the documents. There is no email from Mr Al Ghalib expressing any such concern; nor is there one from Eric Wempen or Mr Wempen referring to it. The alleged statement is not mentioned in Excalibur’s further information describing fundraising attempts obstructed by Gulf’s failure to recognize an interest; nor was the incident referred to in Mr Wempen’s first witness statement when discussing his contact with Mr Al Ghalib, notwithstanding that in the first half of the relevant paragraph he asserts that, in the absence of origination letters, he could get nowhere with Mr Latimer. Mr Wempen’s oral evidence on the topic was vague and meandering. In any event Mr Ghalib was a long shot. Oil investment was not his main interest.</p>

I do not think this likely. There was every reason for Mr Kozel to want Excalibur to pay its share of the signature bonus which was due on Thursday 6 December 2007. There was no sound basis for asking for the entire amount by the end of January, which would have been (a) unknown and (b) not due. It was the signature bonus which Mr Patrick had asked Excalibur to put in escrow in the 23 November 2007 email and it is unlikely that he and Mr Kozel were asking for two different things. On 16 November 2007 Eric Wempen had said that Excalibur “<span style="font-style:italic">absolutely need[ed] to get a delay from Todd on the funding of the bonus</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

It may be that Mr Wempen realised that in order to raise the money for the signature bonus he would, in practice, need to raise more: but the message to Mr Kozel was that he was not able to raise whatever money was needed in order to pay Excalibur’s share of the signature bonus.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kozel’s evidence was that Mr Wempen said that Excalibur could not meet the 6 December 2007 deadline for payment of the signature bonus and “<span style="font-style:italic">needed</span>” about 6 to 8 months to raise the money: he suggested initially that they agree the same timeline as had been agreed with Texas<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="84">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Mr Wempen erroneously thought that Texas had a carry up to first oil. In fact it had (as the Gulf press release of 7 November 2007 recorded) a carry for the costs and expenses prior to drilling the first well i.e. the spudding<span> </span>- beginning of the drilling process - of the first exploration well. Thereafter there would, before first oil, probably be the cost of an exploration and an appraisal well. Mr Wempen did not in fact expect to get the same terms.</p>
	      </authorialNote>; Mr Kozel said that Gulf was not a bank and was only prepared to keep the farm out offer open until the end of January. I regard this evidence as essentially correct. In my judgment the substance of what was being said was that Excalibur needed until June (nearly 7 months away if you take the end of June). That timeline is consistent with the 2 January 2008 note. I do not find it necessary to decide whether (as Mr Kozel recalled at one point in his oral evidence) the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>January extension had been mentioned by him at the beginning of the discussion, or only in response to the 6-8 months proposal, or both.</p>

First it seems to me unlikely that there was any discussion about Excalibur’s interest/title or Gulf’s denial of it preventing Excalibur from raising finance. Mr Wempen’s note makes no reference to those matters. So far as Mr Kozel was concerned the issue was whether the farm in, which was what was on offer, could go ahead. When, as Mr Wempen’s note records, he began the meeting by saying that he could not raise the money by Friday that was a form of response to the farm in offer, whether or not the words “farm in” were used. So far as Excalibur was concerned the question was how to move forward in a positive way “<span style="font-style:italic">as opposed to throwing around blame and so forth</span>” (Eric Wempen’s evidence).</p>

I think it unlikely that Mr Kozel spoke in those highly negative terms (he did not recall doing so). He was to tell the Gulf Board three days later that Dr Hawrami had said that he would consider a request for Gulf to farm down its interest favourably. There was a discussion about the need for Mr Wempen to get himself approved by the KRG and that Gulf would help with that. That may well have included reference to the hurdles that Excalibur had to climb. But, as Mr Kozel viewed it, the ball was in Excalibur’s court:</p>

His suggestion that they flip a coin was intended to convey that there was nothing really to talk about. It is not clear to me, and I do not find it necessary to decide, whether the issue which the toss was to decide was whether there should be a buyout (which could be determined by the toss of a coin) or, as the January 2008 note records, what would be the fair value of a buyout (which could not readily be determined that way); and it may not have been clear at the time. Mr Kozel may just have said “let’s go down to the bar and toss for it”. It may well be that Mr Kozel’s humour was opaque to Mr Wempen who, with characteristic over optimism, interpreted what Mr Kozel said as indicating a receptiveness on his part to the idea of Gulf paying a substantial buyout price.</p>

Mr Kozel does not remember any such meeting. There probably was such a meeting at which the offer was made and Mr Kozel may have said that he would talk to his economic people.</p>

As is apparent from his first and third witness statements, and his answers to me, he is likely to have explained that Excalibur was entitled to a stake in the Shaikan block, provided that it could pay its way, and that it sought finance to secure the interest that it had (“<span style="font-style:italic">Excalibur’s own proprietary share</span>”). He made similar claims to other potential investors at the time. It is not clear to me that he made a reference to Gulf’s farm in offer but he may well have said that the deal would need the consent of the existing participants and the KRG but that the existing participants were eager to raise funds.

If that be right, any such obligation on Texas or Gulf must, in my view, necessarily be conditional upon Excalibur showing itself ready, willing and able to put up the funds to cover payment of the costs and liabilities referable to its interest, starting with the signature bonus. The implied obligation to give effect to the entitlement to an indirect interest is matched by an implied obligation to be ready able and willing to pay for it. The holder of a direct interest would be bound to provide its share when due and the same must apply to someone claiming an indirect one. This condition was never fulfilled. In consequence (subject to any question of prevention by the defendants) the obligation of Texas and Gulf never arose.</p>

There could be no commercial justification for that. Further, the obligation must be to put the fronting party in funds before the due date (or, at the very latest, on it) because there is no reason why the fronting party should bear any credit risk at all and the agreement does not provide for it.</p>

Mr Park in effect accepted that, if Excalibur had an indirect interest under the Collaboration Agreement, the “trustee” (i.e. the party to the PSC from whom the beneficial interest was derived) would have the right to be put in funds in advance to enable it to discharge the beneficiary’s share of liabilities when due.</p>

The meeting of 3 December 2007 discussed a possible postponement of the deadline.

However if, as Excalibur claims, there was an existing relationship with it, pursuant to which an obligation to pay arose only if demanded, it is legitimate to see whether, despite a denial of that relationship, there was what amounted to a demand.</p>

Due payment of the signature bonus was particularly critical. It was the price of entry into a risky venture and had to be paid when matters were at their riskiest. If Excalibur was in default further fund raising efforts would be difficult, and might be impossible, if for instance negative seismic results were recorded, and the other parties’ cash flow strained.

Further at the meeting on 3 December 2007 Mr Kozel was prepared to keep the farm in offer open until 31 January 2008.

On 3 December 2007 Mr Kozel received an email from Dr Hawrami seeking to meet him to discuss the KRG’s proposal that it should take equity in Gulf in place of some part of the bonus and the two of them met to discuss that subject that week. In addition the KRG had not specified a bank account for receipt of the bonus. The minutes of the Gulf Board meeting on 6 December 2007 record that “<span style="font-style:italic">Dr Hawrami was aware that the KRGs bank details had not yet been supplied to GKP and was prepared to extend the deadline for signature bonus payments while these discussions were ongoing</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and also state<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">The KRG had not formally requested payment while the discussions wrt to [sic] issuing GKP equity were still ongoing</span>”.

That is the period specified in Clause 16.3.3 of the UK OOA 20th Round Model Form JOA at the end of which the other contracting parties may elect to forfeit the interest of a party whose default in respect of any monies due in respect of Joint Operations has not been remedied. It was a JOA based on that form which clause 8.7 of the Collaboration Agreement required the bidding parties to enter into, and it forms an appropriate measure of the period after which any breach of an obligation to pay a share of the signature bonus is to be regarded as material.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I recognise that the JOA regime relates to the cost of Joint Operations; whereas the payment here in question is a portion of the signature bonus, which is an obligation arising under the PSC. But the provisions of the stipulated JOA are, as it seems to me, a useful pointer as to the appropriate period after the expiry of which the breach becomes material. If that be too strict a view, then I would regard a delay beyond 90 days from the due date (the period provided for in the actual JOA – clause 8.5) as the date by which the breach became material. Texas and Gulf did nothing which could be regarded as a waiver of any entitlement to rely upon material breach. Even if the breach did not become material until 90 days after 31 January 2008 or 90 days after payment by Gulf of the signature bonus on 4 February 2008 (i.e. in early May 2008), the breach is one on which the defendants may still rely.</p>

The act or omission must be wrongful in the sense described. This was illustrated in the evidence of Judge Pratt who was asked to consider a case where Party A is obliged to pay Party B a sum of money and asks Party B to make a presentation on its behalf to a bank from which it seeks funds to enable it to perform. Party B’s refusal to make the presentation would not engage the prevention doctrine because, in the absence of some custom of the trade which imposed such an obligation, Party B would not be obliged to provide such assistance. It would (or might), as I observed, be different, if Party B wrote to the bank and sought to dissuade it from lending the funds. The example illustrates that, whilst a party may be under an obligation not intentionally to do that which prevents the other party from performing its obligations, the prevention doctrine and the good faith covenant cannot be used so as to create new duties that negate explicit rights under the contract or are inconsistent with the contractual terms, as may be the case if the duty is not one that the party in question agreed to undertake.</p>

I must, for this purpose, assume, contrary to what I have decided, (a) that Gulf was a party to the Collaboration Agreement; and (b) that Excalibur was entitled under that agreement to an indirect interest. Even so, it does not seem to me that Texas/Gulf were impliedly obliged to confirm that entitlement to third parties in circumstances where there was a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> dispute as to whether it existed and when the agreement from which it was said to derive was available for all to see. Further, even if lenders would not provide funds to Excalibur without an origination letter, Excalibur, itself, if it had the money, could satisfy the condition required to be fulfilled if it was to secure an indirect interest. An origination letter was not a precondition of participation itself and the contract was workable without it. The scheme of the Collaboration Agreement was that each party was to provide its own finance. There was no obligation of any party to assist the other in raising it.</p>

The experts are in agreement that a bank would not in the early “pitch” stage seek to look behind a statement (e.g. in a teaser) declaring an ownership interest: see para 3.6 of the Park-Wilkinson joint memo and the oral evidence of Messrs Park, Wilkinson and Jull. At this stage the bank would take any representation that Excalibur had or was entitled to an interest at face value. (None of the institutions approached appears to have done anything different). Investigation of title would come later, if the bank was interested, and after signature of an NDA. A request to sign an NDA would, itself, indicate that the opportunity was a genuine one. That stage was never reached. If it ever was reached an acknowledgment letter would be inadequate. The bank would want to see whatever agreement was or would be in place to give effect to any indirect interest.</p>

In this respect, not being on the PSC put Excalibur at a distinct disadvantage (in Mr Wilkinson’s view it was probably fatal to any prospects of finance from private equity). Private equity investors would expect a company, such as Excalibur, embarking on a wildcat venture, to be on the PSC, since, if it was not, (a) it would be at least one stage removed from direct participation; (b) it would have no place on the operating committee; and (c) those financing it would run the risk of the party on the PSC defaulting on its terms and forfeiting its interest. An indirect interest may also be less easy to sell and private equity generally aims to realise its investment in 5 – 7 years<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="90">

Longford Energy Inc, which was in the Forbes &amp; Manhattan group, held an interest in the Chia Surkh block through Forbes &amp; Manhattan (Kurdistan) Inc, where there was no realistic credit risk. Range Energy Resources also held an indirect interest in the Khalakan PSC in circumstances where the credit risk was also negligible.</p>

If what was contemplated was an indirect interest, they would want to know what Excalibur had in mind. It is difficult to know what Excalibur’s answer would be other than that it was looking to the banks to advise on the question. The farm in offer was a far more attractive bet; but that was the one thing which Excalibur did not wish to take up.</p>

If it was entitled to an indirect interest it would have to be given effect by some means that had been neither discussed nor agreed. If Mr Wempen had shown the letter to a financier and had been asked the exact nature of Excalibur’s interest, he would have to have said that it was as yet undetermined; and, if asked how it arose, he could only point to the Collaboration Agreement and assert that Gulf was a party.

Further, Gulf had offered Excalibur a farm in and had not ruled out the possibility of it acquiring an indirect interest: see Mr Patrick’s email of 28 November 2007: para 972 above.</p>

In each of them liability arises because of the relationship of the puppeteer to the company and its effect on the company’s internal management. Such an approach avoids the prospect of a different law applying according to the wrong that the puppeteer has procured the company to commit. It is inherently possible that a company entirely dominated by another may, in respect of the same course of conduct, commit breaches of contracts governed by the laws of countries A and B and torts whose applicable law is that of countries C and D.

Gulf and Texas were two independent corporations with their own boards and shareholders. Neither Gulf nor any of its shareholders (other than Mr Kozel) was a shareholder in Texas. Mr Kozel had only a 25% share in Texas, and, whilst the Texas Board left him to get on with it in Kurdistan, it made its own decisions as to what Texas should do. The idea that Mr Kozel dominated his father and his brother Robert borders on the risible. Both Gulf and Texas acted through their own independent boards. As Mr Robert Kozel put it: “…[Mr Kozel] <span style="font-style:italic">could not make a decision or put [sic] Texas’ fate without the approval of me and our board members</span>”. The fact that Texas was prepared, against an indemnity from Gulf, to retain a 5% interest in Shaikan, in order that the deal should not fail, comes nowhere near showing domination by Gulf. That decision was essentially made by Robert Kozel. Mr Kozel recused himself in relation to the negotiations over the indemnity agreement.</p>

No party has to acquire data or to submit or join in submitting a bid if it does not wish to participate and, if it does not wish to participate, there is no provision for a bid to be submitted on its behalf. If the National Government requires prejudicial amendments to the terms of the bid, a party cannot be forced to accept the revised terms: clause 8.6.2.

Clause 5.2 provides for the parties to agree a program for data acquisition, joint studies and the preparation of a Bid. These accounts are to be joint account costs. If the bid is successful the parties who participate in the successful Consortium Bid will become parties to the PSC and will enter into a JOA to regulate the exploration and development of the block. As a result they will then embark upon a venture in which they will share profits and losses. The Collaboration Agreement does not, of itself provide for that share save in the limited sense that, if a PSC is signed but no JOA has yet been entered into, the relevant parties’ shares in the rights and obligations will be in proportion to their Participating Interest, which may be said to have the effect of sharing profits and losses. The agreement that is contemplated as regulating the sharing of profits and losses is the JOA. There is nothing in the Collaboration Agreement applicable to Excalibur which, on the facts of this case, required it to share profits or losses.

It was undoubtedly an introducer – an important but not a fiduciary role. Thereafter Mr Wempen liaised with Dabin, the local agent which Excalibur had engaged, and attempted to exercise influence with the KRG (unsuccessfully). Mr Wempen came to Erbil in June 2006, on which occasion there was no presentation by Excalibur. The meeting was one at which he hardly spoke and at which he was embarrassingly cut off. After that Mr Wempen, on his own evidence, only met Dr Hawrami once – in August 2006 – and that is in dispute. On the second visit to Erbil it is common ground that he did not meet Dr Hawrami. Mr Wempen regarded Excalibur’s function as that of bringing the deal. He thought that it was for Gulf to do most of the rest, such as the scrutiny of the terms of the PSC and negotiating with the KRG. Origination apart, his contribution was of no practical utility. Excalibur took no part in the bid. As events after the signing of the PSC showed Mr Wempen came to expect Gulf to accommodate Excalibur with an indirect interest of some sort; and to extend time for coming up with funds. Mr Wempen’s expectations were not, however, the measure of the defendants’ duties.</p>

Since Gulf was to be doing most of the work under the putative joint venture it seems to me that it was the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract and that, under the Rome Convention, it is the place of its principal place of business which determines the governing law.

Excalibur and Gulf had, at the relevant period meetings in Florida, London and Kurdistan, but not New York. Neither of them provided services to the venture in New York. Gulf did so in Kurdistan and London where it was based. The venture related to the acquisition of blocks in Kurdistan.

If he had attempted to correct the misunderstanding it is not clear to me that Mr Wempen would have accepted his advice and acted differently: see para 316 above.

Even if Excalibur thought that it did need to be on the PSC (or would have done if advised that its view of the Collaboration Agreement was mistaken) there was no fiduciary duty which obliged Gulf/Texas to assist it to get there. If Gulf was not a party to the Collaboration Agreement it could have had no such duty. Even if it was a party, like Texas, it was the responsibility of the parties to secure that they got on the PSC in their respective proportions. They were not obliged to assist each other with finance or persuasion. As Mr Kozel told Mr Wempen, it was for Excalibur to sort itself out. Even if Mr Kozel had made further attempts to get Excalibur on the PSC he is not likely to have achieved anything other than to learn earlier than he did how bereft of access to capital Excalibur was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Insofar as the question of fiduciary relationship is governed by English law the answer is in my judgment the same. In English law a “joint venture” has no settled legal meaning. It is a business, not a legal, term. Further, the circumstances in which someone will be classified as a fiduciary are not precisely defined. I am content to proceed on the basis of the summary in Chapter 7 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Snell’s Equity</span><span style="font-style:italic">,</span> approved in <span style="font-weight:bold">Ross River Ltd v Waverly Communications</span> [2012] EWHC 81 at [235]-[238] per Morgan J that (i) a fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence; (ii) the concept captures a situation where one person is in a relationship with another which gives rise to a legitimate expectation, which equity will recognise, that the fiduciary will not utilise his or her position in a way which is adverse to the interests of the principal. Whilst fiduciary relationships may arise in a commercial relationship, this is uncommon, not least because it is normally “<span style="font-style:italic">inappropriate to expect a commercial party to subordinate its own interests to those of another commercial party. But if that expectation is not inappropriate in the circumstances of the relationship, then fiduciary duties will arise</span>”: <span style="font-style:italic">ibid.</span></p>

A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal.

That meant that it was, <span style="font-style:italic">pro tanto</span>, a party to a Consortium Bid with a Participating Interest of 5%.

Gulf was not aware that anything it was doing meant that Texas would be in breach nor did it close its eyes to the possibility that that might be so. Nor was anything that Gulf did improper.

The claim is based on a duty on its part to pay Excalibur 30% of the value of certain Kurdistan oil fields in return for its origination of the deal and other services. That origination was in Kurdistan and such services as were performed were not performed in New York. In those circumstances it does not seem to me that the relevant law is to be determined by a contract into which it did not enter and that the proper law of the obligation to make restitution should be the law of that country with which the activities which are said to give rise to the obligation have their closest and most real connection. That is not the law of New York. It is probably that of Kurdistan where the origination began and the enrichment occurred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was an attempt to have it both ways, when both cannot be right. The claim in the draft origination letter that the proposed settlement was a purchase of rights in the PSC would either have been true, in which case the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was to be deceived; or false because it was not those rights that Excalibur was to dispose. The only way of squaring that circle is to contend, as Eric Wempen did, that Excalibur had no interest in Shaikan for tax purposes (because it was not on the PSC) but, under the Collaboration Agreement, a legal right to an interest, which right would not be treated as equivalent to an interest in the PSC for tax purposes. In circumstances where Excalibur claims to be entitled to specific performance of an alleged entitlement to an indirect interest this distinction appears somewhat contrived; and, even if it were valid in US tax law, about which I express no view, would mean that the acknowledgment letter which Mr Wempen had asked for in 2007, which stated that there was an actual interest, was inappropriate – as was any reference to a “proprietary share” or the like.</p>

Mr Wempen sent his brother a draft of an email to Mr Williams. In it he said that he needed an origination letter; that “<span style="font-style:italic">they need to pay me and get rid of me</span>”; that he needed the letter to mention his role; and that he was highly concerned about receiving a payment from an offshore entity “<span style="font-style:italic">in the present national security environment</span>” because his security clearance was under review and any complications were the last thing he needed. A further draft by Eric Wempen of an email to Mr Williams, based on Mr Wempen’s own draft, dealt with the need to show that any funds from which the payment to Excalibur was to be derived were based on legitimate business activities and for some protection if Gulf engaged in some legally questionable activities in the future or if the legalities of the PSCs came under international scrutiny. At this time, as Mr Wempen was aware, the US authorities had disapproved of the Hunt Oil deal with the KRG and had said that such deals could have no legal standing and might hurt peace prospects in the area.</p>

He said that if the seismic results were positive, he wanted to readdress with Cadwalader the “<span style="font-style:italic">merits of [the] case</span>”.

This was a formal letter of complaint following a meeting on 12 September 2008. The letter, which referred to Gulf and Texas as Excalibur’s joint venture partners, claimed that Excalibur had been unjustly cut out and requested that Excalibur’s “<span style="font-style:italic">investment consortium</span>” be admitted to the PSCs in respect of Shaikan and Akri-Bijeel. It claimed that Excalibur had “<span style="font-style:italic">assembled a strong team of new joint venture partners and gathered the necessary funding for a major participation in one or more Kurdistan PSCs</span>”. This was, according to Mr Wempen, a reference to Prime. But Prime was not a joint venture partner and had not promised the necessary funding. Nor had Excalibur gathered any team. The proposal was that the KRG should use the option of Government participation contained in the PSC to award the consortium 20% in Shaikan and 10% in Akri-Bijeel on the footing that Excalibur’s 24% entitlement in respect of Shaikan should be covered by the 20% and the increase of its 6% entitlement in respect of Akri-Bijeel (30% x 20%) by 4%.</p>

Although the choice of options was “accepted” the non-binding letter of intent was never signed. Excalibur did not want to commit to anything. The plan was to wait and see how Shaikan developed in the hope that, if oil was found, finance on better terms would probably become available and that Excalibur might do better by suing.

It is, however, a fair indication of the sort of difficulties which Excalibur, a far less sophisticated applicant, would have faced even in the summer of 2008.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the autumn of 2008, Gulf again tried to farm out a 25% interest in Shaikan. Gulf offered a third of its working interest in Shaikan in return for a carry of Gulf’s share of the costs of two exploration wells and reimbursement of past costs of $ 28.75 million. This would make $ 58.75 million, the cost of the two wells being expected to be $ 15 million net each. (Of that 2/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> would represent a “carry” since the farm out was only of a 1/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> interest).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This farm out attempt was unsuccessful. Gulf approached about 20 companies. The majority of those approached were not interested, being deterred by the political or technical risks. For example, Talisman was concerned that there was a real possibility that there was no structural closure in the block, and considered that Shaikan might be a “<span style="font-style:italic">one shot wonder</span>” with “<span style="font-style:italic">no running room/follow up potential</span>”. Gulf received an offer from Dogan Enerji, an affiliate of Dogan Holdings, a Turkish conglomerate, in November 2008, but it was a low one<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="98">

The response was poor. Three companies gave the offer serious consideration. One of them, Niko Resources, said it was not interested because it was concerned about the technical risks and doubted the future prospectivity, fearing that the “<span style="font-style:italic">Block could be perceived as a ‘one well’ block with no obvious follow up to a dry hole at this time</span>”. The only offer Gulf received was from Perenco for a 37.5% interest (i.e. 50% of Gulf’s 75%), but the terms of the offer were, in Mr Gerstenlauer’s view, derisory. Perenco would acquire 50% of Gulf’s interest in return for carrying Gulf’s share of future well costs up to a cap of $ 11.4 million. There was no contribution to past costs and no premium.</p>

It also wanted a very large discount, eventually offering 5 p per share instead of 9 p. At the time the directors could not deal in the Gulf shares because it was in a ‘close’ period in relation to the interim results due to be published in September.

Mr Kozel told Dr Hawrami that he “<span style="font-style:italic">owed me a letter</span>” about the Excalibur situation as he had not had a response to his 2007 letter. Dr Hawrami asked to be sent a copy. A copy could not be found. On <span style="font-weight:bold">9 September 2009</span>, while on an aeroplane, he dictated to Ms Berry a brief outline of the letter which he thought he had written and delivered in 2007. This was not a verbatim dictation. He gave her an outline and she tried to put something together from what she understood he was saying. She told Mr Peart, Mr Patrick’s successor, that she did not really understand what was going on with Excalibur and did not really know what she was writing. She asked for help. Ms Berry sent a second draft of the letter to Mr Kozel on <span style="font-weight:bold">10 September 2009</span>, and on <span style="font-weight:bold">26 October 2009</span>, which Mr Kozel then signed.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not think that the letter was part of a plan to discredit Excalibur by, in effect, deliberately fabricating a letter which, when it was composed, was known never to have been written in any form. In September and October 2009, when the reconstruction of the supposed 2007 letter took place, litigation did not appear to be in the offing. Nothing had happened on that front, so far as Gulf was concerned, since Cadwalader’s letter of 5 December 2008. In Mr Kozel’s mind Excalibur had “<span style="font-style:italic">kind of gone away</span>” unless they came up in conversation. Unless there was also a response from the KRG the letter would be of precious little use. If the letter was never in fact delivered, the response would have to be fabricated. If, as Excalibur suggests in its closing submissions as an alternative, the letter was intended to show that Gulf was trying to help Excalibur in 2007, that was authentically apparent from Mr Patrick’s email of 19 November 2007 to Mr Morrow: see para 893 above. The 24 November 2007 letter was referred to in a witness statement put before Gloster J, as she then was, in the application for an anti-arbitration injunction as part of the history of this litigation but it was of limited if any relevance to the issues which had to be determined.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The more likely explanation is that in 2009 Mr Kozel thought (wrongly) that in 2007 he had asked for Dr Hawrami’s approval of Excalibur and about the applicable procedure and whether any further information was needed, to which the KRG had not replied. Gulf had in fact asked the KRG in November 2007 about the type of information that the KRG wanted; and the KRG had not replied. But that had been done by Mr Patrick.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It may be that in 2009 Mr Kozel thought that it would be no bad thing to have the KRG’s formal response as to the acceptability of Excalibur because it would confirm that they were not acceptable. Ms Berry’s first draft expressed the hope that the documentation sent to Gulf by Excalibur would “<span style="font-style:italic">allow you to confirm that there is no basis for their participation in the application as they do not conform to the minimum requirements</span>”. But I do not accept that he knew in 2009 that he had never written a letter in 2007 or that he has invented the account of his dealings with Dr Hawrami in 2009.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When the Shaikan PSC was signed, Dr Hawrami was not aware that Gulf was about to enter into its agreement with Dabin. Shortly afterwards Dr Hawrami indicated to Mr Kozel that Dabin could not participate in a PSC because locals and local companies should not benefit from a PSC. On <span style="font-weight:bold">29 January 2010</span> Gulf asked the KRG whether the profit-sharing agreement with Dabin was legally valid in the light of KROGL. Their letter indicated that they had concluded that it was not. On <span style="font-weight:bold">27 February 2010 </span>the KRG replied that it was not its policy that a PSC contractor should involve any local service provider or individual with a direct or indirect interest in the PSC. In addition it said that KROGL prohibited participation of any individual or organisation linked to government officials, political parties or influential individuals. That applied to Dabin in the light of Mr Berwari’s links to the KDP.</p>

Dabin indicated that it would respond, but did not do so. The agreement has for practical purposes been treated as void, and Dabin has not challenged that. Dr Hawrami took the view that the 10% net profit interest payable to Dabin should be paid to the KRG and that is what Gulf ended up having to do.</p>

By an amendment agreement dated <span style="font-weight:bold">9 March 2012</span> (5 days prior to the security for costs hearing on 14 March 2012), Psari agreed to increase the amount of the general litigation funding. It also agreed to an increase in the amount of its Security Advance by way of a bridging loan repayable as quickly as reasonably possible, on the condition that Excalibur obtained funding of a certain amount from other third parties for the purpose of covering the provision of any security.

Because Psari is to have a working interest it will be required, if Excalibur obtains an interest, to pay its percentage share of past and future costs. The amount of the interest or share in damages to which Psari might be entitled was increased by the March 2012 agreement if Excalibur drew down under the additional funding arrangements made thereby. The increase attributable to the increased security for costs was only due if the funds advanced had not been repaid by 1 October 2012 (and <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> if there had been partial repayment).</p>

Mr Kozel and Mr Gerstenlauer went to Dr Hawrami’s house and, prior to the formal discussions about the meeting of the previous day, Dr Hawrami raised the subject of the forthcoming US Kurdistan Business Council visit (due to take place on 15-16 October 2012). Mr Kozel said that he had read in papers filed in Court<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="105">

Dr Hawrami then got rather upset and said that he would not meet Excalibur’s representative. He telephoned his Communications Advisor, Mr Michael Howard, an English speaker, in the presence of Mr Kozel and Mr Gerstenlauer, to ask him to prepare a letter to that effect. After the technical discussion Dr Hawrami made a second call to Mr Howard with some amendments to the letter and directions as to timing and who was to be copied. I am satisfied that Mr Kozel did not, as was suggested to him, make this evidence up. Mr Gerstenlauer, who was present, even if not for the whole of the meeting, corroborated it.</p>

In the letter Dr Hawrami said that he had been advised that the USKBC delegation would contain a representative of Excalibur and that he was not happy to facilitate a meeting with the delegation if Excalibur was included.

In his report Mr Wilkinson had explained the relatively slow process involved in a single private equity house or fund making a substantial investment in a company like Excalibur. In his supplemental report in response (“Park 3”), Mr Park criticised Mr Wilkinson for not considering the most obvious and popular financing technique for E &amp; P players namely to attract funds, not from a single private equity house, but, through brokers, from a wide net of interested investors, which could be done in weeks.</p>

Forbes &amp; Manhattan is a leading private merchant bank with a global focus on the resource-based sectors. It has headquarters on Bay Street in Toronto, and offices, operations and assets across the globe. Its CEO – Stan Bharti – has a high reputation and it has acquired, restructured and financed mining assets worldwide and generated billions of dollars in market capitalisation.

The public market is in different cycles than what private equity will do, so the two are not tied at all in my view. Just based on my experience, when we would be investing might not have been the same time that the public markets would be out there buying shares or selling shares, or the IPO window would be open, in fact what we would do, sometimes we would have a private company, we would do our investment, we would develop it and our exit was an IPO.

In Park 3 Mr Park appeared to row back from this by saying “<span style="font-style:italic">it is inherently unlikely that any company will meet all of the requirements by happenstance before it elects to pursue listed status.

The joint memorandum is not to be treated as if it was a statute. But it, and the oral evidence, deal with what is needed to attract investment. As to the need to have at least one attribute, Mr Park said in his oral evidence that, if a company lacked all of the five attributes – as Excalibur did – it would have had “<span style="font-style:italic">a very low chance of being successful</span>” and that it would make private equity “<span style="font-style:italic">difficult or impossible to raise</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">very difficult or impossible… to attract private equity</span>”. For practical purposes it can, in my view, be regarded as impossible for a company that lacked all the attributes to raise the sort of capital needed.</p>

According to Mr Park, at one stage in his evidence, a company like Excalibur might start as a private company and then move to a public company over a period of 6 months to 2-3 years; and, in my view, it would only be at the latter end of that spectrum, if at all, that listing would have been achieved.</p>

A private equity house or fund considering whether or not to make a single substantial investment is likely to take about 4-6 months or more to come to a decision.

Given the quality of the asset represented by an acknowledged interest in Shaikan and Akri-Bijeel, finance would follow. This approach is fallacious. The asset (on Excalibur’s case a right to have an interest in Shaikan and Akri-Bijeel in some form) was not the equivalent of an Old Master or a precious jewel of undoubted value. It was a high risk venture, a wildcat play, which might fail utterly, and which would require years of expenditure on exploration and then, hopefully, production to bring to fruition. There was great geological <span style="font-style:italic">potential</span> in the form of an almost entirely unexplored territory in a prolific oil and gas region with blocks available on trend with the large Kirkuk oil field.

Excalibur never had (or sought) such personnel, which, in Mr Jull’s view, it would take 6-12 months to hire. Mr Codd thought two was an absolute minimum. In Mr Jull’s view an E &amp; P company, even if a non-operator, required “<span style="font-style:italic">a CEO with a record of unlocking value for shareholders, someone with relevant geological training and experience, someone with geophysical training and experience, someone with in-country experience (or experience of a like-country or basin), and a CFO</span>”.

Five may be too high, but it is likely that at least three would be needed in relatively short order and maybe more. Mr Park accepted in his oral evidence that, in addition to hiring a CEO and a CFO, Excalibur would have to hire a consultant or a consultant firm to interpret geological data; and Mr Jull’s evidence was that private equity will always require a geological report.</p>

They have procedures for taking clients on and will ask similar questions to those which an investor would ask, including consideration of the five attributes; the extent of management’s skills and trustworthiness; whether they like the proposed management and whether potential investors will do so; what are the prospects and potential problems in relation to the assets; what capital management is contributing (“skin in the game”); and the quality of the business plan.

I regard his assessment as reliable and likely to be correct. His view was based on the facts (i) that Excalibur lacked all of the five attributes, including the lack of experienced management or any capital contribution from its members or managers; (ii) it had started the process of finding funds very late; (iii) it had no proper marketing material, financial or production model, presentation, budget or business plan; and (iv) it was not a direct party to the PSC or listed.

ONOC had been the original partner with Calik and the agreement was novated to Anatolia. ONOC’s CEO between May 2009 and March 2011 was Robert Spring who had previously been VP, Exploration and Land of Conoco Phillips. He, therefore, did have oil and gas experience. It was he who was the CEO whom Raymond James was supposed to have located for Anatolia.

Mr Jull might have done the former but I do not regard it as established that investment banks in general are wont to spend much time explaining the deficiencies of a putative client and what it needs to repair them. Nor is it at all clear that Mr Wempen would have accepted any advice he was given. He viewed Excalibur’s role as that of passive investor and would have been reluctant to take on high quality and expensive staff. In addition neither he nor his brother were fitted for the task of finding and selecting appropriate personnel and would certainly need to enlist assistance.</p>

Mr Wempen regarded Excalibur’s role as that of originator and passive investor: see his email to Mr Patrick of 18 November 2007 (para 888).

This is not surprising because no reference to potential finance from this source appears in the pleadings or the joint memorandum and Excalibur never went to one. Merchant banks invest their own capital in equity, as opposed to seeking to raise capital as agent for the company seeking finance. They take a direct role in management or board direction. There is the example of Forbes &amp; Manhattan, which identifies projects and launches or forwards them through its own subsidiaries, to which it seconds or allocates personnel from its group. I do not know what criteria they apply, what interest they had in further investment in Kurdistan in 2007/8, the extent to which there are others like them, and how long they take to make a decision. There is no indication that they have ever acquired a company off the street (as opposed to establishing one of their own) or one which has no more than an entitlement to an indirect interest in a PSC or, indeed, a company that was already on a PSC. Nor do I know on what terms and at what cost they would act, on the assumption, which I doubt, that they were prepared to act for Excalibur at all.</p>

Mr Jull did not claim that expertise. In fact I do not regard Mr Jull’s evidence, taken as a whole, as meaning that a private equity fund will generally perform the sort of incubating role that Forbes &amp; Manhattan may adopt. He made clear that, whilst, if Excalibur came to him, it was possible that he <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> have referred them to Forbes &amp; Manhattan because of the latter’s interests in Kurdistan (and because Mr Bharti will overlook many of the blemishes which private equity will not), he would not have approached equity funds such as ARC Financial or First Reserve or Natural Gap for Excalibur; and that such funds generally do not second their own people to the company, let alone provide a complete management set starting from scratch. They may put someone on the board and become involved in selecting people to add to management. He had no personal experience of private equity firms supplying financial management expertise to companies. If and insofar as private equity firms act like merchant banks, it seems to me that they are, in effect fulfilling not an equity fund, but a merchant banking, function, to which the observations in the last three sentences of para 1392 apply.</p>

The idea was hopelessly grandiose. The suggested portfolio of the Thames Chesapeake fund, which had no track record at all, contained an extraordinary combination of some of the riskiest exploration assets in several different countries, together with utility assets at the other end of the risk spectrum. These are two radically different businesses with markedly different return profiles. No fund would combine the two, let alone do so and advertise the high returns mooted. Commodity trading was also proposed. The fund embraced a confusing mixture of businesses which required different types of expertise, training and skill. Mr Wempen had no experience of running a fund, and, if he was to solicit investments in Canada, would need a licence as a fund manager which he did not possess and was unlikely to obtain. The same applies to Eric Wempen, Mr Franchi and Mr Kinnear. The fund idea added another layer of complication and highlighted the shortcomings of Excalibur.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wempen had also, as I have said left the business of fund raising far too late. No doubt finance, as opposed to a conditional commitment or statement of intent, could not actually be obtained until a deal was there to be signed. But the preliminary work – assembling a team with the right expertise, preparing or assembling, so far as possible, marketing materials such as a business plan, a budget, economic models and geological reports, working out how the indirect interest was to be taken and approaching sources of finance in a measured and organized way without the imminence of a deadline measured in weeks – needed to have been started well before 1 November 2007. It would require a lot of time and effort and, for Excalibur, would probably mean obtaining qualified professional help from an investment banker. Mr Wilkinson thought that a start should have been made a year in advance and in any event by early 2007. Mr Jull thought it would take 6-12 months to put in place everything he thought necessary to obtain finance in Canada. Mr Park thought it would take 3-6 months to raise equity finance, but 6-12 months to do all that Mr Jull thought was needed to be done for that purpose (procure competent management team, have solid business plan, solid understanding of the asset and reasonable evidence of its prospectivity, skin in the game, and a geological report), but that many of those factors could be fulfilled within weeks which would permit Excalibur to proceed with funding. I think Mr Jull’s 6-12 months estimate for the time to raise equity finance (if it could be obtained) is a reasonable one. That assumes what is, itself, doubtful that Mr Wempen would have accepted the need to embark on this course, rather than insisting on a fund or Excalibur’s entitlement to participation based on origination alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, therefore, Excalibur needed to start at the very least 6 months before the finance was needed and that could well be too late. If the approach was to a private equity fund or a merchant bank the process of acceptance might itself take months. That Excalibur had not realised this was, itself, a hurdle to fund raising. Excalibur suggests that, initially, there could be temporary consultants or part time officers; but, as it seems to me, investors would not be satisfied with that, particularly the former, save that a geological report could be commissioned, possibly from Gulf.</p>

Mr Park accepted that it was a “<span style="font-style:italic">significant error</span>” for Mr Wempen to accept that Excalibur should not be on the PSC. It meant that what was on offer was a derivative interest. That added another layer of risk since the named party might fail and forfeit its interest. It would also require some convincing explanation as to why only an indirect interest was available. There are public companies which have raised funds on the basis of indirect interests in the PSC (e.g. Longford Energy Inc<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="116">

At the lowest, finance for an indirect interest, if available at all, would not be likely to be forthcoming until the form of the interest had been agreed at least in principle.

As to that it seems to me that several forms of indirect interest would not come within the Article. If, for instance, Excalibur had a shareholding in Gulf International the Article would – absent a change of control – not apply. But some means of taking an indirect interest might be caught by the clause e.g. if the proposed structure involved an assignment of the PSC to a joint venture company or a special purpose vehicle. I also incline to the view that an arrangement which constituted a disposition in equity e.g. an express trust of the benefit of the contract (such as in the Second Indemnity Agreement – even though Texas did not seek the KRG’s prior consent) would come within the Article. I do not propose to analyse the position any further. The fact that the taking of an indirect interest in a particular form would or might arguably require KRG consent could contribute to the unattractiveness of an indirect interest.</p>

There is no pleaded case to that effect; nor evidence of what proportion it might have sold and at what cost.

The number of hurdles that it had to surmount, and the results of such attempts as it did make, satisfy me that this was not a task in which, even with some letter of acknowledgment, it would have succeeded. Possession of an express acknowledgment of an entitlement to an indirect interest would not have crowned the efforts it actually made with any better success or caused it to make others which would have secured the necessary finance in time.</p>

The unique nature of the asset lies in the fact that it was an interest in a risky venture which might come to nothing but which offered the prospect of huge gains at a later stage. These have in the event materialised. To take the value of the interest at the inception of the venture is unfair since it takes no account of what the true value of the interest is shown (albeit with the benefit of hindsight) to have been. Further an assessment of the value of an oil field, at any stage, is one that requires the making of a number of assumptions or assessments which involve a considerable degree of speculation. An order for specific performance would avoid this.</p>

In that case Mr List was ordered to return or pay the value of a Chagall, which he had purchased from the Perls gallery, to the true owner, Mrs Menzel. Mr List was entitled to recover damages against Perls for breach of the implied warranty of quiet possession. The question was whether he was entitled to recover only the value of the painting when the gallery had sold it to him or its value ($ 22,500) at the time of the trial of Mrs Menzel’s action. The Court held that he was entitled to the latter. Mrs Menzel’s action against Mr List was in replevin and the $ 22,500 represented the cost to him of the disturbance of his quiet enjoyment. Further the court appears to have proceeded on the basis that his cause of action for breach of contract did not arise until the judgment in favour of Mrs Menzel. At any rate it was a continuing breach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur contends that the date of breach rule is not inflexible. It can and should be departed from if that is necessary in order to give effect to the basic principle that damages are to compensate the innocent party for the non performance of the contract by putting him in the same position, so far as money can, as if the contract had been performed. That, it says, is the case here. To calculate damages by reference to the date of breach would (if the defendants are right to say that the interest had no value) equate the interest with a worthless and defunct item, and ignores its inherent potential. On any view the interest is worth immensely more now than at the date of breach. The nature of the venture between the parties was that they intended to develop any blocks acquired and not just to acquire an asset which could be sold off relatively soon after acquisition. Excalibur always intended to hold on, and would have held on, to the asset and would not have had to dilute its interest in order to fund participation. The asset is unique and Excalibur could not have mitigated its loss by buying in a substitute. For all these reasons to take the date of breach rule would not compensate Excalibur and would be neither fair nor reasonable. It would give Texas and Gulf a far greater share of profits than was ever agreed or intended.</p>

The date of breach rule is, as the New York courts have consistently held, sound in principle. Assessing damages as at that date fulfils the basic aim. A valuation at that date of what is or is expected to be an income producing asset will take account of the prospect of future profits, as then viewed. If the asset in question is worth little or nothing at the date of breach and much more at the date of trial the claimant will obviously seek the later date; just as, if the value plummets he will seek the former. But if the court takes the date of trial it (a) exposes the parties to all the vagaries of post breach events, which may produce results favouring either side, or different sides at different times, as a result of events for which the parties or one of them may bear no responsibility; (b) assumes that which in this case is doubtful namely that the party claiming damages would not have disposed of any part of its interest in the interim, either to make a profit or to raise finance, as Mr Wempen sought to do when he tried to sell to MOL; (c) gives it the benefit of an increase in value when it has borne none of the costs or risks; and (d) enables it to hedge its bets by waiting until the venture has proved a success before making any claim.</p>

But it never in fact made an offer to pay the costs (which it was never able to pay) and there can be no certainty that, if it had the interest claimed, it would in fact have continued to pay them. And nothing can alter the fact that it has borne no risk. If the date of trial is chosen as the date of assessment one party or another may secure a windfall benefit or detriment depending on accidents of timing or judicious selection of when to bring an action. If, in theory or in practice, a party is allowed to choose the date by reference to which damages are to be calculated he is afforded the unjustifiable advantage of being able to hedge his bets.</p>

That would mean that Gulf would have been assuming a responsibility, if oil was discovered, to compensate Excalibur for ongoing loss of profits even though Gulf, and not Excalibur, had taken all of the risk.</p>

Such an award would give it, in respect of Shaikan, a proportion of the value of a discovered field with huge reserves when what it was denied was an indirect interest in a wildcat exploration site with huge inherent exploration, technical and political risks.

Even if satisfied that the wording did not apply (a view that might not be shared by the KRG or a Kurdistan court) I might have been reluctant to adopt any particular means of giving effect to an indirect interest without knowing the attitude of these bodies to the result which the order was designed to achieve. To impose on the Gulf defendants a result which was unacceptable to the KRG (whether or not it involved a breach of the PSC) might well be unfair to Gulf, if it prejudiced Gulf in its relations with the KRG or, at worst exposed it to a claim that it was in breach of the PSC. As Mr Codd observed, an attempt to bypass the KRG by granting Excalibur shares in a holder of the PSC or giving Excalibur some indirect interest, when Dr Hawrami had not wanted Excalibur to participate directly, might be a practical disaster. Since I am not going to make any such order I do not propose to address further the considerations material to the question whether and on what terms I should have done so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons set out in Appendix 2 hereto I have come to the conclusion that there was as at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 no real monetary value to any entitlement of Excalibur to have a 30% indirect interest (of unspecified form) in the defendants’ interests in the Shaikan PSC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If, contrary to my view, any assessment of damages should be made as if Excalibur had been denied a 30% direct interest in the defendants’ interests in the Shaikan PSC (on the basis that an indirect interest could have been modelled which would have the same effect) the damages would be no more than $3.3 million. At most, therefore, Texas would be liable for 5/80<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and Gulf for 75/80<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of that sum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excalibur faces a further problem. It claims damages based on the value of the interest as of now (or, in the alternative at the date of breach). That assumes that it, itself, would have held 100% of the (indirect) interest to which it claims to have been entitled and of which it claims to have been deprived. But the likelihood is that any participation on an indirect basis would from the start either have been through (a) a Gulf SPV (as suggested by Eric Wempen on 28 November 2007 in his draft statement for Mr Wempen – see para 1024); or failing that (b) an Excalibur SPV (see Eric Wempen’s advice of 16 November 2007: para 862); or (c) both. Eric Wempen’s draft statement contemplated either a Gulf SPV or an Excalibur SPV which would invest in a Gulf SPV.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because Excalibur, itself, had no funds, the likelihood is that most of the shares in the SPV would be owned by Excalibur’s “sponsors” and not by Excalibur. In those circumstances Excalibur cannot claim on the basis that it would have obtained 100% of the value of the 30% interest. Its interest would have been very heavily diluted.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A similar problem would arise if investment took place through a fund investing in some SPV. Excalibur might have been entitled to a management fee; but the claim is not based on that.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot tell what the dilution would amount to. If it were essential to make an assessment I would think it likely that it would reduce Excalibur’s beneficial interest in the SPV to no more than 20%. Accordingly, any assessment of Excalibur’s damages would have to be made on the footing that Excalibur’s loss is no more than 20% of the figure mentioned in para 1470 above.</p>
