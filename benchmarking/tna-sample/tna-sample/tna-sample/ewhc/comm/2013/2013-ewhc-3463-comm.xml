Mr Vik carried out different types of investment and trades through DBS, including investments in shipping, drilling and related equities (where he utilised the services of Mr Harald Hanssen), a special situation hedge fund and currency transactions (FX).  He also engaged Mr Bokias as his full-time investment manager who provided him with financial analysis and market views by reference to it, with regular updates, graphs and spreadsheets.  His major contact at DBS in 2005 was Mr Meidal, who left DBS in about September 2007.  Mr Brügelmann, who had worked with Mr Meidal then became Mr Vik’s point of contact and his “go to” man for the effecting of trades through DBS and later in 2008 through DBAG in respect of his (Mr Vik’s) own trading. </p>

The main purpose of this agreement (the “FXPBA”), was to allow Mr Klaus Said, an individual with experience in FX, to trade in FX on SHI’s behalf, using the medium of the Prime Brokerage arrangements furnished by DBAG.  Another ISDA Master Agreement was concluded between SHI and DBAG and signed by Mr Vik on 28th November 2006 (the “FX ISDA”), with a Schedule of specific terms and a Credit Support Annex (“CSA”).  Both that Schedule and an Amendment Agreement to the 2006 Equities ISDA, also signed on 28th November 2006 made it plain that “unless otherwise agreed between the parties, any transactions other than Foreign Exchange Transactions and Currency Options Transactions shall be governed by the ISDA Master Agreement dated 8th May 2006” and that the November 2006 ISDA Master Agreement should govern only Foreign Exchange Transactions and Currency Option Transactions.  As part and parcel of the arrangements for trading in FX and currency options, a Pledge Agreement was concluded dated 28th November 2006 by which SHI, DBAG and DBS agreed that all assets deposited or relating to an account of SHI with DBS would be held as collateral for all claims that DBAG might have against SHI.   </p>

On 7th December DBS undertook, without SHI being privy to it, to hold assets in the pledged account in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement and to monitor the lending value according to its own margining requirements and to advise DBAG if that value should fall below US$35 million (the TPMCA).  The NOK equivalent of the sum of US$70m (approximately) was paid into the account. </p>

It was generally referred to as Mr Said’s account or the New York account.  Mr Said was not technically employed by SHI, but by another creature company of Mr Vik’s which provided him with health benefits and a salary which were to be set off against financial compensation paid to him by SHI in the shape of 10% of the profits he made for SHI on his trading.  Mr Said worked (when not working from home or from his holiday house during the month of August) in the office annexed to Mr Vik’s wife’s house in Greenwich Connecticut, where others engaged by SHI also worked and where Mr Vik himself also had an office, on a different floor, from which he worked when not in his main Monaco office or travelling around the world.  Mr Vik was in the USA for 60 days a year or less, because of his residency in Monaco.  He had three personal assistants.   </p>

To effect these different investments, the normal pattern was for him to give instructions to Mr Meidal or Mr Brügelmann who would then execute the deals for SHI.  Wishing to indulge in more sophisticated forms of transaction, and in particular the shorting of equities, Mr Vik caused SHI to conclude a further Prime Brokerage Agreement with DBAG on 30th January 2008, but in this case operating through its London branch (the Equities PBA).  This prime brokerage (often referred to as the “London Account”) related to “transactions in respect of Securities” as defined in the agreement itself, including any instrument as agreed between the parties from time to time.  Under the Equities PBA, DBAG was to provide financing and settlement services to SHI against cash or securities to enable SHI to enter into transactions, primarily in stocks or bonds, but also futures and options in respect of either.  Under this arrangement, SHI could enter into purchase and sale transactions of Securities with third parties, nominating DBAG as its agent for settlement purposes, whilst DBAG could, at its discretion, provide cash or securities financing, against collateral in the Securities Account held by it, with a security interest over those assets.   </p>

All transactions concluded by Mr Vik were, prior to 30th January 2008, effected through DBS and, after January 2008, his FX transactions, his transactions in equities and in options and listed futures and options were all treated as governed by the suite of agreements reached on 30th January 2008 and handled in London on what was referred to as the GPF Platform, which provided for margining of these different types of transaction together under what was known as the DBX system.  As appears hereafter there is an issue between the parties as to whether Mr Vik’s FX transactions were governed by the FX ISDA to which the FXPBA (which indubitably governed Mr Said’s FX transactions) referred and any collateral agreements relating thereto, or by the 2008 Agreements.

DBAG issued margin calls totalling over US$500 million in respect of Mr Said’s trading.  These were mostly paid by SHI by transfers of cash from the GPF account from available assets and proceeds of sales, in order to meet the premium needed to close out Mr Said’s FX trades and the collateral required whilst doing so, whilst SHI also closed out substantial loss making positions on Mr Vik’s own FX trades and profitable positions on his Futures trades, until the money available to SHI in its DBAG and DBS accounts ran out.  DBAG claims sums as due to it, amounting to US$118,474,958, under the FX ISDA and the FX Close Out Agreement allegedly reached with SHI and US$125,523,086 under the 2008 Agreements, as sums due on the close out of transactions.    </p>

First, in circumstances which I shall describe more fully later, it accepted, when it had a discretion whether to accept or reject them, particular types of trades under the FXPBA (EDTs and OCTs), which, by reason of their terms, could not be booked, valued or margined on its GEM and ARCS VaR computer systems at the time.  When the market moved against SHI in the course of 2008, and in particular in the autumn of that year, on its case DBAG became entitled to call for margin in substantial sums.  It did not do so until it became apparent to it, as a result of another bank, Morgan Stanley (MS), seeking collateral in respect of Mr Said’s trades with it (using DBAG’s name and credit under the FXPBA) and from 2 direct trades that Mr Said had concluded with DBAG, that there was a deficiency in margin put up by SHI, which then led to the margin calls under the FXPBA to which I have already referred.

Although the latter would have impacted on earlier trading in amounts not calculated by the experts, on discovery on 16 October and 22 October 2008 respectively the errors were corrected.  The effect of the errors was that assets in the Cash and Securities Accounts on the GPF platform had been overstated by US$115m and US$315m respectively.  It is in these circumstances that a deficit emerged on the GPF account which led to a disputed margin call on that account on 22 October 2008.

It is said that DBAG wrongly margined Mr Vik’s own FX transactions with his and SHI’s other transactions on the GPF platform (supposedly under the Equities PBA), which led him to close out various Equities Futures and FX transactions which he would not otherwise have done, on receiving notification on September 3 2008 from Mr Brügelmann that he was near to SHI’s GPF margin limits, as calculated by DBAG.  If DBAG had margined Mr Vik’s FX transactions separately from the rest of his transactions on the GPF platform, there would have been no such warning as it was those FX transactions which were the subject of large market movements, with the consequent effect on the calculation of variation margin on the Equities PB Account.  SHI maintains that, in the absence of any warning on 3rd September, its Equity Futures and FX trades would otherwise have been held until profitable once again, and it thus incurred losses from the wrong margining and the wrong warning.  These failures were exacerbated by one of the two huge computational errors made by DBAG in respect of the GPF account. </p>

The computer system operated by DBAG and its Prime Brokerage (PB) desk was not capable of recording transactions of such complexity nor of producing valuations on a MTM basis nor of calculating margin requirements by reference to exposure (MTM) or what is known as VaR (value at risk), which is intended to reflect the loss involved in the liquidation of the assets in question.  SHI says that, in consequence of this inability to record and report on the exposure and margin generated by Mr Said’s trading, whether or not there was an agreed limit on Mr Said’s authority to US$35 million worth of exposure or an agreement to limit SHI’s liability to that figure, the effect of DBAG’s failures was that SHI was ignorant of the true figures (in the persons of both Mr Said and Mr Vik) and was unable to appreciate the risks being run on the EDTs.  Had there been any appreciation that the exposure and margin requirement exceeded US$35 million, and in particular to the extent that it did, steps would have been taken to close out those transactions and reduce the exposure to manageable levels.  Although the forensic accountancy experts instructed by the parties differ on matters of detail, both agree that by April 2008 the collateral requirement of Mr Said’s trading, if properly calculated in accordance with DBAG’s maximum entitlement would have been of the order of US$90 million and, after dropping below the US$35 million limit in May and June 2008, from July onwards fluctuated between US$50-100 million until September and October when it leapt, with some fits and starts, to US$400 million and, at its peak at the time of the margin calls, to US$800-$900 million.   </p>

In circumstances where Mr Vik alleges that he made agreements with Mr Meidal and Mr Said in the context of the latter’s FX trading, and where Mr Brügelmann is now no longer said to be a party to any such arrangement, the key issue of the oral agreements turns essentially upon the credibility of Mr Vik’s evidence in the light of the written agreements and their proper construction, the surrounding documents and the commercial probabilities, as well as Mr Said’s deposition evidence.   </p>

The Amendment Agreement to the Equities ISDA and the Schedule to the FX ISDA (both concluded in November 2006) provided that, “unless otherwise agreed between the parties”, transactions other than FX transactions and currency options transactions should be governed by the Equities ISDA and that FX transactions and currency options transactions (as defined in the 1998 ISDA FX and Currency Option Definitions) should be governed by the FX ISDA.

Although there was a dispute as to how the margining was done and whether it was truly cross margining or merely an aggregation of FX margin with margin under the Equities PBA and the Listed F&amp;O Agreement, it is clear that DBAG did margin Mr Vik’s FX trading under the suite of 2008 Agreements and not under the FXPBA, whether by reference to the Capital Limitation Agreement or PAL.  In cross-examination, Mr Vik said that he did not apply his mind to this issue at the time and that it was an argument for the lawyers about construction and contemporaneous exchanges between the parties.  There is here therefore a question of objective construction of documents to show what was or was not “otherwise agreed”, and questions of fact as to the conduct of the parties and/or the understanding of the parties, in the context of common assumption, waiver or estoppel. </p>

A draft of that report was disclosed by DBAG but the final version was subject to redaction by lawyers and is less informative.

No FXPB New Product Approval Process had been completed for the product.  FXPB had since conducted a review and confirmed that no other TPFs were held by it and had stopped accepting complex trades including TPFs.  The second issue referred to the lack of defined and implemented clear roles and responsibilities over the set up of new accounts for margining purposes, as between GPF, GES (responsible for F&amp;O), and IBO (the IT team).  A review was being conducted of existing accounts to ensure that they were being margined correctly as well as implementing control over the set up of new accounts.  The third issue was that inadequate credit risk management technology was utilised to manage the risks as a result of products traded by PWM (Private Wealth Management) clients operating primarily on the GM (Global Markets) infrastructure.  In particular the specific processes used to stress the exposures in a credit environment were not employed.  The fourth issue was the need for clear definition of PWM and GM responsibilities for clients managed under the PIC (Private International Client) desk framework.  It was said that PWM had no defined clear guidance on acceptable email correspondence with clients and in particular portfolio overviews were provided without clearly defining the scope of the reports or including disclaimers.   </p>

As their systems could not handle the TPFs, it did not matter how diligent CRM was or how much collateral they might have had because the margin requirement was unknown as a result of the absence of proper booking.  He made much the same point in relation to stress testing, commenting, as indeed was the fact, that what was booked on GEM had very probably been stress tested but the TPFs were not correctly reflected in GEM or were completely absent which meant that they would not be subject to such tests.  If trades were not booked properly onto the systems, everything was affected downstream so far as CRM was concerned.  These appear very fair points to make.   </p>

The New York Court of Appeals explained this doctrine in <span style="font-style:italic">People v Evans</span> 94. NY.2d 499 (2000): “The law of the case addresses the potentially preclusive effect of judicial determinations made in the course of single litigation before final judgment”.

Nonetheless, the application of the doctrine is a discretionary one and, if an amended pleading is subsequently filed, it supersedes the original pleading and the allegations made in it, unless identical in practice to those previously dismissed, are not affected by the prior decisions of the court.  The issues which then arise are different.  SHI states that it is in the process of reformulating its complaints in the New York action to tally with many of the complaints made in this jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the decision of the Appellate Division on 2nd July 2013 apparently can be the subject of appeal after final judgment in the New York action.   </p>

In order to found issue estoppel in this country there must be a judgment which is final and conclusive and a decision on the merits of an issue which is identical in the two sets of proceedings and which was necessary for decision in the foreign court.  The House of Lords emphasised the need for a cautious approach in regard to issue estoppels based on foreign judgments in the light of different procedures and rules in other jurisdictions.  There is a need for the English court to be satisfied that the issues in question cannot be relitigated in the foreign country.   </p>

The FXPB Operations Team was based in New Jersey where Steven Kim was the Global Head of FXPB Operations and was ultimately, through intermediate line managers, responsible for Mr Walsh.  The latter’s job title was “analyst” but his task was to oversee the trade flow of FXPB accounts by checking that trades had been matched in the TRM system (the automated matching engine used by DBAG) and, when required, by booking trades into DBAG’s FX booking system, RMS, on behalf of clients for whom he was the designated Client Services Representative.  He was the Client Services Representative for SHI and was in contact with Mr Said in relation to his FX trading.  Mr Said also had dealings with Mr Quezada to whom Mr Walsh looked for assistance and guidance in relation to the EDTs and OCTs.  Whilst the other persons mentioned in this paragraph did give evidence, neither Mr Quezada nor Ms Liau did, although once again passages in Mr Quezada’s deposition were relied on by both parties.

Mr Walsh’s own understanding of the transactions effected by Mr Said which gave rise to the major issues was, it appears, somewhat limited, since he had to have those trades explained to him by Mr Said in October 2008, with the possibility of huge losses far from his mind until the collateral call came in from MS for sums in excess of US$100 million.  He was, it seemed to me, straightforward in the evidence he gave, although, not unsurprisingly, he could not recall detailed day to day events in 2007-8.  It was plain from the contemporaneous recorded telephone calls that he went through agonies at the time in not knowing what to do and he squarely faced up in the witness box to his failings, without casting blame on to Mr Quezada or Mr Kim, as well he might have done, with justification.  As will appear from a more comprehensive review of the evidence later in this judgment, the issue as to whether or not to accept these types of transaction was something well above Mr Walsh’s pay grade and was effectively taken by Mr Quezada, with acquiescence from Mr Kim, in the full knowledge of the problems in booking the trades and the hope of finding a solution to them in time.  Mr Quezada too was anxious not to upset Mr Said and to go along with his demands that he should be able to effect these trades through the prime brokerage arrangements.  The extent to which Ms Liau was aware of what was going on remains uncertain but since Mr Quezada sat next to Mr Giery and they both sat opposite Ms Liau, about a metre or so away, it is hard to believe that they were all unaware of at least some of the problems which arose in relation to the disputed transactions, although Mr Giery’s focus was different in 2008 and he had left by September of that year.  Whilst attempts were made to resolve the booking issues, Mr Walsh was essentially left to manage the situation as best he could, whilst those issues remained unresolved and had little prospect, it would appear, of resolution, whether in a period of 6 months, as envisaged by Mr Kim, or at all.  Mr Quezada and to a lesser extent Mr Spokoyny were aware of this. </p>

When seeking to justify transfers in October 2008 he seized on a “standing instruction” which was nothing of the sort, but, as it transpired, there was in fact a telephone transcript that showed that he had Mr Vik’s agreement to the transfer. </p>

A number of witnesses employed by DBAG and DBS participated in this attempted “cover up”, which was in any event futile because Mr Said was well aware of the position, as should have been obvious to the individuals concerned, and he had in fact told Mr Vik.  Given the size of the margin calls, it should also have been obvious that he must have told Mr Vik the position.  It is the more senior employees who must take responsibility for this, as Ms Serafini’s evidence confirmed, because decisions were being taken at a high level about the margin calls, about the basis on which they were to be made and the explanations to be given in an effort to keep the payments coming.  By the time of the second margin call, the problems were known to all the FXPB team who were dealing in any way with SHI.  They knew that recent market movements alone could not account for the sums now required by way of margin.  Attempts by Mr Gunewardena and Ms Liau to explain the calls on this basis were ridiculous.  The approach adopted by DBAG does it no credit at all.  Misleading and inaccurate statements were made and made to the knowledge of those concerned which was both dishonest and senseless in the circumstances.  If they thought that Mr Vik was being deceived, they were themselves deluded.  They were, it seems, surprised that Mr Vik paid up on the first five margin calls but the reason was not that they had deceived him but that he considered that he had entrusted Mr Said with considerable trading authority for SHI and felt that SHI was bound by his commitments, as indeed it was.   </p>

Since Mr Vik had already decided the previous weekend to close down transactions as opposed to just putting up additional margin, these figures included large premium figures for the closing out of transactions, but, on the face of it, without some knowledge of what was going on, he might have expected margin calls to be limited to a reasonably small excess over and above US$35 million, even given the extraordinary state of the markets in October 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September and the events which followed.   </p>

Furthermore the question arises as to whether he himself was also to blame because of his knowledge and/or approval of Mr Said’s trading.  The timing of his knowledge of different aspects of Mr Said’s activities may assume some importance in this connection.  As Mr Said himself said at the time, however, there is no doubt that the prime cause of the losses was Mr Said’s own market misjudgments in the torrid circumstances of the autumn of 2008. </p>

Whatever his state of knowledge at an earlier stage, as a result of exchanges with Mr Said, he knew by 9th October that DBAG had failed to margin the EDTs and by October 10 that closing out the trades was likely to cost hundreds of millions of US$.  That was the course which, over the weekend of 10th-13th October,  he decided to take.  By the time that DBAG issued its first margin call, Mr Said must have alerted him to the true position, in so far as it was known to Mr Said.  So it was that thereafter Mr Vik kept pressing DBAG to inform him of the history of margining, knowing that it could not do so without revealing its inability to book, value and margin the disputed trades correctly.  He must have known, because Mr Said must have told him, that Mr Said had agreed to DBAG not providing MTM figures in respect of the disputed trades with consequent impact on margin reports.  He knew that SHI had been getting a “free ride” on margin because Mr Said told him that.  Because of the terms of the authority which had been given to Mr Said by SHI, Mr Vik must have known that there were problems for SHI in relation to waiver of compliance with any implied terms as to accurate booking, valuation, margining and reporting of the trades.   </p>

He knew that the two were not coincident and that assessment of market value (MTM) was not a science.  If he had understood the concept of 95% VaR he would have realised that, ex hypothesi, it was not expected to cover 5% of the situations which might arise (although the application of a multiple to the VaR figure might be anticipated to cover the deficit in most situations, to which October 2008 might well be an exception).  If Mr Said incurred trading losses on trades otherwise within his authority, the amount of collateral supplied could not be or act as a trading limit in itself, though it might in practice act as a brake on losses, because of DBAG’s expected desire to insist on protecting itself by obtaining security in respect of potential losses caused by SHI’s trading.  The fact that some DBS and DBAG individuals, including Mr Brügelmann, referred to the US$35m as a “risk budget”, a “VaR budget”, an “equity chip”, a “maximum position limit” or even as a “trading limit” has provided SHI with something on which to seize to support an argument but it merely reflects a loose use of language and the view that this was the amount of capital Mr Vik wished to provide by way of collateral for Mr Said’s trading.  They understood that Mr Vik had set up Mr Said with US$35m as trading capital – as the money available to him as security for his trading – but neither he nor they could reasonably regard that as a limit on SHI’s liability for his trading, if it was otherwise authorised. </p>

These were, as described, obviously not vanilla trades in anyone’s parlance and Mr Vik could not have thought otherwise.  Furthermore, if he had thought that these were outside the scope of Mr Said’s authority, Mr Vik would have told Mr Said and DBAG that this was the case when he says he first heard of them.  He did not.  On the contrary, he appears (in email exchanges) to have supported and encouraged Mr Said to continue in these trades in the light of the profits then being made which it was hoped would continue from mid 2008 onwards and he raised no issue about them throughout the margin calls, when it is clear that he knew that they were the main cause of the losses.   </p>

There is no suggestion of any of the other alleged agreements restricting Mr Said to vanilla trades, to the PAL, to margining his own trades under the FXPBA or FX ISDA or anything else.  The Complaint is based on an agreement to a US$35m limit of exposure and DBAG’s failure to monitor the risk and keep SHI informed of margin calculations of its maximum entitlement with consequent failure to prevent Mr Said trading beyond such limit by demanding more margin.   </p>

Of course, a witness may be inaccurate or lie about one matter and not be inaccurate or lie about another.  The motivation for lying in one area is highly relevant in determining whether a witness is lying on another aspect.  Apart from the desire to protect SHI’s assets by refusing disclosure and making misleading statements the only motivation here is the advancement of SHI’s case against DBAG in respect of the trading losses incurred by SHI’s own agent, Mr Said, and I am clear that this was Mr Vik’s motivation.  Although Mr Vik sought, when he came to give evidence, to avoid some of the conflicts of evidence presented by the way that SHI’s case had been framed in the pleadings, whether by limiting the party to the oral agreements to Mr Meidal in his witness statements or by diluting some of the evidence which was in his six witness statements, the documents, the written formal contracts and the commercial realities meant that his evidence, even when standing uncontradicted by any DBAG or DBS witness, is incapable of acceptance on the crucial issues.

Whilst SHI maintained that the stance he took in his depositions was adopted to defend himself against potential claims by SHI and his affidavit was truthful in all matters and respects, the documents and all the commercial probabilities support his evidence in those depositions about the absence of any agreement with Mr Vik limiting his trading in any relevant way and about the extent of his discussions with Mr Vik concerning the different types of exotic trades that he pursued.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Cohen said that the duty of good faith and fair dealing was not selfdefining.  There have been various elucidations of the concept by New York courts but the most common formulation is that the implied covenant “embraces a pledge that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract”.  Professor Fishman stated that the duty of good faith not only proscribes undesirable conduct but may require affirmative duties, including a duty not only to refrain from hindering or preventing the occurrence of the party’s own duty or performance of the other party, but also to do whatever is necessary to enable him to perform.  He went on to say that the claim of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing brings to light implicit duties to act in good faith which are already present but not necessarily specified in the contract.  He said that “the claim cannot create new duties under a contract or substitute for an insufficient contract claim”, footnoting this by saying that in order for the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing to stand as a cause of action, there has to be an underlying contractual obligation between the parties.    </p>

The duty of good faith cannot add to, detract from or alter the terms of the contract itself and cannot be used to create independent obligations beyond those agreed upon and stated in the express language of the contract. </p>

A party must not put it out of his power to perform his obligations or prevent performance by the other party and may be required to co-operate to enable the other party to perform.  The implied covenant may attach to the exercise of a discretion or the exercise of a right as the authorities cited by Professor Fishman in his footnote 93 exemplify.  Although in that sense the implied covenant is free-standing, it does directly relate to the terms of the contract and the manner in which existing rights and obligations of the parties are to be performed.  It thus does not create independent substantive obligations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Similarly, with fair dealing: “The law contemplates fair dealing and not its opposite.  Persons invoking the aid of contracts are under an implied obligation to exercise good faith not to frustrate the contracts into which they have entered.  The rule is grounded in many cases that in every contract there is an implied undertaking on the part of each party that he will not intentionally and purposely do anything to prevent the other party from carrying out the agreement on his part.”   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">There was greater disagreement about the circumstances in which a court would imply other terms.  Thus SHI, on the basis of its own expert’s view, contended that a term will be implied into a contract where a reasonable person in the position of a party to a contract would be justified in understanding that such a term was included (although not set out explicitly) in the contract.  A court may imply an essential omitted term that the parties did not consider at the time of drafting the agreement or when circumstances have changed since the agreement was formed or which was implicit in the agreement at the outset.  DBAG, on the basis of its expert’s view, contended that, when a contract is made between sophisticated parties at arm’s’ length, courts are extremely reluctant to imply a term that the parties have neglected specifically to agree and (subject to custom and usage) will only do so when it is clear that the parties must have intended to include such a term but failed to do so.  When parties set down their agreement in a clear, complete document, their writing should be enforced according to its terms and it is the role of the courts to enforce the agreement made by the parties and not to add, excise or distort the meaning of the terms they chose to include, thereby creating a new contract under the guise of constructional implication.  Thus, a term will only be implied into a contract where a reasonable person in the position of the parties to a contract would be justified in understanding that such a term was included and where such a term, at the time of contracting, was in fact implicit in the agreement viewed as a whole.  Notwithstanding that, a court would not imply a term that conflicted with the express terms of a written agreement.  SHI’s only real qualification of this was to say that a term could be implicit in the agreement viewed as a whole where the parties could not necessarily be taken to have intended to include such a term but failed to do so.  It was sufficient if the parties had not turned their minds to a particular topic but the Court determined that, had they done so, they would have agreed to the implied term alleged.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">There was disagreement also about the implication of a duty of reasonable care and skill.  Such a term is applied to building and construction contracts and has been applied to the provision of professional services where causes of action for malpractice and breach of contract are concurrently alleged.  The authorities where such an implication has been upheld typically refer to “services” or “work” to be performed under a contract where the specified duty is described more in terms of a process than in terms of a specific result.  Where a contract sets out obligations which are absolute as to the result required, questions of due care and skill are irrelevant.  There is no case known to either of the experts where a promise to use reasonable care and skill has been implied in connection with a contract such as the FXPBA.  In practice, in the context of the current action, it would not appear that there is any real issue as to the implication of a duty of care and skill in relation to any express obligation in the FXPBA.  The question is whether or not a term should be implied requiring DBAG accurately to book, value and margin the trades in SHI’s portfolio and to report those matters to SHI or whether a term should be implied that DBAG should exercise reasonable care in carrying out those functions or whether no such term falls to be implied at all.   </p>

A valid waiver requires no more than the voluntary knowing and intentional abandonment of a known right which, but for the waiver, would have been enforceable.  A waiver may arise by either an express agreement or by such conduct or failure to act which evidences an intent not to claim the purported advantage.  The experts agreed that “mere silence, oversight or thoughtlessness in failing to object” to a breach could not amount to a waiver although where acquiescence featured in this spectrum was in issue.  The burden of proof of a waiver is upon the person asserting it and there must be a clear manifestation of intent to relinquish the contractual protection.  Waiver does not need consideration to be effective.   </p>

The issue is whether or not they constitute “currency options” within the meaning of the first paragraph of the Letter, either as a matter of language or market understanding.  That issue may turn on questions of legal analysis of the individual trades, whatever the terminology used to describe them, and in particular whether they truly have an element of optionality within them.  Alternatively, if the market understands such trades to be options, does the authority conferred upon Mr Said by SHI encompass all that the market understands to be options or understood from time to time to be options, or only what a lawyer would properly regard as options?  SHI contends that the trades have no optionality whilst DBAG, with the exception of two correlation swaps, contends that they do.  Moreover, whether or not there is express optionality, DBAG maintains that they have embedded optionality and as a matter of market practice in the world of FX, they are seen as “currency options” so that the wording used in the Said Letter of Authority must be construed to encompass them.

Such Structured Options, under the terms of Clause 2 of the FXPBA, required the approval of DBAG at the time when SHI concluded the deal.

The way in which Foreign Exchange Prime Brokerage (FXPB) works was set out by the expert instructed by DBAG in this area, Mr Quinn, in his report.  This was largely uncontroversial but, to the extent that there was any dispute about it, I accept his evidence, founded as it was upon years of experience of FXPB and its operation.  I found him a careful and thoughtful expert witness and reliable on other areas where there was more significant dispute. </p>

I came to the conclusion that I could not rely upon her evidence, which was not candid about that change of stance,  that her original stance showed a lack of understanding of how FXPB operated and that she argued a case, rather than giving independent expert opinion based on market knowledge. </p>

FXPB is essentially a clearing function (although others may refer to it as a credit intermediation function) offered by a bank to its clients to facilitate a client's trading activities on an agency basis.  The bank permits the client to use the bank's interbank credit lines, enabling the client to trade directly with several executing brokers but consolidating all positions and risk with the bank (which acts as the FX Prime Broker).   24.

Other documents that were customarily used included an ISDA Master Agreement (ISDA) and Credit Support Annex (CSA).

The FX Prime Broker would not be regarded as having a trade until both parties had reported the trade.  After the suggested period had elapsed, it was common practice for an FX Prime Broker to reach out to the party that had not reported for confirmation.  If neither party had reported the trade, it was impossible for an FX Prime Broker to know a trade had been executed.  Reporting methods included: Reuters 3000 Machine (FX chat and communication system), fax, phone, File Transfer Protocol file (FTP) or email.  Some banks who were on the Triana platform offered this system to their clients.  By 2006, it was commonplace to receive an FTP file that was straight through processed from the client into the bank's internal FX booking systems for all FX spots, vanilla options and forwards.  These FX spots, vanilla options and forwards generally represented more than 90 per cent of all transactions done by clients and, due to the degree of automation, the FXPB team had minimal manual involvement.   </p>

Matching a trade is meant to ensure that the client and the executing broker have exactly the same trade details.  If a trade is matched properly, the FX Prime Broker then inputs an equal and opposite transaction between itself and the client to ensure the FX Prime Broker ends up with a flat position.  While the FX Prime Broker takes credit risk by the provision of a credit line which gives the clients access to the FX markets, the ending net position for the FX Prime Broker is flat, reflecting the complete offset between the client trade and give-up received.  If a trade was matched it would have then been settled in accordance with its terms.   </p>

Having agreed the terms of a transaction, the terms of that deal would be notified to DBAG’s FXPB department by Mr Said and by the other bank with whom DBAG had a Counterparty Agreement.  That trade took effect as a transaction between the other counterparty bank and DBAG, through the agency of Mr Said and, subject to matching of the details provided, an offsetting trade would then come into effect between DBAG and SHI (the Give-up or Agency Transaction).  This structure would commonly be referred to as an Indirect Trade.  Where Mr Said, for SHI, concluded a trade with DBAG’s Trade Desk, however, the structure was necessarily different.  Self-evidently DBAG’s Trade Desk could not enter into a contract with DBAG’s FXPB desk as they were each part of the same legal entity but the mechanics of the transaction operated in the same way.

According to Mr Quinn, the FX prime broker was not understood to play and did not play any role in assessing or advising on the market risk or possible gains or losses from the transactions that the customer concluded.  Ordinarily, the FX prime broker would only know about the transaction after it had been agreed by the customer and the Counterparty, on receipt of notification from the customer and Counterparty, whether by automated means, electronically or otherwise.  The customer, acting as agent for the Prime Broker in concluding the agreement with the Counterparty, instigated the trade and notified the Prime Broker of it with the offsetting trade between the Prime Broker and the Agent springing up without anything in the nature of a trading decision on the part of the Prime Broker itself and without any opportunity for any discussion of the trade or the risk involved in it between the Prime Broker and the Customer. </p>

She considered that the position of a bank which entered into direct trades or incorporated a PWM department should be seen differently from the position of a stand alone FX Prime Broker.  Ms Rahl also considered that a bank would be subject to obligations in respect of margining.  She was prepared to accept that the function of margin was primarily to provide credit protection for the FX Prime Broker but did not accept that it could not also represent a calculation to be used by the client as an assessment of the market risk of the positions it had cleared through the FXPB.  Mr Quinn did not see any direct relationship between risk reporting by the Prime Broker, even if that was undertaken as an obligation, and calculation of margin since they were distinct functions effected by the FX Prime Broker for different purposes.  The calculation of margin was for the Prime Broker’s protection whilst risk reporting was for the client’s purposes.  Ms Rahl disagreed on the basis that if margin was “risk based”, which she took to be the case with VaR, it could be used as a risk assessment tool.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In her first report, Ms Rahl gave her opinion that it was at all material times the custom and practice of a reasonably prudent and competent investment bank to have a policy or policies regarding high risk derivative transactions to require that the bank explain the risks of the instrument to some person at the client who was not the immediate trading contact – i.e. a supervisor or a Chief Risk Officer.  That second person could be more senior than the trading contact or could be independent of the trading contact.  This evidence was adduced in support of a plea by SHI that, under New York law, on the true construction of the FXPB Agreement, in the light of factual background and/or as an implied term, it was a term of the FXPBA that the bank would ensure that, in circumstances when Mr Said proposed to enter into a high risk product, particularly a leveraged derivative (such as an EDT), an accurate explanation of the risk level of the product would be given to Mr Vik; alternatively the bank would take reasonable care to ensure that in such circumstances an accurate explanation of the risk level of the product was given to Mr Vik.  The plea related specifically to the FXPBA and Ms Rahl’s first report drew no distinction at all between direct trades with DBAG and indirect trades with other Counterparties.  Following the sequential service of Mr Quinn’s report, Ms Rahl responded by saying that the custom and practice to which she had referred in her first report regarding high risk products applied only to direct trades and SHI amended its case accordingly in Further Information served on 1st February 2013.  Ms Rahl agreed with Mr Quinn in the Joint Expert Memorandum of 31st January 2013 that the FX Prime Broker was not providing any advisory service to the client and that it was not customary for an FX Prime Broker to seek assurances that clients had adequately considered the market risks of the transactions which they sought to clear with the FX Prime Broker on “stand alone” trades as opposed to direct trades. </p>

It was a feature of Ms Rahl’s report that, instead of giving expert evidence on the market, she sought to refer to the specific contractual provisions and the facts surrounding the DBAG/SHI relationship, as she saw them.   </p>

Some required manual inputting with a careful review of the terms of the contract.  Ms Rahl considered that although there was no uniform identifiable set of standards which would be customarily applied and although the FX market was self-regulated, clients could reasonably expect accurate and timely booking and confirmation of trades, reporting and margining, irrespective of the systems actually used by the Prime Broker.  Although she agreed that a trading professional would generally maintain his own records, that did not change her opinion that the Prime Broker had an obligation to keep accurate records and there was no reason why a trading professional should not be able to rely on an FX Prime Broker to assist him with his records.  She considered that the accurate booking, valuing and recording of transactions was the minimum standard of service and the very basis of the prime brokerage business, whilst Mr Quinn did not consider these were core services offered by an FX Prime Broker to its client.  The services that were offered would of course depend upon the contract between the parties and no analogy with bank “checking account statements” was appropriate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Regulatory material relied upon by Ms Rahl was all for the purposes of audit of the bank by the examiners of the Office of Comptroller of Currency (OCC), seeking to ensure that banks were run properly with a view to avoiding counterparty risk for the bank’s own protection.  In my judgment, as Mr Quinn said, the only relevant guidance appeared in the Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Prime Brokerage Product Overview and Best Practice Recommendations of 2005.  These were not binding or enforceable.  The core services offered by a prime broker to a client were there said to be “leverage, access to market, liquidity, and consolidated settlements, clearing and reporting”.  This, on Mr Quinn’s evidence, corresponded with his view as to the Prime Broker’s functions, namely that of allowing the client to use the Prime Broker’s credit lines and the clearing and settlement of trades.  The reporting to the client might take many formats but was to enable the client to reconcile its own records with those of the prime broker.  There was no custom or practice which applied in respect of the reporting, save basic reporting of this kind.  Booking a trade in the prime broker’s books was done for its own internal management purposes, namely management of risk and exposure.  Any entity would seek to do this accurately for its own benefit but how it chose to do so was entirely a matter for itself.  Valuation was not part of any core service provided by an FX Prime Broker and, typically, traders did their own valuation internally with the aid of a third party system, or by employing an administrator who would be responsible for managing valuations and striking monthly Net Asset Values if that was required.  It was the custom and practice for FXPB clients to keep their own valuations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Quinn’s opinion was that there was no formalised industry standard regarding booking and recording of FX transactions and that in the 2006/2008 timeframe there were many new products which were inevitably going to be difficult to fit into existing systems of booking.  If the trade fell within the ambit of the Prime Brokerage Agreement, the Prime Broker had no option but to take the trades in and to book and record them as best it could.  Similarly, valuation and margining were arguably the most challenging aspects of FXPB throughout 2008, especially for complex structured FX options.  There was no standard market practice in valuation of the products, nor in the imposition of margin based thereon.  It was in his view customarily understood in the market that the function of margin was to provide credit protection for the FX Prime Broker and was not to be a calculation for the client of the market risk of the positions it had cleared through that Broker.  There was no regulation governing specific collateral levels and clients therefore appreciated that the FX Prime Broker might be flexible about margin.  There was intense pressure between 2005 and 2008 between banks, in seeking to match or better competing banks’ credit/margin terms in order to win new business.  There were also situations in which an FX Prime Broker might choose not to call for all the margin to which it was entitled.  It was customary for clients to have their own risk system, or to utilise the services of a third party technology provider to evaluate their overall exposure to the market.  Where the Prime Broker did provide trading information, there was dialogue between the Prime Broker and the customer to reconcile mismatch errors but not to reconcile risk evaluation.  Mr Quinn was not aware of any FX Prime Brokers who offered any form </p>

She said that for “give-up trades” she had not formed an opinion.  She went on to say however that FXPB reporting was not simply to provide a record of trades the client had selected and executed in the name of Prime Broker and that she considered that whatever the client received by way of report should be accurate and whatever reports were provided were the services upon which the parties had agreed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">So far as MTM and exposure were concerned, she considered that all that mattered to the client was what the prime broker thought about it for collateral purposes.  The client was reliant upon that reporting.  She agreed that valuation was not a core service but stated that it was part of leverage margining and that leverage for a collateralised product assumed an ability on the part of the Prime Broker to calculate margin.  Valuation was therefore not just for the Prime Broker’s own purposes.  It was a regulatory requirement for the calculation of margin.  She agreed that margin was sought by FX Prime Brokers to protect themselves against the risk of client default and came forward with no other reason for it.  She agreed it was not put in place to protect the client from incurring loss but to give the Prime Broker credit protection.  She agreed with Mr Quinn that the provision of collateral was conventional and that margin was for the protection of the bank and not a service to the client.  They both agreed that there were no regulatory standards for the manner in which margin was to be charged in FXPB.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In my judgment it is clear that the core services of a Prime Broker are as Mr Quinn described them.  It is also clear that a Prime Broker, when conducting valuations of trades, does so for its own benefit and protection, so that it can charge margin in relation to those trades.  In the ordinary way, a trader manages its own risk by reference to its own valuations and there is no obligation on the Prime Broker to calculate or call for margin, since any entitlement to do so is provided for the bank’s own benefit and not for that of the customer.  Indeed the customer’s own interests are usually directly contrary to those of the Prime Broker, since the customer will wish to minimise the amount of margin to be put up in order to obtain the greatest amount of leverage and the greatest scope for trading.  The standard position when margin is being negotiated is for the client to seek to restrict the figure to as low a level as the Prime Broker will wear.   </p>

The parties can expressly agree to specific forms of reporting, whether of the trades done, the valuation of those trades or the calculation of margin in relation to them.  That is a matter of freedom of contract.  In the absence of specific agreement to a broader scope however, I accept Mr Quinn’s evidence that, as a matter of market practice, FX Prime Brokers’ duties were to provide basic information for reconciliation of trades and positions and that traders who trade institutionally in the market know their own positions, track them and risk manage them.  If a service is contractually agreed, it should however be performed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Ms Rahl accepted that the FX Prime Broker was not obliged to call for margin but suggested that it had to communicate the fact if it was not calling for it.  She said she did not know if the bank could call for less collateral than that to which it was entitled but said that it was unacceptable to make partial calls without saying what it was that was being done.  She maintained that it was standard practice in margining that the client would be informed of the total collateral entitlement, the extent of any demand by reference thereto and the reasons for not calling for collateral in full and the circumstances in which further demand for it might be made.  She considered it misleading not to call for collateral when collateral was due and, although a bank could decide to waive its entitlement, it ought to inform the client that it was so doing.   </p>

She considered it standard practice in margining and that there should be no distinction for FXPB.  I was unable to accept any of this evidence as giving rise to a market practice which could affect contractual rights.  Ms Rahl had no relevant experience of the FXPB market to bring to bear on the subject and once it is accepted that any provisions for margining are for the benefit and protection of the Prime Broker, and not the customer, it is hard to see how there can be any applicable custom which could give rise to an obligation affecting the exercise of that entitlement.   </p>

DBAG submits that the purpose of this provision is plain, because it appears in the context of a clause which requires SHI to monitor the Net Daily Settlement Amount and the Counterparty Net Open Position for each Counterparty in order to ensure that the contractual limits are not exceeded.  The contents of the “summary” are not specified, but bearing in mind that purpose, must at least include the date of each trade, some identifying description of it, the identity of the relevant counterparty and the sums involved in the transaction so that settlement figures and Counterparty Net Open Position figures can be monitored against the limits specified - the Settlement Limit and the Maximum Counterparty Net Open Position.   </p>

This is to be done by summing the respective short and long positions on each currency in all the open individual FX Transactions between DBAG and the Counterparty (concluded by SHI), expressed in US$ and aggregating the result with the US$ Countervalue of the delta equivalent of Options purchased or sold by the Counterparty, taking into account Netted Options.   </p>

DBAG’s agreement to provide the figures for net exposure is clearly for the purpose of enabling SHI to perform its monitoring obligation in circumstances where the effect of not doing so could be to vitiate the authority given by DBAG to SHI to conclude Counterparty Transactions.  Clause 2 itself provides that DBAG is not to be responsible for any Counterparty Transactions executed by SHI if giving effect to such transactions causes the Settlement Limit or the Maximum Counterparty Net Open Position to be exceeded without its prior written consent or recorded verbal consent confirmed by fax immediately afterwards.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">DBAG’s agreement was to provide the information “up to two times on each Business Day during which there are Counterparty Transactions outstanding”.  The phrase “up to two times” appears to provide a degree of latitude in the obligation.  DBAG contends that it is to be construed as a provision giving a choice to SHI to ask for such information, but with DBAG only required to provide it no more than twice.  If no request is made, then there is no obligation to provide the information.  SHI contends that it provides an obligation on DBAG to provide the information once a day, and, at SHI’s option, a second time, if so asked.  It does not appear that SHI in fact ever did ask for such information, whether because Mr Said never felt the need to do so, being confident of being well within the limits in question, or because he did not want to raise the issue.  Where there was no specified Maximum Counterparty Net Open Position, there would be no reason to ask and, as will be noted, Structured Options fell outside this regime in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In my judgment, since the purpose of the provision of such information was, as DBAG submits, to inform SHI so it could monitor its trading against the limits, so that it was not at risk of exceeding them and running the risk of concluding trades in the name of DBAG which DBAG would not acknowledge, the Clause must be read as requiring DBAG to produce such information once or twice a day if and as requested by SHI.  If there was no request, there was no obligation to provide the information.   </p>

The information to be given relates to outstanding Counterparty Transactions and to realised profit and loss (unpaid cash settlement figures between DBAG and the Counterparty banks) on such trades and to unrealised profits and losses (in the shape of MTM on those trades between DBAG and the Counterparty banks).  The latter would appear to correspond to the margin requirement between DBAG and the Counterparty banks – essentially MTM on the trades between them (variation margin), without any initial margin, but it does not relate to margin calculations or margin requirements as between DBAG and SHI.  Those are to be found in the FX ISDA and the Schedule and CSA thereto.   </p>

The figures do not represent SHI’s total portfolio upon which margin could be charged under the FX ISDA, the Schedule and the CSA, with both initial margin and variation margin.  The whole of Clause 2 relates to the position between DBAG and its Counterparties and the effect of SHI’s actions when concluding transactions, as between DBAG and the Counterparties.   </p>

This means that they did not fall to be taken into account in assessing the Maximum Counterparty Net Open Position nor require SHI to monitor them.  Each “Structured Option” was to be the subject of specific agreement by DBAG, as provided by Clause 2, at the time SHI concluded any such trades with a Counterparty.  Thus “Structured Options” fell into a special class of options, outside the Counterparty Net Open Position provisions, each of which had to be approved before being concluded by SHI and taken in by DBAG, in order to be an “Accepted Transaction”.   </p>

Each involves the aggregation of figures on a “per Counterparty” basis and Clause 8 gives DBAG the right unilaterally to amend those limits on 20 days notice or to do so immediately in the event of reasonable grounds to believe that the Counterparty is unable to perform any of its obligations under the Counterparty Master Agreement.  Moreover, under Clause 11, if SHI were to exceed one of those two limits without DBAG’s prior consent, DBAG would be entitled to terminate the FXPBA immediately.  The limits are provided for DBAG’s benefit and are capable of unilateral modification by it.  The agreement to provide a summary of outstanding trades and net exposure in relation to each Counterparty was for the purpose of enabling SHI to monitor its obligations and to ensure that it stayed within the limits provided by Clause 2.  No request was ever made for a report of the net exposure with respect to a counterparty for the purpose of monitoring that limit let alone for a report of net exposure on Structured Options which fell outside that limit, so that DBAG cannot be in breach of Clause 2.  In short, the express terms of Clause 2 are of no direct assistance to SHI in its allegations of breach of a duty on the part of DBAG to book, value and record trades and to margin them and report such figures.  SHI has never alleged any breach of the Clause, as so construed.   </p>

The provision of collateral under the ISDA was a one way feature in support of SHI’s obligations to DBAG arising out of such trades.  Paragraph 2 of the CSA set out SHI’s Credit Support Obligations by reference to the concepts of the Delivery Amount, the Credit Support Amount and the Credit Support Balance, the last of which was the Allocated Portion of the Pledged Account as at any Valuation Date.  Under paragraph 11 of the CSA, the Credit Support Amount required to support SHI’s trading was the aggregate of the Independent Amount and DBAG’s Exposure.  That Exposure was represented by the amount payable by SHI to DBAG on the Agent Transactions as if they were terminated at the date of the valuation (namely the marked to market valuation or MTM/premium to close out the transactions).  The Independent Amount was initially 200% of VaR, representing the potential loss of value which might occur in the course of unwinding those transactions in a given period.  In the event that the value of the Credit Support Balance (the Allocated Portion of the assets standing to the credit of the Pledged Account), fell below the Credit Support Amount (constituted by the sum of the Exposure and Independent Amount), the differential, namely the Delivery Amount, was to be made good by SHI with Eligible Assets which would then constitute Eligible Credit Support.

Paragraph 11(h)(ii) of the CSA provided that where a transfer obligation arose under paragraph 2(a) of the CSA, any Eligible Credit Support should be transferred into the Pledged Account and that, once transferred, it would be held subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement.  Only Eligible Assets can constitute Eligible Credit Support and Eligible Assets are defined as “any assets which (i) would be eligible for transfer into the Pledged Account and (ii) would constitute satisfactory collateral, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Support Document” (i.e. the Pledge Agreement).  The Pledged Account is defined in the Pledge Agreement as Account 2011084.  What is plain, contrary to that submission of SHI, is that “Eligible Assets” are not confined to assets which are already in the Pledged Account because they are defined as assets which “would be eligible for transfer into the Pledged Account”.   </p>

Contrary to its submission that the only available assets which could constitute collateral for the envisaged FX trading were those already in the Pledged Account, the very definition of Eligible Assets envisages that the assets may lie outside the Pledged Account, because it refers to assets which “would be eligible for transfer into the Pledged Account” and “would constitute satisfactory collateral, pursuant to the terms of the [Pledge Agreement]”.   </p>

Of course if there are other Eligible Assets in the Pledged Account which are not part of the Allocated Portion and are available to become the Allocated Portion (and therefore the Credit Support Balance), then there would be no need for a transfer from outside but in the absence of that, there is no doubt that the CSA provides for margin calls to be met by SHI by payment into the Pledged Account to form part of the Allocated Portion. </p>

Reliance is then placed on paragraphs 5(a) and (b) but paragraph 11(h)(ii) prevails over this and SHI’s argument falls foul of the express terms of that sub-paragraph under the definition of Eligible Assets, to which I have already referred.  SHI refers to the use of “clumsy language” and “an imprecise use of language”, when the language is plain and it is SHI’s construction which is clumsy in its attempts to avoid its obvious meaning. </p>

If there are insufficient Eligible Assets in the Pledged Account to constitute the Credit Support Amount (the MTM deficiency plus 200% VaR) it can make a margin call by giving notice of its calculation of a new figure for the Allocated Portion and by demanding a transfer of the Delivery Amount for payment into the Pledged Account so as to increase the size of the Allocated Portion.   </p>

This required all payments by DBAG in respect of any of SHI’s FX trades under the FX ISDA to be made by way of credit to the Credit Support Balance.  As the Credit Support Balance, in accordance with paragraph 11(h)(ii) of the CSA, is the Allocated Portion on any Valuation Date, the trading profits, if paragraph 10 of part 5 of the Schedule is taken at face value, would go to increase the collateral available as part of the Allocated Portion, without any notification of an increase in the Allocated Portion.  As paragraph 11(h)(ii) provides that the Allocated Portion is constituted by the amount of assets standing to the credit of the Pledged Account, as calculated by DBAG in its sole discretion and notified by it to SHI, a notification of payment of profits into the Pledged Account can be taken as a notification of an increase in the Allocated Portion.  Since accumulated profits can only be paid into the Allocated Portion, the effect of notification of such payment must be to increase the collateral even if there is no express notification that the Allocated Portion has been increased.  The collateral available to support the FX trading is thus increased by the profits earned, as long as they remain in the Pledged Account, because they automatically form part of the Allocated Portion.  The accumulation of profits in the Allocated Portion would serve to increase the scope for collateralised trading by Mr Said above and beyond what was possible with US$35 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, no change in the Allocated Portion was ever notified by DBAG and  most of the profits earned on Mr Said’s trading were, with DBAG’s consent, withdrawn from SHI’s trading account (in one instance via the Pledged Account) without, it appears, any consideration of these provisions of the CSA.  Some US$30m was withdrawn in late 2007 and some US$75m (including a sum in Euros) in mid 2008 but, under the terms of the ISDA, once the money was in the Pledged Account, whether as part of the Allocated Portion or not, it could only be released from it with the consent of DBAG, whilst DBS maintained its monitoring role to ensure that the lending value of the assets pledged was always US$35 million or more.  On 6 October 2008, Mr Said agreed to new margin terms, which, for the reasons I have already set out in the context of the Said Letter of Authority, he had authority to do.  No notification of any change in the Allocated Portion was ever made to allow for this, even though the suggestion at the time was that the effect of the change would be to increase the margin required from about US$20m to US$40m, some US$5m more than the notified Allocated Portion.  This aspect was soon overtaken by events and the margin calls were met by payments from other sources than the Pledged Account, with Mr Vik signing transfers for payment direct to DBAG’s own accounts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">There is thus no basis in the FX ISDA, the Schedule or the CSA for the contention that DBAG was restricted to collateral of US$35m or to what was in the Pledged Account at any time.  There was a procedure to be followed in the provision of more collateral, in the shape of a margin call and a requirement to increase the Allocated Portion of the Pledged Account by “allocation” of assets within it, or transfer of external Eligible Assets to it, but, on the face of these Agreements, there was nothing to prevent DBAG from seeking additional margin, calculated in accordance with the CSA, whenever the situation arose.  As is recognised by SHI, the effect of its argument is that DBAG would  be assuming responsibility for any drop in the market value of the assets in the Allocated Portion or the Pledged Account, if it, when aggregated with the Initial Margin, gave rise to a figure which fell below the required margin level calculated in accordance with the CSA.  This is an unlikely and unbusinesslike  construction of a provision setting out a requirement for security. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is self evident that the reason for the provision of “the Allocated Portion” was because the Pledged Account was also intended to serve as collateral for other transactions apart from Mr Said’s FX transactions.  Only a part of that Pledged Account was intended to serve as collateral for Mr Said’s FX trading, namely the NOK equivalent of US$35m, whilst other types of transaction could be secured on other assets in the Pledged Account, as permitted by DBS in accordance with its separate requirements.  Initially the documents show that the NOK equivalent of another US$35m (approximately) was put into the Pledged Account as security for other types of trading that Mr Said had in mind, such as Fixed Income trading and trading of the kind he effected during the lead up period to the FXPBA, in Credit Default Swaps and Argentinian Bonds.   </p>

DBS had undertaken by the TPMCA to monitor the sums in the Pledged Account so as to ensure that the assets, denominated in NOK, did not fall below the US$35 million figure, but this was a private arrangement between itself and DBAG, to which SHI was not a party.

The pledged assets amounted to a figure just short of US$70 million.  DBS stated that it had blocked and would safeguard the pledged assets held at its Zurich office and would ensure that they were not released prior to receipt of authorisation from DBAG.  DBS agreed to monitor the loanable value of the pledged assets in accordance with its own margin requirements and procedures and undertook to advise DBAG should the loanable value of the assets fall below US$35 million so that DBAG could take the necessary action to maintain the required loanable value (under Paragraph (i)(iii) of Part 1 of the Schedule).

It provided for DBAG to enter into Counterparty Agreements with Counterparty banks before any Counterparty transactions could be concluded by SHI and for DBAG to enter into offsetting trades with SHI when SHI concluded authorised Counterparty Transactions.

The manner in which the Prime Broker booked or recorded these trades was an internal issue for itself alone and not a matter for the client.  The reporting function involved only reporting of basic trade details in order to enable the client to reconcile his own records with those of the Prime Broker in circumstances where every trader could be expected to retain his own records of trades and positions, to watch the market and to manage his own risk.  No trader would rely upon the Prime Broker’s collateral requirements to assess the market risk being run in relation to liability on trading positions.  (On his own evidence Mr Said was no exception to this.)  Any trader would be able to tell you, at any point in time, how his trades stood with respect to the current state of the market, from his own records and from following the market himself.  Risk management was a matter for the client and not for the Prime Broker whilst the Prime Broker’s entitlement to call for collateral in the shape of margin was a provision for the Prime Broker’s benefit alone and one which there was no obligation on the Prime Broker to utilise or enforce.   </p>

SHI contends that they were supplied as part of the services afforded by DBAG as a Prime Broker, that the FXPBA was the governing contract in respect of Prime Brokerage and that terms must be implied into the FXPBA in relation to the provision of those services.  SHI submits that the function carried out by DBAG in practice, however badly, in booking, recording and valuing SHI’s trades and in reporting those trades, their MTM value and the margin requirements of the portfolio were so fundamental to the Prime Broker relationship between SHI and DBAG that the court ought to hold that they were implied terms of the FXPBA.  It is said by SHI that a reasonable person in the position of SHI would be justified in understanding that there were implied terms in the FXPBA to that effect, since without them the framework in which SHI operated as DBAG’s agent and entered into offsetting transactions would not exist.   </p>

This level of fee was suitable for the routine transactions which were dealt with in an automated fashion.  In the ordinary way, with such routine vanilla transactions, the trades would be booked with apposite trade details in DBAG’s automated system, by both Mr Said for SHI and the Counterparty.  The system would match the transactions and confirmations could be sent to both parties showing the trade between DBAG and the Counterparty and DBAG and SHI.  Under DBAG’s automated systems, this would lead to the creation of initial margin at the outset by the use of DBAG’s ARCS VaR FX II (ARCS VaR) system in the case of SHI’s portfolio of trades (and by its NOP system in GEM for many other customers).  Initial margin was a figure intended to represent the losses which the portfolio would incur during the time it would take to liquidate it.  Thereafter the trades and assets would be valued (marked to market or MTM) and variation margin would be calculated by the same VaR engine.  In practice therefore, if margin was calculated and required on a daily basis, the variation margin payable on any given day would represent the shortfall between the aggregate MTM valuation of the portfolio on that day as compared with the valuation the previous day.  The aggregate amount of the Initial Margin and the Variation Margin was thus to be the subject of collateral available to DBAG, as provided by SHI.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The valuation and reporting of MTM values and margin levels depended upon the correct inputting of the trade details.  Once the trade details fed in by the customer, the Indian office or the FXPB operations department had been matched by the Counterparty, whether through Harmony or by email with a short form trade confirmation, the transaction would be booked in RMS and its details would then appear in GEM.  Valuation for margining on the VaR basis was effected by the ARCS VaR engine which fed through details of its calculations to GEM, with the MTM values as well as the Initial Margin.  Margining on the NOP basis, with MTM valuations for that purpose, came from a different source than ARCS VaR to GEM.  As appears later in this judgment, there were problems in the feed of information from ARCS VaR to GEM throughout the period from June 2007 to August 2008 so that, on ordinary vanilla transactions, the MTM seen on the GEM Web Reporting site was inaccurate and did not reflect the current state of the trades done.  In consequence, a work around was effected whereby a new reporting account was set up in GEM.  This was intended to replicate the trade details which appeared in the Outstanding Trade Details part of the website so that the trade information in this account auto-generated the same information in what became known as the P&amp;L Reporting Account.  MTM valuations from the NOP system were then fed into the P&amp;L Reporting Account which was not accessible to SHI on the GEM website, being only available to DBAG personnel.  At the close of business each day in the periods when these problems arose, Mr Walsh would send Mr Said, by email, a spreadsheet which represented a screenshot of the vanilla trades (with some adjustment) and the MTM position on each as they then appeared.  Mr Said’s main concern here was with the vanilla cash transactions, not the options, as set out later in this judgment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the relationship between SHI and DBAG, Mr Said increasingly was to effect trades which would not fit into the automated system and which were recognised by him and DBAG to be “Structured Options”.  He sought DBAG’s consent for these and, when obtained, provided details of the trades by email.  Manual intervention was then needed in order to book the trades into DBAG’s systems although, as appears elsewhere, there were insufficient fields available in the computer systems for the EDTs to be properly booked.  Nonetheless, in the light of the increasing manual work required in particular to match trade confirmations, a special fee was negotiated and agreed with Mr Said, namely US$1,200-$1,500 in respect of each EDT.  Nonetheless, in total, DBAG received less than US$400,000 in contractual remuneration for allowing SHI to trade in its name, for giving SHI the benefit of its net margin arrangements with Counterparty banks whilst requiring SHI only to put up collateral to DBAG alone and, in addition, providing whatever services it did provide to SHI, which SHI calls “back office services”.  These figures can be seen in the context of realised profits of about US$40 million in Mr Said’s first year of trading and some US$81 million in eight months in 2008 until the market moved against him with resultant losses in excess of US$600 million in October 2008.   </p>

This Pitch Book set out the benefits of prime brokerage as including the efficient use of capital and increased operational efficiency with a centralised FX clearing facility, centralised credit arrangements, centralised settlement, position and trade reporting, error rate and market risk reduction through timely trade matching and confirmation, auto-matching technology (for Straight Through Processing by TRM), online real-time reporting and a simplified documentation process.  “Operational risk management” was to be achieved by the TRM auto-matching engine in the computer systems and website reporting with trade data feeds.  “Product depth” specifically included “FX options” and “Exotic FX options”.  In the Basic Trade Flow diagram, reference was made to the single credit line, single collateral relationship, consolidated reporting and single reconciliation achieved by the prime brokerage system operated by DBAG.  Trade matching, credit monitoring, allocations and valuations were specifically mentioned.  As part of the client service there was “on-line reporting” which was described as a real-time suite of trade reports which included trade detail, cash flow summaries, collateral summaries, historical reports, bank credit lines with all reports marked to market every 15 minutes.  Electronic summary trade files were said to be available for automatic reconciliation purposes.  Reference was made to efficient back office trade capture and reconciliation, and, on the page dealing with “Credit Terms”, under the heading “Margin Requirements”, the explanation was given that credit terms were specific to each client’s needs with Net Open Position based margining (NOP) on a tiered currency basis with percentages determined by credit.  VaR methodology was also said to be available.  As part of the seamless integration into DBAG’s FXPB system, the first step was set out as agreement on the product scope for the service.   </p>

Whilst the remuneration for Prime Brokerage services was limited in itself, there was a potential spin off, of which personnel in the FXPB department of DBAG were aware, namely that SHI might conduct direct trades with DBAG’s Trading/Franchise desk, thus generating profits for DBAG in a different department.  Moreover, DBAG recognises that these services were not freestanding, in as much as it contends that the web reporting services were governed by the GEM Terms and Conditions.  It thus accepts that there was a contract between SHI and DBAG in relation to web reporting, albeit that it relies upon those terms and conditions as excluding it from liability in relation to inaccurate reporting.  One way or another, it is in my judgment clear that there was an agreement of some kind to provide the services which were actually carried out.  These services involved the provision of information, not the internal booking and recording of the trades by DBAG, although, of necessity, in order to report, DBAG had to maintain some systems which would enable it to do so.  The GEM web reporting agreement cannot be seen in isolation from the FXPBA – the two are plainly linked, as both parties recognise.   </p>

Under Clause 4 of the FXPBA, every Agent Transaction was to be “subject to and governed by the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, including the Credit Support Annex”.  Specifically the Agent was to be required to post collateral in accordance with the terms and provisions of the CSA, it being agreed that any breach of the FXPBA on the part of the Agent (SHI) should constitute an Event of Default under the FX ISDA.  The FX ISDA and the CSA are governed by English law.   </p>

Only SHI therefore knew the terms agreed between it and the Counterparty which gave rise to the offsetting transaction between SHI and DBAG.  Clause 7 of the FXPBA provides that SHI is to indemnify DBAG against loss resulting from any error in any information provided by it to DBAG.  In practice, in the case of simple transactions SHI could feed the information directly into DBAG’s computer system (RMS) which would carry out a matching process with information fed by the Counterparty.  On more complex transactions human agency was required to effect the matching in the systems.  Structured Options would be the subject of special prior agreement before being concluded however so that DBAG would be aware of at least the main terms before giving its approval, but the same provisions of Clause 3 and Clause 7 applied nonetheless.  The Prime Broker was not responsible for the terms of the trades. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is accepted by DBAG that a core function of Prime Brokers is to clear trades, by matching them, on the basis of information supplied by the Agent and the Counterparty.  How this is done is a matter of mechanics and, following email exchanges and/or the supply of short form term sheets, it appears that the normal process involved matching trade confirmations from each party.  Where that could not be done, because there was an unresolved issue as to the terms of the trade, no deal would be concluded.  As this is a matter of mechanics however I do not see how the test for implication of terms is met, although it seems to me that an implied term to fulfil the core function of a Prime Broker of clearing by matching the Counterparty Transaction and Agent Transaction (on the basis of information supplied) is to be implied because any reasonable person in the position of the parties to the FXPBA would  be justified in understanding that there was a term to that effect, without which the Prime Brokerage function could not be fulfilled.  As a matter of fact, nothing turns on this implied duty in any event, but the terms of Clause 4 (last sentence) and of Clauses 5(a), (c) and (d) of the FXPBA provide circumstances in which action is said to be contractual notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in a trade confirmation.  The implied term is inconsistent with these provisions and cannot stand. </p>

As a third implied term (in paragraph 38(4A)) it is further alleged that DBAG was obliged to inform SHI of any inability or failure to book and/or record and/or value accurately any of SHI’s transactions in its accounts or recording systems.  I am unable to see how these terms can properly be implied either, since the additional functions which DBAG actually performed, and represented that it would perform, in accordance with its promotional literature were reporting functions, rather than internal functions of booking and recording which led to that reporting of trades and valuation of trades.  Moreover, if there was such a duty it would be an oddity to be under an obligation to give notice of any breach and, if there was no such duty, a failure to book or record would again be irrelevant.

So far as its own performance is concerned, DBAG would inevitably be in breach if it failed to perform the Agent Transaction.  No implication of any term is required for this and the alleged implied terms would not cross the mind of a person in the position of a party to the FXPBA.   </p>

Mr Said was, by the Said Letter of Authority, authorised by SHI to trade on its behalf under the FXPBA.  The FXPBA in turn authorised SHI to act as DBAG’s agent in binding it to trades with Counterparties.  It was always open to DBAG to agree with a Counterparty that a trade conducted by SHI in DBAG’s name, though falling outside the scope of the relevant Counterparty Master Agreement as defined in Clause 3 of the FXPBA, was to be binding on it.  The principal can ratify unauthorised acts effected by its agent.  Whether such a trade would be binding upon SHI under the FXPBA and/or the Said Letter of Authority is another matter but, even if it was not within his actual or ostensible authority, it could be ratified by SHI.  The only question which would matter in such a context was whether or not Mr Said had such authority, which depended upon the FXPBA and the Said Letter of Authority or on ratification by SHI of something done outside that.   </p>

Nor could it be obliged to calculate or demand its full margin entitlement at any particular time.  There could however be a significant difference between the provision of information on valuation on a MTM basis on the one hand, which a trader might wish to know for any number of reasons, including the hedging of the item or closing out a transaction, and on the other hand a demand for margin, which constitutes security to DBAG in respect of the exposure revealed by such valuations.  Any trader in the ordinary way would want to know how his trades were faring on an MTM basis in order to make decisions about future trading strategy and, in the case of more complex transactions, such as the EDTs or OCTs (as opposed to vanilla trades and forwards, where valuation was straightforward from readily available sources and with readily available tools) a sophisticated computer model might be required to provide MTM, with the only alternative being to seek a price in the market to unwind the trade in question.  Although the evidence of Mr Quinn was that all traders kept their own valuations as part of their risk management, there is no reason why a trader might not value a crosscheck on ordinary trades and might look for some guidance in relation to complex trades where a computer model was needed.  As will be seen later, Mr Said did not expect this for the EDTs because he knew that DBAG’s systems were not able to value such complex trades and he had no regard for their MTM status in any event, regarding them as buy to hold options.  Mr Said did, of course, as any trader would, retain his own trading records and had his own pricing tool which would operate for vanilla trades.   </p>

Whereas, as a matter of English law, to my mind it would go without saying that a Prime Broker who provides services for reward impliedly undertakes to act with reasonable care and skill in the provision of those services, that does not appear to be the stance adopted by New York law, which does not so readily imply duties of reasonable care into contracts, save those of a specified kind.  As a matter of commercial good sense, regardless of any notions of “fair dealing”, both DBAG and SHI must have entered into the FXPBA with the expectation that trades would not just be accurately cleared and settled, but reported on the website, together with MTM valuations according to DBAG’s systems and margining in accordance with the agreed terms set out in the CSA.  No customer however would expect perfection in the sense of 100% accuracy at all times and it appeared to be common ground between Ms Rahl and Mr Quinn that errors were to be expected.

If, for whatever reason, DBAG could not accurately report such a trade and set out its value on the website and include it in the margin calculations, it had the choice before taking it in of refusing that trade or agreeing special terms in relation to its reporting.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The next alleged implied term is that found in paragraph 38(4B), namely that DBAG would ensure that, before it entered into a direct trade of a “high risk product” with Mr Said for SHI (and in particular any EDT), Mr Vik understood the risk level of the product, alternatively that the bank would take reasonable care to ensure that he understood the risk level of the product.  It is said that such a term is to be implied because it was the usual custom and practice of an investment bank to have a policy providing that it would ensure (before concluding a “high risk” transaction of this kind) that an appropriate individual in the client organisation other than the usual trading contact understood the risk level of the product.  Some explanation would therefore have to be given to the appropriate individual unless the bank was aware, by reference to previous trading or other circumstances, that this individual already understood the risk.   </p>

In the first place, it is hard to see how the internal policies of the bank, designed for its own protection, in order to avoid counterparty risk or loss of reputation, could give rise to an implied term of the kind alleged.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The “usual custom and practice” put forward by SHI, to which it referred in its pleadings and which is required to meet the appropriate standards of consistency and wide knowledge in the trade in order to qualify as a relevant custom and usage, has changed during the course of the action.  The difficulty which SHI has had in defining this custom suggests that it is not “uniform”, “well settled”, “established”, “wellknown” or “notorious”.  In the Amended Defence and Party 20 Counterclaim, when the point was first pleaded, SHI stated that the relevant custom of an investment bank, such as DBAG, was to have a policy providing that in respect of high risk products (in particular EDTs) “an explanation of the risk level of the product would be given to, and authorisation for the trading for such products required from, at least one level of seniority, if not two levels of seniority, of decision-maker in the client, above the usual trading contact”.  At a Case Management Conference, I ordered a sequential exchange of reports in relation to this alleged custom.  Ms Rahl, on behalf of SHI, expressed her opinion that “the custom and practice of a reasonably prudent and competent investment bank” was to have a policy “to require that the bank explained the risks of the instrument to some person at the client who [was] not the immediate trading contact, i.e. a supervisor or a Chief Risk Officer”.  That person had to be independent of the trading contract but not necessarily more senior.  The reason for such a policy was, she said, to seek to prevent clients from unknowingly incurring large risks “and thus exposing the bank itself to financial, legal and reputational risk” inasmuch as informing additional persons within the customer’s organisation would provide a check or balance that was intended to reduce or control the risk of a rogue trader.   </p>

Ms Rahl agreed in the Joint Experts’ Memorandum that the FX Prime Broker did not provide any advisory service to the client, which ruled out any question of advice on market risk, as a matter of custom of the FX PB market.  As Mr Quinn pointed out, customarily, the FX Prime Broker would only know about any transaction after it had been executed by the client and would be bound to accept that transaction if it fell within the ambit of the agreement between them.  Moreover, the alleged custom related to authorisation of “the trading” of “high risk” products and FX Prime Brokers would not be considered to be involved in trading since the whole point of the arrangement was that the Prime Broker’s position was “flat”, with the trading risk being taken by the Counterparty and the client respectively, between whom the deal had been concluded.  It was agreed between the experts that the FXPB desk had minimal interaction with the FX Sales or Trade Desk and charged low level fees for its operationally focused business.  In the Joint Memorandum Ms Rahl, when agreeing that the Prime Broker did not even know what trades the client had entered into before the client informed it, noted that this was not true in the case of direct trades not involving a Counterparty bank or executing broker.  Where, for example, SHI, in the person of Mr Said, concluded an EDT with DBAG’s Trade Desk, through Mr Geisker at the Sales Desk, the position was different to trades with Counterparty banks effected as agent for DBAG through the Prime Brokerage mechanism.  (As appears elsewhere in this judgment, of the forty one EDTs concluded by Mr Said, six were direct trades concluded with DBAG.) </p>

That was the issue which Ms Rahl had been addressing in her first report, without reference to any distinction between direct trades with DBAG and indirect trades with Counterparties.  In her Report in response to that of Mr Quinn, she was less than candid when saying that the custom and practice she had referred to in her original report applied to direct trades only.  In cross-examination she stated that this was obvious and that she had only felt the need to clarify the position in her second report following the experts’ meeting.  I regret to say that I have concluded that Ms Rahl was advancing the case for a custom in her first report, in the context of an implied term in the FXPBA (albeit by reference to the surrounding circumstances which included a PWM relationship with DBS), which she then abandoned when faced with Mr Quinn’s evidence about the nature of </p>

She referred to the OCC and the Federal Reserve’s high level guidelines for FX sales trading in this context.  In consequence, banks adopted standardised customer classification, although this sometimes merely split them into those considered sophisticated or unsophisticated, whilst other banks would have a wider spectrum.  Classifications might indicate the types of product which a client could trade and the need for independent approval for products outside that range but this was once again variable as between banks.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Most importantly however, she drew attention to the standard Master Agreements most commonly used in FX trading, which developed over the years so that, in 2005, terms such as ISDA were in common usage with the express provisions therein of the kind to be found in part 5, paragraph 1 of the FX ISDA in the present case.  In such provisions, the client acknowledges that it has made its own independent decisions as to whether the transaction was appropriate or proper for it based upon its own judgment and is not relying upon any communication given by the other party to the transaction as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into it.  It acknowledges its capability of assessing the merits of and understanding the terms, conditions and risks of the transaction and acknowledges that it does assume risks.  The other party is acknowledged as not acting as a fiduciary for or adviser to it in respect of the transaction.  (In the present case there are various other provisions in part 5 paragraph 1(b) in which SHI acknowledged that the transactions to which the ISDA refers may at times be volatile and subject to complex and substantial risks that can arise without warning with losses occurring quickly and in unanticipated magnitude.  The terms of part 5 paragraph 1 are set out in full in Annex 1 to this judgment).  Ms Mandell continued by saying that sales people for sophisticated clients with IFXCO/ISDA type agreements would not customarily question the motivation for trading a particular instrument, especially if the request came from the client (reverse-enquiry) or if it was known to the bank that the client had traded the instrument before (thereby implying that the client was capable of booking and managing the risk).   </p>

She stated that ensuring that an appropriate individual in the client’s organisation, other than the usual trading contact, understood the risk level of a product prior to trading, was not in her experience a standard requirement of the sales process.  It could conceivably be a specification attached to the authorisation to trade but it would not be customary to require the sales force to do this for every high risk transaction.  In entering into a transaction, an FX Sales/Trade Desk would pay regard to internal guidelines and to the agreed documentation with the client.  The </p>

Consequently, in her view, there was no customary policy that the bank would ensure that a person other than the trading contact of the client understood the risk level of a high risk product (however that was defined) and would explain the risk level to such a person.  Nor was there any general or regulatory requirement to do so.  Whether it actually took such steps in any particular situation would depend upon all the circumstances, including the nature of the client, its trading history, whether there was any evidence that the trader was engaged in improper practice and the terms of the client documentation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">By contrast, the evidence of Ms Mandell, set out in her report and maintained under cross-examination, was entirely convincing.  From the perspective of a Sales Desk of a bank, it is irrelevant whether or not the other party has an FXPBA with the same bank.  There are sales standards which apply to FX sales persons as to other sales persons in a bank and banks are subject to Federal regulation in the US.  The FX market however is self-regulated.  She accepted that regulations were principles based but those that existed were all about the risk that the bank assumed, namely the risk of counterparty default and it was in that context that a bank might wish to ascertain the effectiveness of a counterparty’s risk management systems and capabilities in order to preserve the institution’s reputation in the market place by avoiding situations that created unjustified expectations.  Steps taken to ensure that counterparties understood the nature and risks inherent in transactions were taken for the bank’s own protection.  Some higher risk transactions would be referred to the senior management of the client or the senior sales person at the bank with this in mind.  This was particularly the case where the client was unsophisticated.  A bank should assess the client’s ability to understand the risk in the relevant product and would want to have a procedure whereby it was confident that the client management understood the nature of the transaction, but often it would be the manager or a senior person who would be executing that transaction and a bank would not go to another individual to inform them of it.  There was moreover a higher degree of confidence that the client was prepared to undertake complex higher risk transactions if it had done such trades before, passed them through its systems and confirmed and settled them.  It was not therefore standard practice on the sales desk or a standard practice of the sales process to present an outline of the risks associated with complex derivatives to someone </p>

The allegation is of a custom and practice about bank policies.  It does not follow that, even if banks did have such internal policies, the terms of those policies would be customary terms of contracts with those dealing with the institution.  To my mind the notion is inimical to the internal nature of such policies designed for the bank’s own protection and I can see no basis for importing a term into the FXPB or the FX ISDA to the effect alleged.   </p>

The FXPBA makes no distinction between “high risk” trades and other trades.  The opening paragraph of the FXPBA lists the type of trades which DBAG authorises SHI to transact as its agent.  Structured Options, as defined, are more complex transactions and require DBAG’s approval prior to execution by DBAG but, as with the vanilla trades, the initiative for concluding the transactions rests with SHI which deals with Counterparties before approaching DBAG.

SHI was, by the terms of this Letter, expressly clothing Mr Said with authority to act on its behalf as its trader and agreeing to be bound by transactions executed by him “to the same extent as if we were directly executing such FX or options transactions”.  SHI thus equated Mr Said with itself, held him out to be the manager of the business referred to and absolved DBAG from any duty to enquire further about SHI’s interrelationship with him.  The requirement to ensure that someone other than Mr Said within SHI, whether Mr Vik, a contact other than the trader or another senior figure, understood the risk level of a product would necessarily involve an inquiry as to the understanding of persons other than Mr Said, an enquiry into the nature of his relationship with SHI as a “manager” or “senior person” and an enquiry which questioned his authority to execute transactions on SHI’s behalf.   </p>

However the claim is put, it is nonetheless completely inconsistent with the terms of the FX ISDA and its Schedule, as set out in Annex 1 and referred to above, which applied to every transaction concluded under the FXPBA and to the direct transactions with DBAG as much as the indirect trades.  The acknowledgement that SHI had made its own independent decisions as to the appropriateness and propriety of the transaction and was not relying upon any advice or views of DBAG in relation thereto and had determined that the transaction in question was suitable for SHI in the light of its investment objectives, financial situation and level of investment sophistication, when combined with the acknowledgement that transactions may be volatile, subject to complex and substantial risks with losses which occur quickly and in unanticipated magnitude, render the implication of a term of this kind impossible.

There was no such expectation or understanding on the part of any of the individuals involved, whether at the FXPB Desk, the Sales/Trade Desk or on the part of Mr Said or Mr Vik.  As appears elsewhere in this judgment, Mr Vik knew that Mr Said was entering into complex risks, the nature of which was explained to him by Mr Said, but never looked to FXPB or the Trade/Sales Desk for an explanation of the risks involved.  Nor was it ever suggested that any such approach on their part was required.  Mr Geisker’s evidence was that, in his seventeen years as a salesman, he had never called anyone else other than the trading contact he had in relation to any trade being discussed.  He knew of no market practice whereby investment banks, before selling leveraged products such as the EDTs to a client, ensured that an appropriate person at the client, other than the trader, understood the risks involved.  He said that it never occurred to him to contact Mr Vik and there was never any discussion of the need for that at the bank.  Not only did his evidence support the absence of any custom of the kind alleged but his evidence showed that the course of performance and the parties’ practical construction of the agreements, in so far as anybody had reference to them, was inconsistent with any such customary terms.  The salesmen would assume that a Counterparty employing a trader was receiving reports from the trader and it would be difficult and embarrassing to approach anyone else over the trader’s head and would undermine the relationship between them.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that the draft internal Audit Report referred specifically to the absence of any NPA process by FXPB in respect of the EDTs (there referred to as TPFs).  There is no dispute that carrying out an NPA process was standard practice in the banking world.  It was also common ground between the experts that NPA processes were internal matters, conducted by banks as part of their internal risk management and that the processes instituted and adopted by such banks were confidential to them.  The processes varied from bank to bank and there was no identifiable set of standards, according to Mr Quinn, which would have been customarily applied, nor an identifiable set of steps which would be taken by a reasonably prudent and competent investment bank engaged in operating an FXPB arrangement.  Whilst therefore a customer might be aware that banks habitually carried out NPA processes, the customer could not know what those processes involved nor how effective they were in ensuring that the bank in question had minimised the risks to it from trading in such products.   </p>

It simply does not follow from the fact that a bank has an internal practice of reviewing a product, before being prepared to trade in it, that a term is to be implied into a contract with a third party that it will not permit itself to enter into a trade with that third party unless and until that process, however effective or ineffective it is, has been carried out.  Once again, the test enunciated by the New York law experts is not met, namely that, for a term to be annexed to a contract as a matter of trade usage, it must be shown that the parties to the contract are aware of the usage or that the existence of the usage in the business to which the transaction relates is so notorious that they should have been aware of it.  The custom and usage must be such that the parties are taken to have contracted by reference to it.   </p>

This, once again, is directly inconsistent with the terms of the FXPBA and the Said Letter of Authority.  Both of those instruments contain their own definitions of the types of trades which Mr Said was authorised to conclude for DBAG on the Counterparty Transaction and/or SHI on the Agent Transaction.  If a trade fell within the ambit of the FXPB and the Said Letter of Authority, DBAG was not entitled to refuse to accept such a trade.  The fact that DBAG might not have gone through its own internal NPA process is an irrelevance in that regard.  It had agreed to accept the transactions set out.  The fact that there was a special category of Structured Options which had to be approved by DBAG before becoming an “Accepted Transaction” does not affect the overall position in relation to the alleged implied term.  The implied term, as formulated, would require DBAG to refuse to trade a product which otherwise fell within the scope of what it had specifically agreed to authorise Mr Said to conclude on its behalf </p>

This is illustrated by Ms Rahl’s own evidence.  In her first report she was insistent that the Prime Brokerage desk should conduct an NPA process before handling the new product, regardless of the position of the Trade Desk.  In her second report she said that the application of the NPA process to a Prime Brokerage desk could be different from that applied to the Trade Desk but that the Prime Brokerage desk might be able to rely on an NPA process conducted elsewhere in the bank.  In the Joint Memorandum with Mr Quinn she agreed that NPA was primarily done for the bank’s protection but stated that it was a standard procedure and clients could reasonably expect that all products entered into by a bank would be subject to an NPA “or some other approval process” that ensured that their operations and systems could handle the products.  This point was repeated in her third report where she again referred to “some other similar process” to ensure that an FXPB group could properly handle the trade “without making sustained errors in valuation, margining and reporting” and in cross-examination, having stated that approval at the FX level could not possibly cover FXPB, she accepted that a shorter process, such as a “sign-off by systems and operations and credit” could suffice.  Whilst she was insistent that it was standard practice to seek to achieve what was set out in Best Practice Number 51 issued by the New York Federal Reserve in its publication, Management of Operational Risk in Foreign Exchange, she recognised that there were no regulatory requirements for NPA and only guidelines, none of which referred to NPA processes being conducted for the client’s benefit and none of which set out the details of the process to be followed.  External regulatory examiners would audit banks for compliance with their own procedures, but no more than that. </p>

SHI maintains that this Approval was insufficient for the EDTs and the reference to the technical security type “KOMultiDualCCY” did not incorporate the EDTs, although Mr Chin’s evidence was that EDTs were treated by DBAG as falling within this category.

The balance of the paragraph which follows on merely states that, whenever he wanted to trade something he had not traded before, there was a ritual of process and procedure which had to be gone through which involved form filling, legal documentation and significant delay.  He did not attribute this however to any NPA process.  Given my other findings about the unreliability of Mr Vik’s evidence, I am not inclined to accept this evidence from him either, being contained in one sentence alone without anything to support it.  There was no evidence from Mr Said that he had any such expectation at all.  The evidence of DBAG’s witnesses in relation to NPA was all given in the context of procedures designed for DBAG’s own protection.  Mr Quinn’s evidence was that NPA processes were for the bank’s benefit without any client involvement.  NPA process was a standard practice but a matter of internal risk management to ensure that banks had proper controls, operation, technology and finance.  Moreover, FXPB, which was not involved in the trading of new products, maintained a flat position on business it was bound to take in under the Prime Brokerage documents agreed and would not necessarily know that a product had or had not been approved on a firm-wide basis when taking in a trade.  He said that, particularly in the years 2006-2008, Prime Brokers were often presented with new products that a client was trading in an evolving market.  If the trade fell within the contractual documents, the broker was bound to take it in and fulfil its role as Prime Broker.   </p>

The NPA process was intended to assess whether the relevant departments within the bank had the necessary knowledge and expertise to book and account for the product, whether it had the knowledge and expertise properly to risk manage the product and whether transacting in the product would expose it to unnecessary reputational risk.  She agreed in cross-examination that the NPA process was an internal process and that different banks would have different processes though the intent and the major components, she said, would be the same.  She agreed that banks conducted NPA processes for their own risk management purposes but maintained that it was also “a regulatory imperative”.  She appeared to accept that the regulatory guidance referred to in her report focused on what banks did for their own protection without any suggestion that it was being done for the benefit of the client.  She said that it was “not done for the clients per se, but it is done to ensure that the product can be properly processed and handled and by definition therefore it tells a client that a bank is not going to enter into an activity that it is ill-prepared to handle properly.”  Given however the absence of any knowledge on the part of the customer as to how any NPA process would be conducted and how effective it would be, it could not tell the client anything of the kind.   </p>

The evidence does not establish that an obligation to refuse trades which had not been through a Prime Broker’s appropriate NPA process was a customary obligation in the trade to be incorporated into the contract because the parties must be supposed to have made their contract by reference to it.  It is inconsistent with the internal, confidential and proprietary nature of an NPA process, inconsistent with the terms of the FXPBA (and the Said Letter of Authority) and with the terms of the FX ISDA and Schedule (as set out in Annex 1) inasmuch as SHI thereby acknowledges that it assumes the risks of the transactions, relies on its own judgment in entering into such transactions and reaches its own decisions as to the suitability of them whilst acknowledging that DBAG is neither a fiduciary nor an adviser on whose advice or communications it relies.   </p>

The implied term alleged is that DBAG would not enter into any transactions with SHI or accept any transactions under the FXPBA (alternatively any Structured Options) which the FXPB desk was unable to book, value, record, margin and report accordingly.  The alternative formulation is that the bank would take reasonable care to prevent such transactions being concluded.  Once again I have to apply the test for implication of terms as set out by the New York professors of law engaged by the parties.  The oddity about this implied term is that, once again, it imposes an obligation upon DBAG to prevent SHI from conducting transactions which otherwise fall within the authority given to SHI under the FXPBA and to Mr Said under the Said Letter of Authority.  This is not, by any means, the opposite side of the coin from the implied term alleged under paragraph 38(2) of the RRRADC which relates to DBAG’s obligations in relation to trades concluded by Mr Said that fall within the ambit of the authority given to him.  The great advantage of the implied term alleged in paragraph 38(4D), from SHI’s perspective, is that it would cast responsibility on DBAG for the transactions which have led to the major losses (the EDTs), all of which resulted from Mr Said’s trading decisions.   </p>

If a trade fell within the ambit of the FXPBA (and the Said Letter of Authority) it was a transaction which DBAG had authorised SHI to conclude as its agent (and which SHI had authorised Mr Said to conclude as its agent).  DBAG would therefore be obliged to accept such trades as binding upon it in relation to the Counterparty and to conclude an offsetting transaction with SHI on the same terms under Clause 4.  For ordinary transactions, other than Structured Options, DBAG had no power to accept or reject and was bound to process them under the FXPBA, if they were within its terms.  DBAG was simply not in a position to refuse a transaction which was authorised under the FXPBA and would be in breach if it did so.  It was bound to process the authorised trade which Mr Said had concluded, in its name, with the Counterparty and it was bound then to enter into the corresponding transaction with SHI.  There simply is no room for the implication of a term to the contrary effect not only allowing but obliging DBAG to refuse transactions on the basis of its inability to book, value, record and margin properly or to report accordingly.  It matters not whether this is expressed as an absolute duty or as a duty to take reasonable care to prevent such transactions taking place.

Direct trades were, in fact, treated by the FXPB desk in exactly the same way as indirect trades, from an operational point of view, although the legal position was, self-evidently, different.  DBAG, as one and the same entity, could only have one contract with SHI and there could be no separate Counterparty Transaction and Agent Transaction, since the DBAG FXPB desk could not contract with the DBAG Trade Desk, as a matter of law.

The Trade Desk was in fact capable of booking and valuing the EDTs by using DB Analytics and margining could be done but not on the VaR basis by the ARCS VaR model, as the FXPBA and the CSA required.  DBAG is thus said to be in breach of the implied term in so far as the Trade Desk concluded direct trades with SHI which the FXPB desk could not properly process.  It is not suggested that the direct trades are governed by anything other than the FXPBA and thus it is an implied term which is alleged into the FXPBA in relation to what the FXPB desk could or could not do.  If a trade had been treated as outside the FXPBA and CSA, then the Trade Desk would have instituted separate processes for trade confirmation, valuation and margining on a different basis, such as trade level margining. </p>

If DBAG did owe a duty to book, value, margin and report on the trades concluded by SHI under the FXPBA, it would be in breach of contract if it failed to do that.  How then would the New York law test for implication of terms apply?  There could be no basis for the implication of a term that DBAG would prevent SHI from concluding Counterparty Transactions and Agent Transactions or direct trades where DBAG’s failures would mean that it was in breach of contract.  If no such obligations were assumed, there would be no basis for implying a term that DBAG would prevent SHI from using the authority given by the FXPBA to conclude trades in circumstances in which DBAG could not carry out various functions that it was not obliged to carry out anyway.  In circumstances where I have held that there was an implied term requiring DBAG to report trades and their valuation and the margin requirements of the portfolio as a whole on the website, DBAG would be in breach if it failed to do so though its liability might be restricted by reference to the GEM website terms and conditions.

The same logic applies as for trades which are not Structured Options.  If DBAG owed an implied obligation to book, value, record and margin Structured Options or the more limited obligation that I have held to exist, namely to report on such Structured Options, DBAG would be liable for failing to do so if it has approved such transactions so that they became Accepted Transactions.  If it owed no such duties, there would be no basis for saying that it was obliged to tell SHI that it could not do what it was not obliged to do.  Either way, there is no basis for thinking that a reasonable person in the position of a party to the FXPBA would be justified in understanding that such a term was included or that such a term was implicit in the Agreement viewed as a whole.   </p>

DBAG would not be responsible for any Counterparty Transaction executed by SHI on its behalf unless such approval was obtained and was effective at the time of execution of the trade.  In the absence of DBAG’s consent, it would not be bound by Mr Said’s conclusion of the trade with a Counterparty and would not be obliged to enter into any offsetting transaction with SHI.  The requirement of consent was therefore a pre-condition to DBAG’s liability for such transactions and obligations in respect of them (and DBAG could impose additional conditions for its consent).  The Clause does not involve an obligation to refuse consent in circumstances where DBAG was unable to comply with any enforceable obligations which would arise if it gave its approval.  Once again there can be no basis for implying an anterior duty which has the effect of restricting DBAG’s ability to give consent, whether or not the giving of consent for transactions it cannot properly handle gives rise to future breaches of contract.   </p>

As a matter of prudent and internal risk management, any employee would rightly think that a bank should not take on trades that it could not properly process in its systems.  That however is very different from a contractual obligation, about which they were not being directly questioned and on which they were not qualified to give an answer.  A bank which takes in trades that it cannot properly process may be liable for any loss caused by such failure but there is no basis for the implication of an independent obligation not to accept such trades and it is in fact a powerful factor against the suggestion that such a term should be included and was implicit in the agreement taken as a whole.   </p>

They disagreed however as to whether the implied covenant created additional freestanding duties in the sense of substantive obligations which were independent of the other obligations imposed on the parties by the contract, whether express or implied.  Both agreed that the implied covenant could not give rise to duties which conflicted with the express terms of the contract and I have found that the difference between the professors was not as wide as might at first sight be supposed. I have also set out my conclusions on the point.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Cohen stated that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as part of the contract, does not create a cause of action that is separate from an action for breach of contract.  He opined that, as noted by many New York courts, “The duty of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in the performance of contractual obligations to the extent that a separately stated cause of action asserting breach of that duty is routinely dismissed as redundant.”  In the present case, that is exactly what has happened in the New York action.  The seventh cause of action alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was dismissed by Justice Kapnick on 9th November 2012 as duplicative of SHI’s more specific breach of contract claims on the basis that they arose from the same facts.  The other wrongdoings alleged deprived SHI of the intended benefits for which it bargained, including the rights provided by the terms of the FXPBA and FX ISDA.  The alleged breach of the implied covenant therefore had no independent substance and added nothing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As can be seen from the earlier section of this judgment dealing with the construction of the FX ISDA there are three provisions relating to collateral which could result in the termination of the FX ISDA.  The first was section 5(a)(iii) of the FX ISDA itself which provided that a failure by SHI to comply with its obligations under the CSA, continuing after any applicable grace period had elapsed, amounted to an event of default in respect of which, if continuing, DBAG was entitled to serve a twenty day notice specifying the default and designating an Early Termination Date.  The second provision was found in Part 1(i)(iii) of the Part 1 of the Schedule where DBAG could, if for any reason it deemed there were insufficient Eligible Assets held under the Pledge Agreement, give notice obliging SHI to deliver additional collateral, either into the Pledged Account or in some other form satisfactory to DBAG.  A failure on SHI’s part to comply would amount to an Additional Termination Event.  Thirdly, under paragraph 11(h)(v) of the CSA, DBAG had a right of immediate termination if the value of the collateral in place fell below 100% of VaR.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">These provisions, when seen in the light of the other terms to which I have made reference, are inconsistent with a further implied term alleged by SHI.  SHI submits that DBAG had an obligation to calculate the Allocated Portion every day and an obligation to ensure that it contained sufficient collateral to support SHI’s FX trading on the basis of 200% of five day VaR.  SHI submits that once there was insufficient collateral in the Pledged Account for the Allocated Portion to support the FX trading on a fully collateralised basis, there was no scope for the parties to enter into any further FX trades without a request for additional collateral being made and fulfilled.  If a request was made and SHI did not provide the additional collateral, DBAG could close down SHI’s FX trading.  In such circumstances of termination, on SHI’s construction, DBAG would retain the Allocated Portion in its entirety because ownership in that had been transferred to it.  The effect of this, if DBAG had been performing its calculations correctly, would be that most or all of the losses would be covered even if market movements were sudden, since the margin calculated was intended to cover this very situation and, as soon as the limits were exceeded, the request would be made and met within a day during which time prices would not be expected to fall substantially.  SHI further submitted that it had no liability for any outstanding transactions above and beyond the collateral provided.  It submitted that “[g]iven the structure of the FX CSA that was set up, where the Bank has no entitlement to demand additional collateral (only the ability to close down SHI's FX trading where a request for additional collateral was refused or where the collateral fell below 100% of the VaR level), and where the Bank retained the Allocated Portion, notwithstanding that it might (and indeed was very likely to) overcompensate the Bank on any loss-making transactions, it must follow that SHI was not to have any outstanding liability for transactions".  DBAG’s only recourse was therefore to the Allocated Portion and there would be little sense in the agreed limitation on DBAG’s ability to seek further collateral if SHI had remained liable for the underlying transactions.  Accordingly it is said that there was an implied term of the FX ISDA that SHI’s liability on its FX transactions was limited to the Allocated Portion, working on the assumption that DBAG had complied with its obligations with regard to the calculation of margin.   </p>

Furthermore the express terms of the termination provisions gainsay any implied term just as much as they gainsay any construction of the FX ISDA which has the effect of limiting SHI’s liability to US$35 million.  DBAG is given a right of termination in the event that SHI fails to put up additional collateral but this in no way touches upon SHI’s obligation to do so under Clause 2 of the CSA.  There would be no purpose served in allowing for time to comply with an obligation before the termination provisions kicked in, if there was no obligation to produce margin over and above the US$35 million.  The alleged implied term is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract.   </p>

The implied term that I have found is a straightforward obligation to report on the web, subject to the GEM terms and conditions, whereas the duty alleged here is one of reasonable care.

As recorded in the Joint Memorandum of Agreement and Disagreement, it was agreed that, under New York law, there is a duty of care in law to avoid causing physical bodily injury and property damage, but that such a general duty of care does not apply to cases involving pure economic harm.  There are exceptions to this principle but the experts were not at one in relation to tort claims “at the borderland” between tort and contract, although both agreed that there were two New York Court of Appeals decisions which provided a framework for deciding when New York law would recognise a tort claim for economic harm in circumstances in which the parties are in a contractual relationship.  Those two decisions are <span style="font-style:italic">Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Island R.R.

There was disagreement as to the effect of three further decisions of the New York Court of Appeals to which I shall refer later, but there was recognition between them that “professionals” have been found to hold such an independent legal duty and that lawyers and accountants qualified as professionals for this purpose.   </p>

As Professor Sharkey put it: “the New York courts … are extremely wary about imposing extra-contractual duties in contexts where sophisticated parties have set forth their contractual arrangements”.  Cases where there was no contract between the parties are of limited assistance when considering the imposition of a duty and Professor Zipursky’s views were largely founded on “near privity” cases where there was a special relationship akin to contract without any applicable terms and conditions governing the parties’ rights and duties.   </p>

Furthermore, the damages allegedly sustained as a result of the breach of the duty of due care were clearly within the contemplation of the written agreement as indicated by the design change and adjusted compensation provisions in it.

As Professor Sharkey testified, the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer </span>is critical in dealing with what was described as “the borderland between tort and contract” and as setting several guide posts for separating tort from contract claims.  It was maintained by the defendant that the plaintiff was restricted to claims under the contract.  The court referred to the basis of the claims in tort and to the duties imposed by law as a matter of social policy.  By contrast, contract duties arise from the parties’ consensual undertaking.  The borderland situations most commonly arise when the parties’ relationship initially is formed by contract but a claim is then made that the contract was performed negligently.  That was the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer</span>.  There was no duty owed prior to the contract being made but, once made, the defendant had obligations which included a duty to make timely reports to the fire department.  The effect of such a claim being put in tort or in contract could be significant in the context of statutes of limitation, proof and measure of damages and the availability of exemption clauses or contribution rights.

In the light of the guidelines the court highlighted the nature of the services to be performed in the light of the scheme of fire safety regulations which applied to buildings in New York.  Fire alarm companies were said to perform a service affected with a significant public interest where failure to perform that service carefully and competently could have catastrophic consequences.  The conclusion that a tortious claim was available therefore rested on the special relationship of the parties in the context of the services to be rendered and the public interest policy which required a duty of reasonable care to be imposed that was independent of the defendant’s contractual obligations.  The conclusion was also held to rest upon the manner in which the injury arose and the resulting harm, both of which were said to be typical of tort claims, in contrast to the delamination of tiles in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bellevue </span>case and the damages claim in <span style="font-style:italic">Clark-Fitzpatrick</span>, which amounted to no more than the benefit of the contractual bargain.

As compared to the fire-safety regulations cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer</span>, the<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>provisions of the Insurance Law are properly viewed as measures regulating the insurer’s performance of its contractual obligations, as an adjunct to the contract, not as a legislative imposition of a separate duty of reasonable care …”.

There is a degree of uncertainty about the exact identity and nature of the contract which existed in that case between the claimant note holders and the defendant which was the Indenture Trustee, whose position was regulated by the Federal Indenture Trustee Act.  Claims were made in contract for breach of the Indentures and the Additional Secured Indebtedness Registration Statements [“ASIRS”], for breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence in failing to deliver the Registration Statement to the Collateral Trustee of earlier loan instruments.  There is considerable discussion about the position of an Indenture Trustee and reference to a number of authorities where it was held that “prior to default, Indenture Trustees owe note holders an extra-contractual duty to perform basic, nondiscretionary ministerial functions redressable in tort if such duty is breached”.  The claims for fiduciary duty were dismissed but it was held that the duty to perform basic non-discretionary ministerial functions did give rise to a tortious duty to act with due care.  The contract claims could not run because of the terms of a release that had been agreed but the court decided that there were issues of fact which had to be resolved in relation to the tortious duty established by prior authorities.  It was said that there were “issues of fact as to whether State Street, separate and apart from its contractual duty under the ASIRS, undertook and breached a duty of care, ‘connected with and dependent upon the [ASIRS]’, to act in accordance with the ASIRS and the CTA registration requirements to protect plaintiffs’ security rights in the CTA collateral and whether plaintiffs sustained significant losses as a result of this alleged breach.” </p>

There, the claimant was not a party to a contract but was able, by virtue of the decision of the court, to bring a third party beneficiary claim.  The question then arose as to whether or not a tortious duty could arise in the context of an allegation of gross negligence in the management of a portfolio on behalf of the investors.  The court referred to the need for a legal duty independent of the contract to be violated for a tort claim to arise, citing <span style="font-style:italic">Clark-Fitzpatrick </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">New York University</span>.  It was held that the claimant could be taken to have alleged material representations which had induced Bayerische to purchase the notes, including a representation of future contractual performance with care and skill.  It was held that the claimant had sufficiently established, in order to withstand a motion to dismiss, a legal duty independent of contractual obligations imposed by law as an incident to the parties’ relationship, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer</span>.  Although the duty was assessed largely on the standard of care and other obligations set forth in the contract (to which the claimant was not a party), that duty arose out of the independent characteristics of the relationship between Bayerische and Aladdin in circumstances where the claimant purchased notes linked to the Portfolio that Aladdin was to manage under the contract itself.  The duty was connected with and dependent upon the contract but sufficiently sprang from circumstances extraneous to and not constituting elements of it, within the meaning of the expressions used in <span style="font-style:italic">Clark-Fitzpatrick</span>. </p>

The loss was purely economic which was at odds with the “long standing New York rule that economic loss is not recoverable under a theory of negligence”.

It was then pointed out that the New York Court of Appeals had never found financial institutions such as investment banks to be professionals for these purposes but that, on the contrary, courts had found in actions involving the contractual duties of corporations and financial institutions, that an action in negligence would not lie and that only contractual remedies applied.  The court found that the parties in the action in question were “sophisticated entities that entered into a time limited financial contract” and that no significant public interest was linked to the provision of investment banking services that would weigh in favour of imposing a tort liability for public reasons.

There it was said that a duty of reasonable care would apply to the broker’s performance of obligations to customers with non-discretionary accounts only in relation to the individual transactions undertaken.  The claim advanced however presupposed an ongoing duty of reasonable care, giving rise to obligations between transactions.  It was held that in establishing a non-discretionary account, the parties ordinarily agreed that the broker had narrowly defined duties that began and ended with each transaction.  The court said it was unaware of any authority for the view that in the ordinary case a broker could be held to have an open-ended duty of reasonable care to a non-discretionary client that would encompass anything more than limited transaction by transaction duties.  In the ordinary non-discretionary account the broker’s failure to offer information and advice between transactions could not constitute negligence.   </p>

Recovery of economic loss lay in the nature of breach of contract, as opposed to tort, but the unavailability of a contract remedy does not trigger an exception to the rule and the doctrine may apply where there is no contract at all between the parties.  The presence of a contract or a financial transaction that is in the nature of the contract can however be a strong indicator that a plaintiff was not owed a legal duty that was separate and apart from the obligations for which he bargained and obtained in the transaction.

The nature of Prime Broker relationships is set out earlier in this judgment.  The nature of the services provided and the way in which loss was caused have nothing to do with physical harm nor with the kind of issues to which tort law is directed and no issues of public policy arise in that context, requiring an extra-contractual duty to be imposed.  The complaint is made about the performance of alleged duties under the FXPBA and resultant economic loss – the loss incurred as a result of an alleged breach of the bargain made between the parties.

There were a series of contracts between DBAG and SHI concluded in November 2006 which governed their inter- relationship with the detailed terms of Part 5 of the ISDA schedule, as set out in Annex 1, showing the absence of any reliance by SHI on DBAG as an adviser or fiduciary in respect of any transaction concluded by Mr Said.  Economic losses suffered by SHI are either recoverable under such contracts or are irrecoverable, as a matter of the Law of New York. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">On 8th November 2012 Justice Kapnick dismissed SHI’s eighth cause of action for negligence, referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Clark-Fitzpatrick </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the guidelines set out in the latter and referring also to the <span style="font-style:italic">Bayerische </span>decision.  The judge referred to the facts pleaded by SHI and its contention that it had detailed the wrongdoings of DBAG as Prime Brokers and private bankers which were independent from any explicit contractual obligation.  It contended that the position of a Prime Broker was akin to that of professionals, common carriers and bailees and that the result of DBAG’s alleged wrongdoing was catastrophic losses in an “abrupt, cataclysmic occurrence” represented by the global financial meltdown in September/October 2008.  Thus DBAG’s position was said to be like that of the fire alarm monitoring company in <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer </span>in failing to perform the risk management duties it had undertaken.  The judge rejected these arguments and accepted DBAG’s submissions based on <span style="font-style:italic">Sommer</span>, where the court’s conclusion rested in part on the nature of the injury, the manner in which the injury arose and the resulting harm which were typical of tort claims such as personal injury and property damage.  She said that SHI was essentially seeking to recover economic losses sustained under the contract where a plaintiff sought enforcement of the bargain or merely alleged that the breach of contract arose from a lack of due care and no claim lay in tort, notwithstanding the use of familiar tort language in the pleadings.  Moreover, she accepted DBAG’s contentions that SHI was attempting to circumvent the court’s earlier ruling dismissing its breach of fiduciary duty claims, which had already been affirmed by the Appellate Division by that time.  An allegation of reliance upon DBAG’s superior knowledge and expertise in connection with its FX trading account ignored the reality that the parties had engaged in arm’s length transactions pursuant to contracts between sophisticated business entities that did not give rise to fiduciary duties.  Repeating those claims with a negligence label did not alter the fact that the only duties between them were based in contract.   </p>

The best evidence of New York law must be the decisions of the courts there.  The pleadings in each action may not be identical but the relationship between SHI and DBAG, the contracts between them and the alleged type of duties owed are the same so that, even though there is no issue estoppel, the decisions of the New York court carry huge weight.  They proceeded on the basis of SHI’s allegations, which doubtless put forward its best case.  I have proceeded on the basis of the facts established by evidence and have come to the conclusion that the criteria for establishing any exception to the economic loss rule and/or an independent tortious duty outside the contracts have not been met.  None of the tortious duties alleged can therefore stand.   </p>

In a terse paragraph, the court upheld Justice Kapnick’s dismissal of SHI’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentation, stating that the reality was that the parties engaged in arm’s-length transactions pursuant to a contract between sophisticated business entities that did not give rise to fiduciary duties.

Although originally it was alleged that the agreements between SHI and DBAG were made between Mr Vik on the one hand and Mr Meidal and Mr Brügelmann on the other, or, in other formulations, Mr Meidal and/or Mr Brügelmann, Mr Vik’s evidence, in his statements, was to the effect that they were made with Mr Meidal alone.  That change in SHI’s case, in DBAG’s submission, calls for comment.  SHI asked the court to draw inferences from the fact that DBAG did not call its ex-employee, Mr Meidal, to give evidence.  Mr Said has, likewise, not been called by either party although SHI maintains that it reached agreement with Mr Said on the self-same matters as it later agreed with DBAG.  Of course it is possible for the Court to draw inferences of one kind or another from the presence or absence of witnesses but at the end of the day it is the evidence which is presented to the Court upon which it must primarily base its decision.

We had talked about that briefly before I started and as I look at the markets I think it makes a lot of sense.  There will be opportunities that are of the kind you like – pretty long term and with genuine home run potential and I will continue to spend a lot time finding and analysing them.  But – there is good money in exploiting smaller and somewhat more medium term (a few months, 35%) type opportunities.  But – to get to those you have to be nimble, quick and a little flexible.  Also – they do not not often make it onto your radar screen if you are busy with other things. </p>

You do not need to move assets around for we can determine an amount that stays invested as it is, but is earmarked as collateral for “my” account (it cannot be pledged for anything else).  Let me suggest that you allocate between 25 and 50mm$ of assets for this – big enough to make a difference to your bottom line over time if I am successful, but small enough not to go overboard – I want to grow into this.  I would envisage keeping you closely in the loop on what I do and of course results (daily, weekly, as you wish) and of building a somewhat more diversified portfolio than the core bets we might put on for you at times, which by nature will be very concentrated.  … Can we discuss this please?” </p>

As appears subsequently in this judgment, the basis of the Prime Brokerage arrangement for Mr Said emerged over a period of time following this email even though Mr Said had, between 18th and 20th October, discussed a sample portfolio with DBAG in New York which had given rise to a 200% VaR figure of US$28 million and an NOP figure of US$50 million.  It can be seen that the 30th October email has these figures in mind but it was not until some time in late November that agreement was reached with DBAG on the amount of collateral to be posted and, since the account was to be Mr Vik’s account at all times prior to 30th October, there could be no suggestion of any agreed limitation as to the type of trades.  The only one of the four critical elements to which Mr Vik’s evidence referred which could possibly have been agreed by 20th September was Mr Said’s remuneration, fixed at 10% of net profits with the sum of US$30,000 to be paid monthly on account.   </p>

It was the practice of DBS employees to make visit reports for the file and, as Mr Vik recognised, it was the bank’s practice to put in writing any agreement reached.  Equally, there are no emails between the parties that make reference to any visit or to any agreement of the kind alleged by SHI and emails exist in relation to all other known meetings.  If agreements of the kind alleged had been reached, I do not see how they could have been left without a formal signed agreement recording them or at the very least some exchanges between the parties which set them out or referred to them in one way or another.

SHI complains about the absence of any notes of Mr Meidal, as well as his absence from the witness box.  SHI, whose disclosure in some respects was, to my mind, lamentable, suggested that DBAG had failed to disclose documents in DBS’ possession showing Mr Meidal’s schedules for the relevant time.  Mr Vik maintained that, despite having three personal assistants who organised his timetable, he had no diaries or schedules which would record where he was at any time.  That I cannot accept.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Vik and Mr Said, it appears, must coincide with that made between Mr Vik and Mr Meidal because, at least on one formulation, it relates to Mr Said’s authority to transact business for SHI.  If there was to be any agreement of this kind with DBAG relating to the operation of the FXPBA and the FX ISDA and the trading under it, the personnel to agree to it would be expected to be found in FXPB and not in DBS.  It was the personnel in New York and New Jersey who handled the FXPB account and would therefore be in a position to monitor it.  It was these persons with whom Mr Said was in regular contact during the operation of the FXPBA and with whom he was in contact in relation to its terms and operation beforehand.  DBS was always once removed from its operation.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">There are a number of different formulations of the agreement with Mr Meidal.  One formulation is an agreement that SHI’s liability for any losses incurred in respect of Mr Said’s FX trading was limited to US$35 million and DBAG would have no recourse to SHI in excess of that.  A second formulation is that Mr Said’s authority was limited to trades which required SHI to pay or would require SHI to pay no more than US$35 million in losses and/or which required SHI to pay no more than US$35 million by way of margin.  The formulations thus put forward a limitation on liability on the one hand and a limitation on trading on the other.  The trading limit was subsequently reformulated as a limit on Mr Said’s ability to enter into and remain in trades which had that effect.  This involved the idea that Mr Said could commit SHI and DBAG to a Counterparty Transaction and Agent Transaction with authority but that at some point, if the margin limits were exceeded, whether by reason of movements in the market in the value of trades or otherwise, there would no longer be authority to remain in them.  Finally, as put forward at trial, this later restriction was effectively excised on the authority case, so that a trade was authorised if, at the time it was concluded, it would not have the proscribed effect, even if subsequently it combined with other trades in the portfolio to have that impact.  The US$35m limit then ceased to be such a hard and fast bright line.  The notion of a trade concluded with authority subsequently becoming unauthorised by reason of market movements or withdrawal of cash from the account creates such obvious difficulties in the context of the Counterparty Transactions binding on DBAG that its impracticality makes agreement to it incredible in and of itself.   </p>

SHI then put forward the case that the US$35 million was reduced by the net realised losses incurred by Mr Said’s trading but that any net realised profits could restore the limit to US$35 million once again but could not increase the limit beyond that.  Further Information also qualified the position to say that the trading limit operated by reference to the maximum entitlement of DBAG to margin, in accordance with the contractual documents.   </p>

The Bank shall not permit Mr Said (on behalf of SHI) to enter into any FX Transaction if that FX Transaction would cause the Value at Risk for transactions entered into by Mr Said on behalf of SHI multiplied by the Independent Amount Ratio plus the Bank’s Exposure in respect of transactions entered into by Mr Said on behalf of SHI to exceed the US$35 million limit.  If the Value at Risk multiplied by the Independent Amount Ratio plus the Bank’s Exposure is, at any time, greater than the US$35 million limit the Bank will ensure that sufficient open FX transactions are closed out such that the Value at Risk multiplied by the Independent Amount Ratio plus the Bank’s Exposure falls below the US$35 million limit.  The US$35 million limit is (i) US$35 million, minus (ii) any net realised losses on transactions entered into by Mr Said on behalf of SHI (net realised losses being realised losses on transactions entered into by Mr Said on behalf of SHI less any amount of realised profit Mr Said had made on behalf of SHI that remained available to be used as collateral in support of his transactions (but not such as to increase the limit above US$35 million).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The manner in which this is framed presents difficulties.  How DBAG is expected to prevent Mr Said from entering into FX transactions which have the effect in question, when most FXPB transactions are concluded on an automated basis, is unclear.  SHI appears to rely on the fact that, until trades are matched between the Counterparty and the Agent, there may not be any binding transaction but there are obvious difficulties in an FX Prime Broker monitoring trades as they are being concluded in order to avoid the margin being exceeded, rather than calculating margin after they are effected.  There are even more obvious difficulties in requiring DBAG to “ensure that sufficient open FX transactions are closed out” when the US$35 million margin is exceeded.  How this is expected to tie in with a US$35 million recourse limit as between DBAG and SHI is also uncertain, given liabilities that may already have been concluded as between DBAG and the Counterparty by Mr Said.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">There is a further restriction alleged, inasmuch as it is said that Mr Said did not have authority to “trade on credit” by which is meant that he had no authority to enter into trades for which margin was not required by DBAG in accordance with its contractual entitlement.  Of course, SHI traded on DBAG’s credit, in its name, with Counterparties and, at all times, traded on margin arrangements with DBAG, as security for potential debts.  Under the FXPB SHI did not borrow money from DBAG as such and all the collateral provided by way of margin simply represented a contractual figure, which constituted a protection for itself against SHI’s default, based on DBAG’s assessment of any diminution in the MTM valuation of the trades and the estimated costs of closing them down, bearing in mind the degree of illiquidity and “slippage” which might occur.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">As explained by SHI or Mr Vik at one point, “trading on credit” was said to mean trading in circumstances where a debtor-creditor relationship was created between the parties on a debt over and above the capital provided in the Pledged Account. It was said that DBAG only had the right to make margin calls if a debtor-creditor relationship existed between DBAG and SHI which was not permitted. The agreement  therefore was a variant of the Capital Limitation Agreement  and tallied with some of the arguments SHI advanced on construction at one time or another.  As part of this agreement and argument, it was said that if DBAG required capital in excess of US$35m for SHI’s FX trading, SHI had no obligation to provide it, but could, in its discretion, opt to do so.  If it did not do so, then it was said that DBAG was obliged not to allow the trade in question. </p>

As appears from the email from Mr Said to Mr Vik on 30th October 2006, referred to above, it is clear that although Mr Said was seeking to set up an FXPBA from September 20th onwards, the idea was that he was to “source opportunities” for Mr Vik and to execute deals on his instructions.  On a sample portfolio of spot trades presented to DBAG in New York, Mr Said had obtained a 200% VaR margin figure of US$28 million as against a US$50 million NOP figure.  In that email, in which he proposed to Mr Vik that he be permitted to trade a smaller portfolio for his own account (about which they had, he said, talked briefly before he started) he suggested that assets need not be moved around but that “between 25 and 50 mm$” could be earmarked as collateral for his account, so that it could not be pledged for anything else.  The suggestion of an allocation of a figure of this size was to be “big enough to make a difference to your bottom line over time if I am successful, but small enough not to go overboard”.  He said he would be keeping Mr Vik closely in the loop on what he did and supplying daily or weekly results as Mr Vik wished. </p>

US$35 million became the Allocated Portion notified by DBAG to SHI, which never changed throughout the life of the FXPBA.  Whilst the basis of margin was changed by agreement between DBAG and Mr Said on behalf of SHI, there was no further earmarking of assets in the Pledged Account to increase the US$35 million to anything larger.  The figure was then included in the TPMCA between DBS and DBAG, to which SHI was not even a party. </p>

So in my mind it was the US$35 million plus whatever profit was in there.”  In his re-examination by SHI’s attorneys in his deposition, Mr Said was referred to paragraph 7 of his affidavit of 21st May 2009 in the New York proceedings in which he referred to the sample margin calculation effected by DBAG on the hypothetical portfolio of trades.

You either put in collateral, you put in more money or you cut positions.  So that would have been impossible.

If he had entered into an agreement of the kind suggested with Mr Vik, that would have made its way into the contractual documents which he negotiated with DBAG, since it would, so far as he was concerned, have been a basic restriction on his trading which had to be set out.

Such an understanding is wholly inconsistent with any agreement between him and Mr Vik as to a fixed collateral limit of US$35 million, let alone a trading limit at that level.  (As appears elsewhere, Mr Said concerned himself little with margin requirements in the context of his trading in any event and Mr Brügelmann at the outset and Mr Walsh in October 2008 were asked by him to explain what the constituent figures on the GEM website meant in the context of the overall margin figures.)   </p>

I have already referred to the form of the original allegations, namely that Mr Vik made these oral agreements with Mr Meidal and/or Mr Brügelmann and Mr Brügelmann’s subsequent disappearance from the picture, as set out in Mr Vik’s evidence, and to the absence of any documentary support for the contents of the oral agreements as alleged, of the meetings in Connecticut or of the telephone calls relied on.   </p>

In reference to his discussions with Mr Said, when asked whether US$35 million was discussed and agreed with Mr Said as the maximum amount he could lose, Mr Vik replied in the affirmative and then said he would qualify that a little bit inasmuch as “that was the amount allocated to him, so that was all he could trade on and, as a result, that is sort of self-evident that he couldn’t lose more than that.  So that is probably a better answer.”  He went on to say that the chances of him losing more than US$35 million were remote but he had not had a conversation in which Mr Said had said that there was no way he could lose more than that.  He did not remember any specific conversation about what effect Mr Said’s profits would have on the collateral available to support his trading.  On then saying that he did have an agreement with DBAG that accrued profits were not available to Mr Said, save to offset losses, he then said he did not remember having a conversation with Mr Meidal or anyone else at the bank on that subject.  He stated in cross-examination that his memory was fuzzy in relation to the two meetings which he had said, in his statement, had taken place between him and Mr Meidal in Greenwich, with Mr Said present for part of them, and then suggested that there must have been discussion about the FXPB arrangements when he met Mr Meidal at the Frieze Art Fair in London in October 2008, which was nowhere referred to in his statements and the existence of which had only come to light in late disclosure by DBAG.  He agreed that perhaps he had forgotten that he had attended the Frieze Art Fair in London with Mr Meidal and said that a lot of his lengthy witness statements was recollection refreshed by documents seen.   </p>

The emails make clear that Mr Said talked to Mr Quezada and others about FXPB, that Mr Brügelmann was in correspondence with Mr Said about the question of margin, with Mr Meidal copied in and Mr Lay, PWM’s relevant credit officer, also involved.  Mr Said sought to obtain the lowest margining terms he could, thereby maximising leverage on existing assets and negotiating DBAG and DBS down from their initial demands to that which appeared in the CSA.  There were a number of other people directly involved in the setting up of the FXPB arrangements at both DBAG and DBS. </p>

The monitoring of the account would have involved the calculation of the margin in advance of each trade being concluded, and the prevention of trades where they brought about an increase in the margin requirement over and above the limit.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Both Mr Said and Mr Brügelmann understood, as is obviously the case, that margining by a bank can create a practical limitation on the amount of trading that is carried out.  If a bank requires more collateral from its client, the client has the two options to which Mr Said referred, namely to put up more margin or to reduce the trading positions to bring the overall position within the existing collateral provided.  It is in this context that not only Mr Brügelmann but other personnel within DBAG and DBS referred to the US$35 million as “risk capital”, “a risk budget”, a “risk limit” or even a “trading limit”.  What is absolutely clear, as Mr Brügelmann said in evidence, is that there is no way in which it is possible to guarantee that exposure on FX transactions can be kept within a specified limit.  It is in the very nature of FX transactions that the market may move and may do so violently, as happened in October 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  A trader may conclude transactions which, on a bank’s calculation, for example, give rise to a margin requirement of US$32 million but movements in the market of the order of 10-20% would inevitably take the margin requirement beyond US$35 million, at which point the customer would have to decide which of the two steps referred to above he would wish to pursue.  If particular types of trade were complex, illiquid and difficult to mark to market, and if circumstances constituted a one in a century event (such as the market movements in October 2008), a VaR calculation based on a 95% confidence level might well prove seriously inadequate since the circumstances would fall into the remaining 5% not taken into account.  A bank’s margin calculations could prove to be insufficient and if all the trades were closed down at this point, losses in excess of US$35 million could be realised.   </p>

The nature of the EDTs, as appears elsewhere, was that they combined a good probability of relatively small profits against a low probability of very large losses.  Mr Said knew that each EDT with daily or weekly fixings over a period of a year could theoretically accumulate very large losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars but never considered that the market was likely to move in such a way that this would happen.

Had they been margined with accurate MTM and VaR in accordance with the contractual methodology, DBAG would have been looking for additional collateral before the events of October 2008 and with that practical limitation on trading, Mr Vik would have been faced with the decision to which Mr Said referred in his deposition.  There could and would however have been no guarantee that SHI’s exposure was limited to the US$35 million figure, even though the expectation would be that losses would be unlikely to exceed it by much, if at all.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It is in this context that Mr Vik’s alleged oral agreement has to be seen.  SHI says it is a small step beyond the practical limitation of margin for Mr Meidal, on behalf of DBAG, to agree that there would be no recourse to SHI for any losses which exceeded that US$35 million limit in circumstances where DBAG was in a position to keep tabs on the transactions, mark them to market and call for appropriate levels of margin.  There could, however, be no business rationale for such an agreement to be reached on the part of anyone at DBAG.  It would have been an odd agreement to be made by anyone, but particularly by a relationship manager at DBS, as opposed to a senior figure involved in CRM or FXPB.  Nor is it a limit which Mr Vik would have been likely to request since he could not have expected any bank to agree to it.  As he well knew and recognised in cross-examination, an agreement as to the amount of collateral is very different from an agreement to a limit to exposure.  And he himself, in an email to Mr Said of 7 January 2008, stated he did not think in terms of equity capital allocations and did not want that to be a restriction on Mr Said’s activities if he had strong ideas.  A term of this kind could only be seen by an individual at a bank as novel and important and one which would require discussion with others and memorialisation.  That did not occur. </p>

It is inconceivable that Mr Vik could have thought that he had entered into such an agreement with Mr Meidal which was not recorded anywhere in writing and which ran so counter to ordinary concepts of collateral and liability.  The agreement is an invention on his part in circumstances where, by the time the margin calls were made, he was aware from Mr Said that DBAG had not been capable of marking the trades to market and therefore capable of seeking appropriate margin.  From 16th October onwards he was requesting details of DBAG’s margin calculations over the preceding months, whilst stating his inability to understand how DBAG had allowed losses of this size to occur when DBAG was assuring him that proper margining had been carried out.  DBAG refused to admit what had actually happened and Mr Vik commenced proceedings in New York.   </p>

SHI has sought, in this action, to make its point good about an exposure limit by reference to the terms of the FXPBA, FX ISDA, Schedule and CSA, by means of contrived construction arguments.  The weakness of such arguments no doubt explains the alternative reliance upon oral agreements based on Mr Vik’s evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Yet, if Mr Vik had, for one moment in October 2008, considered that he had previously agreed with DBAG that SHI’s exposure was limited to US$35 million, there is not the slightest chance that he would have decided on and agreed to an orderly close out of the trades concluded by Mr Said or ever have paid US$511 million by way of margin calls on Mr Said’s FX trading, in order to achieve this.  Indeed, on being told of potential margin calls by Mr Said, who told him on 10th October that closing out the trades would cost hundreds of millions of US$, on being told by DBAG through Mr Said of a likely first call of US$40-60 million and on being faced with the first margin call of US$98 million approximately, the very first thing that Mr Vik would have said was that there was an agreement under which SHI’s liability to DBAG was limited to US$35 million.  Mr Vik is forceful and demanding.  He is not a man who shuns confrontation or who would meekly respond to a bank’s demand for money and pay up, if he thought there was a good basis for refusing.  There is not a whisper of any semblance of this oral agreement until January 2009, after payment of the margin calls without protest.  I conclude that what Mr Vik has done is to seize upon the bank’s failure to effect margin calculations, to seek to make capital of it and to fabricate an oral agreement with an individual who was once employed by DBS and who may now be sympathetic to his position but who was not, as he knew by the time of his statements, to be called as a witness by DBAG.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is on its face, in its wider form, a highly surprising allegation.  Although, as originally contemplated, Mr Vik anticipated making the decisions which Mr Said would execute under the FXPBA, the account was always intended to be separate from other trading and once Mr Said was given control over the FXPB account with DBAG, Mr Vik continued to conduct his trading in FX through DBS, which, he accepted in cross-examination, was not subject to any trading limit of any kind, and was secured against his general assets placed with DBS.  Although he had authority to use it, it was not then anticipated that Mr Vik would use that FXPB account to trade through DBAG nor trade with DBAG as he later did in 2008 outside that account.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The idea that, from the outset in 2006, it was agreed that he and Mr Said would together be limited in their FX trading with DBAG, whether under a Prime Brokerage arrangement or otherwise, to a joint trading limit savours of the absurd.  Mr Vik would thus be limiting his own trade for no good reason and doing so by reference to the losses which Mr Said might make, thus restricting his own trading scope considerably.  If Mr Said could incur losses up to US$35m, Mr Vik would only be able to incur losses to the extent of the net profits that SHI happened to make and the balance on the Pledged Account.  As in fact Mr Vik withdrew US$30m of Mr Said’s profits at the end of 2007 and another US$75m approximately in mid 2008, this would have reduced his room to trade considerably in 2008, well below what he actually did.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Yet, as owner of SHI, there were substantial assets available as collateral for his trading outside the Allocated Portion, both in the Pledged Account and elsewhere with DBS in 2006-2007 and in DBAG from early 2008.  Neither Mr Vik nor DBAG could ever have thought that he, the owner of SHI, was not permitted to incur FX losses in trading above and beyond the balance of the Pledged Account plus SHI’s FX trading profit.  It is inconceivable that he would have agreed to any such limit, nor agreed that his trading be limited by the amount of collateral supplied for an entirely different and specifically segregated purpose, as he testified, namely for Mr Said’s trading, even with the addition of Mr Said’s trading profits.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor, once he started trading FX with DBAG in 2008, could he ever have thought that his large directional trading in FX in 2008 was subject to such a small collateral requirement, let alone such a trading limit.

It is right that paragraph 10 of the Schedule to the FX ISDA provides that payments of profits on transactions under the FXPBA should be credited to the Credit Support Balance, and that the CSA provides that the Credit Support Balance on any Valuation Date is the Allocated Portion.  The CSA refers specifically to the Allocated Portion but this supports Mr Said’s view, expressed in deposition, that it acted as additional collateral for his trading above and beyond the figure of US$35m.  As a limit for his trading or as a limit on his authority, it can fare no better than the argument for a US$35m trading limit or limit on his authority but, as a limit on Mr Vik’s ability to trade, it makes no sense at all.  Mr Vik accepted that recourse for SHI’s debts other than FX trading was not limited to collateral held by DBAG or DBS.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite Mr Vik’s evidence at paragraph 95(b) of his first witness statement that it was expressly agreed between himself and Mr Meidal that the bank’s recourse against SHI in relation to its FX trading would be limited to the amount of capital secured in favour of the bank in the separate and segregated account held by DBS, plus any built-up profits made on FX trading, Mr Vik did not maintain this point in crossexamination.  There was no suggestion that the PAL applied whilst Mr Vik was trading FX through DBS.  He agreed that it would not apply if and when he commenced trading through CM Beatrice, which was anticipated to happen from May 2008 onwards and actually could have begun at the very time the margin calls were taking place, had Mr Vik not withdrawn from the arrangements made.  Mr Vik then said that during the period in which he traded FX through DBAG he did not consider whether the PAL limit did or did not apply.  On the following day he said that he did not rely on the PAL and did not even consider it until 2009 when it was brought to his attention by his legal team.  The question of the PAL was, he said “really a legal question” as to what agreements governed.  He was referred to his affidavit in the New York proceedings of 19th February 2009 where he said that the accounts of SHI opened at the bank’s offices in London (meaning the accounts opened for his trading of Equities, Futures and FX) were unrelated in any way to Mr Said’s FXPB account in New York.  He agreed that the argument that his FX trading was subject to the PAL had not occurred to him at that stage.  He was then referred to his further affidavit of 6th April 2009 wherein he said that the London accounts had no relationship to the New York FXPB account or Mr Said’s trades at all and agreed that he thought of Mr Said’s accounts as being in New York whilst his FX trading was through the London account.  What became plain was that the PAL was a point first thought of by Mr Vik’s English lawyers in the course of oral submission in the Vik Millahue proceeding on 8th March 2010.  It thus becomes apparent that what Mr Vik said in his first witness statement about the PAL was simply an invention of evidence in an effort to support a lawyer’s point.  There was no evidence from anyone else upon which SHI could rely in support of this alleged oral agreement.  Mr Said said nothing that would assist and Mr Brügelmann knew nothing of it, nor did any other DBAG witness.  There is no documentary record or reference to the PAL anywhere in the contemporaneous material, whether prior to or following the execution of the FXPB documents at the end of November 2006.   </p>

The only options, which are not Structured Options, according to the terms of the FXPBA, are those which are put or call options without special features and single barrier options.  Any other option is a Structured Option.  In his deposition, Mr Vik said that his understanding of what “plain vanilla” FX trades meant was “spot, tom next, forwards and currency options”.  He said in cross-examination that if asked in 2006 what the phrase “plain vanilla” meant that is what he would have replied but he would not be able to tell by looking at a trade whether it fell into that category or not.

As appears elsewhere in this judgment, his evidence on deposition was that he described the nature of types of Structured Options (the exotic trades – the EDTs and OCTs) with Mr Vik before he entered into them.  He discussed the risk characteristics of each of the different types of trades with Mr Vik and specifically recalled discussing the risk on the first EDT prior to entering into it in February 2008, at some point after discussing it with Mr Chapin of CS when in his car driving down to Newport.  He would discuss matters with Mr Vik when they were in the office together and by telephone and email.  Anything new would be passed by Mr Vik with an explanation of the basic pay-off characteristics and the risk but once he had done a structure two or three times he would not refer back to Mr Vik again.  The email exchanges in 2008 particularly show this to be the case.  There is no way in which Mr Vik could have read these emails without appreciating that Mr Said was engaged in trades which would not, on any view, be considered vanilla.   </p>

He did not see how Mr Meidal could have gone off on trips to the USA, made agreements with Mr Vik and come back without recording or telling anyone of the agreements reached.  It was standard practice for DBS employees to make visit reports for the file but there were none for any trip at the relevant time.  Similarly, if agreements were reached on the telephone as Mr Vik suggested, a report should have been made and Mr Brügelmann would surely have been informed, regardless of that.  Mr Vik customarily dealt with Mr Brügelmann by email, sent on his Blackberry because he was constantly travelling and Mr Brügelmann thought that he dealt with Mr Meidal in the same way.

He asked to be put in touch with the right people in the currency/Prime Brokerage area.  On 22nd September Mr Meidal emailed Mr Vik proposing an interim arrangement until a Prime Brokerage Agreement for fixed income and FX trading was finalised.  A limited power of attorney was signed, giving Mr Said authority to trade with a position limit of EUR 300 million in the interim.

Prior to the conclusion of the FXPBA he had concluded Fixed Income investments in Argentinean bonds and the early exchanges with DBAG show that, even after the US$35m figure was fixed for Mr Said’s FX trading (and became the Allocated Portion in the CSA), a further US$40 million was being discussed as capital for FI trading for him.  As previously mentioned, a figure of something under US$70 million was in fact put into the Pledged Account.  In mid-2007 Mr Said concluded a further Argentinean bond transaction and CD swaps with notional values of US$300 million.  In August 2007, also, when vain efforts were being made to set up an FIPB, Mr Vik was keen to obtain facilities that would enable both him and Mr Said to trade “[a]ll products of any kind”. </p>

By this stage, Mr Said had produced details of his trades to Mr Vik for him to review in order to work out a way forward.  Indeed Mr Vik had asked Mr Said for (and it is to be assumed that he had received) five year charts on the currency pairs in Mr Said’s outstanding trades.  Over the course of the weekend of October 10th/12th and the week that followed when the margin calls were made, Mr Said and Mr Vik were in constant touch about those trades and the state of the market.  It cannot seriously be suggested that Mr Vik was unaware of the essential details of the EDTs at this point (although there is good evidence that he was aware long before).  Without protest, albeit asking from 16th October onwards for details of DBAG’s prior margining of Mr Said’s trades, Mr Vik authorised payment of over US$500 million by way of collateral and premium to close out trades.  At no stage did he suggest that Mr Said had exceeded his authority in entering into non-vanilla trades.  Nor did he make this point at his meeting with senior DBAG personnel on 30th </p>

Ms Greenberg’s evidence was that she could not recall why she had selected those products and did not recall spending much time considering or selecting them.  The degree of care employed is revealed by the email which refers to the attached client profile for “Floyd Currency Trading LLC”, rather than SHI.  The purpose of the email profile was, according to Mr Giery, to set out the trade booking codes to be used in DBAG’s systems for trades done.  The document refers to file transmission by the client submitting trades manually online and this, as Mr Giery’s evidence suggested, may in fact be the reason for the products listed as these would be capable of being submitted by the client through TRM, whereas Structured Options not only required DBAG’s consent under the FXPBA but DBAG’s involvement in booking.  It is clear from other documents sent by Ms Greenberg at around the same time and afterwards that she had no understanding that there was a limitation on SHI’s ability to conduct non-vanilla trades.

The structured data in fact always limited trades inaccurately to 13 months.  Once again the explanation for the set-up may be that these particular products were those which could be manually submitted online by the client and fed into GEM web reporting, as two FXPB witnesses suggested.  The structured data should have been based upon a form called a CIF or a MIF and that form for SHI simply referred to options, without any restriction to plain vanilla trades. </p>

Mr Brügelmann said that was something that Mr Vik had explained to him on previous occasions in relation to the DBS accounts.  Mr Vik then asked him as a courtesy to monitor the GPF account and to warn him when the value of the account was within 5-10% of a margin call though no specific agreement was made to that effect.  The rationale for this is relatively clear.  Mr Vik used Mr Brügelmann as his “go-to” man who executed his instructions for purchase and sales of assets for his DBS accounts and was to continue to do so for Mr Vik’s trading on the GPF platform with DBAG.  He thus had sight of all that was going on with Mr Vik’s day to day trading.  He was authorised to execute trades on behalf of SHI in respect of Mr Vik’s trading on the GPF platform.   </p>

He said that he did not discuss a precise number with Mr Meidal or Mr Brügelmann but he thought that “an accurate reflection of what was intended” was that a warning should be given when SHI was about 10% away from reaching the US$35 million figure.  He said he had no recall of the specific conversation with Mr Brügelmann to which the latter had referred on 14th November 2007 but there had been many conversations about this.   </p>

On the former, Mr Brügelmann supplied daily figures to Mr Vik whereas on the latter Mr Said made his own reports to Mr Vik and it was only for the occasions that Mr Vik met with Mr Brügelmann that the latter made enquiries and obtained some figures about Mr Said’s trading on that account.  (Mr Brügelmann only met Mr Vik three times in 2007 and three times in 2008 and those appear to be the only occasions upon which there was any discussion of Mr Said’s trading, following much lengthier discussion on other subjects with Mr  Brügelmann and others).  So far as he was concerned, he did not have access to information in relation to the FXPB account without asking for it whereas he had been given specific authority by Mr Vik to access DBX for the GPF figures and saw them daily in order to report to Mr Vik.  Whereas he was asked, as a courtesy, to notify Mr Vik if he was getting close to a margin call on his own trading (which Mr Brügelmann executed on his instructions), because Mr Said reported directly to Mr Vik on his trading Mr Brügelmann was not asked to provide similar information on Mr Said’s account.  There was never any specific agreement to give a notification about potential margin calls on Mr Said’s account. </p>

Mr Brügelmann said that as a matter of good client service he said he would keep an eye on the account to which he had access and tell him when there might be a potential call on its way.  In January 2008, Mr Brügelmann observed to Ms Hart in a telephone call that he needed to make contact with Mr Vik once SHI were “5% close” to a margin call because when he and Mr Orme-Smith had seen Mr Vik, Mr Vik said he did not want to get into a margin call situation and said he wanted to be told before.  Likewise, in August 2008 Mr Brügelmann emailed Mr Orme-Smith referring to the meeting with Mr Vik in which he had asked to be kept abreast of his margin situation well ahead of any margin call.  There is also a reference in Mr Brügelmann’s email following a meeting with Mr Vik on 7th May 2008 when Mr Vik had a series of meetings with different DBAG employees before speaking alone with Mr Brügelmann at the end.  Following this meeting Mr Brügelmann sent an email to Mr Orme-Smith referring to Mr Vik stating again that he did not wish to get close to any margin calls, at which “a smile went over Clare’s [Claire’s] face”.

Mr Brügelmann and Mr Vik had a close relationship in relation to Mr Vik’s own trading because of the daily instructions that Mr Vik would give to Mr Brügelmann and the daily reports that Mr Brügelmann would give to Mr Vik.  In that context Mr Brügelmann was entirely up to speed with what was going on in Mr Vik’s trading accounts but this was not true of the position with regard to Mr Said’s trading, as Mr Vik must have known.  Mr Vik received very little reporting from Mr Brügelmann on Mr Said’s FXPB account, being reliant upon Mr Said himself to make reports as he did weekly, religiously at the end of week.  In consequence, Mr Vik knew more about Mr Said’s trading than Mr Brügelmann ever did. </p>

By October 10th, at the latest, Mr Vik knew from email exchanges with Mr Said that the cost of closing out the account would run into hundreds of millions of dollars.  This meant that margin limits had long since been exceeded and yet there was not a murmur of complaint from Mr Vik that Mr Brügelmann had failed to tell him of this at any time beforehand.   </p>

Mr Brügelmann would not have considered himself able to vary or modify the CSA and it would be hard to see how Mr Vik could have thought that he could, since he was a relationship manager at DBS.  What Mr Brügelmann was doing was managing the relationship with Mr Vik in an effort to assist but there was no intention on his part to change DBAG’s entitlement to call for additional collateral in circumstances where the contracts allowed it.

There is however no conduct which is capable of amounting to performance of any amendment to the FXPBA and in circumstances where the parties have agreed to formalities of the kind which appear in all these agreements, in order for contractual rights to be affected, I conclude that Mr Brügelmann did not enter into a binding contractual commitment on behalf of DBAG to give a margin warning which could have any impact upon DBAG’s right to call for margin under either the FXPBA or the Equities PBA or the ISDA agreements which related to them.  Mr Vik expected any commitment made by the bank to be made in writing and this was not.  He knew that what he was getting was assistance from his relationship manager without commitment on DBAG’s part.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of fact, DBAG’s practice set three different levels at which action was or was not taken.  Initial margin was set at 200% of 5 day VaR for Mr Said’s account- the maintenance level.  The call level was 150% and the close out level was 100%.  The practice was not to call for margin at the 200% level but only at the 150% level, so that, in effect there was latitude given to the customer as against the margin requirements agreed and which were  supposed to appear on the GEM web reports.  An email of 18th October 2006 to Mr Said spelt out the practice of DBAG to call for margin at the 150% level and to close out at 100%.  The effect would be that the customer would be notified of a deficiency in margin at a level greater than that at which a call could be made.  As to causation, I need say nothing further but it is plain that if DBAG had issued a margin warning to Mr Vik, as opposed to Mr Said, about Mr Said’s FX trading, Mr Vik would have had  a  discussion with Mr Said about his margin requirements and the trading and the FXPB account.  If a margin call had been made, then Mr Said would have had to discuss the matter with Mr Vik.  There is no reason why DBAG would not have observed its ordinary practice in that connection in calling for margin at the 150% level.   </p>

The parties can agree that no currency need be delivered and that, on exercise, automatic exercise or deemed exercise there is simply a pay-off which represents the profit or loss made on the transaction by reference to a base currency.

There are also "structured" options, which have different features that allow the option holder to achieve different results, the most common of which are known as "barrier options" (i.e., knock-in and knock-out options) and "binary options" (i.e., one touch and no touch options).

Professor Wystup’s view was that there were two distinctive features of <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span>, without which a transaction could not properly be so termed.  The first was an element of optionality, namely a discretion on the part of the holder whether to exercise the right to purchase or sell, as the case may be (a call or put option) without any obligation to do so.  The second was that an option could not have a negative payoff and result in loss.  Mr Malik’s view was that the market considered that <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span> could consist of a series of bought and sold options, that any seller of an option had an obligation to fulfil the sale (if the buyer chose to exercise the option) and that a sold option always contained the possibility of a negative pay-off.  If the market price moved below the strike price on the sold option, and a deal was cash settled, the seller would suffer a loss representing the market differential.  His view was that each of the disputed EDTs and OCTs (other than the correlation swaps) was taken by the market as representing a series of embedded bought and sold options, in whatever language the trade confirmations</p>

Professor Wystup considered that the combination in a single contract of a portfolio of options could not be considered a “<span style="font-style:italic">currency option</span>” although it might be considered a “Structured Product” or an “FX derivative”. </p>

He is an honorary professor of quantitative finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management and an associate fellow in the Finance Group of Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick.  He is also a lecturer in Financial Engineering Programmes at the National University of Singapore.  He describes himself as having worked in the FX options industry since 1991 and, following internships, worked for three years between 1996 and 1999 as a consultant and foreign exchange options quantitative analyst at a private bank in Frankfurt.  Between 1999 and 2004 he worked at a Frankfurt bank as a quantitative specialist, risk manager and product developer in the Global Foreign Exchange Options Department where he was responsible for developing and implementing FX derivatives models, generating tailor-made structures for the bank’s clients and internal and external consulting for all FX options matters.  The reality was that he had never worked as a trader or in a front office role and had no experience of FXPB.  He said that he had experience on the FX structuring desk dealing with a lot of salespeople who in turn dealt with clients in buying and selling FX and that he was involved in training.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Despite efforts to explain this away, the fact remains that, when first sent copies of trade confirmations for two TPFs, he concluded that they fell under the category of options which he considered a broad term.  Moreover he considered that it would be highly impractical to create a full list of what fell within the definition of options and that it would be more usual for prohibited trades to be specifically listed in a contract or for there to be an explicit statement that only vanilla trades were allowed.  This was, he said, not only a matter of common sense but  he said that he had never seen anyone approach the issue differently and it was not something that, so far as he was aware, had ever been questioned.  Unless therefore there was explicit exclusion in an agreement, a TPF would be an option.  A <span style="font-style:italic">currency option</span> was a very general term and any book written on the subject would cover a lot more than vanilla options. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">On 10th August 2011, when looking for an expert who might be able to give evidence on the issues which arise for my decision in this area, Freshfields contacted Professor Wystup, enclosing an extract of part of the Defence and Counterclaim which set out SHI’s argument that Mr Said had exceeded his authority in entering into EDTs at paragraphs 85 and 86.  In the Defence and Counterclaim, it was said that each of the EDTs was not an FX transaction because they each contained a Target Knock-out event feature which meant that they were “exotic FX derivative transactions” and not FX or Option transactions.  Moreover, it was alleged that the EDTs did not give SHI a right to exercise as opposed to an obligation, and their character was such, by reference to pricing/valuation, trading, risk management and documentation that they were not vanilla transactions.  Also enclosed were the FXPBA and the Said Letter of Authority together with two trade Confirmations from CS of an AUD/NZD Target Redemption Forward with a strike at 1.2440, with daily observations for a year and a USD/CAD Pivot Target Accrual Forward with a low strike, a high strike and a pivot, running for a year, with daily fixings.  Additionally the declaration of an expert Mr Jananayagam, put forward by SHI in the New York proceedings, was sent to Professor Wystup, in which he expressed the view that the EDTs could not be categorised as “<span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span>” as such terms were used in the FXPBA and Said Letter of Authority.  Mr Jananayagam expressed the view that an option was a financial instrument which gave the right but not an obligation to the option buyer to purchase or sell an asset at a pre-agreed price on a specified date.  A <span style="font-style:italic">currency option</span> therefore allowed the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell one currency in exchange for another and no such right was given to either SHI or DBAG in the EDTs.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">With the benefit of these documents sent to him on 10th August, Professor Wystup gave his views in a telephone consultation on 18th August with representatives of DBAG, Freshfields and DBAG’s New York attorneys.  Notes were taken by a representative of each of those entities and expressed clearly what Professor Wystup was saying at the time.  I have already expressed in outline the record of his view as noted by the Freshfields’ representative which concluded by disagreeing with Mr Jananayagam’s affirmation and the views expressed in it.  The notes of the representative of DBAG (a member of its legal department) referred to Professor Wystup’s view that a market view of the difference between vanilla and exotic options depended upon the person being asked.  A trader would merely distinguish between a vanilla option and a structured option.  His own experience was gained within a group of colleagues within the bank and the range of corporate and institutional clients with whom he dealt.  He was specifically asked in the call if he would be able to testify that TPFs would be covered by an ISDA to which his answer was yes.  He said he was familiar with the Target Redemption Forwards but had not seen the TPF before with its “extra knock-ins and knock-outs” but he considered those as merely tweaks from the ones he had seen.  He regarded Target Redemption Forwards as a type of Forward and a TPF was an FX Forward or an Option and would be treated as such unless specifically excluded in an agreement.  It would be hard to list products and keep them up to date in an agreement, so the general practice would be to include everything but list exceptions.  If only vanilla trades were intended, that is what would be expressly said.  When referred to Mr Jananayagam’s views, he said he did not agree.  The EDTs were not vanilla put or call options but <span style="font-style:italic">currency option</span> was a general term and in any book that you opened, you would see a whole variety of options and not just vanilla.  Based on his experience the market would regard these transactions as options or FX forwards. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The notes of another representative of Freshfields were to the same effect.  Market views would depend on the identity of the person asked as to whether something was vanilla or exotic.  An experienced options trader would consider all as options and would specify if he wanted to trade vanilla alone.  Options included the whole product range including “super-derivatives”.  He said he had no familiarity with FXPB and no experience of the terms in which authority was given to traders.  He had come across TPFs but not the pivot trades which were more recent but both were properly described as FX options and would be covered unless specifically excluded in an agreement.  A TPF was a type of forward, and because of developments, it would be difficult to list a set of authorised products in a Master Agreement and keep it up to date.  Hence such an agreement would tend to be general and only list the exceptions that were not permitted.  He had not seen it done differently.  He specifically disagreed with Mr Jananayagam’s declaration that exotic derivatives, including knock-outs, would not fall into the category of options or forwards.  He saw currency option as a very general term which would include vanilla trades but was not exclusive to it.  Any book that you opened regarding options would provide you with a wide variety of them.  When asked if he had ever had to give an expert report on whether a pivot or TPF would commonly be regarded as an FX forward or an option, he said that he never expected anyone to doubt it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In a follow up email the same day, Professor Wystup made a suggestion to Freshfields.  He said that if further evidence was needed for the scope of the terms “forwards” and “options” in Prime Brokerage Agreements/Master Agreements/ISDA Agreements, his consulting company could carry out a survey of the number of banks known to them and take statements.  He concluded by saying “I think it is clear anyway, but having some supporting material could support your claim”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Professor Wystup’s evidence to the court was that, at the time he expressed these views, he had not taken much trouble to review the documents he had been sent, had not spoken to others in the market and had not sufficiently thought through the issues as he had by the time he came to provide his reports and give evidence.  In a statement, he said that the views expressed in the telephone consultation were his “initial views, expressed off-the-cuff” and gave “a completely bank-focused approach”.  His responses were formulated on the call without prior consideration.  He used labels loosely and now considered that there was a significant difference between an internal bank trading mandate and a client-facing contractual trading authority and he was only considering the former in the telephone call. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Later in the witness statement he said that he had used the term “option” in a very broad and loose way and had not settled exclusively either on “forward” or “option” as a classification for the TFPs.  The reference to “option” was likely to have been because his peer group often addressed pivots and TFPs when talking or writing about options and he was using the word in the way that some of his peer group did use it.  This of course is, in fact, very much to the point.  If others in the market consider these types of trades as options, then later reflection and analysis may not in fact assist.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Whilst professing a consciousness of his duties to the Court, Professor Wystup, both in his reports and in his oral evidence, was a very unsatisfactory expert.  He was partisan and argumentative and sought to argue questions of construction of the contracts rather than focussing on the question of how the market understood the position.  His views, expressed in the telephone call, were close to those of Mr Malik, at a time when he was anticipating that he might give expert evidence on behalf of DBAG.  When consulted by SHI, he changed his views to give diametrically the opposite opinion without any qualifications or reservations and without any explanation of any kind until he was faced with the notes of what he had said in the telephone call in August 2011.  I did not therefore find him an expert upon whose market views I could rely. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">By contrast, Mr Malik came across as a man who knew the market at first hand in a trading context as well as in the context of talking to back offices and clients.  As he said, people in the market did not tend to analyse the transactions in question but simply thought of them as <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span>.  There were indicia as to why this might be so but the rationale for the view was not something that would be discussed much or expressed in the market.  The Trade Confirmations were usually expressed in terms of “pay-off” but the underlying basis of the disputed transactions was the series of call and put options for each of the fixing days, which he described as “embedded” within the terms of the deals.  The concepts for <span style="font-style:italic">structured options</span> had been developed from more straightforward options and strategies of trading straightforward call and put options.  This was done in order to sell products on the market that met particular business needs and in particular the desire of hedge funds and traders to speculate in currency without payment of premium – “zero cost options”.  Combining vanilla options provided some degree of flexibility for investors (Call Spreads, Risk Reversals, Straddles, Strangles and Butterflies) whether for hedging purposes or otherwise, but the strategies provided by the use of such options might not capture the market view of the investor.  Customised products therefore were brought to the market which came to be known as “exotic” <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span> or “<span style="font-style:italic">structured</span>” options, according to Mr Malik.  The latter phrase was usually used to describe transactions which had the combination of options or embedded options which Mr Malik said were inherent in the EDTs.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The vast majority of trading on the FX market which is the world’s largest and most liquid financial market with a daily currency turnover of nearly US$4 trillion, is speculative.  One of the attractions of buying options is that for a fraction of investment of option premium, investors are able to assume risk on the whole investment but, with zero cost options, the attractions become even more obvious.  If the underlying asset moves in favour of the holder, substantial sums can be earned.  Moreover, although options fall to be exercised, if an option is “in the money” there would be no reason not to exercise it and in practice exercise always occurs absent an operational error or an oversight on the part of the buyer.  Where there is a combination of options, the party in the money is always treated as having exercised the option. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Malik’s evidence was that TPFs were very popular vehicles for investors who wished to express a highly customised view on a currency pair.  Although profits were limited by the target feature, the investor was compensated for the limits on the upside by not being required to pay an upfront option premium and by a strike price that allowed the investor to buy or sell the currency pair at a better than market strike price.  The agreement to buy and sell the currency was structured through the purchase and sale of embedded options by the bank and the investor to one another.  Both TPFs and Pivot TPFs can be described as transactions that provide the holder with a higher probability of a relatively smaller gain and a lower probability of a relatively larger loss.  The experts agreed that the maximum loss was readily capable of calculation by multiplying the daily notional by the number of fixings.  In practice, the loss would not be expected to be anything like that amount but would all depend upon the market movements.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">If the example is taken of a TPF with a daily notional of 100 on a USD/JPY trade, where the holder makes a profit if the FX rate settles at above 100 and makes a loss if it settles below, with a target profit of 5, the pay-off to the investor on any day represents the result of the investor purchasing a call option (which benefits if the FX rate rises above the strike price of 100) and the pay-off to the bank on each day can be regarded as the investor selling the bank a put option at the same strike price of 100 so that the position loses money if the FX rate falls below that level.  Thus the purchase of a call option and the sale of a put option at the same strike price is embedded within a TPF structure on each Observation Date or fixing date.  As Mr Malik explained, the FX market has evolved so that the transaction documentation (the term sheets and trade confirmations) simply document the pay-off rather than documenting a series of combinations of options for every day of the duration of the transaction.  Each option is taken to be exercised if it is in the money on any Observation Date so that profits and losses accrue over the period of the transaction, subject to hitting the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">target profit, in which case the transaction knocks out.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In a Pivot TPF, the payment by each party is by reference to three strike prices, as previously set out.  The pay-off in a Pivot TPF is also structured by the use of embedded options.  The investor and the bank purchase and sell to one another a series of embedded daily call and put options at different strike prices.  The target feature once again operates as a condition of each and every option transaction, taken in conjunction with the other.  If, for example, the FX rate is 101 and the low strike price is 98, the pivot 100 and the high strike price 102, the pay-off represents the following four options for each fixing.  The investor sells an out of the money put option at the low strike price of 98.  The investor purchases one in the money call option at the low strike price of 98 (the two in combination operate as a synthetic forward with a strike price of 98).  Additionally, the investor sells two call options at the pivot of 100.  Holders are again taken to have exercised their rights under these embedded options if the options are in the money.  The effect of this combination of options is that the investor makes a profit if the FX price is between 98 and 102 (above the low strike price and below the high strike price) and makes no money at all if the FX rate equates with the high or low strike prices.  As soon as the rate moves outside the high or low strike, the investor starts to accumulate losses.  Thus the purchaser of a TPF is expressing a market view about volatility, hoping and expecting that the currency stays within the high and low strike prices.  The closer the FX rate to the pivot, the more profit is earned until the target figure is reached.  Generally, the longer the transaction goes on, the more chance there is of a change in the rate which would take the FX rate beyond the strike level with accumulation of losses in consequence.  Again, as with TPFs, investors are compensated for the loss of potential upside by avoiding the need to pay any upfront premiums as well as receiving a better strike price at the outset.  In the event that the investor has to pay out on a pivot TPF, the exposure is equivalent to that of the sale of vanilla options.   </p>

The target cap level and the target knock-out event are specified and an explanation given as to the sums owing by way of settlement depending on where the FX rate settles as against the pivot and strike prices.  Each transaction specifically incorporates the provisions of the ISDA Definitions whilst the trade confirmations provide that, in the event of any inconsistency, the terms of the confirmation will prevail.  The confirmation supplements, forms part of and is subject to any ISDA Master Agreement between the parties.  The standard non-reliance Clause appears in the confirmation whereby the investor represents that it is acting for its own account, has made its own independent decisions as to whether to enter into the transaction or not and exercised its own judgment as to the suitability of it, without reliance upon any communication from the other party as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into the trade.  The investor represents that it is capable of assessing the merits of and understanding the terms, conditions and risks of the transaction and accepts those risks.   </p>

They were conditional and explicable by reference to a series of options, even though they were more usually labelled by reference to their conditional pay-off features than as options per se.  The existence of the negative pay-off was a function of selling options, rather than buying them.  Of course even a bought option has a negative payoff in the sense of premium paid in the ordinary way, but the sale of an option will always give rise to a negative pay-off after the event (if exercised) because the seller is obliged to sell when the market has risen from the agreed price on the exercise of the option by the buyer.  Whether a straight line TPF was seen by some as a strip of cash flows or a strip of forwards, that was not the issue because the market participants classified them as <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span>.  Moreover the effect of incorporating the ISDA definitions was to treat these as <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span> within those definitions, as between SHI, the Counterparty and DBAG. </p>

Neither was a matter for an expert unless the analysis was one which was shared in the market as the basis for classifying trades.  Professor Wystup divided products into options, option-like derivatives (which did not have optionality but did have a non-negative pay-off) and non-option like derivatives which had no optionality and could have negative pay-offs.  He further classified what he described as vanilla options on the one hand and first generation, second generation and third generation Exotic options and structured products, refusing to accept that <span style="font-style:italic">Structured Options</span> was a recognised term in the market.  He accepted that no-one in the market talked of trading first generation, second generation or third generation exotic options but maintained that TPFs and Pivot TPFs were traded as such and not as <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span>.  Exotic options were not <span style="font-style:italic">currency options</span> unless they fulfilled what Professor Wystup saw as the indispensible requirements of an option, namely the granting of a right to be exercised (not an obligation) and providing for a non-negative pay-off.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The other pillar in Professor Wystup’s analysis therefore was that single products were to be distinguished from structures and strategies of trading and if an instrument included a series of options, whether linked with other terms and conditions or not, it could not itself be seen as an option but was a “structured product”.  This was a phrase which Mr Malik saw as describing a combination of a cash product with a derivative, whether in the context of FX, Interest rate or Credit transactions.  In my judgment, it is a term which covers a multitude of products and is so imprecise that it is of little value.  Professor Wystup said a package of options was not an option and that an instrument was not the equivalent of its component parts, nor of the products to which it could be decomposed, nor of the products that could dynamically replicate its risks.  He said it was highly artificial to explain the EDTs and OCTs in terms of options even if they could be broken down and represented in this way.  It is hard however to see how an option can cease to be an option when combined with other options in a package and, when authority is given to trade in options in the plural, why there is a problem with structures which put together a series of options.  Even on its own terms, Professor Wystup’s analysis did not hold together. </p>

Mr Gunewardena, Ms Serafini, Ms Liau and Ms Miranda all joined DBAG as a team from GS in 2006, and Mr Spokoyny joined them in 2007 as a risk officer.  He was set to work to build a new margining and risk system for the FXPB platform in circumstances where DBAG calculated Initial Margin for its FXPB clients by two different methodologies, namely NOP (Net Open Position) and VaR.  The majority were on NOP margining.  Variation margin reflected the MTM of the transactions or assets in question under either methodology.  Mr Spokoyny and Ms Serafini introduced a new stress-based margining methodology which was implemented for a limited number of clients in 2008. </p>

For VaR clients, the potential future exposure and MTM of positions and the aggregate MTM of the portfolio were separately calculated by the ARCS VaR system and then fed into GEM.  GEM would then subtract the potential future exposure from the aggregate current exposure of the portfolio to derive the 5 or 10 day VaR.  Any VaR multiplier that had been agreed with a particular client would then be applied by GEM to give an overall initial margin requirement for the client.  Additionally, however, a liquidity add-on could be calculated using a template spreadsheet that sat above, and took information from GEM.  Such calculations were then added to the margin shown on the GEM system and details would be sent to CMV who would input this into their system to generate the margin requirement.  Trade details, MTMs and portfolio level VaR requirements and the overall margin requirement (including both initial margin and variation margin) were reported to clients using a web-based reporting interface linked to GEM.  Liquidity add-on did not appear there and, if agreed, would appear in margin statements from CMV which were usually sent only if there was a margin call or if requested by the client. </p>

As part of the review he designed a series of stress tests which worked by applying hypothetical “shocks” in exchange rates, volatility and interest rates to a client’s portfolio and to specific currency pairs: e.g. dramatic changes caused by large moves in the oil price and similar dramatic economic events.  The object was to ascertain the magnitude of losses that any client might suffer if any of these hypothetical shock events occurred.  The hypothetical losses thus calculated were then compared to the level of collateral required from each client under existing margin terms and if there was a significant shortfall, this was referred to within DBAG as “Gap Risk”.  If a Gap Risk was calculated, it was intended that the FXPB team should seek to negotiate amendments in margin terms, or increase the level of fees, or ask the client to reduce risk in the portfolio or, in the worst case scenario where DBAG would not want to continue acting as prime broker, terminate the FXPB relationship.  The results of the stress tests that were carried out were not typically shared with clients.  </p>

In 2007 and 2008, Mr Spokoyny believed that a more conservative confidence level should be used and that the Monte Carlo simulation used by ARCS VaR should use historical data for longer time periods and should incorporate “jumps” or pre-determined movements in the exchange rate for developed market currencies as well as emerging market currencies (which it already did).  He also held the view that ARCS VaR did not accurately account for the increased liquidation costs that arose if a client held particularly large positions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In August 2007, a potential Gap Risk was identified in relation to SHI but prioritisation of other accounts meant that Mr Spokoyny did not complete his stress tests and report on SHI until 11th March 2008, when he identified significant Gap Risk.  There was thereafter discussion as to whether the counterparty risk on the client should be borne by PWM, by FXPB or GPF where most of SHI’s assets with DBAG and DBS were by then located.  Mr Spokoyny continued to carry out stress tests on the portfolio as it appeared in GEM which included some resurrecting fader options.  His evidence was that they appeared in groups of four entries which appeared to him to be offsetting put and call options.  He did not consider that they added materially to the risk in the portfolio.  Mr Spokoyny’s evidence was that he did not know that each set of four entries represented an inadequate proxy for an EDT with a large notional value when all the daily fixings were taken into account.  The stress testing which he carried out therefore failed to take account of the true nature of these transactions and the full risk presented by them, even where they did appear in  GEM.  Where they remained unbooked, there was nothing Mr Spokoyny would have been able to see and therefore no reason for him to know of their unbooked existence.  It was not until October 2008 that he came to understand the true position. </p>

In the call, Mr Spokoyny suggested NOP terms by reference to the different currency tiers or an amendment by increasing the VaR multiplier and changing 5 day terms to 10 day terms.  There was a suggestion that Mr Said created strategies of a kind that did not lend itself well to the VaR calculation.  Matters were left on the basis that FXPB should come up with figures that should be discussed. </p>

Mr Lay’s immediate reaction was to say that the VaR FX limit for SHI was suspended and that no further exposure could be entered into by the client which provoked the immediate response from Ms Liau that SHI was not in breach of its existing margin terms.  Mr Brügelmann, with the aim of overcoming the issue, asked for further details of Mr Spokoyny’s analysis and sent an email to Mr Orme-Smith of GPF requesting that he block US US$100 million in SHI’s GPF account to secure any potential shortfall until new margin terms had been agreed.  Mr Orme-Smith responded “Noted – thanks”.  CRM personnel regarded this as an effective blocking and Mr Brügelmann plainly regarded this as a practical solution, even if the ring fencing was not legally enforceable.  SHI was never told about this and waxed indignant about it at the trial.  Nothing ever came of this ring fencing and GPF Risk objected when the matter came to its attention and Mr Orme-Smith, on 21st July 2008, stated that his email was never intended to be an agreement to such ring fencing and that he had never been in a position to achieve that in any event.  In the meantime on 15th April 2008 Mr Spokoyny sent Ms Stingelin details of his stress methodology with a Trade Details Report downloaded for GEM, which included eight entries for “Resurrecting Fader Options” (four each for EDTs 1 and 2).  Each entry included N/A in the MTM column which should, in my judgment, have alerted Mr Spokoyny to a potential problem, but, on his evidence, did not.  His review of Trade Details in GEM did not lead him to think that there were trades which materially added to the risk of which he was failing to take account.  Had he investigated the position then, as he did in October 2008, the problem would have been evident to him.   </p>

The purpose was to discuss a new prime brokerage account that SHI wanted to set up for Mr Vik for FX and/or FI and the margin terms for the existing FXPB account.  In the course of this call, Mr Brügelmann explained that there could not be separate FXPB accounts for the same legal entity with different margining methodologies.  Whilst Ms Serafini and Mr Spokoyny saw the solution as being the application of the NOP methodology to Mr Said’s trading account, Mr Giery and Mr Quezada explained that Mr Said was concluding structured options and pivot faders that they did not think could be margined by NOP but could be captured in ARCS VaR.  The suggestion was made of trade level margining by a methodology approved by CRM.  Mr Spokoyny expressed his disquiet that the calculations performed by ARCS VaR were less than transparent because one could not see each and every trade being modelled but only a composite number produced as the margin figure.  He explained that the ARCS VaR system could not readily be changed in order to give DBAG what he considered an adequate protection against the counterparty risk and this would affect all other clients and involve significant investment in hardware and time.  In that call, Mr Quezada referred to pivot accrual faders which presented difficulties in booking, saying his only recourse was to go to a quant expert in the sales desk who was reluctant to help.  He expressed the view that if these types of trade could not be booked in an automated fashion, FXPB would probably not accept them.  Mr Giery said that they could not book some of the stuff that Mr Said was doing at the moment and that it would take somebody in the Structured Options Group to do it and they would then have to value it daily using DB Analytics spreadsheets which FXPB did not have.   </p>

Mr Brügelmann said he would seek to spin an argument on the basis of concentration of risks, liquidating risks and correlation breakdown.  The VaR solution was not however completely out of the question if there was development which enabled subaccounts to function on the system with different margining methodologies.  Mr Quezada wished to go down that route because of the limitation that NOP might impose upon the types of trade which Mr Said could conduct, even though he had recognised earlier in the call that there were still issues about how to book the trades, whether VaR could capture the full risk and that the easy solution was to insist that he conducted the “funky structures” in direct trades with the DBAG trade desk or with CS or MS under separate ISDA agreements with them. </p>

In the meeting on 7th May, Mr Brügelmann told Mr Vik of the issues in relation to setting up an FXPB and FIPB account for him, and the potential deficiency in the existing margining arrangements for Mr Said.  I have made findings about exactly what was discussed on that occasion but the idea of using a separate legal entity for Mr Vik’s FX Prime Brokerage potentially overcame the difficulties of sub-accounts with different margining methodologies.

In a call of that date, Mr Spokoyny explained that Mr Said’s net open position in his FXPB account had reduced from over US$1 billion earlier in the year to some US$600 million at that point and that the current margin requirement was US$23.5 million when he thought the current risk was actually more like US$50-60 million.  On discussing what changes might be required to the VaR parameters, Mr Brügelmann said that he had spoken to Mr Said who had told him that he would not agree a move to NOP margining.  Mr Spokoyny said that the 95% confidence element of the VaR calculation could not be changed but the multiplier could be altered and a liquidity add-on employed.

Looking at the EDT portfolio alone, the difference between “actual” and the DM was 6% whereas the difference between “actual” and the PM was 15%.

The mean size of the jump was 15% and the standard deviation was 7.5% of that.  If the figures were taken as meaning literally 7.24 jumps per annum up and down, the probability of a jump in any five day period was 13.9% in either direction.  With a generation of one thousand different paths in the DM, nearly 28% of those would experience a jump up or down which meant that jumps would occur more often than 5% of the time in any five day period.

It is an estimate because it inherently requires assumptions.  It does not guarantee a maximum loss figure and there is about a 5% chance that the actual loss will be greater than the VaR number produced over a five day period.  It is not an attempt to capture all possible losses and the assumption is that in about 5% of cases it will not.  This calculation of VaR at this confidence level is by definition the 95th percentile worst loss – the fiftieth worse loss in a thousand scenarios.  The purpose of the jumps was however to make allowance for the risk associated with currencies exposed to unlikely but relatively severe events not reflected in the ninety or two hundred and fifty days historical data used in most VaR calculations.  In the DM, as utilised by DBAG in its systems and by Mr Millar, a flat rate judgemental assumption was made for all currencies in particular tiers.  It was an assumption which was made that fell into the 95% calculation but was not factoring in an unlikely risk that would necessarily occur in less than 5% of cases as such.   </p>

It could not therefore be said it was inappropriate and backtesting of the model showed that the assumption had proved correct.  It was a subjective judgment about assumptions to be put into the calculation to get 95% VaR over five days.  The assumptions that were put into the model were different to the actual assessment of the confidence level at 95%.  If the judgment had been based on short term historical movement only, jumps would not be present but it was inherently reasonable to take into account events beyond the ninety day or two hundred and fifty day period and to allow for them in some way, as the jumps did.

It was not however right to say that this was an external element that should be outside the VaR calculation in the same way as a liquidity add-on or a fat tail add-on which were specifically designed to take account of matters that the VaR calculation did not.  Whilst what was being built into the 95% VaR figure was an event which might take place less frequently than in 5% of cases, that was not uncommonly done.  There was a great deal of latitude in the definition of VaR when computing a 95% VaR figure and very often the jumps or tools used were achieved by reverse engineering.  In fact, the BRL EDTs suffered greater losses in their lifetime than the VaR calculations for them under the DM.  The DM therefore did not in fact take account of the worst possible loss scenario.  The assumption was built in in order to get to the 95% confidence level and was not designed just for extreme events but also for lesser events covering factors like difficulties in closing out positions or liquidating portfolios.  Mr Millar did not think it fair to say that the reasonableness of the parameters should be assessed solely by reference to the frequency of extreme events. </p>

There was compensation for the absence of the volatility parameter by the use of the jumps which made assumptions about changes in spot rate, though these were not directly related to volatility as such.  If however implied volatility shift were to be inserted on top of that, there would be an element of double counting.  The effect of the differences between the DM and the PM and their approach to implied volatility and the jumps depended upon the constitution of the portfolio in question and, in the case of SHI’s portfolio, when taken as a whole, it was more sensitive to movements in spot rates than to movements in implied volatility.  Where jumps had the effect of offsetting the absence of implied volatility shifts, that might or might not be random but the effects on this portfolio had an offsetting effect in practice.  Mr Millar made the point that he did not consider the sensitivity of this portfolio to vega to be very high and he could not build in implied volatility into the DM without making assumptions that, to his knowledge, did not replicate anything that DBAG would have done.   </p>

He did not consider that the DM was rendered unreasonable by exclusion of the implied volatility parameter that appeared in the PM.  There was compensation by the provision of jumps, by the longer period during which the DM considered the change in FX rate (five days as opposed to one day scaled up to five) and the shorter time period of ninety days, as opposed to two hundred and fifty days which made the DM more reactive to short term changes in spot rates.  When performance of the model as a whole was taken against “actual”, the DM achieved results which were closer to reality than the PM.  The main differences between the PM and the DM appeared in late July to late September where the jumps made most of the difference and where the DM was closer to reality than the PM.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Dr Drudge accepted that the numbers produced by the DM were not unreasonable but targeted the jumps as an area for criticism.  He accepted that the DM with jumps produced higher figures than the PM on 75 observations at trade level and that, (without jumps) the DM still gave higher figures than the PM at portfolio level.  Dr Drudge accepted that the PM, without jumps, did not allow for events which might affect the spot rate but which had not been seen within its relevant historical time series, such as particular geo-political risk events, sovereign risk events and the like which did not occur with great frequency but could nonetheless take place.  He accepted that jumps did seek to take these events into account and accepted that the range of movements in the spot rate under the DM, with the jumps for the USD/BRL, was in line with the range of movements in the spot rate that was observed in the market in September and October 2008.  In his view however, jumps or similar tools, whether the result of stress tests or otherwise, were more commonly added on top of VaR rather than blended into the VaR methodology.  His essential criticism was therefore that the jumps in the DM were to be found in the VaR calculation as opposed to being outside it as an add-on.  He would not criticise the view that risk in emerging market currencies was not adequately reflected by a particular period of historical data and banks were entitled to make different assumptions of risk in producing their numbers.  For him, the question for BRL was whether it was reasonable to put in a once in ten year event or a once in five year event, as he saw it, into a five day 95% VaR.   </p>

In consequence he wanted the EDTs removed, when they appeared, or the MTM zeroed out.

The continuing problem was that ARCS VaR was not properly feeding MTM through to GEM so that Mr Said was complaining about the inaccuracy of the MTM figures in the Open P&amp;L Report and about some vanilla trades not appearing until some time after they had been concluded.  This problem surfaced in January, April, June and July 2007 and on 31st July 2007 Mr Said expressed his exasperation in an email to Mr Giery.  He referred to erroneous P&amp;L numbers appearing which were the same as the day before and the absence of the previous day’s deals on the system because they had not fed through.  Mr Giery responded that the question had been escalated to senior IT management and that all agreed that this was unacceptable.  He explained that both VaR and individual trade P&amp;L was calculated in a separate risk engine and that the individual trade P&amp;Ls had to be consistent with his overall VaR number (which was of course a portfolio figure).  He told Mr Said that the problem was that the feed from that separate risk engine into the reporting engine had failed several times in the previous month.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The problem was system-wide and was not unique to reporting for SHI’s portfolio.  As SHI was margined on VaR, trade level valuations in respect of SHI’s trading through the FXPB Account were calculated by ARCS VaR and those calculations were carried out a number of times each day.  The valuations were then sent to GEM in batches and were used to populate the Open P&amp;L report and the Trade Details (Outstanding Trades) Report that could be viewed through the web reporting interface.  New trade MTMs would only appear in the reports once they had been sent to GEM by ARCS VaR.  The delay in the feed between ARCS VaR and GEM meant that the valuations displayed on web reporting were not updating as frequently as they should have and there was a considerable delay between the time when a trade was booked and the time when the trade details and MTM values for the trade appeared in the Web report.  In addition, the rates used by ARCS VaR and GEM to recalculate MTM valuations for FXPB transactions throughout each day were updated at different intervals.  This meant that for clients such as SHI who were margined using VaR, the open P&amp;L report in GEM would have displayed a different revaluation rate (the GEM rate) to the one that had actually been used by ARCS VaR to calculate the MTM values which actually appeared in the report.   </p>

It would show MTMs calculated by GEM and not by ARCS VaR and would therefore provide a work-around solution to the feed problem from one to the other.  As Mr Said would not be able to access this newly created report, manual spreadsheets would be prepared on a daily basis of the MTM (referred to by Mr Said as his P&amp;L) of these vanilla trades at close of business, reflecting the trades shown on GEM and the NOP MTMs thus calculated.  On 1st August 2007 Mr Said was told by Mr Quezada and Mr Giery of this separate account reflecting the MTM of open trades on NOP based calculations “calculated in real time”, with Mr Giery enclosing “a cut of your current Open PnL out of our internal risk engine”.  The attached spreadsheet which was the first of the “manual” spreadsheets produced set out the trades as they appeared in the Trade Details (Outstanding Trades) Report available to Mr Said and then corrected the MTMs contained within it by reference to the NOP-based MTM system within RMS, using a pricing module to convert euro figures into USD.

Mr Walsh referred the matter to Mr Giery, making reference to OCT4 as a similar trade which had been done directly with DBAG.  Mr Giery’s response was to raise three points.  The first was to check whether it could be supported; the second to check whether it could be included in VaR and the third was to ensure that Mr Said knew that it could not be reported properly, if it could be booked.  The initial reply with regard to VaR was that, if the trade was not covered by ARCS VaR, it would be possible to book trade level margin in Sentry but a subsequent response in relation to OCT4 was that trade level margin could be provided for each.  The figures would not therefore form part of the overall VaR calculation for the portfolio and as SHI’s FX trading was not set up to feed through to Sentry, any trade level margining would not have been included in SHI’s overall web based report of margin calculations at all.  Mr Quezada gave instructions to take the trade in and to inform PWM, presumably with a view to CRM conducting trade margining, but in fact only Mr Meidal and Mr Brügelmann were contacted and the </p>

Mr Walsh could not recall whether he did or did not tell Mr Said that the trade could not be properly reported and he himself, in his evidence, said that he did not understand either the details of margining or the systems under which they took place. </p>

Mr Walsh appears to have taken this trade in without further ado on the basis that OCT7 had been accepted.  OCT12 was another extinguishing timer option in DBAG’s sales desk parlance and was a direct trade concluded with Mr Said on 7th August.  Mr Geisker booked OCT12 directly to SHI’s account as he had done with OCT4 and Mr Avery confirmed that, as an extinguishing timer, it should be covered by VaR.  In an email from Mr Quezada to Mr Said, he stated that the MTM had been confirmed with David Geisker.  In DBAG’s parlance for the trial, OCTs 4, 7, 11 and 12 were all Knock-Out Timing Options.   </p>

If this reflects the position in 2007, SHI is right in saying that they “popped up” with “sporadic” appearances in the same way that EDTs subsequently did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">At the end of June 2007 Mr Said was seeking to conclude two Correlation Swaps which, it is accepted by the experts, are not currency options but which Mr Said expressly referred to Mr Vik on 25th June, asking if Mr Vik had any questions about the trades.  The email explained the details and I have rejected Mr Vik’s evidence that he did not understand what he was being told.  He did and must be taken to have approved the conclusion of the trade which was in two parts.  Between them, Mr Walsh, Mr Giery, Mr Quezada and Mr Thaung exchanged emails and a hard coded trade level margin of 8% of notional appears to have resulted.  The correlation swaps do not seem to have appeared in GEM at all if the 2012 Reports accurately reflect the position in 2007 in this respect.  Nor did they appear in any of the disclosed manual P&amp;L spreadsheets prepared by Mr Walsh.  Any trade level margining would, for the reasons set out above, not have fed into GEM for SHI.  SHI accepts that not only was it likely that Mr Walsh told Mr Said that the Gated Range Accrual concluded in June 2007 would not be reported properly (as Mr Giery instructed Mr Walsh to tell him) but that Mr Said got used to the fact in 2007 that various types of OCTs would not appear in GEM at all.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">On 18th October 2007 Mr Said concluded transactions that are described as Fade-In Forwards but are probably better described as Pivot Accrual forwards.  CS referred to them as Pivot Accruals and DBAG referred to them as Resurrecting Fader call options.  These transactions constituted OCTs 16 and 18 (with CS) and OCTs 17 and 19 with DBAG.  As described by Mr Malik (and it will be recalled that the experts could not agree upon a description) each of the transactions that are described as Fade-in Forwards are made up of two components, each of which in turn is a combination of put and call options.  One component consists of the purchase of a call option and the sale of a put option at the same strike with a barrier (a pivot) at a higher level.  The other component has the same barrier or pivot but consists of the purchase of a put option and the selling of a call option at a strike higher than the pivot.  Together they constitute a Pivot Accrual Forward.  There is no knock-out feature in this and the investor with this combination of options accrues a gain for each fixing date when the FX price is within the range of the high and low strike prices, either side of the barrier or pivot.  The final payout is determined by reference to the accumulated gains on each fixing.  This is therefore effectively a bet by the investor that the FX price will stay within the range of the strike prices.  Professor Wystup, consistent with his view, saw these transactions as a combination of two forwards, rather than options, but that explanation does not account for the profits and losses which accrue by reference to the pivot or barrier and the high and low strike prices.  Only Mr Malik’s explanation adequately fits the pay-off and the form of the transaction thus demonstrates the nature of the embedded options within it.  It was to these transactions that Mr Said was later to make reference when first concluding the TPFs and telling Mr Walsh of DBAG about them.   </p>

He asked Mr Avery if the risk could be captured for this trade, setting out the essential details of it as a one month EUR/NOK Pivot Accrual with 23 fixing dates, the upper strike, the lower strike and the pivot level.  He chased for a response the following day.  Although there is no record of any direct response, it appears from an exchange between Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh on 20th and 22nd October that Mr Avery confirmed that the risk could be captured because it was a “Resurrecting Fader option” even though the subject matter of the email exchange appears as an American Reverse Knock-Out (OCT20).  OCT20 could not be described as a Resurrecting Fader – it was simply a Knock-Out Currency Option and it appears that Mr Walsh was confusing the issue but was in fact referring to the Pivot Accruals/Fade-in Forwards.  As will be seen, when a list of trade types which could be valued in ARCS VaR was forwarded by Mr Avery on 30th November, it included FX Resurrecting Fader options although, as was to appear in a further email exchange relating to TPFs, the system could not cope with Resurrecting Faders which had a large number of observation dates or fixings.  As OCT16 and OCT18 had 23 such fixings, it is not clear whether that in itself constituted a problem. </p>

They were  booked as FX Resurrecting Fader options which should have fed through to ARCS VaR and GEM.  The confirmation which Mr Geisker sent to Mr Said who forwarded it to Mr Walsh described the transactions as Resurrecting Faders.  Mr Walsh referred, in a conversation with Mr Giery, to the booking of what were presumably the CS Resurrecting Faders as “a nightmare”.   </p>

He told Mr Chapin that if DBAG gave him “any stick”, he would take out a bigger stick, with Mr Chapin commenting that “you are good at that”.

He said that there had since been a few of them but never more than two or three outstanding at any time and none were ever an issue as <span style="font-style:italic">Structured Options</span> were provided for in the FXPBA.

Mr Walsh in his evidence said he did not know why it was necessary to do that but he thought that PWM could determine trade level margining.  It must have been Mr Quezada who raised this but Mr Said understood the position perfectly well.  In an email from him to Mr Walsh he enclosed the term sheet for the Forward Volatility Agreement stating that the notional size of the underlying straddle equated to a P&amp;L exposure of €1 million per one percentage point move in the forward volatility curve and that “your margin guys may want to know that”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is thus plain that, in this particular instance, DBAG accepted the Forward Volatility Agreement as a Structured Option on the basis of applying trade level margining.  That of course DBAG was entitled to do.  DBAG was entitled to decline to take in any Structured Option under the FXPBA but if it decided to do so it could impose such terms as Mr Said was prepared to agree.  If a trade was not capable of being margined in ARCS VaR, for whatever reason, it was open to DBAG to say that the only basis upon which the trade would be accepted would be if SHI would accept trade level margining.  There would then of course be an issue as to how the trade level margin would be added into the VaR figure for the rest of the portfolio but, assuming that could be achieved, and however cumbersome it might be, it should not have been beyond the wit of man to achieve it.  There was no reason why that should not have been agreed between them.  What, if anything, happened to the trade level margining that was imposed here, is unclear, since it would ordinarily feature in Sentry which did not have any connection to GEM.  As appears from Mr Said’s Timeline, he anticipated that <span style="font-style:italic">Structured Options</span> would have to be dealt with separately from the automated systems, in terms of MTM and margin and no doubt that was the basis upon which the original discussion took place about DBAG not being swamped with such one offs.  It was for DBAG to work out how to aggregate VaR on the portfolio with trade level margin on individual trades which had been the subject of acceptance by DBAG on that basis.   </p>

It may be that it was this which caused Mr Quezada to enquire of Mr Avery as to the list of products which ARCS VaR could handle.  A list was sent to him on 30th November, so that, subject to identification of any particular trade alongside the names used by DBAG, Mr Quezada was then in a position to appreciate what could and what could not be the subject of DBAG’s VaR system.

Mr Walsh confirmed to GS, with whom the trade was done, that it would be taken in when GS questioned whether or not it was within the terms of the Counterparty Agreement.  Mr Walsh assumed in evidence that he must have obtained approval from Mr Quezada or Mr Giery since this was a new type of option so far as he was concerned.  There is a record of a telephone conversation between Mr Walsh and Mr Said on 2nd January in which Mr Said referred to a conversation which he had with Mr Walsh in which Mr Said had expressed surprise that DBAG’s system could not handle the trade and had been told by Mr Walsh that he would book it.  Mr Said pointed out in the January conversation that he could not see it anywhere and usually, even if it was not valued, it was visible as being booked.  Mr Walsh confirmed that it had been booked, saying in evidence that he must have checked in RMS, as the trade did not show in GEM Web Reporting.  There is no record in any of the 2012 Reports, nor in the manual spreadsheets sent to Mr Said of this trade at any stage.  In the telephone conversation Mr Walsh said that he could “manually get this one for you” and on being told that the Window Barrier should knock out on the 4th and that it became a simple option at that point, Mr Walsh said that he would “get you a mark on it” as it was just a vanilla transaction.  It was not of course just a vanilla transaction and there is no suggestion that Mr Walsh ever did give Mr Said a mark on it, unless by that he meant the cash settlement figure on knock-out.

Mr Walsh said he was unsure whether there was a product type for this in RMS and asked Mr Giery whether it could be taken in.  Mr Giery told him to speak to middle office to see if it could be booked.  Mr Walsh asked a member of the middle office team in London FXPB, who told him that the product type was a “Threefactor Discrete Double No Touch” option which had been booked in London in the past for </p>

On Mr Walsh forwarding this to Mr Giery, the latter asked if the trade was captured by VaR for that client and Mr Walsh then asked Mr Avery if VaR could capture the risk.  He was told that VaR could not cover the product and there was no suitable proxy.  Mr Giery then told Mr Walsh to ask how London had dealt with the matter for the London client and the answer came back that these types of trade were taken in if the client was buying (and therefore paying premium) or selling by closing out an open position.  As SHI was buying the option and the maximum loss was the premium which would be paid two days after the trade date, Mr Giery authorised the acceptance of it.  There were, in all, five Dual Currency Range Digital options concluded by Mr Said (OCTs 30, 37, 39, 50 and 51), none of which were properly recorded in RMS, GEM and Ethos, let alone in ARCS VaR.  As was evident to Mr Said, they were not on the GEM Web Reporting nor in the manual P&amp;L spreadsheets sent to him.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this background Mr Said entered into his first EDTs on 19th February 2008 with CS.  It was Mr Chapin who introduced him to the concept of TPFs, TARFs or TARNs as they were referred to by various entities.  He actively marketed the idea to Mr Said who then approached Mr Geisker and Mr Bergad of DBAG asking whether DBAG could price transactions of this kind.  He saw them as similar to the Pivot Accruals of October 2007 but with a target knock-out feature which in practice made for wider ranges between the high and low strikes.  This was the essential basis upon which Mr Said put the matter to Mr Walsh on 19th February seeking DBAG’s consent and saying that the cap on the maximum profit made the deals cheaper.  Mr Said explained further, when Mr Walsh suggested that the only real risk was the premium which he was paying, that there was more risk than that because it was a Pivot Accrual and he was “short of some options here”.  In other words he recognised that the TPFs involved the selling of options which meant that he could lose money on them.  He said that it was a very broad range trade but if there was a massive market move that did not revert, he would lose money unless he hedged, which he would do.  There was less risk than the Pivot Accruals because the knock-out assumed that the maturity was shorter.  Mr Walsh asked for the trade details as he needed to clear this with “business” meaning Mr Quezada or Mr Giery.   </p>

Mr Walsh told Mr Quezada that Mr Said had done one of these trades back in October as well (referring no doubt to the Pivot Accruals).  The indicative details set out the pivot, the high and low strike prices, the daily fixing, the target profit, the capped knock-out and the one year duration with 256 fixings.  Mr Quezada’s response was to say that, if it had been taken in before, Mr Walsh could go ahead but he should check with Graham Avery if VaR could capture the risk.  Mr Walsh then asked Mr Avery that question, stating that it was an FX Resurrecting Fader option, as if the trade was identical to OCTs 17 and 19, without referring to the target profit knock-out feature.  Mr Walsh had no recall of getting any reply from Mr Avery and there was no document evidencing a response.  Mr Walsh thought that he must have proceeded on the basis of Mr Quezada’s go ahead, even though he had no answer back from Mr Avery since, if he had received a response saying that the trades could not be captured by VaR, he would have referred the matter to Mr Quezada and Mr Giery once more.  </p>

When asked by her what kind of an option it was, he said that all that mattered was that the exercise/expiry was agreed and it did not matter how he booked it.  Although in evidence Mr Walsh said this was an exaggeration, it is plain that he thought that it was the cash settlements which were crucial, rather than the details of the trade itself.  In evidence he said he did not think he could book the knock-out elements of the TPFs on a Resurrecting Fader booking which was the form that he adopted for these TPFs and which was inappropriate for a number of reasons.  It seems that, generally speaking, when Mr Walsh booked pivot TPFs he booked them as four Resurrecting Fader Options and when he booked non-pivot TPFs he booked them as two Resurrecting Fader Options.  Being booked in this way meant that, insofar as they fed through to ARCS VaR on GEM, they did so incorrectly.  Some did not feed through at all, because, it was said at the time, of the huge number of fixings. </p>

DBAG would have been entitled to accept the Structured Options on terms requiring trade level margining if it chose to do so, or to refuse otherwise to take them in at all.  Presumably, Mr Quezada considered that CRM or PWM Credit would have no familiarity with these complex types of option and that the best source of margining was Mr Hutchings/Mr Geisker’s Trade Desk which was familiar with them because it sold and traded them.  All efforts were therefore directed to achieving trade level margining by reference to the Trade Desk in the course of 2008 when it was clear that GEM and ARCS VaR could not cope.  As appears elsewhere, from Mr Said’s Timeline, he always expected Structured Options to be dealt with outside DBAG’s MTM system, because he knew it could not handle them.   </p>

Once uploaded, RMS could generate a text file and the trader could attach a free-form file providing details describing the trade and explaining the pay out formula (a Generic Sales Ticket).  The trades, he understood, required monitoring because the cash flows were “path dependent” and accrued on the fixing dates.  Without access to the tools used by the traders to monitor the ongoing life-cycle of TPFs, daily cash flows would have to be tracked manually to determine whether the trade had knocked out and whether payments needed to be made.  Although DBAG’s FX traders and the Trade Management Group had access to DB Analytics Securities, in 2008 FXPB client services did not.

His immediate reaction was to tell Mr Walsh that he believed that he should speak to SHI and claim the cancellation of those TPFs and he should not accept any more TPFs if they could not be properly booked.  He forwarded the term sheets to Ms Ogilvie, to whom he was accountable and she sent them on to Mr Kim, the manger of the FXPB Operations Team.  In her email, she referred to a conversation which she had had with Mr Kim, enclosed the term sheets and stated that they represented TPFs which required a GST to be booked because Ethos could not fully support the product type.  If the trades were booked incorrectly, the correct confirmations could not be sent out to the client or the Counterparty.  Mr Kim said he did not follow up on this email and told the Court that his concern was purely from an operational perspective, as was that of Ms Ogilvie and Mr Manrique.  Ms Ogilvie’s concern was that she could not create confirmations which was her responsibility, because the information in Ethos/RMS would not be adequate for it and the trade required a GST.  Mr Kim said he was not aware until sometime later that the TPFs had been booked as Resurrecting Faders which meant that Mr Walsh had booked four records in respect of each trade, as had been done for the Pivot Accruals/Fade-in Forwards.   </p>

He said that these had to be kept out of the live MTM module because the system could not handle it and was giving silly numbers.  He attached a copy of the trade terms for EDT 3.  Two days later he entered into EDT 4 which he explained was really no more than an increase on the previous deal that needed to be treated separately for booking purposes.  In an instant messaging chat with Ms Ng, Mr Walsh said that he was booking Pivot Accruals.  He did not think that DBAG could take them in but he still booked them because he did not want to say no to Mr Said.  He told her that Mr Manrique was telling him that DBAG was having trouble confirming with the Counterparty because RMS could not handle the options type.  He told Ms Ng that he was telling Mr Manrique to sign off on it but the reason that they had trouble issuing confirmations was because all the details of the trade could not be fed into RMS because there was not an appropriate field for them.  He was having trouble booking them and kept changing things but the notional was US$768 million, as calculated by him.

The response was to say that he should not be taking them in and that the only way properly to book the trades would be through a spreadsheet to which FXPB should not have access and for which it did not have the infrastructure.  A “fudge” booking was a possibility but the author of the email said that he did not have time to look at the term sheet and find the best fix for the moment.  Mr Walsh replied by saying that the trades had already been taken in and that the same trade type had been taken in in the previous year.

From a later chat it appears that Mr Walsh could not bring himself to talk to Mr Quezada about it and so he was thinking of quitting that day because of the SHI issues.  Despite further chasing by Mr Manrique on 4th April, saying that the EDTs needed to be cleared away on Monday 7th, by 4.30 pm that day Mr Walsh had still not spoken to Mr Quezada and was expressing the desire to Ms Ng to speak to Mr Said to find out if SHI could hold the trades directly with the Counterparty or whether he would have to cancel them.  He hoped to be able to “bullshit” Mr Said by telling him that CS would not agree to the confirmations.  He emailed Mr Said asking him to call, which he duly did.  In the telephone conversation Mr Walsh asked if the trades could be concluded directly with CS or whether they had to be put through the Prime Brokerage system and Mr Said told him that he had no other way of trading them because he had no documentation set up with CS and everything he did had to go through the FXPBA.  Mr Walsh said that there were problems with confirmation details and if it was possible to move the trades to CS those problems could be avoided.  Mr Said then said that, touch wood, the first TPF would probably be gone within ten days and as the trades were all exactly the same, the documentation should be clear.  Once the knock-out event occurred, the deal was finished and off the books so that all that would be left would be the unwind.

Ms Ng told him to call Mr Quezada before the situation got worse to which he responded that he had checked with Mr Quezada on the trade date in respect of all of the trades, or at least he thought he had.  She told him to call him up, tell him that he approved the trades but they could not be booked and ask him what to do.  He referred then to a Bloomberg chat which he had with Mr Manrique earlier in the day when the latter had said there were two options.  Either Mr Walsh got someone from the front office to book it or the deal could not be taken in.  In that conversation he had told Mr Manrique of his hope that Mr Said might do the trade directly with CS but Mr Said’s comments had now ruled out that solution.   </p>

FXPB in London however did not agree.  Both EDT 3 and EDT 4 had knocked out but London was questioning why the trades still existed in the knock-out queue since they were incapable of being booked, save by DB Analytics.  Although Mr Manrique suggested that the problem had been resolved by knock-out, that there were notes within RMS booking which allowed for a proper audit trail and the confirmations were being sent for the business manager to sign off, London wanted to know whether FXPB was going to accept TPFs in the future and how it was going to book them when the risk could not be captured by bookings as Resurrecting Faders.  Mr Walsh’s response was to say that the Counterparty confirmations would be signed off by business to clear outstanding unconfirmed trades and in the future each trade would be examined and signed off by business (Mr Quezada/Mr Giery) on a one off basis before acceptance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the direct trades, EDT 05 and EDT 06, Mr Walsh asked Mr Geisker to book the trades directly to SHI’s account, giving a Counterparty code.  Mr Chin, rather than Mr Geisker, carried out the booking with DB Analytics, so that it appeared in RMS but, for reasons given elsewhere, this did not feed downstream.  On these direct trades DBAG, like other banks selling the product to SHI, provided spreadsheets showing the accruing profits and losses on the fixing dates.As the DBAG systems could not, for the most part, cope with OCTs, so also they could not cope with EDTs.  The trade details of TPFs could not be captured by the use of the Resurrecting Fader proxy and Mr Said knew from the outset (see the email dated 28th February 2008) that the system could not handle the TPFs and gave silly numbers for their MTM.  Mr Walsh’s evidence was that Mr Said wanted the trades removed or the MTM zeroed out so that his overall MTM figure was not distorted by the inclusion of such silly numbers.  Mr Said specifically asked him to remove from the manual spreadsheets the MTM values of the EDTs booked as Resurrecting Faders in RMS and also wanted him to ensure that MTM values for those transactions did not appear in the report showing MTMs for individual trades on GEM Web Reporting itself.  Mr Walsh had no control over the latter, in so far as the booking of a trade as a Resurrecting Fader, whether in four component legs or otherwise, would give rise to whatever figures the programmes produced.  If a trade was not booked into GEM, then of course no figures would appear.  Mr Walsh did not have a precise recollection as to whether Mr Said wanted him to remove all references to the transaction from the Web reports and manual spreadsheets or whether he simply wanted him to ensure that the MTM valuations would appear as zero.  His best recollection was that Mr Said requested one or the other in their conversations and that he did both from time to time.  Because of the absence of appropriate fields in which to record the details of the TPFs and Pivot TPFs, any proxy booking as a Resurrecting Fader was obviously inadequate and, to the extent that a trade was booked as a Resurrecting Fader, common sense suggests that it would be likely to generate some MTM or margin figure.  The only way to avoid that potential issue of production of silly numbers was not to book the trade at all until knock out and cash settlement.  That appeared to be what Mr Said wanted when he requested removal of the trade or zeroing out of the false MTMs.   </p>

In consequence the existence of these direct trades (six in all) never featured in GEM Web Reporting at all, although DBAG’s Trade Desk sent Mr Said accrual sheets on each fixing date for them.  On 28th April Mr Said wanted to conclude a Pivot TPF with MS and this gave rise to a Bloomberg chat between Ms Greenberg and Ms Wu, the latter of whom opened the conversation by saying she had spoken to Options (by which she presumably meant Mr Manrique) who said that this was a TPF and that it should not be taken in because it could not be booked without access to GSTs and DB Analytics which FXPB did not have.  Unless the Trade Desk was prepared to book it, it could not be taken in but she had been told that a trade of this kind had been taken in by DBAG in the past.  She thought that Mr Walsh just took it in without asking anybody but Options said that it was booked incorrectly and was a mess.  Ms Wu and Ms Greenberg agreed that if it was a TPF, it would not be taken in.  Internal emails within MS showed that DBAG was saying that the trade was too exotic for the Operations people to handle and reliance was being placed by MS on the fact that Mr Said had told them that he had entered into such transactions with other banks in the past and with the DBAG Trade Desk.  Further discussion within DBAG on 29th April suggests that Ms Greenberg was talking to Mr Quezada or Mr Giery about it and Mr Walsh told Ms Wu that they had been taken in as one-offs in the past though they could not be properly booked in RMS and Options Operations was displeased about that.  Mr Walsh said that Mr Quezada had approved them in the past even though Options had told them to cancel the trades.  Mr Walsh said that Mr Said had sent him the CS TPF (EDT 7) the previous Friday and asked if he should say that it could not be taken in either but the decision was taken to await the result of Ms Greenberg’s discussions with Business.  On the same day Mr Walsh emailed Mr Avery asking if ARCS VaR could margin/value the CS TPF executed on 24th April (EDT 7).  There is no record of an email response but in a further Bloomberg chat, Mr Walsh stated that day that Mr Avery had said that the options were being valued and margined on the existing bookings (which were as Resurrecting Faders).  Mr Walsh, in that chat, said that the only details that could not be booked were the knock-out levels which he thought would have the effect of reducing the risk.  Discussions continued between Ms Greenberg, Ms Wu and Mr Walsh with reference to the need for Mr Kim, Mr Quezada and Mr Giery to make a decision as to whether the MS options would be taken in.  Ms Greenberg commented that Mr Quezada did not know how to say no to Mr Said because TPFs had been taken in in the past.  Further conversation between Mr Walsh and Ms Ng revealed that the trade could not be properly booked anywhere by FXPB and that the Trade Desk would have to book it which it was not thought it would ever be prepared to do.  MS were told by Mr Walsh that DBAG would be unable to take the trade because it was not covered in the Counterparty Agreement but the evidence shows that the real reason was the perceived inability properly to book the trade.  Mr Walsh said he would have sent this email on instructions from someone else and it appears that this was Mr Kim’s stance while Mr Quezada took a different view.  It was unclear how it was that the MS trade was declined but the CS trade was accepted and Mr Walsh had no recollection of the reasons for that, though it may have reflected either disagreement or a compromise between Mr Quezada and Mr Kim.  At all events Mr Walsh was asked to go down to Wall Street to ask for the assistance of Mr Chin to book the CS trade and to be trained in doing it himself.  That never happened because the Trade Desk refused to help in booking the trade for FXPB in circumstances where it had quoted for the business with Mr Said but he had gone elsewhere with it to another bank.  The Trade Desk did not want to assist DBAG’s competitors in doing business with SHI.  The difficulties were then touched on during part of the conversation on 2nd May between (inter alia) Mr Quezada, Mr Giery, Mr Spokoyny and others to which reference is made in the previous section of this judgment.  This all led to the 5th May telephone conversation between Mr Quezada, Mr Said and Mr Walsh, the details of which are set out in the section of this judgment dealing with Mr Said’s trading and his evidence relating thereto.  In short, Mr Said told Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh that he was not concerned about getting MTMs on the TPFs and agreed to DBAG taking them in without being able to report that information.  He told them there was nothing to do on the trades from an administrative point of view save on knock-out or maturity whilst margin issues were a matter for DBAG and, if it was ever concerned about that, SHI would over-collateralise.  It was following that call that, on 6th May, Mr Walsh, at Mr Quezada’s instigation, sought confirmation from Mr Avery that EDT 1 (an indirect CS TPF) and EDT 6 (a direct trade with DBAG) were both being margined.  The response was that neither was being valued in the system, the first because of the number of fixings and the second because it was booked on a generic sales ticket and was not valued by RMS or any of the downstream systems.  Neither Mr Quezada nor Mr Walsh informed Mr Said of Mr Avery’s response but since Mr Said regarded margining as a matter for DBAG, and accepted that he was getting inaccurate MTM figures upon which he placed no reliance, there was no reason for them to do so.  Mr Quezada however might have been expected to inform others who were considering the question of the adequacy of the VaR calculation at the time for Mr Said’s trades, in particular Mr Giery who sat next to him in the office and had been involved in those discussions (see the section of this judgment relating to The VaR Parameters).  </p>

Mr Said was obviously conscious of DBAG’s booking, valuing and margining difficulties when making this request.  Mr Quezada told Mr Said to go ahead, stating that it would give him “the fire power” that he needed to have the Trade </p>

Mr Quezada emailed Mr Hutchings of the Trade Desk referring to the Direct Trade and stating that Mr Said had said he needed to be able to conduct such trades with other banks through FXPBA and if FXPBA could not oblige, he would not trade with DBAG at all.  Mr Said also put pressure on the desk, telling Mr Quezada that he had made it clear that unless the PB desk got a pricing tool, direct trades with DBAG would stop.  He continued to apply pressure, according to emails of 21st May and 3rd June, and then concluded another TPF (EDT 11) with DBAG on 4th June.  These efforts to gain access to DB Analytics came to nothing because, it appears, the Trade Desk maintained its stance that, if it were to assist the PB desk by providing the pricing tool and/or training a member of FXPB in its use, the effect would be to improve the position of its competitors vis-à-vis itself.  Although Mr Quezada appears to have met with Mr Hutchings, although Mr Geisker made some suggestions for solving the “[K]laus problems” and although there was a suggestion of interim solutions pending a “longer term [RMS] solution”, nothing came of this.  It was not until about 17th October 2008 after most or all of the margin calls had been made that indirect EDTs were booked as such in RMS using the DB Analytics system.On 21st May Mr Said asked if he could conclude a TPF with GS and subsequently sent an email to Mr Walsh saying that he had received Mr Quezada’s approval.  GS was informed by Mr Walsh that such trades were accepted as <span style="font-style:italic">Structured Options</span> on a one-off basis.  This 21st May trade with GS was only booked by Mr Walsh on knock-out on 23rd June.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">From hereon this appears to have become the pattern of action or inaction by Mr Walsh.  Trade confirmations would be received from Mr Said and the Counterparty and he would print off copies which would then sit on his desk but he would not book the trades in DBAG’s systems, unless there was some particular trigger to do so such as a Counterparty requiring confirmation of a trade.  On knock-out, Mr Walsh would book the trade in his standard manner for Resurrecting Faders with a cash settlement.  This kept the silly numbers out of the MTMs that Mr Said was receiving, which was what Mr Said wanted.On 28th May Mr Walsh provided Mr Quezada with a list of the exotic trade types that Mr Said had executed, including Correlation Swaps, Resurrecting Faders, Gated Range Accruals, Pivot Target Accruals, Dual Binary Options and Double No Touch Options.  Mr Quezada asked him to check with Graham Avery to see if ARCS VaR captured all those trade types in order to frame a request for the use of DB Analytics in relation to those which could not be captured.  Mr Walsh replied by saying that there were two trade types that could not be completely valued in accordance with the way they were booked because not all the details could be entered, whilst the others could be valued and margined by ARCS VaR.  The two in question were the Gated Range Accrual and the Pivot Target Accrual.  Whilst Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh hoped to resolve the booking and margining issue by use of DB Analytics, London FXPB returned to the issue on finding that EDT 02 had not been processed.  It appears that CS had not produced the Counterparty confirmation.  This led to FXPB in London taking the matter up with Mr Kim by asking him if he was aware of these TPF trades and asking how FXPB could agree to take them in.  Mr Byrne in London commented: “This trade type is one of the most structured types of business we are currently supporting on the franchise side, and there is no way PB can accurately book or monitor this trade type.  Apparently the business is signing off on these when we receive CS confirmation, although this does not alter the fact that the trade is not accurately captured in RMS.”At about the same time Mr Cook of IT responded to Mr Walsh’s email of 21st May in which he asked how to obtain access to DB Analytics in circumstances where FXPB had previously been fudging the booking of some complex options.  Mr Walsh asked what had to be done in order to capture the risks and margin the trades.  On 5th June the reply was received telling him that the trade types he was talking about were complex risk trades which were generally booked and managed by the Complex Risk Group and were booked externally through RMS in Excel and uploaded as free text entries into RMS.  Questions of who would book the deals, who would manage the risk, who would provide valuations (which were generally done manually) and how margin would be done outside of RMS all arose.  There was therefore a business process to be gone through as between PB and FX business managers.  Mr Quezada’s response was to state in an email to Mr Cook, Mr Walsh, Mr Hutchings and Mr Geisker that FXPB wanted to have the ability to book the trades in the same way as the Trade Desk and that initially use could be made of the latter’s expertise with risk management effected by the Complex Risk Team on that desk.  He said that valuations were not critical to the client and manual valuations would be sufficient.  He understood that ARCS VaR could capture many of the structures but, if not, margin would have to be captured manually.  He wanted to know who could arrange FXPB’s set up to have access to DB Analytics.  Mr Kim, following receipt of Mr Byrne’s email, asked who had agreed to take the trades in, whereupon Mr Walsh told him that Mr Quezada had signed off on these trades after discussing them with SHI.  He said that he and Mr Quezada were working on a way to book the trades in the future and Mr Quezada was aware of the risk/valuation problems but there was no choice but to leave the trades booked as they were because they did not yet have access to the necessary RMS functions for booking the trade types.  Mr Kim’s response was to say that he needed to approve new trades, not Mr Quezada, and that he needed to explain to FX management why the trade had been taken in and to ask for the trade details to be sent to him.  Mr Walsh then said he would send over the details but the trades were those which had been discussed in April and booked in February.  Whilst saying that he would speak to Mr Quezada to explain that Mr Kim did not want to take the trades in, he asked him to speak directly to Mr Quezada as well.  Mr Walsh then sent details of EDT 1 and EDT 2 alone to Mr Kim and none of the other eight that had by this stage been executed and three of which remained unbooked.  FX Operations in London had picked up on EDT 09 with GS because of contact with them by the latter and there then followed email exchanges between London and Mr Kim about the continued acceptance of such trades and the need to “push back” and not accept them in the future, whilst trying to decide what was to be done with those which had already been accepted.  It was agreed that all future trades should be handled in New Jersey as opposed to London in order to avoid confusion.  619.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Mr Kim’s evidence was that, as at 4th June, EDT 09 with GS, concluded on 21st to 23rd May, had not yet been booked and he was told by Mr Beels, his equivalent in London, that the only way to book it was with DB Analytics to which FXPB had no access.  He had ascertained from Ms Ogilvie or Mr Manrique that drafting confirmations for these TPFs would take 3-4 hours each.  He was concerned about booking and about matching and settlement.  He intended to speak to Mr Quezada but at the end of the day the issue of approving the trades was a matter for the business side, namely Mr Quezada.  Operations would have to manage the result of any decision taken.  His evidence was that he did not want to take these trades in at all and contemporaneous records of conversations of others suggested that he was furious at Mr Walsh and Mr Quezada’s decision, which effectively by-passed him.  As recorded in an email, Mr Kim was told by Mr Walsh that each one of these trades was approved by Mr Quezada before execution.  Mr Kim’s evidence was that after 4th </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">June he spoke with Mr Quezada in perhaps three different conversations in which he was told that SHI wanted to do the transactions, that FXPB had to take them in because the client wanted it, the Sales Desk did them and SHI was saying that if DBAG could trade them directly, SHI should be able to do so through FXPB.  Mr Quezada said he was seeking to obtain access to DB Analytics and GST.  He also assured him that SHI was aware that DBAG could not book these trades properly and that there were valuation and margining issues which went with that.  Mr Kim’s response was to say that the numbers had to be limited whilst waiting for the DB Analytics solution, because the operations team could not handle many of these transactions which took a great deal of time on a manual basis.  There was a discussion about charging US$1,200-1,500 per transaction for this reason, a figure which was agreed with SHI and subsequently charged.  The transcript of a telephone call between Mr Kim and Mr Quezada on 4th June is consistent with Mr Kim’s evidence with reference to the pressure being exerted by Mr Said on the Trade Desk in telling that desk that if they wanted to sell him TPFs, they had to allow him to “trade away”, through FXPB, with other banks.  He said that Mr Said had agreed to do whatever he could to minimise any of the difficulties and play within any constraints DBAG wanted to put upon him apart from telling him that he could not do the trades at all.  If DBAG could not figure out a way to do the trades through FXPB, he would shut down the franchise and move all the business.  The effect of what Mr Quezada was saying was that DBAG had little choice but to accept the business.  Margin and risk was not much of an issue because SHI was over-collateralised and was willing to put up whatever additional margin was needed.  “Some of [those] pivot things” did not get marked on VaR.  Mr Quezada said he would produce something on paper and asked Mr Kim to tell him in response if he did not feel comfortable with it and tell him what else could be done to alleviate his concerns.  Mr Kim’s concern, as expressed, was the pressure he was receiving from London.  On 6th June Mr Quezada sent an email to Mr Hutchings and Mr Geisker of the Trade Desk and to Mr Kim and Mr Walsh.  The email commenced with Mr Quezada saying that he needed “to put a full court press on this” (a basketball reference to an aggressive defensive tactic in which the members of the team cover their opponents over the full court).  </p>

In the first he asked how the Trade Desk currently margined the trades done by SHI with it, or for similar hedge fund clients.  He spoke of the need to sit down with Credit to determine consistent/proper haircuts.  The second point was to ask how valuations were being handled for SHI whilst the third point said that “[f]or starters” access was needed to “the book” from the PB side, by which was meant DB Analytics, as used by the Trade Desk.   </p>

There does not appear to have been any great sense of urgency about progressing this matter and Mr Kim’s evidence was that he anticipated it might take six months to gain access to DB Analytics which is why he wanted a limit on the volume of trades accepted.  He told the Court that as long as it was no more than five trades in a week it would be acceptable.  He simply wanted to limit the number of TPFs taken on so as not to put a strain on the Options confirmation team in doing the business manually, taking term sheets, matching them, issuing confirmations and settling the trades.  As far as he was concerned, it was a matter for Mr Quezada to deal with the downstream points of valuation and margining, about which he had given him assurances.  Mr Walsh appeared resigned to the position and booked EDT 09 on knockout on 25th June 2008 (it had been traded on 21st May 2008) a practice that he largely then adopted for other EDTs.   </p>

Mr Said was told that DBAG’s margining for TPFs was based on those numbers, which Mr Said recognised as “chaotic”.  He said that more collateral could always be provided.  Details of this conversation appear elsewhere in this judgment.  Mr Said continued to trade EDTs seeking DBAG’s consent to do so but knowing that no solution had been found to the booking issue and that many bookings were not being made on GEM (nor appeared on the manual spreadsheets) until knock out, as compared with the Accrual Spreadsheets that he received on each fixture date.

He said that he did not give his approval but it was not needed as a result of his discussions with Mr Quezada.  On 16th September however Mr Manrique asked Mr Kim to sign off on the use of Counterparty term sheets for generating Confirmations as a form of GST in respect of ten TPFs which were concluded between April and August, five of which had already knocked-out.  At that stage, if not before, it must have been obvious to Mr Kim that these TPFs had not been booked in the system contemporaneously.  The exact numbers of unbooked trades would of course not be known to anyone except Mr Walsh who kept a pile of confirmations on his desk until October.  Once they were booked in RMS, they would be open to sight by anyone with access to the system and, as part of his role, would have been picked up by Mr Manrique if not his superiors in Operations.   </p>

He did not recall how that had been resolved but from June to October he saw a number of TPFs when they knocked-out and were booked the same day.  He assumed that there had been resolution as the deals kept coming through and, because there were not large numbers involved, he did not think much of it.  It was odd to have settlements appearing on the days when trades were booked with an earlier date specified as the date of the deal.  It was obvious then to him that the deals had not been booked earlier.  Until a trade was booked he knew nothing of its existence, whereas if it was booked inaccurately he would see it and might take action.  If a Counterparty sent a confirmation, he would raise the matter with Mr Walsh and a trade would then be booked but otherwise, he could see that trades were being booked on cash settlement but had no knowledge of how many were in the pipeline until October.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The evidence shows that the GEM system was capable of dealing only with swaps, forwards, cash trades, vanilla options and single barrier options, as Mr Giery’s statement said.  The definition of “Structured Option” in the FXPBA tallies with this, inasmuch as it is expressed negatively by reference to options which are not put or call options without special features or single barrier options.  Mr Said appreciated this as his October 2008 Timeline reveals.  He refers there to “several non-standard Structured Options (defined in the PB agreement) as basically a catch-all of options that the automated deal capture and MTM system of DB could not handle.”  So it was that, towards the end of 2007, when asking DBAG for details of OCT4 and OCT12, he referred to them as being “offline”.  As SHI submitted, in its closing submissions, when he referred to “an offline deal” he meant that the trade details were not readily available to him from any of the DBAG systems.  SHI accepts that not only was it likely that Mr Walsh told Mr Said that the Gated Range Accrual concluded in June 2007 would not be reported properly (as Mr Giery instructed Mr Walsh to tell him) but that Mr Said got used to the fact in 2007 that various types of OCTs would not appear in GEM at all.   </p>

Between August 2007 and October 2007 the data which represented the starting point for the spreadsheets came from the same account whose details were available to Mr Said through Web Reporting, save for one date when it appears to have been based on the P&amp;L Reporting Account which was the internal account created with NOP MTMs.  Between November 2007 and February 2008 four of the eight spreadsheet reports were based on the account viewable through Web Reporting system and four on the P&amp;L Reporting Account for the corresponding dates.  Between May 2008 and August 2008 the spreadsheets were based on the P&amp;L Reporting Account for the relevant date.  On eight particular days between August 2007 and August 2008 however, there were multiple versions of the same spreadsheet, some of which were based on the Web Reporting system and some on the P&amp;L Reporting Account. </p>

Five OCTs (two Digital options, two Fade-in Forwards (Resurrecting Faders) and one Knock-Out Timing option) were in the Web Reporting system but not in the P&amp;L Reporting Account.  So far as EDTs are concerned, whilst it should be borne in mind that nine TPFs were booked between October 7th and 9th, there is only one TPF booked as a Resurrecting Fader option which appears in the Web Reporting system but does not appear in the P&amp;L Reporting Account.  Each TPF was booked with a set of two or four trade entries constituting the single transaction and given a single structure ID.  A new version of each trade entry was generally created every working day to reflect the daily fixing schedule.   </p>

The discrepancies between the GEM Web Reporting system, whether the Open P&amp;L Account or the Trade Details (Outstanding Trades) Account and the P&amp;L Reporting Account were unexplained but Deloitte did not consider that the fact that the P&amp;L Reporting Account operated by reference to NOP methodology explained the difference.   </p>

When this report is now run for historical dates, it displays either zero or N/A for MTM figures in respect of a number of positions held in the FXPB account.  Deloitte’s investigations with DBAG have led to the conclusion that where there was no valuation feed to GEM, “N/A” was displayed: where there was a timing issue with the valuation feed to GEM (because of a delay causing the valuation to be received in respect of a particular trade version) the valuation showed as “zero”.  Both these types of entry were therefore the product of the feed of valuations from ARCS VaR to GEM, not of any changes made to the underlying structured data held in GEM.  The History of Collateral Summary report available in GEM Web Reporting shows the daily end of day Available CMV Amount but this shows as zero as a result of a system wide coding change which affected the historical reports for all clients margined on a VaR basis.  The date of that change is unknown.  In the Collateral Summary Report, however, the latest Current Credit Exposure appears, which is a calculation of the open MTM valuation of all positions in the account, which feeds from ARCS VaR and displays as the “Available CMV Amount”.  Those end of day CCE calculations fed from ARCS VaR are retained in the GEM database and have been disclosed whereas the zero figures in the Historical Report are not recorded in the GEM database but are generated within the Report at the point when the Historical Report is run.    </p>

At the end of the day I do not think that matters, in the light of the critical evidence.  Taken overall, there is no doubt that the DBAG systems were not designed to cope with the Structured Options and could not do so.  That Mr Said knew and understood, although he would not have understood the reasons for the faders “popping up” with spurious MTM numbers sporadically from time to time, nor why figures differed between accounts, if he noticed that they did.  He did appreciate that the trade details of the EDTs and most of the OCTs could not be captured and that any MTM or margining was therefore inevitably askew.  Mr Said knew that he was not getting accurate reports on the EDTs or their MTMs but his only concern was to ensure that they did not distort the MTM figures in respect of his other trades.  It was the accrual spreadsheets, which he got from Counterparty banks on the indirect TPFs and from DBAG on the direct TPFs, on which he relied in assessing his position and risk in respect of the EDTs.  As appears hereafter, he told Mr Walsh that he wanted the EDTs removed or the MTM zeroed out of the figures supplied to him by DBAG whether by way of web reporting or manual spreadsheet, which could only achieved by not booking them at all and removing them manually from the spreadsheets if they were booked.  He did not look to MTM figures for risk management of his EDTs because he regarded them as accrual trades.  Margin was a matter for DBAG to sort out for its own protection and he did not regard the GEM system as a risk management tool.   </p>

He remained on Mr Vik’s company’s payroll until about June 2009, having told Mr Vik that he would work for him for free in an attempt to recoup the losses suffered as a result of his trading in 2008.

I have found that the surest guide to the accuracy of that testimony is, as might well be expected, the content of the contemporary documents, including in particular the emails passing between Mr Said, Mr Vik and DBAG personnel, transcripts of telephone conversations recorded by DBAG and the immediate reactions of those involved when issues came to a head in October 2008.  Additionally, there are Bloomberg chats which throw light on the contemporary events.  When these matters are considered in the light of the motivation which can readily be ascribed to those involved, I have not found it difficult to determine where the truth lies in what Mr Said has said on the critical issues between the parties.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">One factor stands out.  When, in October 2008, DBAG made substantial margin calls of SHI, Mr Said did not blame DBAG in any respect for the losses sustained in his trading, nor suggest that DBAG had hidden anything from him in its accounting, valuing and margining, nor that the margin calls were inappropriate.  It is clear that he had substantial discussions with Mr Vik in October and that the margin calls made between 13th and 17th October were all paid.  On more than one occasion Mr Said said that there was no-one to blame for the losses incurred other than himself and the one in one hundred years market conditions he had encountered.  In the middle of that week Mr Vik started to ask questions about DBAG’s prior margining, but there was not a hint of any suggestion from him that Mr Said’s trades were unauthorised, that there had been an agreed limit of US$35 million for SHI’s liability, or that Mr Said had been left in ignorance about his trading positions and would have acted entirely differently if DBAG had provided him with the MTM and margin information of which complaint is now made.  By that time, in fact by sometime in the preceding week, if not earlier, he knew what Mr Said knew about DBAG’s failures to value margin and report thereon.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover Mr Said drafted a “Timeline of Dealings with Prime Brokerage”, running to five pages, covering the position from September 2006 to October 2008, which he said he produced some time in October 2008 for the benefit of SHI’s lawyers and which therefore might be expected to put the best face on his and SHI’s position.  The contemporaneous documents are reflected more closely in that Timeline than in his affidavits in the New York proceedings.  When asked in his depositions by SHI’s lawyers how it was that, in his depositions he was saying that he had told Mr Vik about the different types of Structured Options that he conducted before he did them, whereas in paragraph 23 of his third affidavit he had maintained the opposite, he said that, in his affidavit, he had “[m]ade a mistake … [d]idn’t read it carefully enough.  … It’s just not correct.  I don’t have a good … I think the military answer would be no excuse.”  At the time of swearing those affidavits in April and May 2009, Mr Said was working with SHI’s lawyers and he explained in his deposition that he did not personally draft the affidavits and did not remember reviewing any emails or other documents in conjunction with them at all.  What Mr Said was there saying was that he was effectively acting under orders when swearing the affidavits (“the military answer”) and that the affidavits were drafted for him, doubtless by SHI’s lawyers.   </p>

It is suggested that, following his affidavits, DBAG’s lawyer made contact with Mr Said, suggested that SHI was depicting him as a “rogue trader” and asked him if he was prepared to meet him.  Mr Said refused to do that and subsequently instructed his own lawyer for the purpose of the depositions.  I cannot see how this provides any sort of an explanation for the change in stance adopted by Mr Said in his depositions, as compared to the affidavit, nor any explanation for the differences between his affidavits and the earlier Timeline, which was originally claimed to be a privileged document but which was the subject of an order for disclosure by the New York court.   </p>

When, in the context of a video-taped face-to-face deposition, witnesses are referred to, or have read, documents which tell a different story from that set out in a statement in writing, they are, naturally, more reluctant to uphold a position contradicted by those documents or not reflective of reality.   </p>

He therefore had no particular reason at the time of the depositions to take DBAG’s part in the dispute and, as far as he was able, he did support SHI’s case.

He had been Global Head of Foreign Exchange and Money Markets at CS for five years from 2001 to 2006, having previously worked at JP Morgan, rising to Global Head of Foreign Exchange, Short Term Rates Trading and Precious Metals between 1999 and 2001.  He knew how banks operated and knew how to put pressure on the employees of DBAG, including in particular Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh in the FXPB department.  It is plain from Bloomberg chats that he felt able to exert leverage on them by threatening to withdraw SHI’s business or putting them in bad odour with Mr Vik, an important billionaire customer of DBAG.  As appears hereafter, he was able to persuade them to take on trades that they were reluctant to accept.  He was also a good negotiator and was prepared to gild the lily when talking to others and seeking to persuade them to adopt a course of action more amenable to himself.  As any trader would, he kept his own records of trades and had his own pricing tool for vanilla transactions.  He could see market movements in spot trades, forwards and volatility.  He could check his own records against those of DBAG’s web reporting system at any given time and was able to point out errors in DBAG’s MTM calculations on both vanilla and exotic trades, when they did appear.

He then began to branch out into non-vanilla trades in the shape of OCTs and between February 2007 and July 2008 he traded in fifty-three OCTs and  fortyone EDTs (as they have subsequently been classified).  This still represented a relatively small proportion (11.7%) of his total trading in terms of numbers of trades.  Mr Said expressed his underlying trading philosophy for these non-vanilla trades on a </p>

Whilst there was a measure of volatility in the movement of currencies against one another, he saw the market as being essentially directionless in 2007/2008, particularly during the summer months, when he described the market as going “into hibernation”, an anomalous expression for the summer months.  He maintained that the only way to make any real money in such periods was to “short volatility” – in other words to enter into trades which amounted to a bet that currencies would not move against each other beyond certain limits, whilst they might move within them.  He described these as “range bets” or “range trades”.  He was betting against increases in volatility beyond the specified range in the individual transactions.  He considered some currencies to be mean reverting and although they might move out of the ranges specified from time to time, they would in the ordinary way come back within the limits of those ranges and under the terms of the trades he would make profits.  If therefore a trader was prepared to ride out the storm of temporary volatility and the losses incurred when currencies did move beyond the ranges, profits were there to be made because they would come back in, but a trader had to be prepared to hold onto the trades and treat them as accrual trades with the profits building up and offsetting the occasional loss.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Said thus perceived EDTs and other similar OCTs as good range bets.  They were zero cost options with no money to be paid up front and, where pivots were involved with a knock out feature, the latter had the effect of limiting the total profit made but, in those circumstances enabling the trader to obtain a wider range within which the currency could move with greater or lesser degrees of profit, without touching the upper and lower strike prices where losses would begin to accrue.  Such trades were not to be unwound because they were “buy and hold” trades and the unwinding of them would be prohibitively expensive.  At almost all stages they would be likely to be out of the money on a mark to market basis, right from the moment of the trade being done.  He regarded his position at SHI as giving him an advantage over banks or hedge funds because he did not have to respond to MTM movements in the way that they did.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that he fully understood how pivot TPFs worked and saw them as accrual trades.  He told Mr Vik that “you have to watch them like a hawk” and if they moved towards the range, they had to be hedged with either directional TPFs or with other pivot trades with a wider range (i.e. a higher or lower strike which would enable profits to continue to be made as the market moved further away from the pivot on the earlier trade and beyond the strike set in that trade).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">He knew in broad terms, because he said so, that the MTMs of TPFs were essentially negative at the outset and were generally negative throughout the duration of the TPF until knockout.  He knew also that the MTM related to the spot rate, the forward rate, and implied volatility – information on all of which was available to him on Bloomberg.  He also knew that losses could be substantial if the spot rate moved beyond the range and stayed there for any length of time.  It is self-evident that any competent trader would know that the notional on a TPF, whilst expressed on the basis of one fixing, depended upon the number of fixings for the trade, whether weekly or daily.  This is plain from any trade confirmation and the manner in which profits and losses accrued.  Mr Said’s deposition evidence and the email exchanges show that he was well aware that profit was limited by the knock out feature to the “target” figure in the TPF, whereas losses, as with any sale of an option, were indefinite and theoretically without limit up to the total notional.  It is clear that he knew the risks he was running in entering into these trades but considered that the substantial losses which ultimately occurred were extremely unlikely to eventuate.  He referred to that possibility as involving “the world [going] to hell in a hand basket”.  He therefore regarded the risk of losses of the magnitude which were ultimately suffered as so unlikely that it could be effectively discounted.  He was proved wrong by the events of the autumn of 2008 which he described as a “perfect storm” in which he was caught up.   </p>

It is true that there was built-up profit in the account which would have meaningfully INCREASED the margin capacity (see above).  DB pointed this out on a call to me.  However, much as he did in 2007, Alex did in the summer (I believe in July) withdraw 66mm$ from the account (a move I suggested to him given the cash was lying idle) which would have been substantially all the built up profit.

The Bank recommended and agreed that this would be accomplished by Sebastian Holdings, in connection with the opening of the New York FX PB Account, pledging as collateral the equivalent sum of $35,000,000 in a newly opened separate account of Sebastian Holdings with the Bank in Geneva, Switzerland and that the Bank in Switzerland would issue a guarantee against such account, in such amount to the New York FX PB Account to support the FX trading in New York.

Indeed, on two separate occasions, Sebastian Holdings transferred funds out of my account as such funds were not used to support my trading.

Several things should be noted: first, I often checked the "available" collateral on the Bank's website and found that I never got close to the limits.  At no time before October 2008 did the Bank inform me that the Bank had failed to include any trades in the collateral calculations.

Because my collateral was limited to $35,000,000, and Sebastian Holdings was not interested in increasing the pledge, this required me to reduce my trading positions.  No mention was made of pivot trades or the fact that by that time the Bank may have known about losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, all of which was unknown and unavailable to me and of course to Mr. Vik with whom, prior to mid-October 2008 I did not discuss my pivot trades. </p>

He was more than content to go along with that in order to use the prime brokerage to contract the EDTs and OCTs he desired.  He told DBAG personnel that MTM was of no consequence to him because he regarded these as accrual trades or “buy and hold trades” and it was the cash accruals of unrealised profits and losses to which he had regard.  As appears from his exchanges with individuals at counterparty banks and Mr Vik he knew that he was getting a “free ride” on margin because of DBAG’s inability to value the trades for a period of some 6-12 months and throughout the relevant period he was doing his best to keep the margin requirements down and was not in the slightest dependent upon either DBAG’s MTM valuations or its notification of margin requirements in conducting his own risk management. </p>

The key point is that, as discussed directly between DBAG personnel and Mr Said, he knew, because he was told as much, that the FXPB department did not have access and never obtained access to the MTM tools used by the DBAG Complex Options Trade Desk, namely DB Analytics, for valuing the EDTs.  He at one stage offered to help FXPB to gain access to DB Analytics by offering to do direct trades with the DBAG Trade Desk and suggesting that it should make the DB Analytics tool available to FXPB, failing which he would do no further trades with it.  This all came to nothing, as he knew, since the Trade Desk was not, for whatever reason, prepared to make that system available to FXPB (whose personnel would have to be trained in the use of it).  The reason for this was almost certainly the reluctance of the Trade Desk to assist FXPB in facilitating Mr Said’s trading such EDTs with other banks rather than the problem of preserving confidentiality, since Mr Said was content for details of his other trading to be disclosed to DBAG’s Trade Desk.   </p>

The position remained the same throughout the rest of the period of Mr Said’s trading.  There was nothing which could have altered his understanding on this point.  Nor could he have, at any time, understood that the EDTs were being properly margined since such margining depended, so far as concerned variation margin, on DBAG’s systems producing valid MTM figures.  This appears at least in part from his evidence on deposition.  Elsewhere I set out the more significant exchanges between DBAG personnel and Mr Said which make his state of knowledge and agreement to the absence of proper booking, valuing and margining, clear, to the extent that he was not prepared to admit it on deposition.   </p>

He said he did not recall DBAG ever saying that they could not do these structured trades and in the end they were booked and executed as at first conceived.  He said that in April 2008 he had emailed Mr Walsh to say that the FXPB system was throwing out numbers that were spurious by tens of millions in respect of the Pivot Accruals.  He told Mr Walsh to exclude them from the MTM figures.  He said in the deposition that he was not concerned over the current MTM of the Pivot Accruals (or faders as Mr Walsh called them) because they would accrue profit and loss over time anyway.  He therefore told him to keep them out of the MTM figures in order to ensure that the other figures were straight.

This fix for the Pivot Accruals was always just round the corner.  The MTM on the TPFs was therefore excluded from the website until they fixed the matter.  Mr Said said in deposition that it never occurred to him that DBAG would not value the trades so far as its own risk went.  When he sent an email to Mr Walsh saying that the numbers in the live MTM module relating to two pivot trades were not accurate and told him to exclude them from the system until they were correct this was not a general instruction to exclude pivot trades.

It was only in October that he was told that trades had not been booked and he recalled going through all the trades that had been done with Mr Walsh at his request on October 7th.  He did not think that Mr Walsh told him then that some had not been booked.  He said he was never told that the trades had not been margined correctly.   </p>

Something along those lines had been said which was quite comforting.  He considered margin a matter for negotiation and when in September DBAG came forward with a proposal to amend the existing margin methodology, he thought he would see if he could get away with less than was being sought. </p>

It was only in October he said that it dawned on him that DBAG did not have a handle at all on the trades, being ignorant of what they had, what the values were and how to deal with the trades.  DBAG had received a margin call from MS and was struggling to reconcile the numbers.  Mr Walsh asked him if he could get valuations from the counterparty banks and it was at about this time, perhaps a little earlier, that he realised that DBAG was unable to value the TPFs which meant that they had probably not charged margin on them.  He had never given the margin situation much thought prior to that and it was never a problem.

He said that on and off he got MTM figures from CS but did not receive regular MTM figures from all the counterparties.

He said he was unclear what DBAG had in mind but, as it turned out, the topic was the original terms that he had negotiated, which DBAG now felt were too generous.  He asked for a proposal which resulted in DBAG putting forward a change in the VaR multiple and a liquidity addon.  The discussion culminated, as he described it, in new margin terms of 2.5 x VaR and a liquidity add-on “which would have raised my required margin on oct 6th form [sic] 21mm$ to 40mm$!”.  The relevant paragraph in the Timeline concludes with the reference to the meeting of 8th September where reference was made to the TPFs and the difficulty in incorporating them into the margin calculation which they “would get to shortly”.  The terms of the paragraph, including the exclamation mark following the reference to the new proposal, show that Mr Said had been expecting to receive a much higher margin proposal because he thought that DBAG had at last found a way of margining the EDTs, whether by use of the Trade Desk DB Analytics tool or otherwise, only to discover that they still had not.

These had been booked as Resurrecting Fader options – OCTs 16-19.  The difference, as explained by Mr Said, was that TPFs had a cap on the maximum profit and, although there was a risk of loss, Mr Said said that only a massive move in the market which did not revert could cause that and he would hedge against that in any event.  He said that these TPFs had less risk than the 2007 Pivot Accruals because of the knock out feature which meant that the trade would have shorter maturity and therefore less chance to move away from the pivot outside the range.  In fact the Pivot Accruals, which were combinations of Resurrecting Fader options, had a different payoff formula and, because of his view of the unlikelihood of substantial losses occurring, in his telephone conversation with Mr Walsh, Mr Said downplayed the risk element.  What was clear from the evidence of Mr Walsh and from the exchanges between him, Mr Quezada and Mr Said, was that not only was Mr Walsh scared of Mr Said but that he had limited understanding of the complexities of the TPFs and of the risks involved and had to have their basic structure explained to him in October 2008.  Similarly Mr Quezada appears to have had a limited understanding though I am more dubious about this.  Mr Said however fully understood the trades and was prepared to gloss over the potentially huge downside, of which he was well aware, in requesting DBAG to approve the EDTs.   </p>

He booked them as “Resurrecting Faders” as he had for the previous Pivot Accrual trades, with the result that the GEM system, where it did produce figures, produced MTM figures for a different type of transaction.  Mr Said executed EDT 3 on 27th February 2008 and the following day he sent Mr Walsh an email telling him that DBAG’s GEM system could not handle the TPFs and was producing “silly numbers”.  He told Mr Walsh to “keep these out of the live MTM module”.  This was an ongoing theme in his conversations with Mr Walsh.  Mr Said appreciated that the GEM system could not cope with the trade details of these TPFs and knew that if the appropriate details of the transaction could not be fed into DBAG’s system, the numbers produced for an MTM valuation could not be accurate.  He was concerned about the potentially distorting effect of those numbers on figures for other trades.  He must therefore have appreciated the potential impact on valuation of the portfolio as a whole and the calculation of the portfolio margin in consequence.

It was discovered that this was due to system-wide issues involving a “feed issue” between ARCS VaR and GEM (resulting in delay in the time between a trade being booked and its valuation appearing) and a lack of correspondence in the Reval rate which showed in GEM and that used by ARCS VaR to calculate the MTM.  This problem led to the establishment of the “dummy” reporting account to which Mr Walsh, but not Mr Said, had access.  This account used NOP margining as opposed to VaR margining and Mr Walsh would print off a spreadsheet from it which he would send to Mr Said electronically at the end of the day containing MTM values for the vanilla trades.  This system of “manual” spreadsheets started on 1st August and continued on effectively a daily basis until 5th November 2007, by which time the problem seemed to have been solved though it recurred from time to time thereafter.  In consequence other manual spreadsheets were sent on 27th November 2007, 7th February, 19th, 20th and 22nd February 2008 and between 12th May and 27th August 2008, with one further spreadsheet on 19th September 2008.  These spreadsheets were supplied when Mr Said again identified problems with the valuation of straightforward FX positions.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The problem with the EDTs was distinct and incapable of solution in the ARCS VaR and GEM systems.  In consequence, Mr Said did not want them to appear in GEM at all and whenever they did so as “Resurrecting Faders” he instructed Mr Walsh to remove them or zero them out which Mr Walsh could not and did not do.  On the manual spreadsheets sent by Mr Walsh in consequence of the problem with straightforward FX transactions identified above, where the EDTs appear, they do so as FX Resurrecting Fader Opt, with their trade date and expiry date but with a Current Market Value (MTM) of zero.  They either did not appear or their MTM was zeroed out by Mr Walsh.  Mr Said wanted the website and manual spreadsheet to exclude the EDTs from MTM valuation and said so as can be seen from his emails of 28th February, 12th May, 3rd July, 21st July and 22nd July 2008.  The spreadsheets of 27th August and 19th September 2008 continued to show the EDTs with zero MTM.  What appears from all the exchanges is that Mr Said castigated DBAG for its inability to solve the problems relating to MTM valuation of straightforward trades, since he could get the figures right himself with published information and the use of his desk calculator.  He did not however at any stage criticise DBAG or complain at the absence of MTM figures for the EDTs.  On the contrary, he required their absence rather than the inclusion of “silly numbers” for them which served only to confuse and might have the effect of distorting the overall position on the other trades for </p>

He expressly accepted the inability of DBAG to value the trades.  He expressed the view that margining was a matter for DBAG to work out for itself but that in any event SHI was over-collateralised and would always produce further margin if required. </p>

SHI at one point suggested that they were referred to in this way because they could not be booked online by him in the TRM system for Straight Through Processing (STP).  However, Mr Said’s understanding of the booking and valuation problems was reflected to some extent in the Timeline to which I have already referred.  He appreciated that Structured Options were the subject of special acceptance under the FXPBA and understood the inability of the system to cope with them.  On 15th April 2008, by way of example, Mr Said emailed Mr Walsh, referring to a Dual Currency Range Digital Option (OCT39) saying “I realize they are also offline trades and not in the daily p+l”.  By this time Mr Said was referring to TPFs as “fader options” or “faders” in his dealings with DBAG and on 18th April he referred to “the faders” being back in GEM web reporting.  It was on 5th May that Mr Walsh told Mr Quezada that Mr Said referred to these trades as “fader options”.   </p>

There was pressure from FXPB personnel in London and from the operations personnel in New Jersey, including Mr Kim and Mr Manrique, to cancel these FXPB bookings because of the inability of the system to handle them.  What they appear to have envisaged as a possibility (although it was probably unrealistic) is that the deals would be rebooked as direct trades between SHI and the Counterparty bank, by agreement between them.  However SHI had no ISDA agreements with such banks and would have had to negotiate and put up collateral to each of the banks concerned as opposed to using the current FXPB arrangements which enabled Mr Said to trade, using DBAG’s credit and only putting up margin to DBAG.  Mr Said dismissed out of hand any suggestion made by Mr Walsh that he should conduct trades directly with other banks under new arrangements with them, rather than through the FXPB arrangements he currently had.   </p>

By this time it had been ascertained by DBAG FXPB personnel (essentially Mr Walsh and Mr Quezada) that ARCS VaR could not capture the MTM or risk on the EDTs and that the only way that DBAG could book these trades was by using the DB Analytics tool that was used by the FX Trading Execution Desk for complex options.  FXPB did not have access to this tool because of the Chinese wall between FXPB and the Trade Desk.  So it was that Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh spoke to Mr Said on the telephone on 5th May, the transcript of which is available, to discuss what was to be done.  Mr Said was told of the position with regard to the DB Analytics tool and of the problems created for valuing the trades, monitoring the risk and margining them.   </p>

He thought that the effect was that there would be over-collateralisation but was not 100% comfortable about that.  He said that the two trades with the RMS IDs (identification numbers) showed up “sporadic[ally]” on the website report but that Mr Said did not use those reports to check on those options and removed them himself in his assessment of the position.  He thought these were not the direct TPFs but the indirect ones.  Mr Quezada then asked him expressly to check with Mr Avery to confirm that the risk on those two identified trades was being captured and if it was, then pressure could be applied to the Trade Desk on the basis that, unless it assisted, Mr Said would not conclude any further TPFs with them.  Mr Walsh then said that the direct trades were not showing up in the web reports or anywhere because they were booked under the Trade Desk sales ticket (GST) which did not feed into the system.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">On 6th May, Mr Walsh passed on to Mr Quezada a message from Mr Avery which stated that neither the indirect TPF nor the direct TPF were being valued.  The indirect trade was not being valued as a Resurrecting Fader due to the number of fixings (258), although under a new hardware system, the limit on the number of fixings which could be taken into account might be capable of removal.  The direct trade which did have another RMS identification number was booked by way of a generic sales ticket (GST) which he explained as a freeform ticket and was therefore not valued by RMS or downstream systems at all.  Mr Avery suggested that the risk in these structures was normally covered by other trades but it looked as though a DBA Security trade had been booked to cover that risk (a hedge from DBAG’s internal perspective since there was no counterparty other than SHI).  Mr Avery said that these hedge trades were basically on DB Analytics spreadsheets which were loaded into RMS but again were not sent to downstream systems.  The unequivocal message being conveyed to Mr Walsh (in response to his question as to whether either of the identified trades was being margined) and which he passed on to Mr Quezada was that no valuation and no margining was taking place on direct or indirect TPFs at this point, regardless of the form of booking.  It mattered not whether the booking fed to GEM as indirect trades booked as Resurrecting Faders by Mr Walsh (as ARCS VaR could not value them) or whether, as a direct trade, it was merely booked in RMS on the basis of a generic sales ticket, which did not feed to GEM or ARCS VaR at all. </p>

The conversation opened with Mr Said telling Mr Walsh that the MTM valuation on a vanilla China option that he had was total garbage on the GEM web P&amp;L, although it was correctly set out on the manual spreadsheet which Mr Walsh was regularly forwarding to Mr Said at that date.  Mr Said then stated that “all these faders pop up” in the web P&amp;L so it was not very usable.  He could correct for the faders by manually taking them out, which was “a pain” but the web was effectively useless if the spot positions were wrong.   </p>

He said in deposition that “the P&amp;L system … was throwing off numbers that weren’t a little bit wrong.  They were spurious by tens of millions of dollars and they were random.  And they were throwing off the entire P&amp;L.”  In consequence, he regularly instructed Mr Walsh, whenever the MTM figures for EDTs crept into the GEM Web Reports, to remove them or zero them out.  This appears from his emails of 28th February, 12th May, 3rd July, 21st July and 22nd July 2008.  Mr Walsh could not do this and no-one appeared to have any idea why the figures sporadically appeared and disappeared.  All that Mr Walsh could do was to zero out MTM figures on the manual spreadsheets which he produced, based largely on the P&amp;L Reporting Account, which sometimes included references to Resurrecting Faders, but never a comprehensive list, and resort to booking the EDTs only at knock out, for cash settlement, so that no MTM figures could appear in respect of those trades throughout their duration.  </p>

Mr Said knew that the valuation issue for the EDTs was not susceptible of any easy solution because, as he recognised in his Timeline, the systems were simply not apt to capture the details of such complex trades.  The only solution which had been put forward was the use of the DB Analytics pricing tool which was available only to the Trade Desk and which he knew was not being made available to FXPB, despite his own and Mr Quezada’s efforts to obtain access for FXPB.  </p>

From the terms of his later conversation with Mr Walsh on 6th October following his agreement to the new VaR parameters it appears that Mr Said did not pay much attention to the Collateral Summary Report on GEM at all.  He asked Mr Walsh to explain the figures as they appeared on screen.  As the MTM figure was about US$33.675 million (negative) Mr Said would have known this was hopelessly wrong in the light of the MS margin demands, although he confirmed to Mr Walsh that it sounded about right.  If Mr Walsh had any real understanding at the time, he would have appreciated how far wrong this was also.  The Open P&amp;L Report was at the time showing a negative valuation of approximately US$50 million for non EDT transactions.  </p>

When discussing MS’ MTM values for three TPFs on 9th October, Mr Said said that there had “been big numbers” before and, on the same date, in an email he told Mr Vik that he was “always aware” of MTM when he was trading, though he largely ignored it.  He occasionally got MTM figures from counterparty banks (for example on 24th March 2008, 6th August 2008, 12th August 2008 and from MS between 3rd and 9th October 2008) and if he had wanted further figures, he could have sought and obtained them.  </p>

He knew that they were “pretty big positions on a vega and gam[m]a basis” and that if volatility increased and spot moved away from the pivot after inception, the trades would show a substantial MTM loss very quickly.  He understood that any position which attempted to “short volatility”, as these did, would show loss on any significant movement in the market.  On receiving the accrual spreadsheets from the counterparty banks in respect of each fixing date, Mr Said would be able to see exactly how the market was moving, what profits and losses were accruing and the general direction of the trades vis-à-vis the strike barriers.  With knowledge of the spot rate, the forward rate and implied volatility, all of which information was available on Bloomberg, it would be clear to an experienced trader such as Mr Said when MTMs were negative, although the exact figures would not be known.  </p>

His USD/BRL positions were particularly troublesome but he could see from the daily accrual spreadsheets that his other trades were moving in the wrong direction from August onwards.  He still entered into eleven further EDTs in September, some of which he saw as hedges because the ranges were wider than those which were already moving in the wrong direction.  In discussions with Ms Hashimoto in mid- and late September, the extent of his worry and sleeplessness over the issues is revealed.  Mr Said knew the risks that he was running.  His emails of 18th and 19th September to Mr Vik illustrate the point.  </p>

Knowing that Structured Options fell outside the scope of DBAG’s systems, Mr Said must have been surprised that DBAG did not seek to agree trade level margining or hard coding of some kind as a condition of accepting other OCTs and the EDTs.  Variation margin was always going to be a problem if MTM could not be calculated as Mr Said knew it could not.  As the market moved, Mr Said knew that the margin calculations on GEM were not reflecting that movement (see the Timeline).  If he had stopped to think about it, his sample portfolio in October 2006 with five large FX Spot Positions had generated a Margin Requirement of US$28 million which meant that the substantial open positions, including what he regarded as high risk EDTs in the volatile market in the late summer and autumn of 2008, had, of necessity, to be generating a much higher margin figure if the whole portfolio was being valued.  Throughout the period when the market was moving, from mid-August onwards, the margin figure on GEM remained essentially static, whilst Mr Said, recognising that implied volatility was high, was attempting to short it by further TPFs.  As appears from his Timeline, Mr Said appreciated that the EDTs were attracting no initial margin or variation margin in the overall VaR portfolio figures provided on GEM.   </p>

The email continued: “We know he does structured options [both] direct and indirect that require [additional] work in order to book and trade.”  Mr Quezada then asked Mr Geisker whether he and Mr Spokoyny could meet with him for fifteen to twenty minutes prior to their meeting with Mr Said.  The purpose of this was “to [discuss] the structured options and also to give you a preview of our discussion so that you are prepared for your 3pm”, which was a reference to Mr Geisker’s separate scheduled 3pm meeting with Mr Said (where pricing was to be discussed).  Mr Quezada received that morning from Mr Walsh a trade confirmation of EDT 33 and, from Mr Geisker, an accrual spreadsheet showing EDT 31 (a direct EDT).  Mr Quezada and Mr Said both knew at this point that TPFs could not be properly booked, valued or margined.

Mr Spokoyny’s statement referred to Mr Said asking Mr Quezada about progress in booking his trades but said that his own recollection was that there was no detailed discussion of this and he saw it as a matter for the Operations team.  He said that he did not pick up that there was any valuation or margining problem which affected his own role in assessing the adequacy of the VaR formulation to be applied, which is surprising.  Mr Said however, in whatever terms the matter was discussed between him and Mr Quezada, did understand that there was still a booking, valuing and margining issue.   </p>

The Timeline refers to this by saying “during our meeting on September 8th in New York they did reference the structures and said they were having some issues incorporating them into the margin calculation but would get to it shortly.”  It is clear therefore that in this document, which was prepared for the benefit of SHI’s lawyers and, no doubt, was putting the best face on it that Mr Said could for the purpose of making a case, he was not saying that he was given any assurance that the figures produced by DBAG were comprehensive in terms of margin calculation.  Whatever was said, he was aware that there were still issues for DBAG in calculating and reporting margin to him in respect of the TPFs and that the problems had not been resolved.

Contrary to SHI’s submission, he was not given any assurance at that meeting and could not have been given any such assurance, whether by Mr Quezada or Mr Spokoyny.  As appears from section 13 of this judgment, Mr Quezada knew only too well that neither direct nor indirect TPFs had been booked properly and that they could not be captured by ARCS VaR.  He knew that no helpful response had been received from the Trade Desk about the use of DB Analytics and, whether or not he met with Mr Geisker prior to his meeting with Mr Said, that position remained unchanged.  He could have given no assurance about the resolution of the booking problem and Mr Spokoyny, on his evidence, knew little about it so that any comments on the subject may have passed him by.  In a later part of his deposition, having earlier referred to some assurance being given by Mr Spokoyny, Mr Said said that Mr Spokoyny had told him that they had not effected bookings but were getting there.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">as to the true MTM position of his trades if the comments in internal MS emails in September are to be believed.  He seemed to think that it was sufficient, however, for him to keep his VaR “somewhere this side of the GNP of a small nation.” It seems that Mr Quezada was not copied into any emails concerning the conclusion of TPFs by Mr Said after 20th June 2008 until 8th September and twenty-six EDTs were concluded by Mr Said thereafter.  In fact, all the loss making TPFs which were concluded by Mr Said were entered into after his 22nd July 2008 telephone call with Mr Walsh.  Mr Spokoyny had only noticed the limited number of Resurrecting Faders which appeared in GEM which he took as offsetting one another because of the manner in which they were booked with four or eight different entries.  Neither Mr Quezada nor Mr Spokoyny was therefore likely to appreciate the extent of the outstanding volume of EDTs, nor the seriousness of the MTM or margin position in the light of the way in which the market was moving, but the history of their involvement, including the 2nd May telephone call, the email from Mr Quezada to Mr Geisker and Mr Spokoyny’s later email of 7th October, together with Mr Said’s Timeline satisfy me that they knew there was an outstanding problem, about which neither has since been candid.  Furthermore, Mr Quezada and Mr Kim must have been aware, at least in general terms, of Mr Walsh’s approach and Mr Manrique knew that he was essentially not booking EDTs until knock-out.  He asked Mr Kim to sign off on ten EDT Counterparty term sheets on 16th and 18th September which had not been booked contemporaneously, making it clear that FXPB did not have access to GSTs and thus to DB Analytics.  I conclude that the booking problems were more widely known than the bank personnel have been prepared to admit, although the significance of the trades themselves would not have been apparent to those concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">On 30th September Mr Quezada and Mr Spokoyny spoke further with Mr Said in a telephone call seeking to agree an amendment to the margin terms.  Mr Quezada initially proposed that the initial margin terms should be amended from 2 x 5 day VaR to 3 x 10 VaR plus liquidity add-on.  The current figure was said to be US$21.8 million and the changed parameters would move the figure up to US$50 million.  Mr Said recognised that there should be more margin because he considered that DBAG “are probably always a little on the low side” but said that there was no risk because the account had Mr Vik behind it.  Nonetheless, even at this late stage, knowing the state of the market and that his EDTs were not included in the margin calculation, Mr Said still resisted the increase sought, saying that it was too high and, effectively, that he could get a better offer from another bank than the 150% increase that the new margin parameter reflected.  Mr Spokoyny then gave Mr Said a rough estimate of the amount of margin that would be required if margin terms were amended to 2.5 x 10 day VaR and Mr Said indicated that he would be content with margin terms that doubled the existing collateral requirement.  He asked Mr Spokoyny to carry out backtesting over the previous two years on his account to ascertain what amendment to the margin parameter would be required to increase the current level by 75-100%.  He observed that if it took a further two years for DBAG to revert to him, he was not in any way concerned.  Mr Said said that he would discuss the margin position with Mr Vik and that one of his big advantages was that he did not have, as a rule, to cut positions simply for margin reasons.  Given the sleepless nights that he was suffering, as reported to Ms Hashimoto, about the EDTs and his knowledge of the extent to which the BRL positions, in particular, had moved outside their ranges, Mr Said could not have thought that any solution had yet been achieved in relation to DBAG’s booking problems.  He knew that he had not been told that any such solution had been reached.   </p>

Mr Said promptly accepted.  Knowing that DBAG had still not found a way of booking the EDTs so that they were reflected in MTM and margining, Mr Said knew that the agreed new parameters for VaR margining were inadequate to cover the risks on his portfolio, particularly in circumstances where he had just recently received details of MS’ margin demand for US$103 million, based on MTM alone, which neither Mr Spokoyny nor Mr Quezada then knew.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Said’s relevant exchanges with Mr Vik in October are set out in section 16.  Mr Said’s knowledge that he had not been margined on the EDTs appears clearly from his “free ride” email to Mr Vik on 9th October 2008 in which he pointed out that the profit on the EDTs was made on “almost no capital” and that he was able to do that essentially for free, but that this was now at an end because DBAG, having given SHI “a free ride on these things because they could not value them properly in their system” had now “woken up”.  The same point is confirmed by Mr Said’s telephone conversation with Mr Walsh and Mr Quezada where he referred to getting a free ride for the past six months (as opposed to the year that he had mentioned to Mr Vik) “from a mark to market … from a collateral point of view”.  The terms of the conversations between Mr Walsh, Mr Quezada and Mr Said make it clear that they all understood that the EDTs had not been taken into account in the margin calculations because ARCS VaR could not capture the risk, with Mr Said saying that he did not realise the full extent of the freebies that the deficiencies in DBAG’s systems had given him.  He knew that he had had a free ride for six months to a year.  He knew that the MTM figures were large because of the market movements since mid-August and he knew by October, if not before, that “hundreds of millions” of dollars would be involved in unwinding the trades on an MTM basis.  He therefore knew that, if DBAG had been able to calculate margin in accordance with the contract, those figures would have been very substantial but he may not have realised quite how substantial.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">At no point, at any stage, did he blame DBAG for not reporting accurate MTMs on the EDTs or accurate margin calculations which incorporated the EDTs because he knew that non-reporting of these matters was the agreed basis upon which DBAG took in the EDTs in consequence of the systems’ inability to capture the trade details and risk.  The most that he ever said in a call to Mr Quezada on 9th October in the evening, was that “with a more standard system where these things are fully collateralised, fully margined, the positions would have been smaller …  If these had all been valued, I may have screamed and yelled at you for costing me the opportunity, but I wouldn’t have had so many positions on”.  Even this was said in the context of saying that more margin would be put up and SHI would manage the crisis with the ball in their court, not DBAG’s.

To the extent that there was any suggestion that he used such reports to monitor his risk and that he always insisted that DBAG should only take the EDTs if they could book them accurately, value them and margin them, that evidence was false.

Margin, for him, was DBAG’s concern, because it was a requirement for security on its part against obligations owed to it by SHI.

The portfolio margin likewise could only be done, and was ultimately done, only with computer programmes which were specifically designed for the TPFs by the experts engaged by DBAG and SHI.  As the market moved sharply outside the ranges of the TPFs and looked as though it was going to stay there, the impact on MTM and margin must have become increasingly apparent to anyone who understood how the TPFs worked as Mr Said did.  He knew that, from the moment they were first concluded, they tended to lose value on an MTM basis and that, at all stages until knock out they were likely to be negative from an MTM viewpoint.  Once, however, market movements occurred which put them outside the ranges, with little prospect of return, as occurred in the autumn of 2008, there came a point where Mr Said must have realised just how inaccurate any margin figure on the web was, a point which was brought home to him on Friday October 3rd when MS reported MTM margin figures to him on three USD/BRL TPFs, which on Monday 6th were reported as US$103 million.  That may have been the figure for October 3rd, but if it was not, it must have been a figure of that order.  Previous comments by other banks’ representatives in Bloomberg chats suggest that he was not fully alive to the size of this figure until he was hit with it.   </p>

Whatever DBAG’s obligations might previously have been, as a matter of implication of terms into the FXPBA, Mr Said agreed that DBAG did not need to report MTM figures for the EDTs or accurate margin calculations or even process the EDTs until knock-out and settlement.   </p>

He understood also that DBAG’s systems could not capture the trade details of the EDTs and therefore that that they could not be properly booked in DBAG’s systems and agreed that they need not be.  He waived any requirement for that and for reporting any trade details, agreeing that a cash settlement booking was sufficient.

Mr Said did not rely upon the accuracy of DBAG’s booking, valuation, margining or reporting in making his decisions to execute EDTs.  He did so on the basis of his own trading decisions and market judgments and sought approval from DBAG knowing that DBAG could not properly book, value or margin them.  It was Mr Said’s decisions which gave rise to the trading losses, not DBAG’s failure to provide MTM or margin reporting.  Although Mr Vik might well have taken action, as Mr Said said in his deposition evidence, to require Mr Said to reduce positions if he had known that the MTM  requirement had risen to a figure of US$150 million - US$200 million, DBAG was under no duty to protect SHI from the consequences of Mr Said’s trading decisions.   </p>

His first venture into these exotic options occurred on 8th February 2007 with two Knock-out Call Options concluded with Citibank and CS.  If there had been an agreed restriction on his trading to vanilla options, he therefore went outside the scope of his authority within a couple of months or so of the FXPBA and the Said Letter of Authority.  Furthermore, DBAG’s forensic accountant calculated that Mr Said’s trading took him briefly over the US$35 million margin level on 18th January 2007 so that this also constituted a breach of authority on SHI’s case.

In an email he explained the nature of the transaction he wanted to do and asked if Mr Vik would like to “do some on your own position also”.  As explained, a premium of €1 million was to be paid with a prospect of a €5 million payout on the maturity of the option in two months’ time (forty business days).  If the NOK was in the range of 8.05-8.21 on any business day, one fortieth of €5 million accrued as profit.  If the NOK left that range the option knocked out and the premium was lost but profits gained were retained which meant that, provided the NOK stayed within the range for nine business days, a profit would be earned.  If it stayed within the range for the whole period, US$5 million profit resulted.  The email said that Mr Said was happy to explain further.  Mr Vik responded to say that he did not wish to purchase such an option himself but raised no objection to Mr Said doing so.  In cross-examination he said he had no recall of reading this at the time and it was of no interest to him.  In his deposition he said that he had read it.

Mr Said asked if Mr Vik had any questions about the Correlation Swap but Mr Vik did not take him up on it.  In cross-examination he said he did not understand the trade and it was not plain to him that it was not a vanilla trade.  This could not have been true and indeed, if he had not understood it, it would have been all the more plain that it was not vanilla.  In fact I have no doubt that Mr Vik did understand the explanation given.  Though not authorised in advance it is plain that Mr Vik gave his approval to it.  In crossexamination Mr Vik accepted that he knew that Mr Said was going to conclude the Correlation Swap, saw a description of it and even after Mr Said later reported that it had lost money, he never raised any objection.

Mr Vik’s response was to ask whether the odds were very heavily in SHI’s favour, saying that selling FX volatility on relative trades should be a good prospect with the existing implied volatilities.  The response from Mr Said was then to say that the trades were very high risk, high reward because, at these volatilities, there were very wide spreads.  He said that if the market should move outside the range and stay there, there was in theory unlimited loss potential.  He had a couple that had done that but he had put other ranges round them to create an average portfolio and so far that had worked.  He said he liked these trades because he thought that currencies were a bit of a side show in all of it (meaning that it was the volatility that mattered) and although there were sharp vicious moves up and down he did not think there would be a major sustained move which would negate his trading strategy.  Mr Vik’s reply shows that he fully understood what Mr Said was saying because he suggested that diversifying the pairs of currencies would reduce the overall risk as well.  In cross-examination Mr Vik said that he understood that if the price moved outside the range and kept going a lot of money could be lost.  He said he did not know how Mr Said was hedging but he did understand his general strategy.  What is clear, however, is that he understood what the range trades involved in terms of the pivot and the high and low ends of the range and that the hedging to which Mr Said referred involved yet more range trades with wider ranges so that, if money was lost from the original trades, the wider range trades would still give rise to profit.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In the last of the emails sent on that day (September 19th) Mr Said expressed the key to his strategy by reference to four elements.  The first was “spreading it out over time and never doing too much of any one trade”.  The second was being more aggressive when volatility was high and “pulling your horns in” when it is low.  The third was picking the right currencies, meaning those which were “fundamentally rangey” but offered decent volatility and fourthly, diversifying the currencies.  He said that these were risky trades, but offered good risk reward if you believed that currencies were often mean-reverting, which he did.  They had, however, to be watched like a hawk. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement, Mr Vik had said that he recalled that on or about 19th September, he did speak to Mr Said about a range trade whilst in the office in Greenwich and was told that it involved selling a call option at the top of a desired range and a put option at the bottom of the range.  In cross-examination he suggested that this conversation preceded the email exchange to which I have just referred in some detail.  He thought it followed an email of 18th September from Mr Said when he had said that the volatility was high and he could get wide ranges round the spot rate in EUR/NOK and EUR/USD, commenting that the average life of trades was one or two months and it was time to add more.  The gist of Mr Vik’s evidence on deposition in relation to this conversation was that he understood that a good premium was obtainable because the volatility had gone up a lot.  He accepted that, if the 19th September email followed the conversation in the office, it made no reference to it and that there was no request from him as to how much premium was obtained.  The email exchange of 19th September gives the lie to Mr Vik’s evidence and shows that he understood clearly not only that the TPFs were not vanilla transactions but also their basic characteristics.  Since Mr Said’s exchanges with other people showed that he was working from home on both 18th and 19th September, Mr Vik is probably wrong about the dates of this discussion in any event but what his evidence does show is that he did have a discussion with Mr Said about “a range trade” and there would have been no reason for Mr Said not to explain the nature of the transaction in full, particularly given the extent of email traffic on the subject.  In all probability this discussion must have happened much earlier since, in the early emails Mr Said offered to give Mr Vik further explanation whilst the later emails do not and proceed on the basis that Mr Vik fully understood the position, as his responses demonstrate he did. </p>

The week was good for the accrual/range trades but none of them were close to maturing or knocking out, whilst directional positions were difficult to run in the market.  Two days later, Mr Said expressed his surprise at the strengthening dollar, even though that helped his range trades.  He was “hunkering down” and not entering any new trades whilst keeping a very close eye on the range trades, which were for the most part still doing well, but was ready to execute hedges quickly.  He had made enough elsewhere to hold the position, was not comfortable but was still in business. </p>

Given the focus on range bets and accrual trades and the profits they were making in circumstances where directional FX trading was highly problematic, both for Mr Said and Mr Vik (as to which see elsewhere in this judgment), in my judgment it is inevitable that Mr Vik would have wanted to know details of the profitable trades in which Mr Said was involved and to understand how they operated.  The emails reveal that he was told much in them and, as Mr Said said, there was other discussion between them about what was involved.  Contrary to Mr Vik’s evidence, he knew what the TPFs were, how profits accrued and how losses could occur if currencies moved outside the ranges and remained there.  Neither he nor Mr Said thought that this would happen over any extended period.  The emails make no reference to the size of the notional involved on a daily or weekly basis but the profits made by Mr Said must have indicated that substantial sums were involved.  Moreover, in the context of face-to-face or telephone discussions between Mr Vik and Mr Said, however limited the evidence is of these, it would have been impossible for Mr Vik not to have asked basic questions about figures.   </p>

Mr Said said he was making more than enough in the other positions but on an MTM basis, if SHI were to seek to unwind the trades it would look awful.  That, he said, was the risk taken with “structures”.  He was accruing some losses on these every week but so slowly that he expected to get out of them over time with moderate or no losses.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Vik questioned whether Mr Said should stay in BRL because he had “made the mistake in staying in these one way trains [which] seemed to go much further than expected or possible”.  Mr Said’s response was to say “[y]es” although the BRL could go further but if it did, it would be due to further position wash-outs in a highly illiquid market.  Not unwinding positions due to such squeezes on illiquidity was one of the big advantages that he considered he had with a more long term investment horizon.  He said it was true that the major part of the long Brazil position was in option structures as was much of his other risk.  The structures had made a great deal of money over the year and would make more money that year too.  He said that payment for the profit potential was a certain illiquidity.  MTM exposure to volatility and spot rates over the life of the trade were not really that relevant but it would hurt greatly if a decision was made to unwind them.  “These are buy and hold trades and if they go awry (which they can) you manage [your] way through them – which is what I have done so far.  With vol[atility] so high now I think most of the structures I have will be under water – some by a bit, some [by] a lot – on an unwind basis.”  He went on to say that he was accruing US$1.3 million a day, none of which was guaranteed until the trades knocked-out but he was pretty comfortable in thinking that over the next two weeks somewhere in the neighbourhood of US$20 million would accrue.  He said the important point was to stick with the trades as he had all year and when something went “out of whack” that he did not think would self-correct, hedges could be put on.  On the BRL trades, he considered they should be held but would refrain from adding hedges.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">On the same day Mr Said was informed by MS of the MTM position on his five outstanding TPF transactions with that Counterparty.  According to an intermessaging chat between two MS representatives on the Monday, Mr Said was not expecting the MTM to be that much and the representatives reckoned that closing of the trades had just been expedited and that Mr Said would be fired.  Another representative of MS on the Monday said that she had had a brief chat with Mr Said the previous week who said that he could not sleep at night thinking about the exposures and the trades which he could not unwind.  He thought he could either get lucky or things could look sick.  She considered that he was aware of the risk but did not know what to do with it.  The figure on Monday 6th in respect of the three USD/BRL trades was a negative figure of US$103 million.  Presumably the figure on the Friday was similar.  Mr Said’s end of the week report on the Friday referred to the markets as stressed and illiquid but the day had ended in most currencies where it had began, even the BRL.  Mr Said thought that it would take time for the market to improve and he thought it was close to the bottom for stocks and risky assets which he thought might go in hand with a gentle weakening of the dollar.  His profit figure stood at US$46 million including “all spot, forward and standard option positions on a full mark to market” basis.  The range trades were not included, whether MTM or positive built-up accruals.  On the BRL he thought it was a matter of sitting it out but would watch carefully for signs of change.   </p>

Under the heading “very ugly” Mr Said still appeared optimistic, telling Mr Vik that his range trades were still alive and most of them accruing positively though at lesser rates with some taken to their boundaries.  He said it was not a good situation but there was no quick fix as these were not trades that he could just unwind.  Whilst very rewarding in anything but the wildest moves, there was not much liquidity and if the market moved sharply and stayed down they were dangerous.  He said that volatility was sky-high and he was using that selectively to restructure some of the older trades to more favourable levels but there was nothing else to be done since hedging at that stage was not practical.  He then responded to Mr Vik’s enquiry as to his positions by setting out the main range trades in terms which would have been incomprehensible if Mr Vik did not understand how they operated.  He referred to the three Brazilian TPFs which were all negative and accruing losses and said that he was concerned about the US$/JPY trade.  He suggested a telephone conversation and said he was living on the profits made so far.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Later that day Mr Said said the only sensible course was to sit tight and take losses as they accrued, waiting for tradable markets before taking action.  Mr Vik’s response was to say that he was forced to close his own positions because the pain was too great, to which Mr Said responded that if the BRL was tradable in any meaningful way he would stop out of some of his trades too.  He maintained that volatility was sky-high with trading at 10% bid/ask spreads which meant that the only rational course of action was to see what transpired.  He was very uncomfortable and whilst there was still plenty of opportunity for matters to turn out OK, it was dangerous.  He expressed surprise that DBAG had not yet asked for more collateral but was sure that they would.  Mr Vik’s response was to say that it was not a good time to add more collateral and Mr Said should reduce his positions as they came off.  He then asked Mr Said about the BRL positions.  In response to that question Mr Said said that the BRL position on an MTM basis would be absolutely awful and with volatilities at 30% with a 10% bid/ask spread, fire sale prices only would be obtainable for such complicated positions.  On an accrual basis he was probably losing US$1-1.5 million a week if markets remained at the current level but there was no realistic alternative to waiting for an improvement in the market in which risk could be reduced.</p>

If the markets calmed down a little, the cushion would increase as some of the trades knocked out.  On the same day, Mr Said concluded EDT 41, an EUR/GBP TPF with CS, replacing EDT 2 at zero cost, notifying Mr Walsh of it by email “as discussed”.  </p>

He said that DBAG had finally woken up to the fact that they were giving terms which were, by any stretch of the imagination, way too generous.  He knew of no-one who had terms “like what I was getting”.  Although DBAG had wanted to triple the requirements which would have been reasonable, he had negotiated them down to double with the current positions which meant an increase of US$20 million to US$40 million in collateral (the figures which Mr Spokoyny had given him).  He went on to say that there was a realised gain of around US$30 million in the portfolio but reminded Mr Vik that he had taken cash out of the account both in 2008 and 2007 and said that the account was now short.  As the intention was that the account should be self-financing, the easiest thing would be for Mr Vik to increase the amount of the cross-pledge from DBS rather than adding cash.   </p>

As appears elsewhere in this judgment, he knew from his meeting with Mr Spokoyny and Mr Quezada on 8th September that booking problems had still not been solved and that margining was based on the MTMs reported to him on the GEM website.  He knew that on an MTM basis his BRL positions were “absolutely awful”, that most of his structures were “under water” and that unwinding the trades would give rise to substantial losses.  He discussed with Mr Walsh the constituent elements of the Collateral Summary report, which as appears in section 15 was so out of kilter with the Open P&amp;L Report on his non EDT MTMs, let alone the MS BRL EDTs, that he must have known that DBAG’s margining was hopelessly inadequate.    </p>

Mr Campbell said that MS were concerned because there was no record of these trades in DBAG’s margin system.  Mr Walsh said he could supply ID numbers but stated that the bookings were fudged because FXPB’s access to RMS did not allow a full booking of the details.

Mr Said suggested a telephone call to go through trades one by one and in that call Mr Walsh said he had a huge stack which had got out of order and needed to double check all the details.  The huge stack must have been a reference to the trade confirmations sitting on his desk for unbooked trades.  This did not come as a surprise to Mr Said who knew from GEM and the last spreadsheet of the unbooked trades.  Mr Said suggested sending to him the daily spreadsheets that he got from the banks, CS, GS, MS and DBAG, which he did.  They then discussed them on the telephone and Mr Said explained the make up of them and how the trades worked with accruing profits and losses.  He explained that the market had gone crazy but the best course was to continue accruing negative figures on the BRL trades which they could afford to pay until the market stabilised.  It would have been plain to Mr Said that Mr Walsh had no idea about the MTM of these trades and, of course, looking at the accrual figures would not assist in that regard.   </p>

None had ever got close to maturing in the past as all had knocked out (save for one or two which he had unwound).  On being asked what the exposure was and how it was going to be managed, Mr Said said there was not much that could be done.  US$3 million was being lost a week on US$14 million worth of fixing but the need was to buy time.  He thought that this meant days which could be handled because the money he had made in the past could act as a cushion.  Mr Vik questioned how time would help since it appeared to be hurting a lot to do nothing, but Mr Said expressed the view that it would be utterly prohibitive to try to unwind the trades in the current state of the market and unwinding them or hedging them would become much cheaper as the US$ came down.  It was better to run the trades for a while and accrue losses.  In a further email he said that it was a matter of timing and things might get worse before they got better.   </p>

The idea was to cancel one of the BRL structures and then to enter into two or more new range structures in a currency of Mr Said’s choice.  The new structures would be done at very high volatility but be in larger amounts than the BRL trade which would be unwound but at less than the market spreads.  His view was that this was a good time to enter into TPFs because implied volatility was so high and even if these spreads were below market, they were so wide that he thought that money would be made on them.  Moreover, even if they started to go wrong, they would be easier to hedge.  He thought that if structured right this could make real money albeit that there was plenty of risk.  Mr Vik’s response was to say that this was a good idea but it would be better to do this when the BRL level was higher and asked what currency pairs Mr Said would choose.  Mr Said suggested a phone call to discuss the matter and Mr Vik told him to call him on his cell phone.  Mr Vik’s earlier responses show that he wanted to know the details and wanted to discuss the matter before Mr Said did anything.   </p>

He said that though he had invited Mr Said to call him, he did not speak to him about it.  In a Bloomberg chat with Ms Sai of GS about an hour and a half later, Mr Said told her that he had discussed the matter at fair length with Mr Vik, both in principle and in some detail.  Mr Vik in evidence, was sure that Mr Said did not discuss the matter with him beyond the email which set out the proposal.  I cannot accept Mr Vik’s evidence about this.  It is inevitable, given the exchanges between him and Mr Said, that they would have looked at the prospect and discussed the chances of a BRL rally, the accruing losses at the current rate of US$3 million per week for a further 10 months (or worse if the market deteriorated), the MTM of the trades and the costs of unwinding them.  It does not seem possible for Mr Said to have failed to mention the MS collateral demands at this point.   </p>

He said he had talked to Mr Said who was willing to post more margin and expected it to be required.  Mr Quezada’s response was to say that the trades would be earmarked with the margin sought by MS and that approval from Mr Spokoyny and his team would be required for any new trades.  If a direct trade was to be done, there would have to be some hard coding on RMS.  If MS asked for margin, the request would have to be passed on to SHI and if Mr Said accepted the numbers, then those figures could be hard coded in RMS.   </p>

Not only is that my preferred way of trading the structures - it is also the only way.  The wide ranges and (in many cases) quick profits come with a cost - you have to take the swings and let moves mean-revert (and of course try to act quickly when you really think it is not coming back - but only then - otherwise you will get chopped up and lose all value and profit.   </p>

Right now only one of the counterparty banks has raised the issue and I am not sure if DB will extend it to all old trades and all new trades but the bank (Morgan Stanley) has of the brazil position we have and that of course on a MTM basis is causing the biggest issue (spot by the way is down to 2.15) but vol is still sky high and that is actually for the mtm just as big an issue.  I know you don't like that - I can only say the money we have made on these on almost no capital was just a freebie.

If you do not than I would have stop doing them - a shame given how useful and profitable they are but it does require capital.  One way or the other I still want to put a bunch of new trades on to restructure some of the Brazil - that makes sense and should be net collateral neutral (we are shifting the accumulated mtm loss into other, more liquid currencies.   </p>

I have so far largely ignored mtm in my trading (not completely - and I am always aware of it) which has been a great advantage for us because we can often buy when others are selling in panic or hold when others have to get out.  We were able to do that essentially for free - almost no capital requirement.  That will not be the case going forward ...  I believe I can continue to make very nice returns - and you get 90% of them.  But - it will now require a more "normal" amount of capital.  What I am hoping is that you can allocate a meaningful portion of your nok t bills or whatever it may be (which does not produce that much of a return) on a pledge basis to this trading - I think the return has been and on average over the next few years should be worth it - but that is your call.   </p>

The email speaks for itself and I find that Mr Vik fully understood its terms and what Mr Said was telling him which must then have been discussed fully when they met.  Mr Vik knew that Mr Said was looking for substantial additional collateral and there must have been discussion of figures.  In this context Mr Said already knew that MS were looking for US$153.8 million because Mr Walsh had forwarded to Mr Said the spreadsheet he had received from MS with those details on it.

He wanted to talk to Mr Vik and offered to work for him for free until all the losses were recouped.   </p>

He asked him to send him five year charts on every currency pair that SHI was trading.  Mr Said said that at the current distressed levels, three of his range trades, the USD/BRL, the USD/CAD and the AUD/NZD had become effectively forwards, by which he meant they were never going to come back within the ranges.  He said that anything he did would lock in massive losses and there would be a big margin call.  They spoke on the telephone at some point that day and shortly after midnight Mr Said sent a detailed set of recommendations to Mr Vik involving the cutting of some positions, the hedging of others and continuing with others.  The recommendations were predicated on his view that the market was in the process of reaching a temporary bottom and in that sense was somewhat optimistic but not, as he put it, blindly hopeful.  He was recommending that a lot of the risk be taken out which meant locking in losses.  The plan was for Mr Vik to return early from Harvard and for them to meet later that day or the next day.   </p>

In the light of his previous request to Mr Said, it seems that Mr Vik would by this stage have received details not only of Mr Said’s extant trades but of the movement of the currency pairs involved over the preceding five years in order to consider the course of action to be taken.  Mr Said sent various spreadsheets to Mr Vik.  There can be no doubt that Mr Vik would have considered the position in detail and discussed it with Mr Said before coming to the conclusions he did.  The message to be given to DBAG was that margin would be put up whilst the plan was implemented.  In evidence Mr Vik stated that his objective was to minimise the margin call and put up as little money as possible, structuring a plan which required the least amount of money.  He had no idea what the right numbers were but understood that, although Mr Said had been talking of hundreds of millions, DBAG was thinking in terms of US$40-60 million margin.  Between them, Mr Vik and Mr Said settled on a script of the presentation that Mr Said would make to DBAG on the Monday morning in circumstances where Mr Said had, in one of his emails on Saturday, told Mr Vik that DBAG might decide to ask for margin on the remaining range trades, that they had the right to do that and there was no way round it.  All that could be done was to negotiate the amount and close the trades which in itself would require the posting of money to pay for the losses thereby sustained. </p>

Mr Vik had agreed to provide an increase in the letter of pledge.  The plan was to reduce risk by unwinding or hedging positions effectively, particularly the USD/CAD and USD/BRL positions, whilst smaller positions would be cut.  The AUD/NZL position would be liquidated but only over time when the market had improved whilst SHI wanted to hold on to range options in other currencies which were expected to continue to accrue profits and would disappear through knock-outs in the course of the next two to four weeks.  In summary SHI was saying it would provide an increased guarantee, substantially reduce risk and seek to exit most, if not all, positions over time, but in a controlled, carefully thought out fashion.   </p>

DBAG’s representatives said they would be looking for margin later that day which had not yet been calculated.  It was thought to be of the order of US$40-60 million.  It was said that the two outstanding DBAG TPFs in USD/CAD and EUR/CHF had not been included in the margin calculations on the preceding Friday and there was a need now to bring into effect the new agreed form of calculation of VaR.  Mr Said said he foresaw no problems about the production of margin because he had discussed the issue with Mr Vik who was willing to provide it.  Mr Said pressed for a little more information as to the figure and was told it would be at the upper end of the US$40-60 million ball park which he clearly thought was extremely low.  Mr Said made plain that he knew he had gone wrong and what had to be done and that the “key goal here is to work with you”.   </p>

Mr Vik was looking for some accommodation from DBAG for this, as was made plain in that telephone conversation on 23rd October.  He said he wanted to talk to senior DBAG personnel about what had happened.  When asked what it was he was trying to accomplish, he said initially that he was seeking to get all his money back.  He then said that he was not sure but was looking for a settlement that was in the interests of both parties.  He sought to obtain from DBAG that which he had been seeking since October 16th, and for which Mr Brügelmann had been pressing FXPB, namely a history of margining effected by DBAG on Mr Said’s FX trading from 1st July 2008 to 31st October 2008.   </p>

As we you well know, my expectation was that my maximum loss was US$35 million.  DB certainly didn’t exercise its fiduciary duty to Sebastian Holdings.

They must have discussed what they would tell Mr Vik.  Mr Cloete’s evidence was that at that meeting they discussed the fact that Mr Said’s trades had clearly not been booked correctly.  At the meeting on 30th October with senior bank personnel in London, Mr Vik formulated his main grievance, namely his complaint that losses exceeded US$35 million, whilst asking whether DBAG had been applying the proper margining process to monitor his trader’s positions.  He was told, probably by Mr Bouhara or Mr Cloete (according to Mr Brügelmann) that FXPB had posted appropriate margin throughout.  This was probably known by all present at the meeting, not to be the true position.  A margin timeline was promised by close of business on 31st October 2008 but all that was done by DBAG was to send an ex post facto reconstruction of MTM on the trades on 6th November 2008.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The definition of Securities in the Equities PBA focuses on bonds and similar instruments evidencing indebtedness, shares and similar interests in corporations, futures and options relating to those categories and finally “any other securities or instrument as agreed between the parties from time to time”.  The issue which arises is whether or not FX transactions can be seen as instruments for this purpose, although, for reasons which appear later in this judgment, DBAG and SHI did agree, by word and conduct, that Mr Vik’s FX trading was to be governed by the Equities PBA and margined accordingly, regardless of any such definition.  In the ordinary way, an instrument means a formal written legal document of some kind.  Where the word “instrument” appears earlier in this definition, it is in the context of bonds, debentures, notes or certificates as something which “evidenc[es] indebtedness”.  What is there envisaged plainly is a document of some kind which can be compared to bonds, debentures or the like.  Where the word “instrument” appears towards the end of the definition, it is part of a sweep-up provision allowing the parties to agree that other documents which represent assets should fall within the scope of the Equities PBA.  It is to be distinguished from the words “any other securities” and from the words “other instrument evidencing indebtedness” and is not limited by the inclusion of interests which fall within the following wording in the last two lines of the definition.  I see no reason why a written contract does not qualify as an instrument and therefore why an FX contract should fall outside this wording, if the parties should agree on its inclusion. </p>

This states that cash held by DBAG for SHI in the Cash Account is repayable on demand.  In addition to the other exceptions in Clause 10.7.3, Clause 10.7.3.4 exempts DBAG from the requirement to repay where DBAG “reasonably believes that immediately after the payment or transfer there would be a Margin Requirement payable in terms of clause 4.2 above”.  This sub-clause therefore envisages that the Margin Requirement represents a sum which SHI is obliged to pay under the terms of Clause 4.2 and therefore can only represent the amount representing the differential required to bring the total margin up to the appropriate total level (the House Margin).   </p>

What Clause 4.2 obliges SHI to do, in the circumstances there set out, is to provide collateral (in the shape of acceptable Securities or cash) to a value which equates with the total figure for margin that DBAG requires (the “House Margin”).  This latter figure is referred to as the Margin Requirement in Clause 4.2.2, rather than the amount which has to be paid, which is what Clause 10.7.3.4 would suggest.  SHI therefore submits that the Margin Requirement referred to in Clause 4.2 equates with the House Margin, the total figure and not the deficit or shortfall required to be paid to achieve that total.   </p>

Clause 10.7.3.4 uses the term Margin Requirement in the sense of the deficit or Delivery Amount.  So also, in my judgment, does Clause 4.1 since a notification to SHI of a total House Margin would be meaningless without a notification of the market value of Securities held in the Securities Account plus cash held in the Cash Account.  The client must be told what the differential shortfall is which is to be made up.  The purpose of Clause 4.1 is to inform SHI of the amount which it is required to pay by way of additional margin, namely the deficit.   </p>

Although the last part of Clause 4.2 requires that securities or cash must be provided in order to bring up the Market Value of the Securities and Cash Account to the notified Margin Requirement for the relevant Business Day and, on the face of the words used that must refer to the House Margin, the first two lines of Clause 4.2 cannot be read as restricting the entitlement to demand margin to a situation where the House Margin, in absolute terms, increases from one day to the next.  The only sense that can be made of the provision is that the words Margin Requirement in each of the first two lines refer to the deficit payable, so that if there is an increased deficit on any day compared with that of the previous day, assuming the latter to have been paid, further margin is required.  The words when used in the first two sections bear a different meaning to the usage in the last sentence of the sub-clause.   </p>

Then, if the Margin Requirement on the following Business Day is higher than the value of the fulfilled Margin Requirement the previous day (the Margin Equity), DBAG is entitled to demand additional collateral to bring the total market value up to the House Margin figure.   </p>

Such a construction would still involve a different meaning being given to the words in Clause 4.1 and Clause 10.7.3.4.

As established by the evidence, the procedures referred to were the ROR, as interpreted by GPF Risk and the Equities ISDA and CSA which is referred to as a “Specified Agreement” in the Equities PBA.  Although it was an express requirement of Clause 4.1 that DBAG should calculate the Margin Requirement and notify SHI of it each day, there was no obligation to demand additional margin under Clause 4.2.  This is not surprising because the provision of margin was solely for the benefit of DBAG.  If it chose not to demand collateral, it ran the risk of unsecured indebtedness on the part of SHI but that could be of no concern to SHI.  Clause 4.2 set out the circumstances in which it was entitled to make demands and the circumstances in which SHI was obliged, if such demand was made, to provide the additional margin, but there was no obligation to demand margin. </p>

It was only if there were no such applicable rules that DBAG had a residual discretion to determine the amount of margin.  In my judgment, the first sentence of Clause 12.1 gave DBAG an option whether to charge margin on the basis of what it was required to pay under the Rules of an Exchange, where that applied, or to charge such margin as it reasonably required for the purpose of protecting itself against loss or the risk of loss on transactions under the Listed F&amp;O Agreements.   </p>

This decision was taken in full knowledge of the types of trade conducted by Mr Said – the nature of the EDTs and OCTs, and of DBAG’s failure accurately to report on their value or the margin requirements for the portfolio as a whole (including such EDTs) because of its inability to book, value or margin the complexities of the trades in its systems. </p>

Both parties approached this issue as a matter of English law.  SHI relies on the decision of Andrew Smith J in <span style="font-style:italic">Sea Emerald SA v Prominvest Bank</span> [2008] EWHC 1979 (Comm) and on various passages in <span style="font-style:italic">Bowstead on Agency </span>(19th edition) which show the need for the principal to make a conscious decision with knowledge of all material circumstances (unless the intention to ratify is clearly evidenced regardless of such knowledge) and to manifest the unequivocal intention to adopt the acts in question.  Thus, it is said that the principal must know all the material circumstances or intend to take the risk whatever the consequences might be and that any alleged conduct, in order to constitute ratification, must not be capable of any other explanation.   </p>

These individual transactions would be authorised or ratified by Mr Vik’s unilateral manifestation of his will in permitting them to go ahead.  The nature of these EDTs and the risk profile was sufficiently set out in the exchange and, as appears later in this judgment, Mr Vik fully understood what such “range bets” involved.  The effect on contractual margin would however not have been known to him and the authorisation/ratification of individual trades could not apply across the board for EDTs if they were outside the ambit of a financial trading limit.   </p>

The collateral demands from MS were known to Mr Vik before the weekend as was DBAG’s desire to discuss making a margin call and to discuss SHI’s future business plans in the light of the situation as it then stood.  Mr Vik could have been in no doubt as to the nature, the risk profile, the terms and extent of the EDTs concluded by Mr Said, having received details of them from him when discussing with him the course to be adopted.

The exact premium required for closing out trades was of course not known – nor were the collateral figures which would be required.  In a moving market this was inevitable and regardless of the figure, Mr Vik treated the trades as binding on SHI and decided to cut SHI’s losses on them regardless of cost, as can be shown by the subsequent payment of the margin calls to the tune of US$511 million.   </p>

In that action DBAG had sought recovery from a company associated with Mr Vik on the basis, essentially, that had DBAG known of its own errors in computing the sums standing to the credit of SHI in the GPF account (the account which reflected all the transactions under the 2008 Agreements) it would not have permitted the sum of US$25 million (approximately) to be paid to that company on 14th October 2008.  DBAG had produced a series of different explanations for the errors which are now defined as the Russell Multiplier Error and the Ignored Payments Error.  Whilst SHI’s formal position is that such errors are not admitted, there was no challenge to the evidence now put forward by DBAG on these topics. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The notion that Mr Vik could ever have considered that his FX trading in 2008 was governed by the FX ISDA or the FXPBA and the margining arrangements relating to it (the FX ISDA, Schedule and CSA) defies credibility because of his evidence in the New York action, the history of events, the size of the FX transactions he concluded and his desire, constantly expressed in his evidence, to keep Mr Said’s trading separate from his own.  Had he thought that his trading was governed by the FX ISDA and margined by reference to the Pledged Account, the actions that he took in response to an email from Mr Brügelmann of 3rd September 2008 are inexplicable.  Mr Vik made vain attempts to explain that he had not understood that email to refer to losses incurred on his own FX trading and the need to reduce his exposure on those trades because of the margin requirements under the GPF arrangements and the 2008 Agreements.  It is clear however that this is what the email stated and that the reduction in his USD/NOK trades was effected in order to reduce the margin requirement thereunder.   </p>

At one point, after DBAG had agreed on 16th October to forgo any element of VaR or liquidity add-on in calls, Mr Said suggested to Mr Vik that he might move his FX transactions to the FXPB account in order to obtain that margining benefit but Mr Vik replied that he wanted to keep his trading separate.   </p>

He said that he assumed at the time that they were being booked into an account opened under the FXPBA but had no visibility on this because he relied on Mr Brügelmann to manage such matters for SHI.  He said that his understanding throughout was that his FX transactions were governed by  the FX agreements and booked in a separate FX account and had he been told otherwise, he would have reacted adversely and remembered it, since this ran completely contrary to his own understanding of what DBAG had agreed with him.   </p>

Further, as set out earlier in this judgment, he said that at 19th February 2009 the argument that the FX account was subject to the PAL had not occurred to him, despite the fact that he had suffered serious losses on his FX trading in 2008.  The whole issue of margining was, by then, the subject of the New York action.  Later, in cross-examination, he said he did not consider during the time of his FX trading whether the PAL represented a limit to his FX trading or not.   </p>

The point assumed significance in relation to the jurisdictional dispute which arose in relation to the New York action since Mr Vik’s evidence in that action was that he always believed the FX account in which his own FX transactions were booked to be a London account, in contradistinction to Mr Said’s FXPB account in New York.  In the jurisdiction dispute Mr Vik and SHI’s position was that all Mr Vik’s trading, whether of equities, F&amp;O or FX, was effected through a London account or London accounts but had no connection whatsoever with the FXPBA which was reserved for Mr Said’s trading.   </p>

Margining, whatever the details of it, was conducted on the GPF platform and an overall figure for margin in respect of all SHI’s trading other than Mr Said’s FXPB trading was produced by DBAG as a composite figure.  Much time was spent with the witnesses on the mechanisms that were adopted and whether there was truly cross-margining between the different asset classes, in the sense that exposures on one currency in one asset class could be offset against assets in another class denominated in the same currency, but the details are unimportant.

The Equities PBA and other accompanying agreements are all dated in manuscript as of 30th January 2008 with deletions of earlier typed dates in November and December 2007.  The Amendment Agreement as of 30th January 2008, in its preamble, referred to the parties’ desire to amend the terms of the Equities ISDA of 8th May 2006 “as previously amended from time to time”.  The terms of this Amendment Agreement are unimportant for present purposes but SHI draws attention to it because the parties appear to have applied their minds to the Equities ISDA of 8th May 2006 and, at least in general terms, to amendments to it, albeit that there is no specific reference to the Amendment Agreement of 22nd November 2006.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In these circumstances it is necessary to explore the history of what occurred in 2007/2008 in order to see how DBAG came to treat Mr Vik’s FX transactions as being governed by the Equities PBA and the 2008 Agreements.  The essential reason, it would appear, was that there was initially an intention to create a Prime Brokerage account for Mr Vik which would allow him to transact all his trades, FX, Fixed Income and Equities backed by collateral held with DBS in the form of his equity portfolio (see Mr Brügelmann’s email of 8th August 2007 to Eckhard Fitschen).  What Mr Brügelmann was looking to achieve was one account through which Mr Vik could effectively trade anything he wished with third parties with one common source of collateral.  Mr Brügelmann was frustrated in seeking to achieve this aim and was disappointed to find that the Equities PBA would not give Mr Vik such flexibility, although the 2008 Agreements did provide for a breadth of products in which Mr Vik could trade.  One of the other options was to create a Fixed Income PB account through which FI and FX trading could be conducted, because the Equities PBA was not designed for FX trading although it could be used for that purpose.  A yet further possibility was an FXPB account or sub-account linked to Mr Said’s with a common pool of collateral although this would inevitably have had to be larger than US$35 million if it was to accommodate the FX trading of both of them.   </p>

He also wanted maximum flexibility to trade in anything that he considered appropriate and from about May 2007 onwards, Mr Brügelmann embarked upon investigations with DBAG in an attempt to find a vehicle for Mr Vik to conduct such trades with the flexibility he wanted.  This proved to be much more difficult than he had thought.  He had plainly hoped that the Equities PBA would at least go some way towards this result but he was looking to personnel in DBAG’s FI and FXPB departments for assistance to set up accounts or sub-accounts for Mr Vik, and encountered some resistance because the scope of Mr Vik’s anticipated FI trading was not attractive to DBAG and the methodology of margining Mr Vik’s FX transactions (by the NOP methodology) did not accord with the methodology applied to Mr Said’s FX trading, which Mr Said was unwilling to change (VaR methodology).  There were technical difficulties for DBAG’s systems in putting together two sub-accounts on the FXPB account, one for Mr Said and one for Mr Vik, with different margining methodologies and much time was spent in seeking to resolve this issue before, in May 2008, Mr Vik himself offered the solution of using a different company for his FX trading, namely CM Beatrice Inc (Beatrice).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As mentioned above, from some time in 2007 Mr Brügelmann was seeking to set up a Prime Brokerage arrangement which would allow Mr Vik to transact a variety of different trades.  In an email of 8th August 2007 Mr Brügelmann said that he was working on setting up such an agreement “which would allow him to transact on all his trades (FX, Fixed Income, Equities) with CIB backed by collateral held with DBS in the form of his equity portfolio”.  Although the GPF (Global Prime Finance) platform is, as its name suggests, a prime brokerage platform which is intended to provide financing to clients to borrow against the assets purchased, it is essentially an equities-based operation.  It was not designed for large scale FX trading nor Fixed Income derivatives.  The cross-margining system within it allowed for the setting off against equities of equity-linked F&amp;O trades and FX trades, where such had a hedging effect.  This was governed by the Rules of the Road (ROR) designed by the GPF Risk team.  Mr Singh, the European head of GPF Risk described, GPF as being predominantly used by clients who engaged in equities-related strategies, stating that the amount that a client could borrow from DBAG was determined by applying a margin requirement to the client GPF portfolio to produce a minimum amount of equity which the client had to hold in its GPF account.  The client’s GPF portfolio was both the portfolio for which the DBX system showed a margin requirement on the Global Prime Website and the portfolio whose Margin Equity was aggregated to determine whether that margin requirement was satisfied.  The Margin Equity of the portfolio was calculated by DBX which aggregated the previous day’s close of business MTM valuations of each position in the portfolio that were fed to DBX from underlying systems in relation to different classes of assets.  DBX operated on a T plus 1 basis because its margin calculations were based on valuations at the end of the previous day.  A range of types of trade could be cross-margined in DBX to produce a single margin requirement in accordance with the methodology set out in the ROR.  F&amp;O trades were booked in an F&amp;O account and FX trades were booked in an FX account but some types of trades, such as non-equity futures and interest rate swaps, could not be cross-margined. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">I have referred to Mr Vik’s desire to trade in a wider range of assets and the flexibility he sought.  Mr Said had met with the FIPB team on 30th August 2007 to discuss the opening of an FIPB account and Mr Brügelmann continued those discussions with Mr Bausano in September 2007.  Mr Bausano was the co-head of GPF and suggested that GPF could handle products such as bonds on their platform and might be able to accommodate some of the trading that SHI wanted to do.  The GPF account would however only enable Mr Vik to trade FX with DBAG and not with other parties.  At DBS there was a single pool of collateral for all of Mr Vik’s trading.  Despite initially suggesting otherwise in his first statement, he accepted that this was the case and that there was therefore no specific pool of collateral for his FX trading.  The documents show that both Mr Meidal and Mr Brügelmann were alive at Mr Vik’s behest to speak to CRM to reduce the margin requirement for Mr Vik’s trading in the light of the hedging effect (partial or complete), of the equities trades (often referred to as Mr Hanssen’s account) and the futures trades.  The documents also show that Mr Vik was looking for separate reporting of the P&amp;L for different asset classes whilst wanting cross-margining and increased leverage.   </p>

Mr Vik agreed that this is essentially what happened but not that this was the original proposal.  Mr Vik’s evidence was that his primary aim was to be able to short stocks and futures and that he did not want to be any worse off than he was at DBS with regard to margin, although he did not pay a great deal of attention to the details or much care about how it was done.   </p>

He wanted to know whether SHI fully understood the ROR and accepted them.  He wanted to know if SHI was aware of the collateral call and close out mechanisms and expressed his understanding that the ROR would have been explained in detail.  Mr Brügelmann’s response was to say that the margining process, including ROR, had been explained in detail and that Mr Vik was comfortable with the process to be applied by DBAG.  He said that the change in the margining process (48 hours cure vs same day) had been highlighted and that Mr Vik had expressly assured the others that he did not intend to get even close to margin call level.

The ROR made it plain that the maximum benefit from rules-based margining would occur when the client was trading diversified portfolios and that the margining approach considered the two primary risk components for each trade, namely the hedging component and the unhedged component.  It was recognised that security portfolios might incur foreign exchange exposure from positions in differing currencies and that they might have a hedging effect for securities of the same currency, in which case the risk reducing nature of the hedging transactions would give rise to margin relief.  Margin however would be required on outright or residual currency exposures, whether the positions were in cash, future or forward form.  The overall requirement would consist of the aggregate risk assessment in the foreign exchange and interest rates components of the position. </p>

Although in his statement he said that he recalled providing Mr Vik with a bound copy of the GPF presentation, a presentation concerning an investment strategy and a copy of the ROR and a template of the Equities PBA, he agreed in cross-examination that this was incorrect.  He went through the presentation and ROR and produced documents from his bag but did not hand them to Mr Vik.  Mr Vik wanted to sign up straight away.  Mr Vik was late for the meeting and in a hurry because he wanted to go on to an auction of some kind.  Mr Orme-Smith said he gave his usual sales pitch by reference to the benefits of cross-margining, without going through the Rules of the Road in any detail.  He could not talk for more than ten minutes about ROR.  Whilst he had no recollection of the specific discussion, that would be his normal sales patter and in doing so he would speak about the range of trades or products, equities, FX, F&amp;O, bonds and the like.  He had made many such presentations and this was his normal approach.  Given the agenda for the meeting it would have been virtually impossible for Mr Orme-Smith not to have dealt with the issue of cross-margining in discussing the second item of “Financing, margin, risk” since this was considered to be a selling point, whether or not of specific interest to Mr Vik.  In his statement he described his general recollection of doing so but, given the length of the meeting, he did not go through the ROR in detail but referred Mr Vik to the document as containing a detailed explanation of the manner in which GPF cross-margining operated.   </p>

In his second witness statement he corrected this by saying that he understood that there would be segregation between these different types of trading when the Equities PBA had been set up.  One of the three things which stood out in his mind as having been expressly agreed at the meeting was that each of the equities and F&amp;O accounts would be segregated and separately collateralised during their operation whilst FX would remain segregated and separately collateralised under the existing FXPB arrangements.   </p>

He said he was happy for DBAG to set up things the way they wanted with terms either better or no worse than before, as long as he had the ability to short stocks and bonds.  He thought that SHI’s equities trading, FX trading and futures trading were all going to London but that FX would be moved over under the FXPBA with an FX account opened in London for him to trade.  He said he had no impression of any meaningful agreement being made on November 14th at all. </p>

He could not recall how but he conceded that he did understand from Mr Brügelmann that FX trades for hedging purposes of foreign currency shares would be booked with equities trades on GPF, as distinct from FX investments/speculations.  As he later instructed Mr Brügelmann to convert the surplus cash into NOK, it was inevitable that FX transactions would be necessary to achieve that end.  It was therefore impossible for Mr Vik to have thought that all his FX trading would take place under the FXPBA.   </p>

He said that he relied on Mr Brügelmann to ensure that they reflected the terms discussed and agreed and Mr Brügelmann confirmed that they did.

FX forwards, futures and listed options and OTC options were all included.  It matters not for this purpose that the Master Netting Agreement, which referred in the preamble to the parties’ desire to provide the netting of obligations to provide margin pursuant to the terms of the Underlying Agreements, actually contained no such express term to that effect.  That was the clear intention of the Master Netting Agreement and the reality was that everyone involved at DBAG on the GPF account proceeded on the basis of the understanding that all Mr Vik’s trading fell within the terms of the 2008 Agreements.   </p>

There is thus a note of Mr Brügelmann’s dated 21st December 2007 with a diagram which illustrates two accounts in the name of Klaus and Alex feeding into a box with a number 2011084 in it which plainly represents the Pledged Account.  Another note of Mr Brügelmann’s at about that time refers to the GEM platform – “new account for Alex”.  As Mr Brügelmann said, Mr Vik was a man with many ideas who threw them out and looked to see if they could be implemented.  There was thus a proposal for a separate FXPB account or sub-account in GEM, alongside that of Mr Said’s for Mr Vik, even at the time when the 2008 Agreements were being finalised and implemented.  That proposal was at all times separate from the Equities PBA and the trading under it but the idea was that, if a new FXPB account for Mr Vik could be brought into existence, the FX trades which he was doing could be put under that umbrella as opposed to the Equities PBA. </p>

It is unclear whether Mr Said was referring to the Equities PBA or a distinct FIPBA/FXPBA.  The answer he received was that his own trading would be kept separate from that of Mr Vik and there was then discussion of a separate account for Mr Vik in New York for FX Prime Brokerage transactions or of two sub-accounts, one designated Alex and one designated Klaus.  Mr Said pointed out that additional collateral would be required for this latter proposal to work above and beyond the US$35 million in Switzerland and Mr Brügelmann’s response was to say that their FX positions and collateral would have to be entirely separate.  It was unclear how any trades which Mr Said might then want to do in fixed income swap business might be collateralised under the FIPB/FXPB arrangement.   </p>

On 7th February Mr Said emailed Mr Vik to say that Mr Brügelmann had just called and that the Equities PBA was in place.  He continued: “Positions are being moved over (your positions that is – mine have to stay separate because I am located in the US and this is a London law agreement – don’t ask me, but apparently that’s the way it is).”  In the email, Mr Said went on to say that Mr Vik would be able to book trades, “anything really”, into the account and although it was not as highly automated as his own agreement which catered only for FX it was a much more flexible, robust and collateral efficient way of doing things.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Mr Brügelmann the FIPB agreement proved to be problematic because FIPB did not want to take on the business which appeared to involve limited income and additional work in monitoring the trades and margining.  There was an issue as to which of FIPB and GPF would take the risk of a Counterparty failure and a need for a Service Level Agreement to set this out.  FIPB was interested in high volume trading only and Mr Vik appeared only to wish to carry out the occasional trade.  A suggestion that the FXPBA be amended to add in FIPB products also proved fruitless.   </p>

The email exchanges between Mr Vik and Mr Said show an awareness on their part that existing positions on Mr Vik’s trades could either be left where they were or moved over.  They both understood fully that Mr Vik’s FX trades were not being then booked alongside Mr Said’s FX trades or margined by reference to the Pledged Account.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The idea of an SHI parent account which housed two sub-accounts through which Mr Said and Mr Vik would trade respectively, collateralised by the Pledged Account, created an obvious problem.  Mr Said was margined by the VaR method and Mr Vik was not.  Moreover, the senior personnel in FXPB considered NOP to be a better method of reflecting risk than VaR and Mr Said was known not to want to move away from VaR margining on his portfolio.  The system for sub-accounts on DBAG’s system was set up for NOP margining, not VaR margining, so that an alternative structure with separate pools of collateral for each of the two sub-accounts would not resolve the problem.  On 16th April 2008 Mr Brügelmann told Mr Vik in an email that he realised that things had been dragging on for far too long but the sub-account margining facility only operated on NOP and although efforts were being made to modify the systems, “realistically we are looking at another delay of 2-3 months”.  He said that if the SHI account was moved to NOP margining, sub-accounts could be set up at once and all that would be required was an amended CSA.  Mr Said, who was copied into the email, responded to say that moving everything to NOP was not an option.  He asked if Mr Vik could be set up on NOP separately as an interim solution until the VaR methodology problem was resolved.  If that meant Mr Vik posting separate collateral, that would probably not be a problem as an interim solution since he was already posting collateral in his PB account (referring to the Equities PB Account).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In response Mr Brügelmann said that a stand alone account could be set up on NOP for Mr Vik which would require a separate CSA and separate collateral “via internal transfer from his existing equity PB account”.  Efforts to achieve this however foundered because Mr Brügelmann was informed that it was not possible to have two separate FXPB accounts under the name of the same legal entity (which was doubtless why sub-accounts had been suggested in the first place).  The obvious solution to this was to create a new FXPB account, margined by NOP in the name of a separate legal entity.  At a meeting between Mr Brügelmann and Mr Vik on 7th May, in the context of discussions about the adequacy of the margin figures for Mr Said’s trading, and against the background of an internal agreement that SHI should, so far as was possible, be moved to NOP margining, the idea of using a separate legal entity emerged, though there was an issue between Mr Brügelmann and Mr Vik as to which of the two made the suggestion.  Each said that the other had.  On 26th June 2008 Mr Brügelmann, by email, referred to the meeting and the agreement of Mr Vik to provide the name of the separate legal entity for the FX Prime Brokerage account for him.  On 8th July 2008 Mr Vik supplied the name of Beatrice.   </p>

SHI, in its closing submissions, suggested that the solution solved Mr Brügelmann’s problems and meant that he did not need to tell Mr Vik about the way in which his current FX transactions were being handled.  This idea is absurd in the light of the exchanges to which I have already referred and what follows.  Mr Brügelmann had no reason to hide the situation from Mr Vik who knew that this was the culmination of the various attempts which had been made to set him up with his own FX Prime Brokerage account in circumstances where he had been conducting trades with DBAG alone, without any intermediation, and had not been trading with third parties under Mr Said’s FXPBA or by reference to the Pledged Account collateral, which would have been insufficient for the size of trades he had been conducting.   </p>

This meant that Mr Vik would post NOK and all P&amp;L would be converted into NOK at maturity.  The email went on to say that “once the set-up is complete, all open positions will be transferred from Equities PB to the new FXPB account”, thus again setting out their mutual understanding that Mr Vik’s existing FX trading was being effected on the GPF account.  On 13th October when asked by Mr Vik how it would work to transfer all positions to Beatrice, Mr Brügelmann confirmed that there was no problem in moving FX positions through novation but that there would be a need to transfer cash to the Beatrice account on the same day that the positions were moved.  He said he would send him a transfer request to sign.  In a further exchange that day, Mr Vik asked what accounts he had and what their individual legal status and function were.

In August 2008, the MTM on his short USD/NOK position deteriorated significantly so that by mid-August the MTM of his FX transactions gave rise to a negative figure of about US$120 million and by 10th September about US$250 million.  It is inconceivable that Mr Vik could have considered at this stage that his FX transactions were supported by collateral in the Pledged Account, even allowing for the profits that Mr Said had made by August 2008, on top of the US$35 million originally allocated.  In cross-examination he accepted that the surplus over the US$35 million in the Pledged Account which related to Mr Said’s trading could at most have been US$35-40 million in September.  By 7th October, in a document handed to Mr Vik by Mr Brügelmann, the MTM of his FX trading gave rise to a negative figure of some US$290 million whilst the total balance on the Pledged Account was only US$67 million.   </p>

By 24th July a decision had been taken to raise the margin rate from 5% to 10% on the large USD/NOK transactions.  The effect of implementing the increase was the application, in accordance with ROR, of a rate of 8.7% on all USD exposure.  Mr Brügelmann was tasked to inform Mr Vik, but he never did so, hoping that the new FXPB account for Mr Vik would shortly be in operation and knowing that no margin call was imminent on the new basis.  This is an example of Mr Brügelmann not wanting to create issues with Mr Vik and being unwilling as Relationship Manager to be the bearer of bad news.  The situation on Mr Vik’s FX trading with the NOK was however rapidly to deteriorate in August/September.   </p>

As Mr Vik well knew, he had at this stage a very large short USD/long NOK position in his FX trading.  The table to which the first few lines of the email referred set out his margin equity in cash and securities before deducting from it his current FX losses of NOK 0.877 billion (equivalent to approximately US$125 million) and then adding in the realised sums from closure of some of Mr Vik’s futures positions.  The adjusted margin equity was NOK 4.681 billion whilst the margin requirement was set out by reference to long and short equities, (including equities futures) bonds, FX and “special” items as described in the email.  The margin deficit on this basis was NOK 114 million (NOK 4.795m – NOK 4.681m) but an inflow of NOK 115 million was due from the sale of equities by Harald Hanssen. </p>

Notwithstanding his protestations that he read this and earlier emails on his Blackberry and on this occasion he was climbing mountains in South America, the importance of this email was plain, particularly bearing in mind his desire not to get close to a margin call.  He must have appreciated, on reading the email, that his FX transactions, his equity transactions, his bond transactions and his futures transactions were being aggregated for margin purposes in the GPF account and that the reason for the deterioration in his margin situation on that account was his FX position (negative MTM of NOK 2.686 bn) and in particular his USD/NOK trades.

For Mr Vik to have taken such action, on his own evidence, requires him to have read the email with some care.  Despite his attempts in his first witness statement to advance an alternative interpretation, it is plain what this email meant.  As Mr Vik himself recognised in cross-examination, his big assets were expressed in Euros and US Dollars, meaning the F&amp;O positions, and the problem was self-evidently with his FX trading with long positions in NOK and other currencies against the rising US Dollar.

His exchanges with DNB reveal that there was a further NOK 853 million held on account there and that realising the CD would produce 99.907% of the total figure.

It is true to say that each contains its own margining provisions as set out in section 17 of this judgment.  SHI draws attention to the different provisions as to what constitutes eligible margin under each of the agreements and the different title regimes which operate in relation to margin supplied.   </p>

He might well not have understood the intricacies of the cross margining provisions but, as with his trading at DBS, he knew and accepted that there was a single pool of collateral which was available for his trading on the GPF platform, whether it be in FX, Equities or Futures.  He was untroubled by the details of margining as long as he was no worse off after transfer of his trading from DBS to DBAG.  In the end, whether or not there was express agreement to cross margining is not of importance.  Whether it was cross margining or netting of aggregate obligations is neither here nor there in the overall context of this dispute because what matters is whether or not the parties agreed that Mr Vik’s FX trading should be conducted under the Equities PBA or whether it was governed by the FXPBA.   </p>

The exact mechanism of cross-margining or aggregation of margining is neither here nor there for this purpose although SHI sought to dwell upon the complexities in the application of cross-margining rules in the ROR and the manner in which the DBX system operated to put these into effect.  Whether or not there was full or partial cross-margining in the sense of transactions in one asset class being treated as a hedge for trading of assets in another class or whether there was merely an aggregation of the margin requirements of each class to produce a composite figure is ultimately irrelevant for current purposes.  What matters, in the light of SHI’s case on this point, is whether or not Mr Vik’s FX transactions fell to be margined under the FXPBA, the FX ISDA and its annexes by reference to the Pledged Account.  In such circumstances margin calls would have been made in respect of Mr Vik’s FX trading under those agreements, regardless of the margin calls which were made in October in respect of Mr Said’s FX trading.   </p>

It was, he said, a question for the lawyers.  SHI’s argument therefore depends entirely upon the terms of the first Amendment Agreement dated as of 22nd November 2006 to the Equities ISDA and the terms of the Schedule to the FX ISDA of the same date, which provide for FX Transactions and Currency Options to be governed by the FX ISDA and for other transactions to be governed by the Equities ISDA of May 8th 2006, “unless otherwise agreed”.   </p>

At the time, there were discussions about a separate FXPB account or sub-account for Mr Vik as well as an FIPB account or a combination of the two and it was hoped that one of these proposals could be put into effect for Mr Vik’s FX trading, which had previously taken place through DBS with DBAG alone.  He had no give-up facility for his FX trading at DBS and none at DBAG, as he well knew.  The purpose of the different proposals and the ultimate Beatrice solution, which was never put into effect, was to give him this facility, as he well knew.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">In the meantime, the vast majority of his assets were moved from DBS to the GPF platform and constituted collateral for the equities trading managed by Mr Hanssen and Mr Vik’s trading in equities, futures and options and swaps.  Self-evidently, if Mr Vik was to conduct FX trading, that had to be collateralised also and Mr Vik was always insistent, on his own case, that Mr Said’s trading and allocated capital should remain separate from his own trading.  There was, therefore, only one way in which Mr Vik could carry out separately collateralised FX trading with DBAG, absent any fresh contract, and that was through the Equities PBA.  The emails from Mr Brügelmann to Mr Vik in February 2008 relating to the transfer of assets from DBS to DBAG and in relation to margining of equities, FX and F&amp;O made the position abundantly clear.   </p>

The exchanges of emails and the whole course of conduct between the parties from February through to October 2008 is only consistent with such an agreement having been made.  As all the evidence shows, at no time could Mr Vik have considered that his FX trading was being conducted under any other agreement and specifically not under the FXPBA, the FX ISDA and CSA by reference to the Pledged Account. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Vik accepted that limited FX transactions could take place in the equities account for the purpose of purchasing foreign currencies to purchase foreign shares, or for hedging exposure to foreign currencies in relation to shares held in foreign companies and gave the example in his witness statement of purchasing shares in a Korean ship building company which would require the purchase of Korean Won and a possible desire to hedge the exposure to the Won by entering into an equal and off-setting FX forward transaction.  He said in cross-examination that he drew a distinction between FX transactions for the purposes of purchasing or hedging foreign currency shares on the one hand and “speculative FX transactions” on the other.  In his witness statement he distinguished between the former and the “large directional FX positions such as those that I was taking for SHI (which had nothing to do with its equities positions)”.  There is no doubt that the former type of FX transaction was the type of transaction that was ordinarily transacted on the GPF platform which was essentially equitiesbased.  The GPF platform could accommodate large directional trades but was not designed with that in mind.  The former type of transaction would attract crossmargining benefits if there was any hedging effect, whilst the latter would be much less likely to do so unless specifically concluded with a hedging object in mind.  Yet the effect of SHI’s case is that all FX transactions conducted by Mr Vik would fall under the aegis of the FXPBA, a conclusion that runs directly counter to Mr Vik’s evidence and would have created enormous problems in the context of a purchase of foreign shares of the kind to which Mr Vik referred and in the context of his standing instructions to Mr Brügelmann to convert surplus in the GPF account into NOK.  Since Mr Vik wished his available cash to be held in NOK, there was a need for spot trades to be conducted in order to make a payment required in a different currency such as US Dollars or Euros in order to post margin in accordance with ROE requirements for the F&amp;O trades.  Equally, sums held in other currencies could not be converted into NOK as Mr Vik desired.   </p>

As he said the only person he really had contact with was Mr Brügelmann and there can be no doubt that, by reason of the course of conduct of the account by Mr Brügelmann on Mr Vik’s instructions, it was agreed between them that these types of trades could be effected on the Equities PB account.   </p>

The 2008 Agreements were executed and the GPF account opened on that basis with a letter of authority given to Mr Brügelmann to give instructions for SHI in relation to trades under those agreements.  Mr Vik approved the transfer of assets from DBS to DBAG on the terms of the emails to which I have earlier referred and Mr Vik thereafter gave frequent instructions to Mr Brügelmann for him to execute trades in relation to those agreements which Mr Brügelmann did and which resulted in bookings by DBAG and margining on that basis.

The ROR provides for netting as between certain classes of assets and not between others.

There would be little or no point in SHI’s argument without it being said that there was a trading limit or limited pool of collateral available for any particular class of trading which is of course what is alleged in relation to Mr Vik’s FX transactions but not in respect of his/SHI’s Equities or F&amp;O transactions.  As I have rejected SHI’s allegations in relation to the PAL or any other limit operating in respect of Mr Vik’s FX transactions and the allegation that they fell to be margined under the FXPBA and the FX ISDA to which it referred, it appears to me to be of no consequence whether there is truly cross-margining of different asset classes or aggregation of separate margin calculations, unless it is being said that there is a </p>

The auto sweep operated to ensure that sufficient cash was held within the F&amp;O accounts to cover ROE margin requirements, not DBAG’s margin requirements, and the cash held for this purpose in the separate accounts was treated as part of the margin equity by DBX so there was no question of any duplication in DBAG’s margin requirements.

In consequence of this there were two F&amp;O accounts, an F&amp;O Equities Account and an F&amp;O Non-Equities Account on GPF, with a third account, the F&amp;O Family Account, which was a parent account showing the aggregate of the cash balances and positions in the two child accounts.

The key accounts were in fact the Financed Account, the Non-Financed Account (where assets did not qualify for financing) and the Roll-Up Account.  Both the Financed and Roll-Up Accounts were set for cross-margining of FX and F&amp;O positions whereas the Legal Entity Account, to which, on Mr Patel’s evidence, no reference should have been made for margining purposes, did not.  Mr Patel’s evidence was clear.  Ms Borque’s evidence was that she referred to the Roll-Up, Financed and Non-Financed Accounts for margin purposes and Ms Carroll said that she would use the Financed and Non-Financed Accounts, although there is evidence of her and others wrongly referring to the Legal Entity Account in October 2008.  None of this however affects the essential questions which fall for determination by me since none of these persons had any dealings with Mr Vik, made any agreement with him or shared any understanding with him and DBAG’s set up was designed to provide for full cross margining. </p>

It could not be used to aggregate the margin requirements from the Financed and Non-Financed Accounts and its function was to provide a record of assets recorded in CPORT DW.  It was originally set to show zero margin so that it would be obvious that it was not to be referred to for margin purposes and many emails made that point.  As a result of experimentation with CalcTypes, Mr Patel found that the best way of achieving the zero figure was to use CalcType 73 which coincidentally was the CalcType which excluded F&amp;O and FX positions from cross margining.  Although SHI considered this significant, it also excluded equity specials, bonds and currency exposures which SHI accept should be cross margined so the point does not support SHI’s argument.   </p>

This was probably due to a system-wide override such as might occur if DBAG had decided that a 100% margin rate should apply to particular assets in a given jurisdiction.  In Mr Johansson’s witness statement, he said that his recollection was that he downloaded all available DBX margin reports but that cannot have been the case as the Structured Data demonstrates that the Financed, NonFinanced and Roll-Up Accounts were accessible throughout 2008.  The Legal Entity Account was not available to SHI on Global Prime more recently since, in June 2012, prior to giving SHI access to it again, DBAG set the “client access” settings in DBX to “admin only” for the Legal Entity Account because it was considered irrelevant to </p>

Whilst not spelt out in any detail, it was SHI’s case that there was a further “informal prime brokerage relationship” between SHI and DBS so that there was a further back-to-back transaction between DBS and SHI, corresponding to the Counterparty Transaction and the offsetting transaction between DBAG and DBS.  In consequence SHI contended that it had no liability to DBAG for any losses incurred on Mr Said’s transactions and DBAG had no entitlement to claim collateral from SHI in respect of any of them.  In these circumstances the margin calls of October 2008 were calculated on an entirely incorrect basis and were made in breach of contract.   </p>

SHI’s argument is based upon the names used by DBAG in its internal records and accounts, rather than any contractual documentation or exchanges between the parties.

That authority specifically related to the conclusion of transactions with DBAG, without any reference to DBS.  The FXPBA authorised SHI to act as agent for DBAG in executing FX Transactions and currency options with Counterparties and provided by Clause 4 that “[i]n connection with entering into each Counterparty Transaction, DBAG shall contemporaneously therewith enter into an equal and offsetting transaction or transactions with … Agent” (defined as SHI).

The Trade Confirmations referred to the party to the transaction with DBAG as “Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc.” for direct trades and as “Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc. Indirect” for indirect trades.  The name at the top of the confirmation to which the confirmation was addressed was “Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc.” with the postal address of DBS and on many if not all of the confirmations, Mr Said’s name and fax number.  The opening wording of the document stated that the purpose of it was to “confirm the terms and conditions of the transaction entered into” between DBAG and “Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc.”.

The FXPBA itself provided that each Agent Transaction or Option was subject to and governed by the applicable ISDA Master Agreement between DBAG and SHI, including the CSA which was a part of it.  It went on to provide in Clause 4 that SHI should be required to post collateral with respect to its obligations under the FX ISDA in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CSA and that any breach of the FXPBA by SHI (but not by DBAG) should constitute an Event of Default under the FX ISDA.

Whether or not Clause 4 of the FXPBA can be read as providing that, when Mr Said bound DBAG to a Counterparty Transaction with another bank, there automatically sprang into existence an equal and offsetting transaction between DBAG and SHI, the effect of the Clause was that DBAG and SHI agreed that there should be such a transaction.  The notion that, instead of this, a transaction came into existence between DBAG and DBS with a further transaction between DBS and SHI is fanciful.  No-one at DBS was ever involved in the creation of such a transaction and Mr Said, self-evidently, had no authority to bind either DBS to DBAG or SHI to DBS.  When Mr Said signed transactions in the name of Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc., he was doing so as agent for SHI in its trading relationship with DBAG and not for any other entity.    </p>

PBR” or “Goldman Sachs International AC Sebastian Holdings Inc. PBR”.  None of these appellations are the most obvious form of words to use for the transactions in question but the initials “PBR” are a clear reference to the Prime Broker position of DBAG.  SHI do not contend that Mr Said did not commit DBAG to concluded trades with the Counterparties such as CS or GS, in such a way as to bind DBAG; nor does SHI submit that the reference to “AC Sebastian Holdings Inc. PBR” alters the nature of that transaction.  The manner in which the Counterparty Transaction leg and the Agent Transaction leg referred to the parties is clearly designed to show that the trades take place under the FXPBA and the FX ISDA between DBAG and SHI and the reference to DBS can only be explained on the basis that the collateral was being held by DBS in respect of the transactions.   </p>

It is to be inferred that it was because the FX Prime Brokerage Division of [DBAG] did not accept SHI as a direct customer for the trading of FX transactions through its Prime Brokerage Division.  In any event, the relationship was set up so that [DBS], rather than SHI, would be the counterparty to Mr Said’s transactions”.  It is thus contended that, without any agreement on the part of SHI or DBS, by some form of unilateral decision, DBAG decided to depart from the contractual structure and to conclude Agent Transactions with DBS with the inherent suggestion that DBS entered into a similar offsetting transaction with SHI.   </p>

It would be contrary to business common sense for DBAG to decide that it would not contract with SHI but with DBS instead without any contract with DBS or without any contract between DBS and SHI and without any agreed collateral in respect of such trading.   </p>

Mr Manrique explained that the form used in the trade confirmations was one that was commonly used for DBS PWM clients, a point which is exemplified by the long form counterparty information recorded within RMS (“Deutsche Bank Suisse SA AC Sebastian Holdings Inc.”) and the “short RMS Code for the FXPB Account” as “MTS Sebastian”.  The reference to “MTS” is a reference to Margin Trading Switzerland which illustrates the significance of the reference to DBS, as the place where margin was held.  No such reference appears in relation to SHI’s other trading with DBAG in 2008, where there was no margin held in Switzerland against the trading of Mr Hanssen or Mr Vik in equities, F&amp;O or FX.  </p>

Various documents appear to show that some individuals within DBAG thought that DBS might be acting as agent for SHI but this was not the basis upon which the Prime Brokerage relationship was put in place and structured.  There can be no doubt that individuals within DBAG were muddled in their thinking and that the names given to various accounts or identity codes do not assist in clarifying this confusion.  Some of this nomenclature may have reference to projected Service Level Agreements between DBAG and DBS as to which of them would be responsible for any counterparty risk in the event of default by SHI, but this again cannot affect the contractual interrelationship between DBAG and SHI.  Revenue sharing agreements are likewise immaterial in this context.  The applicability of any of the existing SLAs or draft SLAs to a Prime Brokerage relationship was not a model of clarity but this takes SHI nowhere.  Whatever account names were used, with references to DBS and Switzerland, “NOTE TEXTS” referred to the client being owned by PWM, by whom “Know Your Client and credit checks” had been done.

It was maintained that the funds were not under SHI’s control and were not freely transferrable by it because the accounts were those of DBS and not SHI.  This is not sustainable.  At all times SHI was able to give instructions in relation to the accounts in which funds from its transactions were held and there has never been any suggestion that its instructions would not have been implemented, when given.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Although the experts differed as to the date when Mr Said’s FX trading margin requirement first exceeded US$35 million, they each agreed that it was exceeded on occasion in 2007 and was substantially exceeded in April 2008 and from July 2008 onwards.  A table and graphs showing the forensic accountants’ respective calculations is attached as Annex 3 to this judgment.  As appears from earlier sections in this judgment, DBAG’s systems could not cope with many of the OCTs and all the EDTs.  Many of the former were therefore inadequately booked and all the EDTs were inadequately booked and were not the subject of contractual valuation or margining from the date of the conclusion of the first two on 19th February 2008.  It is unclear exactly which EDTs remained unbooked as at the dates of the alleged representations but Mr Walsh’s deliberate practice of leaving them unbooked until knock-out appears to have begun after obtaining Mr Kim’s sign off to EDTs 12-14 dated 20th June.  In all probability, as at the end of June/beginning of July, EDT 15 is likely to have been unbooked.  As at 6th October 2008, it is known that there were nine unbooked EDTs which Mr Walsh proceeded to book over the next three days. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">SHI alleges that Mr Vik relied upon each of these representations by continuing to permit Mr Said to trade and without intervening to ensure that his trading stayed within the US$35 million.  As I have found that this figure did not represent a contractual limit on Mr Said’s trading but was merely the amount of margin that had been allocated to it, small and temporary excesses are of much less significance than SHI suggests.  If Mr Vik had been told of significant additional margin requirements, the question then arises as to what he would or would not have done in such circumstances.  In my judgment, Mr Vik would not have been unduly concerned, if Mr Said’s trading appeared profitable, as long as the margin requirement remained within the sums in the Pledged Account, regardless of the Allocated Portion, or within the total represented by the sums in that account and the profits which he had taken out of it, namely US$30 million in 2007 and approximately US$75 million in 2008 i.e. at least US$140 million.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">That point is made good by reference to Mr Vik’s approach to the first margin call where, on his own evidence, he wondered if Mr Said’s profits should be taken into account when assessing the appropriate figure for the CLA or PAL.  Furthermore, he said he was content to pay the first margin call on the basis that the VaR element in it would “come back” once the trades had closed down.  Mr Said’s evidence on deposition also falls to be taken into account in this context.  In his view, if the MTM requirements had been US$150-200 million, his trading strategy would have been seen as untenable.  Mr Vik’s general approach can be seen from his email to Mr Said in early 2008 in which he said that Mr Said should not feel constrained by the amount of capital allocated to him.  At levels of US$150-200 million margin, in my judgment Mr Vik would have required Mr Said to reduce positions but, given his general approach when faced with hundreds of millions of dollars of losses in October 2008, he would undoubtedly have worked together with Mr Said, as he did in October, to close positions in the most judicious manner possible to bring the figure down.  On the forensic experts’ figures, it seems that, depending whose figures are accepted, these levels of US$150-$200 million would be approached in late August/September 2008 with a mid-September date for Mr Said’s account showing an overall loss.  Although the market was tight and illiquid at that stage, there would have been greater opportunities to close down trades at lesser loss than was ultimately the case in midOctober.</p>

Those two instruments were the key instruments relating to Mr Said’s FX trading which governed the interrelationship between DBAG and SHI, with the FX ISDA, its Schedule and CSA governing the individual transactions under it.  It is not said that any particular individual transaction was induced by the misrepresentation.  What is said is that the continuance of trading under the FXPBA and the Said Letter of Authority was so induced.

As shown by the documents, the meeting was organised so that Mr Vik could meet Mr Schiraldi of the PIC Desk who would be executing Mr Vik’s FX trades from then on and so that Mr Vik could talk about trading strategies with knowledgeable persons at DBAG.  From Mr Brügelmann’s perspective there were other issues which he wished to cover but the first, as he mentioned in an email to Mr Schiraldi, was the need to update Mr Vik about the progress made in relation to setting him up with an FX and/or FI PB account and the difficulties represented by the VaR/NOP issue in that context.  The second arose as the result of his conversations with FXPB personnel on 2nd May, which was the question of reviewing the VaR parameters under which Mr Said operated if he was to continue on VaR, because of the concern expressed by Mr Spokoyny and CRM personnel.  The two issues were linked because, if SHI was to have two sub-accounts for FXPB trading, DBAG required them to be on an NOP basis, because of the configuration of DBAG’s systems. NOP was DBAG’s favoured system for capturing the risks because Mr Spokoyny and others considered that the VaR model did not protect DBAG sufficiently.  Mr Brügelmann was mandated to explain to Mr Vik that the risks inherent in the FXPB account margined under VaR were greater than the current VaR methodology suggested, given the type of positions that he had and recent changes in volatility, in the hope of persuading Mr Vik that, if he wanted to have an FI and FX PB account himself, Mr Said’s trading would have to be moved from VaR to NOP, which would probably mean that more collateral would be required.  The perceived “gap risk” in the VaR parameters currently applied to Mr Said might thus be overcome.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Brügelmann’s evidence, in his witness statement, was that, as a result of what he had learned in his telephone call from FXPB personnel, he informed Mr Vik that the margin terms on the FX account and the amount of collateral held were not adequate due to the deviation in Mr Said’s investment pattern, compared to that at the time when the FXPB account had been established.  Mr Vik’s response was that this should be taken up with Mr Said, which is what Mr Spokoyny subsequently did.  Mr Brügelmann said that he did not refer to the debate about different margining methodologies, as between NOP and VaR.  There was no need to do so as the issue about sub-accounts was resolved by a discussion on that day between him and Mr Said. One or other of them came forward with the suggestion that Mr Vik could have a separate FXPB account from Mr Said in the name of a different company, which solved the technical difficulties of setting up sub-accounts in DBAG’s systems with different margining methodologies.  Moving Mr Said off VaR, to which he was known to be resistant, could no longer be suggested by reference to this problem but, on the evidence, I have no doubt at all that there was a reference to DBAG’s view that the collateral for Mr Said’s account was considered insufficient because this was a prime purpose of the meeting and Mr Vik’s response was that this should be discussed with Mr Said, as it later was.  In such circumstances, it does not seem to me likely that Mr Brügelmann would have told Mr Vik that Mr Said’s trading was going well and I accept his evidence to that effect.  Insofar as margin was referred to, it could only have been referred to in the context of the need for some adjustment.  In his deposition Mr Brügelmann had said that he pointed out to Mr Vik that calculations performed by DBAG personnel on a preliminary basis might point to a shortfall in collateral but that there was no discussion of the amount of the potential shortfall.  In his evidence on cross-examination, Mr Brügelmann said that he left Mr Vik with a strong message that there was a problem with the US$35 million as there was a bigger risk in the portfolio, whether he mentioned a number or not.  He also told Mr Vik that </p>

The note continued: “On the subject of FX risk, the client took note of the disparity in results between stress-tested risk calculation and the results produced by the VaR methodology, but demanded that we have that discussion with Klaus Said rather than with him.  He has allocated a US$35 mio risk budget to Klaus and he wants to await the outcome of our discussion with Klaus before deciding whether to explicitly support an increase in his line.” </p>

In crossexamination, as I have said, Mr Brügelmann could not say whether he had mentioned any figure and it was suggested to him that he was reporting to FXPB something that had not happened, particularly as a solution had been reached to the issue of an FXPB account for Mr Vik which meant that there was no longer any need for Mr Said’s account and Mr Vik’s proposed account to be subject to the same margining methodology, namely NOP.  Whilst it may be that in that telephone conversation Mr Brügelmann overstated the position as to what he had said to Mr Vik, the effect of the note of the meeting and the undisputed elements in the evidence of the two protagonists leads me to the clear conclusion that Mr Brügelmann did express DBAG’s concerns about margin requirements for Mr Said’s FX trading, although there was no reference to unbooked EDTs or to “funky transactions”  as such or to problems in valuation and margining of which Mr Brügelmann was unaware.  If he had not done so, there would have been no reason for matters to be taken up with Mr Said in relation to margin. </p>

The thought would simply not have crossed the mind of either at the time, particularly as Mr Vik knew that Mr Brügelmann was a client representative for PWM clients at DBS and was not part of DBAG’s FXPB team.  There was no discussion of booking of particular transactions and nothing which could have led Mr Vik to think that Mr Brügelmann was telling him anything about such matters.  Their conversation proceeded on a much more general level with regard to the totality of Mr Said’s trading and changes in its nature, of which in fact Mr Vik was aware because of his email exchanges about OCTs and EDTs with Mr Said.   </p>

In circumstances where Mr Said, as the authorised agent of SHI, waived any obligation by DBAG to book and report MTM and margin calculations and agreed that reporting of the MTM on EDTs should not take place, because he knew it could not be done accurately, it would be anomalous if a misrepresentation made to another authorised representative of SHI that such duties had been performed could give rise to a different result.  There is a logical distinction between a waiver of an obligation and a representation that the obligation had been performed and different authorised individuals were involved, but the inconsistency involved is apparent and issues of corporate reliance would arise.  </p>

The following day, Mr Brügelmann responded to say that Ms Enger would take care of the balances on Mr Said’s account and asked her to ascertain what the figures were which she duly did.

Mr Said objected to this increase of 150% and, whilst accepting that his existing margin requirement was too low, thought he could do a lot better, by which Mr Spokoyny understood him to mean that he could go elsewhere for a better offer.  Mr Spokoyny then produced a rough idea as to what margin terms of 2.5 x 10 day VaR would produce and Mr Said said he would be happy with a formula that effectively doubled the current collateral requirement, but wanted an historical analysis to ascertain what the effect of the new parameters would be on his portfolio.   </p>

Likewise, in the light of those exchanges, Mr Vik could not have relied upon any representation, knowing that many of Mr Said’s trades were under water and that unwinding everything would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Not only is it inconceivable that Mr Said or Mr Vik could have relied upon any representation made, but it would in any event have been too late to do anything beyond what they did, namely to review the position on each of Mr Said’s trades and decide what was to be done about them, namely whether to put up further margin, close out the trade or work towards closing at the most judicious time.   </p>

The report I received and left with Alex Vik did not, however contain any information regarding the structured option positions.  Very likely these trades were properly booked and were reflected on the TRM FXPB website accessible to his trader, Klaus Said, but for some reason did not appear on the report I received.  The resulting margin call starting October 13th was triggered by the structured options.” </p>

Mr Brügelmann’s evidence was that he told Mr Vik that the discussions within the FX Prime Brokerage team in respect of amendments to the margin calculation had concluded and that new terms had been agreed between them and Mr Said.  There was no discussion of the details of these terms.  In cross-examination he said that, following their meeting in May where he had indicated to Mr Vik that there was a discrepancy between the risk calculations performed and the capital provided, he told Mr Vik that closure had been reached on that subject.  His evidence was, both in his second statement and under cross-examination, that he could not have made any comment about Mr Said’s trading because he had no visibility over the FXPB account.  He was able to comment about Mr Vik’s trading about which he knew, because he had been executing Mr Vik’s instructions and Mr Vik was clearly troubled by the losses which he had been incurring. Mr Brugelmann specifically denied that he had said that Mr Said was doing well and said he could not possibly opine on that subject.  He would hand over printed sheets but he would never comment to Mr Vik on any other person’s trading, whether it be that of Mr Bokias, Mr Hanssen or Mr Said.   </p>

Mr Brügelmann knew nothing save that no margin call had been made and that new margin parameters had been agreed.  This is borne out by Mr Brügelmann’s email that evening to Mr Halfmann saying that, having met with Mr Vik that day, Mr Vik was working on the assumption that the risk in the portfolio managed by Mr Said was now captured adequately with the new margin terms.  It also may explain the email that he sent to Dr Koch on 16th October in which he told him that he had handed over figures to Mr Vik at the meeting and had said that the account was “in good order from a margin viewpoint”. </p>

He could not therefore have relied on it and over the course of the next few days that position was reinforced by all that Mr Said told him.  On the experts’ calculations, the collateral requirement of Mr Said’s portfolio was of the order of US$650 million on 6th October 2008.  Mr Said and Mr Vik may not have realised the size of it in absolute terms but they both knew that the MTM figures on the MS BRL EDTs alone gave rise to figures way in excess of US$35 million.  Mr Vik could not have relied on anything Mr Brügelmann said about Mr Said’s margin in these circumstances where he was in discussion with Mr Said.  Moreover, Mr Brügelmann knew nothing of booking, valuing or margining problems at this stage whereas Mr Said did.  Mr Brügelmann would have had no reason to think that anything that he did say about Mr Said’s trading by reference to the figures on GEM was wrong, but Mr Said would have known and Mr Vik was in receipt of information from Mr Said about the problems he was having.   </p>

SHI’s complaint is that it continued to allow Mr Said to enter into transactions because of communications made in the shape of implied representations, but it does not allege that these constituted investment advice or recommendations to do so.  Nonetheless, in the FX ISDA Schedule, it acknowledged that no communication from DBAG could be deemed an assurance or guarantee of the expected results of that transaction and specifically that DBAG made no representations whatsoever as to the effect, consequence or benefit of any transaction, which would include its impact upon the overall valuation of its trades and margining of its portfolio.  Specifically, SHI also acknowledged that it was not relying upon any view of DBAG with respect to any transaction or the FX ISDA itself and that transactions concluded under it were the result of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties.  In these circumstances it is hard to see how any of these complaints, even if well-grounded in fact, could succeed in law.   </p>

No margin requirements were set out which included these trades until the margin calls were made and, as appears below, those margin calls included approximate figures for the EDTs which were not calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions, although in fact they amounted to less than the amounts which the experts now agree DBAG could have called, had they calculated margin with the use of the computer programmes now available to their experts.   </p>

A further number of EDTs were not booked until shortly before the time of the margin calls because of the same booking problems and because they had not knocked out before that.  Thus they were not the subject of MTM figures or margin calculations reported to Mr Said or reported at all at any time before the margin calls of October 2008.

This was a deliberate choice on the part of Mr Vik after lengthy consideration and Mr Said’s original pitch to hold onto the positions and put up margin as required until the market improved.  The actual amount to which DBAG was contractually entitled was not known to anyone at DBAG at that time, let alone to Mr Said or Mr Vik, because the necessary calculations were complex and the DBAG systems were incapable of making them.

Mr Vik was the sort of man who was well able to fend for himself and to argue his corner.  I conclude that the only reason for the duress argument is that, without it, the payment of over US$500 million to DBAG is so inconsistent with SHI’s other defences that it was appreciated that they were most unlikely to succeed.  The duress argument is a vain attempt to explain away the reality of the situation which was that, at the time Mr Vik authorised these payments, he knew that SHI had been receiving a free ride on collateral for a year, that DBAG had been unable to value or margin the EDTs accurately, if at all, and that Mr Said’s authorised trading had brought about huge loss-making positions in the once in a century market which had emerged in October 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It is impossible to see how these mistakes on the part of DBAG, albeit involving massive amounts, could either vitiate payments made by SHI or impact on debts which were due from SHI.  What actually happened was that SHI’s GPF accounts were debited with sums which were then credited to SHI’s FXPB trading account, thereby creating a deficit in the GPF account which would otherwise have been a deficit in Mr Said’s trading account.  The sums debited were sums owing from SHI to DBAG on the findings that I have made and in those circumstances there can be no question of unjust enrichment.  The mistake on SHI’s part was, at best, a mistake as to the assets available to it in the GPF account.  It was not a mistake as to the nature of the payment, the nature of transactions under which the payments were made or as to the amount owing.  Whether or not a request to transfer sums and the forwarding of instructions to be signed in order to effect that transfer can amount to a representation of available sums in an account, there is no suggestion of any detrimental reliance or alteration of position by SHI other than the signing of the instructions which had the effect, supposedly, of paying money that was owing to DBAG.  Mr Vik has said in evidence that SHI will pay whatever sums are found to be due and owing to DBAG and there can be no relevant damage caused by any implied misrepresentation and no basis for saying that DBAG had been unjustly enriched.  Notwithstanding the width of dicta in <span style="font-style:italic">Barclays v Simms</span> [1980] QB 677 and more recent decisions, there is no basis for a restitution claim and no claim for damages will run either. </p>

He knew that Mr Said’s FX trading was conducted under the FXPBA and the FX ISDA with its Schedule and CSA.  (Indeed, on his own case he thought that his FX trading was conducted under those agreements too, although I have found against him on this).  He asked Mr Brügelmann on 13th October about the different accounts that SHI had and their separate legal identity and was told of those in the GPF account in London and of the two FXPB accounts, one of which was for Mr Said’s FX trading and the other, the Beatrice account, was for his own FX trading though it remained unopened.   </p>

Mr Brügelmann sent him the copy agreements and statements that he had available the next day, which related to Mr Vik’s trading under the title “DB London Equity Prime Brokerage Account – Agreements and Statements” and “DB London NOK Swap Position”.  The enclosures were the Equities ISDA and CSA, the listed F&amp;O Agreement, the Equities PBA and the Master Netting Agreement.  There was no suggestion at all that the margin calls were being made under those agreements which had been forwarded, and the FXPBA was not enclosed as Mr Brügelmann did not have an electronic copy available and did not acquire one until virtually the end of the month.  It seems from an email disclosed by Mr Vik (without those surrounding it) that in the preceding days Mr Vik had been perusing copies of the Agreements which he had, including an incomplete draft of the FXPBA which he contrasted with the more recent agreements with DBAG on the GPF account.  Whatever documents Mr Vik then supplied to Mr MacDonald of Wilmer Hale for advice, Mr Brügelmann had not told him, and no-one else had told him, that margin was being demanded under the terms of the Agreements which had been sent to him.

Mr Vik wanted positions to be closed out by Mr Said on a daily basis and knew that was taking place.  He knew that premium would be payable in respect of each day’s closures.  Moreover, collateral requirements would, as he knew, change from day to day with movements in market prices so that, as long as any positions remained open, there was always the possibility of further margin calls being made, whatever amount was required in the first call on 13th October.

Furthermore, on 16th October Mr Vik and Mr Said, prior to payment of the third/fourth margin calls, in a telephone conference call with DBAG personnel, made it plain that, as always, they were looking to pay less margin.  They sought and obtained the agreement of DBAG to such lesser margin inasmuch as DBAG agreed not to charge margin on anything other than an MTM basis, foregoing any entitlement to VaR or liquidity add-on.  They therefore knew, in relation to each margin call, that DBAG was not pursuing its full contractual entitlement. </p>

SHI paid five margin calls totalling US$511 million because Mr Vik knew that he had no good reason not to do so, being bound by Mr Said’s trading activities.  It mattered not whether the requirements were expressed in one call, two calls or five calls and in reality both Mr Said and Mr Vik not only sought to reduce margin to the minimum but were pleased when successful in that.  A failure to pay would have constituted an Event of Default with all that followed from that which Mr Vik was keen to avoid in order to close out positions in the manner that he and Mr Said thought best.  He would not have decided to default on the calls and let DBAG close out the positions immediately because he had decided over the weekend of 10th12th October to put up margin so that he and Mr Said remained in control of the decision making on unwinding the loss making positions.   </p>

Until then Mr Vik paid the margin and premium required to close down Mr Said’s unprofitable trading.  There is no reason to think that he would have adopted a different approach had the figures been larger as the forensic accountants say they should have been, since Mr Vik had taken an express decision on Sunday 12th October to wind down the trades in the best way possible, putting up whatever margin was required in order to do so.   </p>

Under the express terms of these instruments, DBAG had no obligation to calculate, notify nor demand margin, in the shape of a “Delivery Amount” although it had the right to do so.  If DBAG chose to exercise that right, then it was obliged to calculate the Delivery Amount in accordance with the contractual methodology and notify SHI of an increase in the Allocated Portion of the Pledged Account and/or demand a transfer of the Delivery Amount into the Pledged Account in order to increase the size of the Allocated Portion.  I have also held that there was an implied term in the FXPBA that DBAG would provide a web reporting service which set out details of the trades concluded, the MTM valuation placed upon those trades by DBAG and the margin calculations relating to the SHI portfolio as a whole, subject to the GEM terms and conditions.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Where “Structured Options” were concerned, the prior consent of DBAG was required before they could become Accepted Transactions.  DBAG was entitled to decline to accept any such trade or to accept it on any terms agreed with SHI.  As set out elsewhere in this judgment, the EDTs were accepted expressly on the basis that they would not be the subject of accurate reporting of their MTM, and by necessary implication would not be included in the margin calculations which were reported.  By both words and conduct Mr Said agreed that nothing need be done about these transactions until knock-out or maturity when they could be cash settled.  Mr Said had the necessary authority from SHI to do this as set out in the Said Letter of Authority.  Moreover the reason for Mr Said’s agreement to waive any requirement that DBAG report accurate MTMs and margin calculations of various EDTs and the Structured Options was that he knew that DBAG’s systems could not cope with them.  He knew that was why they were provided for in the FXPBA in the way they were, as appears from his Timeline. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the implied term with regard to reporting on the web service was waived, the express terms of the FXPBA, the FX ISDA and the CSA must apply.  As I have already held, the provision which entitles DBAG to call for margin is for its own protection.  Paragraph 2(a) of the CSA requires SHI to transfer Eligible Credit Support at a value equal to the applicable Delivery Amount, upon a demand made by DBAG.  The paragraph goes on to define what is the applicable Delivery Amount by reference to the difference between the Credit Support Amount and the value of the Credit Support Balance (the Allocated Portion of the Pledged Account).  There can however be no reason in law why DBAG should not demand a sum less than its full entitlement.  As DBAG would be entitled to waive its entitlement to demand any sum at all, so also it is entitled to waive its right on any day to demand its full contractual entitlement.  This carries with it no obligation to explain that the sum sought is less than the full contractual entitlement for that Valuation Date but, having once waived the right to call for more than the figure demanded on that valuation date, it would not be open to DBAG to ask for more on the same day.  It would however be entitled, on the following day to demand its full contractual entitlement or, once again, less than that if it chose to do so.  This is consistent with DBAG’s entitlement to call for additional collateral under the terms of Part 1(l)(iii) of the Schedule to the FX ISDA where, if DBAG should “for any reason deem that there are insufficient Eligible Assets held pursuant to the terms of the [Pledge Agreement] to satisfy SHI’s obligations” to it, it could give notice and [SHI]’s would then be obliged within two business days to deliver additional collateral assets into the Pledged Account or in some other form satisfactory to DBAG.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is obvious, in my judgment, that a demand for less margin than the full contractual entitlement does not invalidate the margin call itself.  If, as DBAG points out, for any reason DBAG could not calculate margin on a particular transaction, this would not have the effect of debarring it from making a margin call in respect of the balance of the portfolio unless the transaction had an offsetting effect.  Moreover, even if there was a breach of some kind in calling for less than the full contractual entitlement, it would not be possible, in the ordinary way, for the party on the receiving end of the call to show that any loss had been suffered.  In this case, as demand could also have been made under Part 1(l)(iii) of the Schedule to the FX ISDA and I reject Mr Vik’s evidence that he would have acted differently if a demand had been made for the full contractual entitlement under paragraph 2(a) of the CSA, there is no loss suffered at all.   </p>

Mr Spokoyny could only see Resurrecting Fader options in GEM and when Mr Geisker joined the call he said that DBAG had been doing these options for a year and that Mr Quezada was aware of the issue.  It seems that Mr Quezada then joined the call and said that the “structures” did not fit nicely into any system and the issues of booking and margining were then identified for direct and indirect TPFs.  When Mr Walsh was brought into the picture he confirmed that he booked indirect TPFs as Resurrecting Faders and that he thought that direct trades were booked with a Generic Sales Ticket (“GST”) which he guessed did not feed into GEM.  Mr Walsh confirmed that the booking as a Resurrecting Fader did not capture the trade and that DBAG did not necessarily have the correct product type to book it which was why a placeholder was used.  During the course of the Friday Mr Spokoyny came to appreciate that valuation and margining was an issue and sought guidance from Mr Avery in an email.  The intention expressed by Ms Liau on the Friday was to call for an additional US$40 million of margin after the Trade Desk had done a manual calculation for the direct EDTs, which it seems it probably did that day.  The revised margin parameters of 2.5 x 10 day VaR were implemented in GEM on that day but liquidity add-on did not feature in GEM so it would have to be the subject of a manual calculation.   </p>

This was produced by combining the MTM on the Trade Details (Outstanding Trades) Report on GEM of US$62 million with the figure of US$41 million provided by the Trade Desk for the two direct TPFs.

Ms Liau and Mr Kim berated Mr Walsh and it does not appear that Mr Kim and Mr Quezada owned up to the agreement that they had reached between them in June 2008 as to acceptance of the TPFs, whether or not they knew of the total numbers which remained unbooked until October.  Everybody was saying that the trades should not have been taken on at all.  Whilst Mr Walsh said that there had been misunderstandings as to how the approval process for the EDTs was meant to work </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Very shortly after the first margin call was paid, Ms Liau told Mr Brügelmann that there was to be a further margin call of US$212 million which he had trouble understanding and thought that Mr Vik would have trouble understanding.  He said that he had been on the phone to Mr Vik and had told him that Mr Said had put on two option trades at the end of the previous week which had blown up immediately, which was simply passing on what he had been told the previous day.  Mr Brügelmann was not to know that what he had been told was untrue and that Mr Vik himself would have known that it was untrue when it was passed on to him because of his extensive exchanges with Mr Said, his investigation of Mr Said’s outstanding transactions and his knowledge of the bank’s inability to value or margin the EDTs.  Ms Liau then explained that there were three reasons for a further margin call of US$202 million, on top of the US$98 million requested the previous day.  The first was the change in the VaR parameters which had been implemented.  The second was that there were two big options that Mr Said had done the previous week which were not booked until the current week.  The third was that there were eleven other pivot options which had drastically moved against him.  She said that most of the required figure was attributable to the MTM and not to initial margin.  Whilst Ms Liau was doubtless seeking to cover her own back and protect FXPB from internal criticism within DBAG and DBS, it must now have been obvious to her that what she said to Mr Brügelmann might well be passed on to Mr Vik and/or Mr Said who would know at once that there was no truth in what was being said.  It was therefore not only dishonest but stupid.   </p>

In a telephone call between Mr Said, Ms Liau, Mr Spokoyny and Mr Quezada, Mr Said asked if, after this call had gone out, DBAG was comfortable with the figures, absent moves in the market.  Ms Liau said that she was but the numbers that were changing were all mark to market numbers.  She said that he had conducted a lot of indirect trades and they were looking at the MTMs received from the Counterparty banks and to a large extent were relying on them.  Mr Said stated that their marks were pretty accurate and Ms Liau then admitted that she did not have GS’ or CS’ marks for the day and Mr Spokoyny said the marks received represented the position at the end of Friday though there were more recent marks from MS.  The margin call was therefore based on an estimate.   </p>

He knew that the first margin call was well short of the hundreds of millions of dollars that were needed to reflect the true mark to market situation in the light of the MS figures he had received earlier.  He also appreciated when he received the second margin call that it was riddled with errors.  As admitted by Mr Spokoyny in cross-examination the effect of various errors he made was that the margin call was understated by US$197.4 million.  From the terms of the telephone conversation following the margin call, Mr Said knew that DBAG had no MTMs of its own on the indirect trades and had to get them from counterparty banks.  He knew that Mr Spokoyny had made an estimated adjustment on the MTMs received from such banks which were not up to date whilst more recent MTMs were used in respect of the MS TPFs. </p>

On a spreadsheet which Mr Spokoyny sent Mr Costa-Santos, after sending out the second margin call, upon which he set out the numbers used for the call, three of the five MS TPFs had MTMs provided by MS but the other two had zero MTMs because they were being closed out.  Mr Spokoyny said he made an assessment of the open TPF positions by looking at intrinsic values based on a projection of what the settlement amounts would be in the future with possible cross-checking against the MS MTMs.  On the spreadsheet which accompanied the margin call five items appear as positive MTMs when they should be negative, which would have turned the negative MTM of US$111 million into negative US$309 million approximately for the structures included in it.  The indirect TPFs were not included in any calculation of VaR though there was a manual calculation of VaR for the two direct TPFs.  There was no liquidity add-on for any TPF or other options in the second call, merely liquidity add-on for the cash transactions.  Mr Spokoyny did not know why there was a difference between the figures in the first call and second call for liquidity add-on.  As he accepted, the only correct figures in this margin calculation sent to SHI were the first two, for the ondeposit amount and the pending premium.  The remaining six lines were all wrong.   </p>

In the same email he told Mr Brügelmann that he had instructed Mr Said to close out all positions as the opportunities to do that presented themselves, especially the positions that had turned into forwards (showing that he fully understood the nature of the range trades and what had happened to them).  It is clear also from exchanges of emails with Mr Said that he was keeping a close eye on the way Mr Said was closing out positions that day.  From the terms of his conversation with Mr Quezada, Mr Said was in regular discussion with Mr Vik (“we talked about these things nineteen times today”) and he specifically referred to the EUR/NOK position which they had been talking about because it had become effectively “just a straight cash position”.

Mr Spokoyny said that “on the models that we ran … yesterday … versus now … we’re seeing a mark to market decrease of about 40-50 million”.  He then said that with nine structured options still open another US$40 million was required based on VaR calculation.  On being questioned about this by Mr Said Mr Spokoyny said that he would forward a spreadsheet showing the figures.  Mr Spokoyny’s evidence was that the MTM figures for the remaining open TPFs were based on DB Analytics pricing for the first time and the reference in the telephone call to a model being run the previous day was untrue.  The basis of the MTM figures for the TPFs was entirely different on 14th and 15th October.  The spreadsheet which accompanied the call showed sixteen TPFs with a total negative figure of nearly US$300 million, with six left blank, one knocked-out and five closed out with premium due of US$141 million.  The premium due for the three trades closed the previous day was not included, amounting to US$106 million, which should have appeared either as a reduction in the on deposit amount or as an increase in the pending premium figures.  Mr Spokoyny said he was given the figures for these items by Mr Kim or Ms Liau.  He thought the US$40 million VaR for the TPFs was his estimate for the nine outstanding trades, at US$5 million each, rounded down.  The end result was a third margin call of US$124,513,350. </p>

He asked for a report as soon as possible.  Mr Vik, of course, knew that this was not possible because DBAG had not been margining the EDTs for the previous year, as he had been told so by Mr Said.  This became an ongoing theme of the conversations between Mr Vik and DBAG who studiously ignored the request and continued to maintain the position that everything had been properly valued and margined, in circumstances where Mr Quezada and Mr Walsh knew (even if no-one else did) that Mr Said was fully aware of DBAG’s systems’ inability to cope with the EDTs and it would it be logical to think that Mr Vik knew too.  From the terms of conversations between Mr Quezada and Mr Said on the telephone, it seems that Mr Quezada was not at all sure how much Mr Vik knew, and Mr Said maintained that Mr Vik was not interested in talking to Mr Quezada, when the latter suggested that he might speak directly to him.   </p>

He confirmed that SHI was going to sell all its positions save perhaps the EUR/NOK position which he wished to retain.

Mr Gunewardena said they could give him a high level answer and a much more detailed analysis later to make him comfortable that there was nothing untoward.

Mr Vik opened by asking how, when US$35 million security had been allocated for Mr Said’s trading, there had been no margin demands of any kind before the weekend in the light of the figures now being requested.  Mr Gunewardena said that DBAG would be happy to provide the details.  Mr Vik said that with his better understanding of what had happened, SHI was in the process of shutting down as many positions as quickly as possible, without throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  Mr Said then explained the course of action that he was adopting and stated that what had made the TPFs so unbelievably costly on an MTM basis was the utterly unprecedented rise in implied volatility so that even TPFs that were likely to knock out in five or six days still had a large negative value.  He said he understood options valuations and was not saying that DBAG was wrong.  What he was saying was that they needed “to work out some time” between them in order to close out trades in any sensible way.  He said that SHI had no intention of taking more risk and was reducing it aggressively.  Mr Gunewardena pointed out that DBAG had about US$255 million of premium payments to make on behalf of SHI to settle positions which Mr Said had closed and, subject to checking the marks received from Counterparty banks, it appeared there was around another US$180 million MTM variation margin due, including a trade which had just closed out.  The cash hedges and other options had a further MTM negative value of around US$88 million.  The effect of all this was that, as against US$346 million posted and US$125 million more to come on the third margin call, there was still a shortfall of another US$45 million approximately.   </p>

He said that the numbers that he had been giving them thus far did not include initial margin, but that adjustments could be made “to our VaR model” to exclude the closing out trades so that risk was assessed only on the open positions.  Mr Gunewardena pointed out that US$45 million was still owing without any element of VaR (assuming the US$125 million was paid on the third margin call).  He said that he was seeking to reach a result which protected DBAG in a rational way but achieved an optimal result for SHI.  He then explained that, from “a thirty thousand foot level” there had been unprecedented moves of implied volatility and distress the previous week.  There then followed an exchange about Mr Said losing US$500 million when Mr Vik had put aside US$35 million for him to play with, whilst Mr Gunewardena and Mr Brügelmann made the point that there was no way in which a Foreign Exchange book could be limited to a US$35 million exposure.

He agreed that all the individual trades were fairly marked and that was not the issue.  Mr Vik said that they were looking for a solution in which DBAG was lenient in its marking because the implied volatility in the MTM did not reflect the real risk.  At this Mr Gunewardena said the risk was that DBAG had to go out and liquidate the account on SHI’s behalf, which was not something he would wish to do, but that because of the increased implied volatilities, DBAG considered that the cost of such liquidation would be US$524 million.  He agreed that the figures were being driven by the implied volatilities on the open trades and then said he was happy not to allocate any risk capital (VaR and Liquidity Add-on) provided that the MTM variation margin was paid and the closed out trades were being settled.  On that basis the figure required, including the outstanding margin call of US$125 million would be US$175- 178 million. </p>

Mr Vik and Mr Said had thus achieved their objective which was to obtain a reduction in the margin demands of DBAG, despite the contractual entitlement.  No-one at DBAG was admitting margining failure and Mr Gunewardena talked of adjusting the VaR model to exclude trades that had been closed but not settled, whereas there was no VaR model at all which could include the TPFs.  The impression obtained is of two parties jockeying for position and neither adverting to what the other knew, namely that DBAG’s systems had never been able to value or margin the EDTs.  The end result was satisfactory to both DBAG and SHI, namely further margin calls by reference to MTM alone, which was the basis upon which DBAG was being charged margin by its Counterparty banks.   </p>

US$41 million of the US$103.182 million negative MTM figure was attributable to the Trade Desk calculation for the two direct TPFs but there was no MTM for the other TPFs and no liquidity add-on for any of them at all.   </p>

The commercially reasonable course to adopt in a situation where it was impossible for DBAG to effect proper margin calculations in accordance with the contract, whether because of deficiencies in DBAG’s systems, the peculiarities of particular trades or for any other reason, would be carefully to produce figures by reference to the best available information and to inform the client of the difficulty with a view to sitting down and negotiating sensible margin figures.  Bearing in mind DBAG’s entitlement under Part 1(I)(b)(iii) of the Schedule and Mr Said’s/ Mr Vik’s knowledge of the position, it is probable that agreement would have been reached.  Instead of this DBAG produced hopelessly inadequate figures whilst representing, initially, implicitly, and later explicitly, that calculations had been done on its system.  To the extent that there was deceit involved in this, it appears to me that DBAG personnel could not be said to be acting in good faith, although in practice no-one was deceived.   </p>

In my judgment therefore, whilst the bank behaved dishonourably in this respect, no loss resulted from this breach.  DBAG’s actions did not constitute an Event of Default under the FX ISDA or the FXPBA.  SHI in the persons of Mr Said and Mr Vik were not misled by any representations by DBAG as to past margining and SHI’s agreement to pay further margin on an agreed basis on 16th October rules out any ground for complaint.   </p>

He requested Mr Said to let him know if he wanted to discuss the matter.  Attached was a document setting out the way in which the liquidity add-on methodology worked.  Within a matter of minutes Mr Said replied: “That seems fair.  I can live with that”, which DBAG took as SHI’s agreement and implemented the new system with effect from later on that week.  Later that day Mr Said told Mr Vik about these discussions, informing him of the effect of the alteration and how he had negotiated DBAG down from its initial reasonable suggestions, remarking that the previous terms had been way too generous.  In the light of the other exchanges between them at this time, he talked about the need for Mr Vik to increase the collateral position because he had taken cash out of the account, showing that he was aware that DBAG’s new margin requirements were still inadequate for the portfolio.  This could only be because he knew, from his past conversations and the meeting of 8th September, that DBAG had still not solved its problems with booking the EDTs and consequent valuing and margining, and because he was aware of the MS MTM of US$100 million plus on three TPFs.   </p>

It is however important first to focus on the terms of section 5(a)(ii) because it is only a failure by one of the parties to perform an obligation “in accordance with this Agreement” which can constitute an Event of Default and it only becomes such if it remains unremedied for thirty days after notice of such default has been given.  Similarly, regard must be had to the definition of a Specified Transaction because the only relevant form of transaction there referred to is a “prime brokerage or margin lending transaction”.  Neither definition encompasses the FXPBA.   </p>

Consistent with the contractual requirement for all transactions to be included in the calculation, the contractual calculation had to be a portfolio calculation and it would not be permissible to carry out a VaR calculation which excluded the EDTs or OCTs.  Moreover, however unlikely, the effect of not including them might be to decrease the overall margin requirement for the portfolio rather than increase it which, it appears from the evidence, would usually be the case.  Whilst it would be open to DBAG to waive its entitlement to the entire VaR element of a margin calculation where the effect of incorporating it would be to increase the margin requirements, or to waive part of it, the calculation itself could only be made on a portfolio basis.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">DBAG submits that SHI waived its right to insist on funds being paid to the Pledged Account, alternatively varied the FX CSA to permit it or acted in such a way that it is estopped from claiming that funds should have been paid into the Pledged Account.  As I have found elsewhere, there was no element of duress and nothing which vitiated the payments which Mr Vik made, voluntarily, into the London accounts of FXPB.  He therefore was responsible for making payments to the incorrect account, even though he had been encouraged to do this by the sending of transfer instructions to him which had that result.  It was SHI which had the transfer obligation and SHI was in breach in not paying the sums into the Pledged Account, a solution with which DBAG was entirely happy and a breach which it waived.  Equally insofar as DBAG was in breach, SHI waived it too.  What was done was done by mutual assent. </p>

I can see no basis in law or fact for this argument.  The notices were sent to Mr Said and/or Mr Vik and they received them and the sums were paid.

The nature of the Ignored Payments Error was not explained but Mr Vik was told of what was seen as a deficit of around US$300-350 million.  He was told that “these guys have been extending cash and they have been counting things, possibly slightly incorrectly because obviously the numbers … are doesn’t make sense …  We see that there is a deficit of around US$300 million.”  Mr Vik’s response was to say that a miscalculation of that size was insane and to say four times that SHI could not pay the deficit because it did not have the money.  When asked if the company had assets elsewhere than at DBAG he confirmed that SHI had nothing or that “pretty much” everything that the company held was at DBAG. </p>

In that conversation Mr Orme-Smith referred to the earlier telephone call about the deficit and said he was seeking an open conversation as to how to remedy the situation and sort the problem out, given the unfortunate circumstances.  Mr Byrne then referred expressly to the current situation where “you have a fairly large margin call at the moment”.  DBAG wanted to get his latest views on how that could be funded and what other assets or cash could be made available.  Mr Vik expressed his incredulity once again as to what had happened, including the incurring of such high losses when he had allocated US$35 million to Mr Said’s account, asking whether the risks were not supposed to be limited to that figure.   </p>

Mr Vik responded to say that whatever money there was in the Equities account was all there was and that was all the money that SHI had.  When questioned about transfers out of SHI’s accounts in the last month, Mr Vik said that he did not think they should talk about that.  As appears elsewhere in this judgment, SHI had, in the preceding two weeks, made a series of transfers of its assets out of DBAG’s accounts, including substantial sums to Beatrice and to himself.  Not only was he coy in this call about such transfers but Mr Vik also lied in saying that he had not discussed the FX margining position with Mr Said.   </p>

The references to the “margin call” cannot be sensibly seen as a reference to the earlier telephone conversation about a deficit on the GPF account.  They can only be seen as a reference to the email which had been sent.  If Mr Vik had not received the margin call, he would inevitably have asked what it was that Mr Byrne was talking about and what figure was being sought.

In that letter DBAG made express reference to the margin call issued on 22nd October 2008 via email to Mr Vik and stated that the failure to comply with the terms of that Margin Notice constituted an Event of Default under Clause 6.2 of the Equities PBA.

The letter continued in the following terms: “We also note that we have yet to receive the “notice” of 22nd October 2008 referred to in your letter.”  The significance of the inverted commas around the word “notice” in that letter can be seen from the argument that SHI has put forward that the email did not constitute a margin call under Clause 4 of the Equities PBA.  If the position had been that the email had not been received, not only would the point have been taken at once, following receipt of the letter of 23rd October, but the response of 6th November would have said so in terms.   </p>

As appears elsewhere, SHI’s disclosure has been deficient in a number of respects but, regardless of that, Mr Vik’s own evidence was that he deleted emails when he was “done with them” and his deletion box was subject to an automatic deletion function.  This is the reason that SHI has put forward for disclosure of so few emails received by Mr Vik (see the seventh witness statement of Mr Leslie at paragraph 42).  </p>

All of the written requests by Mr Vik for SHI to Mr Brügelmann for updates on the GPF account and the responses from Mr Brügelmann were equally sent and received by email.  Not only were Mr Vik’s instructions for trading on the GPF account sent by email but so also were Mr Brügelmann’s responses.  In each case the email address used was amvik@xcelera.com.

Communication by post or courier to the Turks and Caicos Islands address (doubtless a nameplate office) would require forwarding, presumably by email to Mr Vik with whatever delay that entailed.  The parties’ habitual method of correspondence was by email and demands or margin notices, no less than any other communication or notice, would be expected to be given in this way.  I cannot see therefore that SHI’s “last known address for correspondence” must be taken exclusively to refer to the postal address in the Turks and Caicos Islands, as opposed to the last known address for email correspondence which was undoubtedly the “amvik” email address.  Whilst emails can go astray, so also can letters in the post, although there are of course means of ensuring delivery by courier/registered post/special delivery.  This does not however mean that an email address cannot be a last known address for correspondence: nor is there anything in the Clause to say that there can only be one last known address for correspondence, as opposed to more than one, depending on the means of communication adopted.  In a modern commercial context, an email address is capable of being a “last known address for correspondence” and the “amvik” email address qualifies for that description.   </p>

The objection is that the “Margin Equity” included the negative value of Mr Vik’s FX positions that could not properly be called “Securities” within the meaning of Clause 4.2 of the Equities PBA.  Of course, over the preceding months, the FX transactions had always been included in the overall margin calculations under the Equities PBA, the Listed F&amp;O Agreement and the Master Netting Agreement, incorporating all positive and negative valuations within that.  For the reasons given elsewhere, that was the basis upon which the parties proceeded and to which they agreed by words and conduct and “Securities” was a term apt to include FX Transactions when the parties so agreed. </p>

Neither Clause 4.1 nor 4.2 require any particular format for notification or demand.  The Global Prime website, in any event, set out the relevant figures after correction of the Ignored Payments Error so that the make up of the sum demanded was available to SHI.  Although Mr Vik did not apparently ever avail himself of the opportunity given to him to log into the website, and it was always open to Mr Vik, in any event, to ask for details of the calculations in question.  In fact he did not do so because he had already told DBAG in more than one telephone conversation that SHI had no assets and was not in a position to meet any margin calls.   </p>

There is no issue that DBX calculated margin on a T + 1 basis, which meant that it was the figures as at close of business on the preceding day which were used for the calculation.  SHI’s complaint is that the figures utilised in the 22nd October email failed to take into account the closure of the EUR 450 million EUR/NOK position which had not been effected at close of business on 21st October but was achieved by 9.41 London time on 22nd October 2008 when Mr Brügelmann sent an email confirming that this had been done.  There is no issue between the parties that the closure of this position was not reflected in the data in DBX as at close of business on 21st October 2008, and that the margin call on 22nd October treated the position as being open, which had a very significant effect on the amount of margin demanded.  SHI also appears to complain that other positions were closed out during the course of 22nd October prior to 6.35 pm London time which ought also to have been taken into account.   </p>

On the latter’s evidence, DBX could not be “refreshed” so as to bring into account, for margining purposes, transactions which had not been closed out by close of business on the previous day.  In consequence, if positions closed out since the previous day were to be taken into account, this would have to be done by carrying out manual calculations based on figures produced during the course of the day for each of the various trades which closed that day, including the large EUR/NOK position.  Mr Singh was not at all happy with this as an idea.  It would require him to take into account “multiple trades done with multiple brokers” and to incorporate figures in a manual calculation, taken from a number of different systems.  Whereas the system could be adjusted to take into account the Ignored Payments Error by unmapping the F&amp;O Equities Account from the Finance Account and Roll-Up Account and it was possible to “refresh” the system to ensure that all trades completed by close of business the previous day were properly taken into account, there was no mechanism by which it was possible to update the margin calculations in respect of trades conducted since close of business the previous day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">There was therefore nothing irrational about the approach which DBAG took when it used the figures on DBX as at close of business on 21st October, subject to the correction of the error in those figures which existed at that time.  It would indeed have been irrational to produce figures which did not take account of the known Ignored Payments Error, just as it would have been irrational to calculate figures on anything other than the T + 1 basis in accordance with its usual procedures.  Furthermore, SHI’s pleaded case is that the EUR/NOK position should have been taken into account but none of the other positions closed out during the course of 22nd October, although in its closing submissions it appeared to recognise the illogicality of this. </p>

That was a genuine good faith calculation made of the position as it was known to be at close of business on the preceding day and the approach adopted by Mr Singh was entirely rational in the circumstances.  There would have been real difficulty in trying to ensure that all trades effected during the course of 22nd October prior to the sending of the email were properly taken into account because DBAG’s systems operated on a T + 1 basis.  To move from that basis with ad hoc calculations based on information as it came in, risked inaccuracy and would have led SHI to criticise any margin call made on that basis, if it saw any advantage in doing so.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally, it cannot be said that it was commercially unreasonable to make such a margin call.  It is always the case that a margin call made on one day and complied with, may on the following or succeeding days, give rise to a margin surplus by reason of market movements or the conclusion of other trades.  There is no doubt that, on 23rd October, the margin requirement based on the position at close of business on 22nd October would have been different from that on 22nd October based on the position at close of business on 21st.  That is however, as Mr Singh said, exactly how margin provisions work.  Security is put up in respect of the Prime Broker’s exposure, as calculated by it at a particular point in time, and the client must produce margin in accordance with the contractual requirement.  As circumstances change so there may be a surplus which is then recoverable by the client from the Prime Broker.  “If there is excess available the next day because of all the risk reducing trades they have done, they can take the money back again.  That is how it works.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, once the margin call is made, there is a contractual debt which requires to be paid and, if it is not paid, the contractual consequences may follow in the context of an Event of Default, regardless of the position the following day and any margin surplus which might arise.  In practice, margin is often the subject of negotiation so that if a margin call is made on a particular day when trades are being closed out, a discussion may take place between the Prime Broker and the client and agreement may be reached as to what an appropriate level of payment might be, regardless of the contractual entitlement.  If however the client, as SHI did in the present case, indicates that, whatever the size of the margin call, no payment will be made, there is no room for any such negotiation, nor room for the Prime Broker to take a more </p>

In fact, it did so since the DBX system produced the figures on the Global Prime website for SHI to see, but in any event this could make no difference to the accrued rights and obligations flowing from the valid demand made the previous day.  In fact, as at 23rd October 2008, on a T + 1 basis, there was still a margin deficiency of NOK 1.5 billion according to the forensic accountants engaged by SHI.  Nor, on 23rd October, despite receipt of the letter of that day stating that an Event of Default had occurred by reason of SHI’s failure to put up margin, did Mr Vik make any approach to DBAG about payment of any sums owing as at that date.  If Mr Vik had chosen to pay what was due on 23rd October (or procure SHI to do so by one means or another) it is hardly likely that DBAG would have followed through with its notice of an Event of Default and terminated the Equities Agreements on 4th December.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The first two transfers of NOK 70 million and NOK 130 million which were transferred to the FXPB account on 17th October 2008 were, together, the equivalent of US$28,179,333 as at 28th October 2008, according to SHI’s forensic accountant.  The immediate instructions for transfer of these sums came from Mr Brügelmann and Mr Halfmann respectively on the morning of 17th October.  The background to these transfers is to be found in the third and fourth margin calls of 15th and 16th October 2008.  It will be recalled that the fourth call of 16th October subsumed that of 15th October, the total being US$175 million.  It will also be recalled that, in order to meet these calls SHI made two sequential payments of US$75 million and US$100 million because it did not have the necessary funds to pay the total in one lump sum.  Mr Brügelmann was in discussion with Mr Vik as to the assets to be sold on the GPF account and the putting together of the necessary funds to pay the call.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I have no doubt at all that the payment of these sums was authorised by Mr Vik as part of the process of putting funds together to meet the call even though the calls were ultimately met by separate transfers.  SHI makes great play of the fact that Mr Brügelmann originally relied on the general instruction given to him on 12th February 2008 relating to the transfer of funds from DBS to DBAG to provide collateral for Mr Vik’s trading on the GPF account and only later sought to rely upon specific authority given to him by Mr Vik on the telephone.  The reason for this is not hard to see.  It was only during the course of disclosure that a transcript of a telephone call between Mr Brügelmann, Mr Gunewardena and Mr Halfmann at 15:30 GMT on 16th October was examined.  Within it was recorded an interposed telephone call between Mr Brügelmann and Mr Vik.  Whilst only Mr Brügelmann’s part of that call with Mr Vik is recorded, he makes specific reference to “around 35 million in cash in Geneva” as part of the funds that he is seeking to free up to meet the call.  Mr Brügelmann’s evidence was that he was given express authorisation in that call to use the sums in Geneva by Mr Vik for this purpose.  In an internal telephone call at DBAG later that day, Mr Brügelmann referred to the sum of US$30 million in a Geneva account held in NOK and at 21:01 GMT, Mr Brügelmann again conversed with Mr Vik on the means by which the margin call was to be met, referring to the sale of futures, to US$10 million in the United States and saying “we’re going to get another 30 million roughly from Geneva so I need to probably be … selling a little bit or covering a little bit more tomorrow in Europe”.  To this Mr Vik replied “OK”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Brügelmann did not need written authorisation from Mr Vik for the transfer of the US$30 million because Mr Vik had signed a “Request and Waiver” form on behalf of SHI by which SHI unconditionally requested DBS to execute all instructions relating to its account transmitted by telephone as soon as possible after receipt and without waiting for written confirmation, declaring that SHI would approve all transactions carried out by DBS on the basis of such instruction.  Mr Brügelmann also referred to these standing instructions in cross-examination. </p>

Article 6 stated that the pledged assets were to serve as “collateral to the Bank for all claims that the Bank has and/or will have against the Pledgor … from any existing and future credit facilities/agreements, including all due, current or future interest and commissions”.  Contrary to the stance adopted by SHI, DBAG was therefore entitled to realise the assets in the Pledged Account if SHI was in default under the Equities PBA, which, by failing to meet the margin call of 22nd October, it was.  Furthermore, as appears later in this judgment, SHI had not paid sums due to DBAG in respect of the closure of Mr Said’s FX trades.  Once again, credit is given by DBAG in its claims for this sum.   </p>

Its case is that, by agreement between DBAG and SHI, his positions and exposures governed by the FXPBA were closed out and SHI’s assets held by DBAG applied against amounts owing by SHI to DBAG under the terms of the FXPBA and FX ISDA.  SHI, in its closing submissions accepts that it had decided to close out all positions and communicated that decision to DBAG.  What it does not accept is that there was an agreement that DBAG would take over any positions and charge SHI for the costs of doing so.  What actually took place after 22nd October is very much in dispute between the parties.  The primary issue is whether or not there was agreement between Mr Said and DBAG’s representatives that DBAG would take over Mr Said’s outstanding trades on 22nd/23rd October and agreement to the prices to be paid by SHI where it did so.   </p>

The draft emails and the actual email referred to “the decision … to close out and crystallise the loss on all remaining positions” which had been taken that morning.  From the terms of internal telephone conversations at DBAG, it appears that Mr Gunewardena had spoken to Mr Vik to say that unless he was willing to post new margin of US$50 million, he had to close everything down that day, including all of the FXPB options including “the Pivot Options”.  In consequence “the client has advised that everything should get, everything will get closed down today …”.  Whilst Mr Vik was not prepared to accept this in cross-examination, the email sent by Mr Said, after the presentation of drafts of it to Mr Vik and the internal discussions at DBAG, show this to be the case.

He said that he had offered all his advice and volunteered a way to get it done but had been told not to do anything save to provide the unwind prices for the options from the Counterparty banks.  The complaint was that the market had moved a lot in the interim period prior to the email.  I have no doubt, given the contents of other communications to which I refer below, that the wording used in this email was agreed between Mr Vik and Mr Said and represented posturing on their part in circumstances where Mr Said himself had been struggling to close the trades and had asked DBAG for help in doing so.  In an email on the afternoon of 22nd October, Mr Walsh reported to others in the FXPB team that Mr Said had just called, saying that he wanted to check all his positions to ensure that he was trading the correct amounts to close them out.  He had said that his plans were to execute those trades later that day or the next day.  The process of closing was a cooperative one.  Even though the EUR/NOK transactions and the outstanding EDTs presented particular problems, by 24th October 2008, with the assistance of DBAG, all Mr Said’s open positions had been closed out.    </p>

Mr Vik’s evidence in cross-examination was that Mr Said’s concern was that DBAG would close out the positions with SHI at exorbitant prices.  SHI relies upon passages in Mr Said’s deposition where he said that “at some point” DBAG took the positions over which were then out of his hands.  He said that of the last few of his trades, he did some himself, “albeit under a fair amount of duress”.  If he recalled correctly there was a finite point at which DBAG took over the portfolio and he also executed some trades where he was basically in co-operation and under instructions from DBAG, particularly Mr Gunewardena.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Very shortly after that call Mr Said telephoned Ms Liau “about closing out everything” and Ms Liau repeated the suggestion of Mr Gunewardena about ascertaining whether DBAG’s trade desk could offer a better price than those obtainable from the outside market.  Whilst Mr Said doubted that this was possible, he recognised that the quote he had from GS on EDT 27, using a spot rate of 9.01, was unlikely still to be obtainable (the spot rate had already moved to 9.05).  He was waiting for a quote from CS on EDT 38.  Mr Said’s concern was that if he went out in the market with a total spot exposure of approximately EUR 1.5 billion which he needed to cover on the EUR/NOK trades (both vanilla and EDTs) the spot rate would be likely to move 5% or so.   </p>

GS quoted US$80.2 million and CS quoted US$58.9 million, totalling US$139.1 million together as the premium SHI would have to pay.  Mr Said said he would call back when he received a quotation from GS on EDT 40 (the USD/JPY TPF).  He said he was pretty comfortable getting that one done on the market himself.  In a further conversation at 12:17, Mr Said asked if DBAG would take on EDTs 27 and 38 for payment of “not too large a premium” and stated that, if this was done, it was for DBAG to decide “whatever the hell” it wanted to do with them thereafter.  In the course of this conversation, Mr Said said that he was worried “about the whole spot thing”, by which he must have meant the weakening of NOK if he attempted to sell EUR 1.7 billion worth of that currency.  He said the best outcome would be for DBAG to take his positions over for a risk premium.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">At 13:28, Mr Gunewardena called Mr Said and they discussed the quotations which Mr Said had obtained, which were now “totally out of the window”, according to Mr Said, because the spot rate had moved from 9.01 to 9.18 and GS would only honour the quote if they could obtain their spot hedge at 9.01.  Mr Said said he had a partial hedge on the USD/JPY position but not on the EUR/NOK trades, whether vanilla or TPFs.  Mr Said said he had no idea what the best option was in the circumstances, suspecting that prices had gone up because “someone out there must know we have a lot of Euros to buy”.  That would not be surprising because Mr Said had been unwinding positions in the second and third weeks of October 2008 and had been requesting unwind quotations from various third party counterparties for his remaining open positions on a regular basis since 15th October.  He was to tell Mr Gunewardena that he had asked for unwind prices for EDTs 27, 38 and 40 every day for the previous six days.  Mr Said said in terms that he was “fried” and “frazzled” but that unwinding the options was not the hardest part of the exercise.  The issue was obtaining the delta hedge.  He suggested that either he or DBAG could “just go out and start buying” but the price would end up at 9.30.  Mr Gunewardena pointed out that DBAG had been asking for these trades to be unwound for many days now and Mr Said said that they were now getting into “real disaster territory”.  Mr Gunewardena said that he would discuss matters internally and get back to Mr Said. </p>

Mr Said was suggesting that Mr Vik was asking why the trades had not been closed that morning, to which Mr Gunewardena responded that DBAG was trying to comply with his directions.  There was then agreement that it was not sensible to go out and buy €1.6 billion in bulk because the market would be likely to move to 9.40 if they did so.  They thought that there would be some liquidity the next morning and it was agreed that DBAG would buy €1.6 billion in small parcels, seeking not to move the market in doing so.  Mr Said thought that obtaining this delta hedge at 9.20 or 9.22 would be an unbelievable outcome because it would mean that the market had not moved from its current position of 9.22.   </p>

There was no logic to this complaint given the difficulties in closing the transaction without acquiring a delta hedge which could only be done in small parcels without moving the market.  The complaint then made that the transactions should have been closed out by that time is not the complaint now made, which is that the transaction should not have been closed out until much later and that SHI should have been allowed to retain EDTs 27 and 38 after 23rd October or should be given the benefits of having done so.   </p>

Mr Said thought that once the delta hedge was in place, the rest was simple.  He plainly considered that the hedge was an integrated part of the close out.  Mr Said already had a US$300 million hedge in place for EDT 40 but it was agreed that a further US$200 million would have to be added.

Mr Said said that from an overall risk reduction point of view it was a lot better to tear up the deal with the original counterparty, but Mr Gunewardena said he could probably get a better internal price from the DBAG Sales Desk than the counterparties would offer.  Less than half an hour later, Mr Gunewardena told Mr Said that he had closed out the SHI/DBAG legs of EDTs 27 and 38 at better prices than GS and CS were offering and a few minutes later, on being questioned about this, told him that the EUR/NOK positions were concluded at a better level than DBAG could have done in the market.  A little later Mr Said confirmed the prices he had obtained from GS and CS at €71 million and €61.3 million although there was some prospect of an improvement of the latter.  The total was therefore €132.3 million, whereas DBAG’s combined price for the two was €125.5 million.

Following receipt of the 23rd October email from Mr Gunewardena stating that US$117 million was now owing in consequence of the close out, Mr Said and Mr Vik discussed the email with Mr Said observing that the numbers were large but “that is what they show”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">All in all, it is clear to me that SHI and DBAG agreed on 22nd October that the balance of Mr Said’s FX trades which were then outstanding should be closed out, crystallising the loss.  The way in which these trades were closed out was discussed between Mr Said and Mr Gunewardena, with some input from Ms Liau.  The object was to minimise the losses on the trades and there was no disagreement between Mr Said and Mr Gunewardena about the methods used or the results achieved.  Mr Said at all times recognised that hedging was a critical part of the exercise if DBAG was effectively to take over the outstanding trades in his FXPB account as he had suggested, thereby closing out the SHI/DBAG legs (the Agency Transactions) of the trades which Mr Said had concluded with Counterparties.  If Mr Said had entered into transactions with the Counterparties to unwind the original deals, he would have paid more.  By concluding a deal with SHI, DBAG was left exposed to the Counterparties and, as Mr Said fully recognised, it needed to protect itself by delta hedges.  The cost incurred in these hedging transactions was therefore part of the price/premium payable to DBAG.  At the time of the events in question there is not the slightest suggestion that Mr Said thought otherwise and the sequence of events, as recorded above, on 22nd and 23rd October demonstrates his full agreement to this course of action and his appreciation that it was done in an economic manner. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It seems that there are two issues which arise as to quantum of hedging costs.  The first issue relates to the EUR/NOK hedging and the manner in which the average exchange rate across the hedging trades entered into by DBAG was derived.  The contemporaneous correspondence shows that each of the three DBAG trading desks which entered into the relevant hedging trades in New York, Sydney and London recorded average rates which in combination on a weighted average basis give rise to the 9.169 figure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I can see no basis for looking beyond these figures to apply the average rate calculated on all DBAG’s external EUR/NOK trades on 22nd and 23rd October and in these circumstances find that DBAG is entitled to take into account the full figure of US$11.5 million as hedging costs on the EUR/NOK trades.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In addition to the US$11.5 million for hedging the EUR/NOK vanilla trades and EDTs 27 and 38, just under US$1.5 million was expended in hedging costs against US Dollar and Yen exposures to the Euro.  DBAG took on sixty-eight FX positions in a number of currencies from SHI on 23rd October but the hedging costs resulting from Dollar and Yen exposure to the Euro arose as a result of DBAG entering into hedging trades on Monday 27th October.  The short issue which I have to decide is whether or not the length of time taken to close out these positions was reasonable in the light of the takeover of the trades at close of business on 23rd October.  If the trades should have been closed out at the start of business on 24th October, the business day following the trades being taken in by DBAG, the claim for these costs would be effectively reduced to zero.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I have no evidence before me as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the course of action adopted by DBAG.  Since the agreement was to take over the trades with immediate effect, I can see no good reason for a delay from the Thursday evening to the Monday, particularly given the 24 hour nature of FX trading on a world-wide basis.  No doubt DBAG had plenty else to occupy itself with during this frantic time in the market but, whereas there is material which demonstrates the time required to hedge the EUR/NOK EDTs, there is none to justify the delay in closing out these more ordinary transactions.  In my judgment therefore the sum of US$1,461,837 is not recoverable from SHI.   </p>

The table refers to the exchanges on which the shares were listed.  Two of the Norwegian Securities were listed on the Oslo Børs which is the main Norwegian stock exchange.  One was listed on Oslo Axess (Seajacks) which is an exchange with less detailed listing requirements and which describes itself as suitable for companies with less than 3 years trading history.  Four were members of the Norwegian OCT information exchange (NOTC) which is not a stock exchange but an information system where securities dealers can register a bid or ask for a price for securities on the list.  Floatel International Limited was neither listed nor on the NOTC list.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The experts provided market statistics of the exchanges upon which these companies were traded in 2008.  The number of companies listed on the Oslo Børs, the Oslo Axess and the NOTC respectively was 224, 35 and 116.  462 companies were listed on the Tokyo second section.  This compares with 1,233 companies on the AIM and 1,174 companies on the FTSE.  The monthly turnover on the Norwegian and Tokyo exchanges placed the Oslo Børs above the AIM index but well below the FTSE, whilst the Tokyo second section and the Oslo Axess market showed very limited turnover by comparison.  The experts produced financial data for the companies to demonstrate the relative sizes of each of them, as appears in the table set out below.  </p>

He looked for approval from Mr Vik for the presentation of the portfolio to some strategic clients that might find interest in bidding as a block as opposed to liquidating the portfolio in line with the daily volume of trades, which could take several months.  Mr Vik did not respond.  Mr Hanssen was a specialist in this area of equities but at no time were any alternative suggestions produced by SHI for the realisation of these shares.   </p>

Mr Singh was cross-examined about the process involved.  I heard expert evidence from Mr Robinson and Mr Davies, who were called on behalf of DBAG and SHI respectively.  Mr Singh was looking to produce the market value of the shares to be set off against sums owed by SHI.  He was not looking to ascertain the lending value which DBAG might ascribe to them and he did not know about the policy used to value equities in DBAG’s books, once transferred to the proprietary account.  His evidence was that having looked at the equities portfolio in DBX, he ascertained its illiquidity with a weighted average of 600 days.  The decision was taken to obtain four bids in accordance with the objective ISDA industry standard, to exclude the outriders and take the median of the two left.

The Norwegian Securities (excluding Floatel) were valued at about €20 million on Bloomberg on the basis of the last traded share price multiplied by the total quantity but some of the shares had not been traded for some time whilst one company’s shares had not been traded since July.  Since that date there had been the Lehman Brothers collapse and the consequent disruption of the markets.  A consistent approach was desired across the board for all the shares, both for the Akasaka shares and the Norwegian Securities, with a desire to get a valuation quickly.  On asking whom to approach for help in relation to the Norwegian Securities, Mr Singh was directed to Mr Lowndes of the Nordic Sales Desk.  Mr Lowndes approached four brokers who were at the time listed as numbers 8, 11, 12 and 19 according to the size of their turnover and number of transactions conducted.  Since the majority of business is in liquid shares, unlike the Norwegian Securities, the brokers’ place in that list does not seem to me to be of much relevance.  It is not suggested that those brokers were incompetent or had reason not to wish to conclude sales and earn commission on them.   </p>

He stressed that he did not know what the outcome of the process would be when it was adopted.  All the brokers were listed in December 2008 as trading on the Nordic Stock Exchange and/or were active on the NOTC platform.  It is clear from internal communications within DBAG that there was doubt as to whether any firm prices would be forthcoming from the brokers at all, because of the state of the market.  This fear proved well founded because within about an hour of Mr Lowndes sending his email to the brokers, three had responded with “no bid” and one with “no interest”.   </p>

The question whether it can sensibly in the interests of either party liquidate on the termination date is part of the complex uncertainties of this emergency situation.  If it decides not to liquidate, it is forced to retain.  If in that context it has to value the assets, why should it not be entitled to value them at a value which reflects the value of such assets to itself?  It may dislike the risk they pose, in terms of the nature of the particular asset, its currency and/or nationality and so on.  The decisions have to be taken very quickly, namely “on the date of termination” (see further below).  Once the asset is not immediately sold, the risk of retention is entirely transferred to Standard.  In theory and sometimes in practice anything may happen the next day, or within the time in which a sale might become possible.  The difficulty multiplies if the asset is relatively or entirely illiquid.  Then there is no market price by which the value can be set on the relevant day.  Who knows at what price the asset can be sold when a buyer appears?  In such circumstances, Standard is entitled, it may be said, to consult its own interests, subject of course to the requirements of good faith and rationality.  Those factors include both subjective and objective elements, but the essence of that construction is that the decision remains that of Standard, not of the market or the court, and that in coming to its assessment, subject to the limitations of good faith and rationality, it is entitled primarily to consult its own interests. </p>

What is the value to be put on an asset for which there is no buyer?  Or for which there is no market?  Or for which there is a volatile or illiquid market?  Or a market which can only absorb a small amount of stock before the price is affected?  The last quoted deal before the termination date may be of little assistance in such a case.  The next quoted deal will be of little assistance, because it looks beyond the relevant day.  In such circumstances, it might be rational to value the asset at or close to zero: but of course it does not necessarily follow.  I do not think that there was any real difference about that, either before Cooke J or Gloster J.  What is plain, however, is that where it is not possible to liquidate an asset on the termination and valuation date it is unreasonable that there should be any risk at all on Standard.  It makes the implication of an objective hindsight valuation an unnecessary and unreasonable imposition. </p>

There were thus very few buyers in the market for illiquid shares such as the Akasaka shares.  The buyers who were in the market were in a position to secure very deep discounts from anyone who had to sell such shares.  A DBAG trader had previously flagged up the point that the Akasaka shares were “already traded at a deep discount to book value”, because of the lack of willing buyers in the market.  Moreover mid and late December was typically slower than other parts of the year due to the Christmas holiday period and year end.   </p>

Normally, a lengthy marketing exercise would be conducted to stimulate interest, and interested buyers identified and/or small parcels of shares would be “drip fed” into the market over a prolonged period.  Mr Hogan expressed two reasons for sale over an extended period.  The discount or depressive reaction in the market to the sale of a large holding would thus be reduced but there would also be a minimisation of the risk of market participants becoming aware of a large block of shares being sold and then short selling the stock.

Can be super low”.  The response was “would have to be real low for that liquidity”.  He responded “can be rediculously [sic] low”.  Three bids were obtained at ¥108, ¥105 and ¥50 on 11th December.  A fourth bid was needed which was obtained on 12th December, with refreshing of the three earlier bids, giving rise to figures of 108, 101, 75 and 20.  By dismissing the outlying two bids, the median figure, which DBAG then used was ¥88.

The process and the result of the process which, of necessity involved ignoring the highest bid, gave rise to a median figure which DBAG took as the value.

SHI submits that an event of default triggered the valuation process under Clause 7.1 of the Equities PBA to which I have already referred.  SHI submits that this Clause entitled DBAG to attribute a close out valuation to the shares but not to transfer the shares to its own proprietary account.  SHI recognises that it could not be credited with value for the shares and keep them itself but, because DBAG ascribed no value to the shares, it is submitted that DBAG had no entitlement to take them and should have returned them to SHI to do with them whatever SHI pleased, since the shares were held on trust for SHI under Clause 5.  This argument however falls foul of the provisions of Clause 7 itself which provides for set off and close out since, by Clause 7.1.1, if the election is made, “all the parties’ obligations under the Agreement which are outstanding … and any obligation (save those set out in this Clause 7) to do anything in future shall terminate immediately.”  The effect of the calculation of the net sum owing with valuations done in accordance with Clause 7.1 is to bring about the termination of any obligation of DBAG to return the Prime Broker Securities to SHI.  Although I have held that the discretionary valuation was not rationally exercised, in respect of the Norwegian shares, the calculation was done and the obligation to redeliver the securities ceased.  The breach of contract was not in failing to carry out the calculation required by Clause 7.1.3 of the Equities PBA nor to value the Norwegian Securities.

There is a basic difference of approach which largely accounts for the different valuations put forward by the two experts in respect of most of the shares.  Each criticises the instructions given to the other which governed the other’s approach.  Mr Robinson’s instructions were to assess the market value or range of market values for each of these equities “determined on the basis of the price that would have been paid in the market had a sale of the Equities taken place on 4th December 2008, with no prior marketing period, and in circumstances where the whole of the shareholding in respect of any of the equities was to be disposed of in its entirety as at that date”.  Mr Davies’ instructions were to produce the market value or a range of market values for the Equities on 4th December 2008 which he took as meaning the market value which could be obtained in the ordinary course of business with appropriate prior marketing, without any pressure to sell.  He assessed the market value on the basis of “the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably prudently and without compulsion”.  SHI criticises Mr Robinson’s valuation as being effectively on a “fire sale” basis, whilst DBAG criticises Mr Davies’ valuation on  the basis that it is not a valuation as of the Termination Date and ignores the illiquidity of the blocks of shares for an immediate sale in their entirety.   </p>

Rix LJ envisaged the difficulty involved in valuation as of a particular date where the assets were relatively or entirely illiquid and where there was effectively no market price by which the value could be set on the relevant day.  He asked rhetorically what value was to be put on an asset for which there was no buyer, or for which there was no market, or for which there was a volatile or illiquid market or a market which could only absorb a small amount of stock before the price was affected.  He envisaged that in such circumstances the last quoted deal before the termination date might be of little assistance (and the next quoted deal likewise because it looked beyond the relevant day).  In those circumstances it might be rational to value the asset at or close to zero, but whatever the position it was plain to him that no risk should be taken by the party not in default in making its assessment of value.  It was entitled primarily to consult its own interests, subject only to the limitations of good faith and rationality.   </p>

Total monthly trade volumes fell by approximately 36%.  The Norwegian Securities were all related to the shipping and oil industries.  The shipping industry was in dire straits.  A fall in global trade was allied with reduced availability of letters of credit required for international shipping, with an overcapacity within the industry.  Shipping margins and revenues were under extreme pressure.  The Baltic Dry Index fell 92% over the course of the year.  Within the oil industry crude oil prices reached a record high of US$146 per barrel in July 2008 but plunged rapidly in August, falling by approximately 61% in the year.  Revenues collapsed within the industry with oil majors’ revenues falling by an average of 36%.  “In summary, 2008 oversaw collapsing credit markets, losses across almost all commodities, plunging equity markets and sharp contractions in global consumer spending.

The price index steadily recovered thereafter rising in January 2011 to the levels seen in 2007.  Share volumes traded remained volatile throughout 2008 with a substantial reduction in trading volumes between July and mid-September.  The Oslo Axess declined by 68% during the year with a fall of 66% between 6th June and the end of the year.  No share volume information is available for this index.  For the NOTC, the volumes traded on a monthly basis fell by 62% from January 2008 to December 2008.  In December 2008 there were only 693 trades recorded on the NOTC at an average value per trade of NOK 0.23 million as compared with the average in January 2008 of NOK 0.47 million.  From December 2008 trading on the NOTC increased but well below the level seen in 2007.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts agree that trading in some of the stocks leading up to December 2008 was illiquid and many of them were very illiquid (Seajacks, Thule and Standard Drilling) and it is therefore necessary to reflect the impact of illiquidity and blockage (selling in large blocks) in the valuations of the equities for December 4th.  Mr Davies produced figures which had an explicit discount for these factors whereas Mr Robinson adopted a more global approach reflecting what he saw as the state of the market, using a methodology reflecting the actual trading patterns, volumes and values around that date.  There are no material differences between them in the share trading data employed (i.e. prices and volumes of the shares sold on a given day).  Where there were completed trades on a given day, the experts agreed that the closing price on that day was the appropriate starting point to determine the share price that day.  Where there were no completed trades on a given day, there was disagreement between the experts in relation to the use of bid/ask statistics.  They of course do not represent an actual transaction but only what a buyer is prepared to pay or a seller is prepared to accept.  Furthermore, they do not provide information as to the volume of shares that might be traded.  Bid/ask statistics were available only in relation to American Shipping, Scorpion and Seajacks.  In Mr Robinson’s opinion, where there were no trades and no bids recorded, this was strongly indicative that there was a paucity of buyers in the market for those shares.  He also took the view that where asks were shown, that demonstrated sellers wishing to sell and therefore, in the absence of actual trades, the price achievable for the stock would be somewhere below the unfulfilled ask price. </p>

The top end of Mr Robinson’s range is assessed by reference to the last recorded bid price of NOK 40 on 4th December.  The bottom end of his range is based on the depth of the market being 100 shares.  Working on this basis the amount of money available for purchase on that date was NOK 4000 (US$600) which, in his words “can be described as de minimis” being equivalent to a price of NOK 0.05 per share.

This suggests that there was some appetite for these shares and that a greater price would have been obtainable on 4th December than Mr Robinson recognises.  It is true that there were no trades done on 4th December itself but the bid price of NOK 40 and the ask price of 44 on that day gives some clue as to the price for an unknown quantity of shares.  The price of the shares continued to fall from 15th December 2008 onwards down to as little as NOK 2.78 on 31st October 2012 and a mandatory liquidation was set to follow the chapter 11 filing of Overseas Shipping Group, but none of that could have been known at the Termination Date.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">I asked each of the experts about assessing market value in circumstances where, because of the state of the markets, the reality was that buyers and sellers were unlikely to reach agreement because the market was so bad that the seller would not be prepared to sell at a price a buyer was prepared to offer.  The seller would hold on in the hope of better times.  No satisfactory answer was forthcoming.  That situation appears to be envisaged by Rix LJ.  It does not however apply to the American Shipping shares if regard is had to the transaction of 11th December.  A price was obviously agreed for a large quantity of shares, much larger than SHI’s holding but the price is unknown.  There would probably be some discount for this quantity which amounted to some 2.04% of the total issued share capital.  Bids and asks were registered at 34 and 40 NOK respectively that day.  Mr Robinson discounted this transaction as being irrelevant to his valuation on 4th December but because it gives an indication of the depth of the market, his approach based on a depth of 100 shares cannot be correct.  There was value in these shares and a forced sale on 4th December, with DBAG looking out for its own interests and taking no risk, would have resulted in a price had the relevant buyer of 11th December been identified.  To assess the actual price which would have been obtainable had that buyer been located is not realistically possible in the absence of any knowledge of the price paid on 11th December.  It must, however, in my judgment, lie within the range of NOK 30-40 in the light of prices obtained and bids and asks registered in the first part of December.  Doing the best that I can, it seems to me that, with further investigation, a rational bank in DBAG’s position would have arrived at a valuation of NOK 35 per share which gives rise to a total valuation of NOK 2,663,500 which amounts to US$373,363 at the exchange rate utilised by Mr Robinson.   </p>

The SHI holding was of 6,243,281 shares constituting 6.95% of the issued capital.  There were other shareholders with 30% and 19% holdings but no-one with a controlling interest.  Mr Robinson assessed a de minimis or zero valuation whilst Mr Davies’ valuations range between US$6.24 million and US$12.49 million.  Mr Davies’ valuation proceeds on the basis of the share price at which Floatel shares were issued in June 2008 in a private placement.  The low end of his valuation range reflects a 50% reduction to reflect the general direction of the market movement.  He describes Floatel as a Swedish accommodation and construction support vessel operator which was established in 2006 to own and operate modern floating accommodation and construction support vessels in the oil drilling industry.  In 2007 it placed turn-key contracts for the building of two vessels in Singapore with delivery dates of 1st May 2010 and 31st December 2010.  Of its shareholding of approximately 6.24 million shares, approximately 338,000 were acquired by SHI in the June 2008 placement.  The date and price paid for the balance remains unknown.   </p>

The placement was of approximately twice the size of SHI’s overall holding.  Mr Davies’ assessment is that there were no material changes in the operations of Floatel between June and December 2008 so that, with a soundly based private company, there should be no material change in the underlying value of the shares.  He accepts that the onset of the global financial crisis resulted in significant falls in listed equity prices in that year from June to December and that shipping and related industries were some of the worst affected by the crisis.  He recognises the possibility of an increased perception of risk in the Floatel shares which accounts for the lower end of his valuations.   </p>

Selling minority shareholdings in private companies is fairly difficult at the best of times and given the state of the market in December 2008 it is inherently unlikely that there would be any purchasers willing and able to buy this shareholding.  It is true that there is always difficulty in producing evidence of available buyers for a private company shareholding, but unlike the situation with American Shipping, there simply is no indication of any interest in these shares at all and had further investigation been carried out by DBAG, there is nothing to show that anything positive would have resulted.  Without any opportunity for marketing and with a valuation to be made for the block of shares on December 4th, I do not consider that Mr Robinson’s approach can be faulted.  Whatever Floatel’s net asset position and long term prospects, the sentiment in the market at the time does not suggest that there would have been any buyers available on 4th December and that any value could be ascribed to the shares on that date.  It is a classic case of the kind envisaged in my questions to the experts and as contemplated by Rix LJ.  Here is an asset for which there is no buyer and no market on the day in question where it cannot be said to be irrational to value the shares at zero even though the shares may have significant value once the market moves.   </p>

The company had a net loss of US$1.3 million for the preceding accounting period and no revenue.  A further share issue was contemplated in order to raise further equity which was required, together with some term financing.  At this stage therefore Floatel did not have financing in place to complete the construction of the vessels for use in an industry in crisis.  Whilst the directors predicted great things for the future in the Report and Accounts, there is no basis for thinking that there would be any purchaser ready, willing and able to offer money for SHI’s share holding on 4th December.  Further investigation by DBAG would have led to that conclusion and justified a zero valuation.   </p>

Mr Davies’ higher figure equates to the last traded price of NOK 0.20 on 27th November whilst the lower end of his range of valuations allows for a 30% discount to represent the possibility of reduced price due to market conditions and illiquidity.  Mr Robinson’s valuations are based on the lack of buyers and the overall value of trades concluded in December where 268,000 shares (representing less than 3.5% of SHI’s holding) were traded on 18th, 19th, 22nd and 30th of the month.   </p>

It also entered into contracts for the construction of two further rigs and acquired an option for the construction of eleven more.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">Unlike all the other holdings however, there is evidence here of an off-market purchase of shares by CIMC.  As appears from its 2008 annual report dated 31st March 2009, CIMC acquired about 7.86% of the shares in Yantai in cash at a cost of NOK 186,831,510, equivalent to US$26,726,789, on 28th November, 19th December and 30th December 2008.  The average implied price per share is NOK 8.69 (equivalent to US$1.24).  This material came to light late in the day as a result of Mr Robinson’s investigation but it did not cause him to change his mind about the valuation for December 4th which ranged from zero/de minimis to US$70,000 on the basis of lack of available buyers and the aggregate of money spent on purchase of shares in Yantai between 4th and 31st December, with that aggregate amount spread across the SHI holding.  By contrast Mr Davies’ valuation ranged between US$3.63 million and US$5.19 million.  The higher end of the range was based on the traded price on 28th November of NOK 7.50 whilst the lower end allowed for a 30% discount to represent the possibility of a reduction in price due to market conditions and illiquidity.  That 30% discount would result in a value of NOK 5.25 per share.  Mr Davies refers in his first report to a figure of NOK 16.25 per share paid by CIMC for 10% of Yantai’s shares in November 2008, which he assumed was reflected in the reported share price of 28th November 2008 for the small quantity of shares listed as sold in the market that day.

Since these were “off-market” transactions, they must have involved bilateral negotiations by CIMC with shareholders.  In consequence, it is now known that there was a purchaser in the market buying up blocks of shares in Yantai in this period.  The evidence of Mr Robinson was that on 3rd November 2008 CIMC acquired a 10% stake in consequence of a change in previous purchase arrangements.  It had been announced in March 2008 that CIMC was going to purchase a 30% stake, but the price and number of shares were subsequently reduced.  In consequence a 10% stake was bought early in November at NOK 16.25 per share (at a time when the listed price was NOK 12.5) and then the further 7.86% was purchased on the 3 dates in November and December surrounding the Termination Date at an average price of </p>

Further enquiries made by DBAG would have brought this to light and an immediate sale would have been possible on December 4th.  I can see no reason, other than the possible perception by CIMC that this was a distressed sale, why the price of NOK 8.69 should not have been achieved for these shares.  The total realised price and therefore the valuation would have amounted to NOK 42,875,591.

What DBAG ought to have done was to have made further enquiries about the individual holdings.  If DBAG had done so, it would have come up with information of the type that has become available to this Court, albeit doubtless in less detail.  One area where this would have made a significant difference is the Yantai shareholding where the substantial interest of CIMC in purchasing the shares would have come to light.  Additionally, investigation of the liquidity of the Scorpion shares would have shown that a price was obtainable, as is recognised by Mr Robinson.  Whilst the position is less clear for American Shipping, I have reached the same conclusion.  The effect of my conclusions is that SHI is entitled to an additional credit of US$6,866,359 against any sums owed by it to DBAG.   </p>

As noted by the New York courts, “The duty of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in the performance of contractual obligations to the extent that a separately stated cause of action asserting breach of that duty is routinely dismissed as redundant.”  In the present case, that is exactly what has happened in the New York action.  The seventh cause of action alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was dismissed by Justice Kapnick on 9th November 2012 as duplicative of SHI’s more specific breach of contract claims on the basis that they arose from the same facts.  The other wrongdoings alleged deprived SHI of the intended benefits for which it bargained, including the rights provided by the terms of the FXPBA and FX ISDA (whether express or implied).  The alleged breach of the implied covenant therefore had no independent substance and added nothing. </p>

Even if there could be a separate cause of action for a breach of the covenant in itself, it could only be in the context of interfering with the contract,  preventing the other party from performance or failing to co-operate with the other party in performance. It cannot subsist without reference to the contractual rights of the other party.

The ineffective cover up continued after the event at the meeting of 30th October and thereafter, including the failure by DBAG to acknowledge its inability to value and margin the EDTs until February 2012.

Additionally, SHI had a counterclaim which was initially expressed as being “not less than $750 million” with a footnote that claims would, where appropriate, be expressed in NOK.  This claim was made in respect of profits which SHI claimed it would have made if DBAG had not been in breach of contract.  SHI’s case is that, had DBAG not breached its obligations, SHI would have retained positions that it was forced to close out, including FX positions, gold positions, short equity index futures positions and long and short equities securities positions.  I have already found that the course of action undertaken by Mr Vik in relation to SHI’s trading on the Equities PB account including the closure of his FX positions and his short equity index futures was not the result of any breach of contract or duty by DBAG, whether undertaken in the context of the 3rd September email from Mr Brügelmann relating to the margin position under the Equities PBA or the losses that he and Mr Said were incurring on their FX transactions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">SHI’s case however was that it would have retained a range of positions that it was forced to close down as a result of the FX margin calls.  Whilst there is a difference between the lost profits that are attributable to the closure of these positions as opposed to the maintenance of them until the time when SHI says they would otherwise have been realised, the overall figure in respect of closure of FX positions, Russell 2000 positions, CAC 40 and IBEX 35 positions, long and short equities positions, gold forward positions and additional gold forward positions amounts to about US$1 billion.  DBAG’s position is that this claim is unsustainable because SHI chose to close down these positions and because it had other funds which were available to it for margin purposes, in particular the money which SHI transferred between 9th and 22nd October 2008, which it could have used to retain such business.  The question of whether these funds were available to SHI is therefore a matter which was canvassed before me and which I am prepared to determine.  In addition to the question whether or not such funds were available for the purpose of meeting margin calls so that SHI was not “forced to close out various positions, in consequence of those calls” the reasons for the transfers may also have significance.  DBAG contends that the transfers of such large amounts reveals Mr Vik’s understanding of the scale of risks posed by Mr Said’s trading at the time in the very volatile market conditions obtaining and his desire at the time to limit SHI’s immediate exposure to the sums remaining in SHI’s accounts with DBAG and DBS.  Furthermore, the history of disclosure by SHI on this subject and the information supplied by Mr Vik demonstrate this and his willingness to mislead the court. </p>

It is true that Mr Vik could not have anticipated this.  It is also true that the extent of the losses which would be incurred in closing out Mr Said’s FX transactions (and his own FX transactions) in the volatile market at the time could not have been calculated by him with any precision as at 13th October.  Mr Said had told him on 10th October that it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to close out the positions but the manner in which this was expressed shows the difficulty of ascertaining what the actual figure might be.  The exchanges between Mr Vik and Mr Said over the preceding few days and their conversations over the immediate past weekend were enough for Mr Vik to know that the losses would be very substantial having conducted an examination of Mr Said’s outstanding positions.  He knew of DBAG’s past failures properly to margin the EDTs and in due course was to seek to make arguments based on that.  There was a perpetual desire to minimise DBAG’s collateral requirements and the sums which DBAG required to be paid.   </p>

Mr Vik signed a disclosure statement on 4th April 2012 in which he stated that it had been transferred to a party other than himself or any corporate body controlled by him and asserted that no further disclosure was needed.  As DBAG submits, the statement can only be read as meaning that the transferee at the time the transfer was made was not a body controlled by him.  Following further orders made by the court because of the unsatisfactory nature of the responses given, it emerged that the funds had in fact been transferred first to SHI’s account with HSBC and from thence to Beatrice, a company which was controlled by him at the time.  In a letter of 23rd November 2012 SHI asserted that, in its disclosure statement, Mr Vik had been referring to the position of the transferee at the time when the statement was made by him and not at the time when the transfer took place.  I do not find such an explanation credible and I see the earlier disclosure statement as a deliberate attempt by Mr Vik to mislead.

The loans from Beatrice to SHI were said to have taken place from 2004 to 2006 when Mr Vik, acting for both SHI and Beatrice agreed the terms of the loan.  In his evidence he said that the loans were made on the basis that they were repayable after five years from the date of the first advance or earlier on demand, and that they would carry interest at a minimum of 15% per annum plus an additional amount to be agreed by reference to the profits earned by SHI.  Mr Vik explained that Beatrice was his savings company whilst SHI was his trading company and it therefore made sense for Beatrice to finance SHI and to participate in its profits.  Not only was there no written loan agreement but there was no documentary record of the existence of any such agreement nor of the origin of any inward payments to SHI which were said to come from Beatrice.

According to SHI’s Further Information, the repayments made included a figure of US$12,173.38 paid on 31st July and a yet smaller sum of US$1,308.46, amongst other figures.  The suggestion that these were “leftover monies that were free” is hardly an explanation for the use of these sums for what was supposed to be an NOK 3 billion obligation.  It appears that, after the event, someone on Mr Vik’s staff cast about to find sums which, when aggregated, would amount approximately to the figure of NOK 3 billion when the first two transfers were taken into account.

The version of events which he puts forward is not, to my mind, susceptible of belief.  The coincidence of the expiry of the 120 day period with October 18th, the absence of documentary records supporting the loan and the size of the payments in question and the rough and ready nature of the supposed interest calculation, when combined with the fact that Mr Vik represented both sides of the alleged loan and agreement for repayment militates against the existence of any loan agreement of the kind suggested.  SHI produced no corporate minutes in support of the loan agreement or agreement to repay.  The corporate books and records of SHI were, in accordance with Mr Vik’s evidence in other proceedings, maintained by the corporate administrators for SHI in the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Mr Vik had not seen any such minutes and said in evidence that he thought that no minutes were required for loans of US$240 million with significant interest repayment obligations.

Mr Vik owned SHI and Beatrice at all times until 30th October 2008 at the earliest and moved money from one to the other as he saw fit.

Mr Said was to produce details of his trading and to explain the pattern to Mr Vik with a view to deciding what was to be done.  It is in this context that any instructions given on 9th October to transfer funds out of SHI have to be seen.  The extreme reluctance shown by SHI and Mr Vik to produce documents relating to these transfers and the paucity of documentation actually produced after a series of applications by DBAG all point to the same conclusion which I have already expressed.  There was no good bona fide commercial reason for the first two transfers from SHI to Beatrice and they can only have been done with a view to depleting SHI’s assets and making it more difficult for DBAG to seek recovery, should it need to do so.   </p>

Why Mr Vik should decide to pay himself a capital distribution from SHI on 14th October via Beatrice is not adequately explained.  The explanation given was only advanced after the series of applications to which I have already referred.  No documentation was provided in support of this capital distribution and no corporate documents by way of minutes or anything else to support it.  SHI’s case is that the transfer was instructed on 9th October but there was again no contemporaneous documentary evidence of that.  Mr Vik’s evidence about a conversation with Mr Gauch and the letter from Mr Gauch do not carry conviction, though it matters little in fact whether the instruction date was 9th October for this and for the transfer of fiduciary deposits or not.  Delay in effecting the instructions for four days or more however seems unlikely. </p>

Mr Vik had previously been a director.  No documentary evidence was produced to show when instructions were given for the transfer though SHI’s case is that they were given on 8th or 9th October.  It may be recalled that this was the certificate of deposit which had been held by DBAG but was treated as a “special item” in Mr Brügelmann’s email of 3rd September so it did not qualify as collateral for Mr Vik’s Equities PB account.

This loan is once again entirely undocumented.  The loan is said to have been made on the same basis as the funds advanced to Beatrice, namely that repayment would take place after five years from the date of the first advance or earlier on demand and that on repayment of the principal, VBI Corporation would be entitled to receive a minimum base interest of 15% and agreed profit interest.

There is no record in SHI’s bank statements reflecting any payments to SHI from VBI Corporation.  A number of payments said to constitute the NOK 1.7 billion are attributable to Fearnley Fonds ASA, the brokers who handled various investments for SHI.  The demand for repayment was, according to Mr Vik, made orally by his father in person but he did not demand full repayment of the loan with interest and profit interest.  According to Mr Vik it came up in conversation that SHI had free money at DnB and they discussed the use of that money to repay the loan.  Mr Vik junior did not make any calculations as to the profit or interest payable at that time.  When cross-examined about the fact that Mr Vik senior was not a director of VBI Corporation on 1st October 2008 and therefore had no authority to act for VBI Corporation, Mr Vik simply said that this was how they acted.  It is highly unlikely that it would take much time to effect instructions to transfer the certificate of deposit which actually took place on 16th October.   </p>

On 9th October he instructed Mr Brügelmann that they should be transferred to SHI’s account with DnB.  They were transferred to DnB on 14th October and out of DnB on 15th October.  SHI’s case is that the transfer from DnB was pursuant to an instruction given in July 2008 to DnB to transfer all the Confirmit shares to Mr Vik once 100% of the shares were held on the conclusion of a mandatory buy out process.  The shares transferred on 15th October amounted to 90% of the share capital.

The dates of the transfers make it difficult to accept that instructions could have been given as early as Mr Vik says, save where the documents show that to be the case.

The first of these was a 450 million (short) EUR/(long) NOK position which was closed out on 22nd October by transferring it to an account held by Mr Vik’s father at HSBC Guyerzeller in Switzerland, thus releasing collateral held in relation to it in the GPF account.  Because of subsequent movement of the currencies, as at 1st December 2012, there was a loss of profit of US$111 million.  The second position was a 994 million (long) NOK/(short) HUF position which was closed out on 22nd October.  If held at 1st December 2012 the lost profits would amount to US$54 million.  The third trade was a 1.5 billion (short) USD/(long) NOK position which was closed on 14th October and which, if held at 1st December 2012 would have given rise to profits of US$79 million.  The total profits as at 1st December 2012 would therefore have been US$244 million but figures would have to be calculated for the position as at trial.   </p>

In his deposition, Mr Vik had admitted that over the period July-October 2008 SHI had reduced positions in FX in response to the market.  He accepted in cross-examination that he had two very bad days in August where significant losses had been seen on his futures and FX positions and on 6th October in discussion with Mr Said he referred to himself as “one of those forced to close out positions because the pain is too great”.

Mr Vik wished to continue to back the NOK but, after acquiring the first tranche of 200 million short EUR/long USD on 7th October to replace part of SHI’s short USD/long NOK position, by the next day there was a negative MTM of NOK 228 million.  With a further build up of this position on 13th/14th October, the negative MTM increased so that by 21st October there was a negative MTM of NOK 552 million.  It was this position which was transferred to Mr Vik’s father’s account by the early morning of 22nd October 2008 and there was no information as to what happened to that trade thereafter.  There was very limited information about the transfer and it was clear from Mr Vik’s answers in cross-examination that he was involved on both sides of the transfer.  Mr Vik maintained that it was a normal sale of the position and he assumed that his father must have put up collateral at HSBC though he did not know for whose account at HSBC the position was entered into.  Given SHI’s own connections with HSBC and the lack of information supplied, there is room for doubt as to whether SHI truly did dispose of the position and whether therefore it could have suffered any loss but I make no findings on that.  The availability of other funds to SHI meant however that it was not forced to close this position out.   </p>

It appears that he had it in mind to close this trade before the margin calls and was looking for the best price at which to do so.

Mr Vik accepted in cross-examination that the reduction of the position from 2.9 billion at its peak to 1 billion was for reasons entirely unconnected with Mr Said, and I find it was because of his loss of confidence in his trading view that the USD did not justify its strength whilst the NOK was undervalued.  Closure of a number of other short USD positions was effected on 7th October, about which no complaint is made.  I have not referred to all the emails which show Mr Vik’s increasing dissatisfaction with the position but it is clear that the close out of the remaining US$1.072 billion on 14th October was a continuation of the process in which Mr Vik was already involved.   </p>

The first margin call was sent to Mr Vik at 5.15 pm GMT on 13th October whilst the second margin call was sent on 14th October at 17:36 GMT by which time this trading position had been completely closed out.  When cross-examined as to how it could be said that it was the margin calls which had forced this close out, Mr Vik resorted to saying that it was the uncertainty caused by the first margin call or the uncertainty in FX that drove him to do it.  He attributed it to the whole situation developing with Mr Said.  Yet he had decided as far back as 5th October to close out all his short USD/long NOK positions so that this closure cannot be attributed to the margin calls.   </p>

Mr Vik instructed Mr Brügelmann as to the prices at which he was to buy back the shorts and Mr Brügelmann did so, in some cases doing better than the limits given to him.  Those funds were needed for FXPBA margin if no funds were to be produced from elsewhere but there was an element here of managing positions and deliberate profit taking with an eye to market movements. </p>

The first occasion upon which SHI ever purchased gold through DBAG was on 10th October 2008, by which time Mr Vik was well aware of the problems that Mr Said had encountered which were likely to lead to hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in closing out his trades.  Mr Vik obviously considered whether or not there might be flight to gold because of the existence of the currencies issues and instructed Mr Brügelmann to purchase gold at the price of US$880 per ounce.  The spot price was higher than that on 9th October when the instructions were given but the purchase was effected the next day.  By 13th October however, the price had reduced rather than gone up and on 14th October Mr Vik instructed Mr Brügelmann to sell at the price which he had paid.  Mr Vik did not need to sell US$20 million worth of gold to meet the first or second margin call but the price did not go up and the sale was effected on 22nd October at a loss of US$3 million. </p>

SHI in fact had available to it a fund of almost equivalent size to that of which it alleges it was deprived.  It was therefore in a position to have utilised such funds to trade in the manner set out in the Hypothetical Portfolio, but it did not choose to do so.  That in itself casts some doubt on the loss of profits claim since, if SHI had the wherewithal to trade and make the profits that are set out in the Hypothetical Portfolio, why did it not do so?  This is of course not fatal to its claim because, had additional funds been available to it, they might have been used in the manner suggested by SHI which was free to use its existing funds in any way it wished.  The point does however highlight DBAG’s submission that the Hypothetical Portfolio does not represent the decisions that would have been taken by SHI if it was trading for real during the relevant period following 4th December 2008, in circumstances where Mr Vik has produced no information or documentation relating to any actual trading or trading strategy carried out by him in the period in question.   </p>

Each worksheet not only deals with the inputting of data, but also contains a calculation engine determining realised and unrealised profits and losses and collateral requirements and produces open positions for reporting purposes.   </p>

The information in the trading worksheets also feeds into the NAV (Net Asset Value) worksheet, which is a weekly recording of the output from the NAV sheet information.  This sheet is nearly entirely populated by formulae and records the total cash position of the portfolio, including realised profits and loss, interest and unrealised profit and loss on open positions at each relevant date.   </p>

Thus at 30th April 2013 there were two hundred and twenty-five individual line entries summarising the life of the portfolio on a weekly basis since December 2008.

The second major shift was in December 2010 when the large equity index futures position that had been built up and maintained was to be reduced.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Different things have been said at different times about the real life nature of the Hypothetical Portfolio.  Following the waiver of privilege in the disclosure of the existence of the Hypothetical Portfolio, I ordered disclosure of privileged documents which related to the date of its creation, formation and development, according to the principles governing collateral waiver.  In consequence some documents passing between SHI and its lawyers were produced.  These documents revealed different answers to questions asked by SHI’s lawyers about the Hypothetical Portfolio.  It was to be traded “as if SHI had been investing “for real” and in real time” and would maintain a record of how the profit and loss developed over time, save that end of day prices were to be used for all trades.  A note of a meeting between Mr Vik, Mr Johansson and SHI’s legal advisers of 2nd February 2012 (disclosed as part of SHI’s collateral waiver of privileged documents) refers to the purpose of the portfolio as being “to recreate SHI’s position that DB had destroyed by closing down the positions” and “rebuilding the positions he had on at the time”.  An email from Mr Vik of 26th March 2012 to his lawyers stated that he thought that some of the first trades were intended to re-establish some of the positions that he had been forced to close.  In a further email Mr Vik stated that the portfolio recorded “the investments that I did do.  Not what I would have done.”  Elsewhere however an attendance note of a meeting between Mr Vik, Mr Johansson and SHI’s legal adviser records that the intention was to “keep it simple – not possible to imitate real life”.  A later attendance note states: “Did commodities.  Was going to do equities but too complicated.”  Further, under cross-examination Mr Vik conceded that there were obviously adjustments which had to be carried out on how to record the portfolio in a way that was feasible for Mr Johansson to achieve but he said elsewhere that the portfolio “wasn’t real life in the sense that it wasn’t real money, but everything else we tried within the constraints that we had, such as how to manage this, how to administrate this thing, how to make it feasible for us to do”.  Mr Johansson accepted that he had tried to record Mr Vik’s trading as in real life so far as it was reasonable to do it, though using rounded figures all the time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I have already referred to some significant differences between the Hypothetical Portfolio and the claim as put in the New York action.  Additionally the Hypothetical Portfolio, however put together, cannot create the pressures that real life trading does.  To my mind it is almost inevitable that trading decisions where the trading is fictional, without any actual risk, will be different from the situation in real life where real money is involved.  The point is illustrated by a week in the period of the Hypothetical Portfolio when Mr Vik’s trades lost NOK 6.6 billion (over US$1 billion).  As is plain from Mr Vik’s reaction in September and October 2008, real life trading would lead to changes in trading activity because the pain would be too much to bear.  With the Hypothetical Portfolio however, nothing was done because there was no real pain and, if there had been huge losses, it would never have been disclosed as privilege would not have been waived.  There are other differences in the types of trading effected, as compared with Mr Vik’s and SHI’s prior trading.  It is highly significant that Mr Vik’s actual trading during the relevant period was not the subject of evidence and no disclosure was given in relation to it, although it was sought by DBAG.  As SHI conducted no trading of its own, it had nothing to disclose and Mr Vik was not prepared to provide any documentation or information as to the strategies which he had adopted outside the Hypothetical Portfolio.   </p>

During 2008, SHI had a far more diverse FX portfolio including an additional twenty-eight currency pairs.  In the Hypothetical Portfolio there was some significant trading in gold whereas only a small quantity of gold had been held for a very limited period by Mr Vik in October 2008.  As already mentioned, there was no trading in equities in the Hypothetical Portfolio (apart from Equity Index Futures) whereas that had played a part in SHI’s trading strategy in the past.  None of the trades in the Hypothetical Portfolio were ever closed out prior to maturity and all the notional investments were made in round number figures, neither of which reflected the reality of Mr Vik’s and SHI’s prior trading.  In cross-examination he accepted that the absence of any trades being closed prior to maturity did differ from his actual approach in real life.  Trading volumes on some indices exceeded the maximum allowable and were of such size as to depress the market price. </p>

Approximately three thousand notional trades were said to have been recorded on it contemporaneously with instructions given by Mr Vik to Mr Johansson or immediately afterwards, using the end of day price to avoid any element of uncertainty.  The one and only record of the Hypothetical Portfolio is on this portable hard drive which Mr Johansson said he carried with him everywhere he went.  There was no back up version of any kind which beggars belief because, on Mr Johansson’s evidence, the product took hundreds of hours of work on his part since he had sole responsibility for creating and maintaining the Hypothetical Portfolio, entering trades, rolling positions, creating P&amp;L and other spreadsheets and tracking performance.

The only documents which now exist consist of rough jottings made by Mr Johansson which he stated were made by him to remind himself of Mr Vik’s oral instructions.  Twelve are dated.  Instructions were given when they sat side by side at adjacent desks in the office in Greenwich, Connecticut and by telephone or Skype when Mr Vik was travelling, which he was for large parts of the year, since he was only allowed to spend sixty days in the USA.  Mr Johansson maintained that instructions were brief and no detailed written notes were required.  A lot of the entries were merely rolling over trades as opposed to entering into entirely new transactions or reducing existing positions.  About 500 trades were not and the notes are said to refer to 40% of such trades.  Only one note exists for between the period 11th September 2009 and 16th December 2010.  There are no notes in respect of 11 of the 20 crucial transactions in the periods of February 2009, December 2010 and June 2011 when strategy is said to have changed and there are no notes after 17th June of that year.

Forensic analysis of the computer hardware upon which the file was said to have been accessed has led nowhere because of various actions taken on the part of Mr Johansson, so that it has proved impossible to establish when the file was created and when the entries were made prior to April 2012.  Mr Johansson’s jottings were obviously made over a period of time and he was able to date some of them, however brief they were, by reference to the numbers in the portfolio and to other events in his life to show that those notes were not fabricated en bloc in 2011/2012, long after the trading dates to which they are said to relate.

The portable hard drive was the sole repository of the Excel file with all the Hypothetical Portfolio information on it.

When asked why this might be, Mr Johansson suggested that the first feature might be explained by his practice of uninstalling the drivers required to connect the portable hard drive to the laptop and reinstalling them whenever he had USB issues whilst the second feature might be attributable to the conversion of the spreadsheets from Excel 2003 to Excel 2010 on 11th April 2012.  Mr Johansson said he kept no copy of the Excel 2003 version and, as already mentioned, had no back up copy of the file, the first saving date for which, as recorded, is 11th April 2012.   </p>

Whilst there were private matters on Mr Johansson’s computer, Mr Johansson was undoubtedly obstructive in this respect and, being as close as he was to Mr Vik, this must have represented a deliberate decision on their part.  According to the Consultancy Agreement between SHI and XXI Art Inc. the intellectual property in the Hypothetical Portfolio recording SHI’s notional trading and for which it was due to pay, was vested in XXI Art Inc.  The separate corporate personality of XXI Art Inc. however (in which Mr Johansson held a one third shareholding and his family held the balance) cannot obscure the reality that this was the vehicle through which Mr Johansson chose to act for SHI and that, had Mr Vik wished it to do so, XXI Art Inc. would readily have co-operated in the production of Mr Johansson’s notes and produced the electronic files and computers for forensic examination.  The history of the delay shows that Mr Johansson deliberately adopted an obstructive attitude.  The order that I made in July 2012 for forensic examination ought to have been completed by October 2012 but was not in fact fulfilled until about February 2013.   </p>

The straightforward thing to do would have been to have told the experts before they began their investigation about what he had done and what his normal practices were.

Mr Vik’s evidence was that he never kept copies of any papers provided to him by Mr Johansson in relation to the Hypothetical Portfolio when they discussed it but destroyed them because the portfolio was evolving and they were of no value as future trades were made.  Again this sits ill with the duty of preserving documents which SHI’s solicitors had explained.  Both Mr Johansson and Mr Vik must have appreciated the importance of any material which supported the claim for lost profits which SHI was hoping to pursue.  Mr Vik’s own evidence was that the purpose of producing the portfolio was to avoid arguments as to what they could or might have done when the matter came to court and so a portfolio was built by trading “as we went along”.  The suggestion that Mr Vik made that he did not imagine that the authenticity of the portfolio would be in dispute is risible.  Mr Vik and Mr Johansson had been specifically advised of SHI’s disclosure obligations in October 2008, just a month before it is said that the decision was taken to initiate the Hypothetical Portfolio and Mr Johansson’s evidence was that he was told not to change anything by SHI’s solicitors when the existence of the computer file was revealed.  In this context, given the supposed conversations by telephone and Skype between Mr Vik and Mr Johansson when Mr Vik was travelling, it is hard to imagine how Mr Vik could have made trading decisions without printouts or electronic copies of the file.  None however were disclosed.  The complete absence of any documentary record other than Mr Johansson’s jottings and five printed out reporting sheets in February 2012 leads to the conclusion that, at the very least, SHI has not given proper disclosure.  The only sensible reason for that is that there is something to hide.   </p>

There was also a further tab “Commodities (spot)” which had a table set up for silver trading.  No trades were recorded in these tabs and yet Mr Johansson’s explanation for the way in which the file was built up was that it evolved trade by trade, starting out with certain sets of asset classes and moving on to other sets with the result that, as they were added, the spreadsheet had to be expanded and various changes introduced.  Both the equities tab and the silver tab contained detailed formulae and data feeds from Bloomberg.  It is hard to see why these tabs were set up if no notional trades were ever conducted.  There was a further tab entitled “Sheet 10” without information but with expanded column widths suggesting that there would once have been data in such columns which has been deleted.  Oddly, a Deutsche Bank logo appears in fifteen of the spreadsheet’s twenty-four tabs.  It was suggested by DBAG that the spreadsheet may have been originally created for another purpose but all the suggestions made were speculative.  It seems to me however that the only basis for including additional tabs would be the effecting of notional trades of other asset classes such as equities, silver and some other unidentified type of assets.  Mr Johansson said he added the words “do not use” to the equities spreadsheet for the benefit of SHI’s solicitors, which is incomprehensible since he alone was the person who made entries in the spreadsheet.   </p>

SHI maintained that with astute directional trading such profits were realistically achievable, particularly where a private investor traded for his own account without being accountable to fund holders or shareholders and where there is no index or publically available information against which to make an appropriate comparison.  In my judgment, on the evidence I heard from Mr Inglis and Mr Davies, the benchmarking analysis conducted by the former by reference to CTA funds and particularly those of a similar size represented a realistic comparison.  The position was different in 2011 because of the radical change in the nature of the Hypothetical Portfolio which was essentially “derisked” between March and September 2011 after making an abnormally high rate of profit in 2009-2010.

This was said to have been Mr Vik’s strategy from way back but in fact the Russell Index hit 400 on 20th November 2008 which would suggest that the strategy allegedly formulated when discussing the portfolio in November could not have set this as a target.  That strategy for going long in equity index futures continued until, at the end of 2010, SHI switched from investing in such relatively volatile assets (which contributed 65% of the Hypothetical Portfolio’s profits) to investing in government bonds.  The effect was that, between 4th December 2008 and 31st December 2009, growth was 212%.  In 2010 there was 44% growth.  In 2011 there was no growth at all and from January to December 2012 there was 13% growth.

In the much easier market in 2005/2007, Mr Davies calculated a return of 107.5% on Mr Vik’s trading whereas in the difficult market of 2008 (which continued thereafter), without the alleged forced close out of positions, the return would only have been around 25% and was hugely negative if Mr Vik’s FX trading was included in full.  The figures put forward for 2009/2010 essentially result from the alleged perfect judgment by Mr Vik of the point at which to move from shorting equity index futures to going long, in February 2009 before de-risking at the end of the year.  Not only is this an unlikely strategy, given the fact that the Russell Index hit 400 in November 2008 (a fact of which both Mr Vik and Mr Johansson appeared unaware) but Mr Johansson missed the actual day when the Russell Index hit 400 in February 2009 as well.  Notional long trading in NOK ignored Mr Vik’s experience in 2008.  The great advantage of the supposed strategy forensically was that, by the time the Hypothetical Portfolio was disclosed in April 2012, and future trading decisions were open to be seen, limited trading risks were being taken and the profits had all been earned long before anyone other than Mr Vik and Mr Johansson were told of the portfolio’s existence.   </p>

Nor was the effect of spreading the trade to the similar indices evidenced sufficiently.  Leaving aside some of the practical difficulties involved in effecting the trades referred to in the portfolio, it is all the factors to which I have referred earlier which lead me to conclude that what appears in the portfolio does not represent a real trading strategy that Mr Vik would have adopted in actuality, with real money and assets at risk.  The results are simply too good to be true and the whole history surrounding the making of the claim, the disclosure of the Hypothetical Portfolio, the deliberate destruction of any audit trail and the virtually perfect reading of the market required to earn the implausibly high profits achieved lead me to the conclusion that the portfolio cannot be relied upon as evidence of what Mr Vik would actually have done with any funds that he had at his disposal.  The absence of any evidence as to what he actually did with the funds at his disposal reinforces this conclusion. </p>

I do not see how the Hypothetical Portfolio could have existed in the form it supposedly did in January 2011, given the terms  of the Amended Complaint in the New York action.   </p>

Each such feature is capable of explanation and has been the subject of explanation by Mr Johansson.  On its own each explanation appears plausible but when seen together, they constitute a remarkable series of events which have conspired to make such investigation impossible.  In my judgment this is all too much of a coincidence and I conclude that Mr Johansson went out of his way to avoid any backup or any auto recover function and to disable any mechanism in the computers which would usually exist by which past history could be checked.  Mr Johansson is plainly knowledgeable and skilled with computers, quite apart from engaging his own expert to advise him at one point in this matter.   </p>

The inference to be drawn from the history of disclosure, the lack of supporting documentation, the procured absence of any audit trail before April 2012 and the extent of the profits made is however to my mind irresistible.  The file as it existed in April 2012 cannot reflect a complete series of trading decisions taken contemporaneously by Mr Vik by reference to the dates which appear in it.  In short, in one way or another it must have been “doctored” prior to disclosure to produce the results sought  in the period between the summer of 2011 and the spring of 2012.  It seems inherently likely that there was trading in other classes of assets which has been deleted.  It also seems likely that the timing of some of the crucial strategic trading decisions was fixed with a degree of hindsight, whether moving from short to long equities futures or turning the investment fund into what was effectively a cash fund.  I can only conclude that the only reason for the lack of supporting documentation, the obstructive approach to applications for disclosure and forensic analysis of the computers and the actions taken in relation to computers and the portable hard drive was a desire to produce trading results which were unrealistically high for the purpose of pursuing the counterclaim.   </p>

This held good until 22nd/23rd October when the deficiency in the GPF account was discovered and disclosed to Mr Vik and he refused to produce further margin.

The contrary view would mean that … the methodology prescribed for calculating the termination payment due on a contractual close-out would be inapplicable and the parties’ choice of the “Second Method” for this purpose (so that a payment is due to the Defaulting Party if the termination results in the Non-defaulting Party making a gain) would be fruitless. It is difficult to believe that this would be the parties’ intention, as the Second Method is designed to impose an obligation on the Non-defaulting Party to account for such a gain.  This is an obligation that it would not have following a common law termination.  If it were able to choose between a contractual and a common law termination, this obligation could easily be circumvented and the objective of the close-out provisions defeated …  </p>

Rights of termination should therefore be regarded as falling within the words “except as provided in this Agreement” so that they are implicitly excluded by the fact that the Agreement contains a detailed code governing the circumstances in which termination is permissible, as well as its consequences.” </p>

Breaches were alleged of the FXPBA, which refers to the FX ISDA, of the FX ISDA itself, of the Equities PBA and the Equities ISDA (as well as the oral agreements and the Listed F&amp;O Agreement).  It is hard to see how SHI could claim damages at large in respect of the Prime Broker Agreements and the FX ISDA and Equities ISDA, without reference to the provisions in them and the Master Netting Agreement.  There are express terms in the Master ISDA Agreements about calculation of loss on the occurrence of Events of Default, Early Termination, designation of a Termination Date or Master Termination Date.

DBAG had formal document retention procedures and systems to record telephone calls and preserve the recordings and was subject to regulation with regard to its record-keeping processes in multiple jurisdictions.

In the case of Mr Johansson the steps taken by him to ensure that no audit trail of the Hypothetical Portfolio could occur prior to 10th April 2012 and the limited and reluctant disclosure of other documents were significant.  In Mr Vik’s case, failures to disclose did not play a significant part in my conclusion that he was an unreliable witness, save in relation to transfers of SHI’s assets and his efforts to mislead the Court as to the recipients of them and their continued availability to SHI.  It is striking however, in retrospect, that with very few documents emerging from SHI, Mr Vik made six statements, some of considerable length, in which he referred extensively to documents disclosed by DBAG in support of the case he wished to make.  Much of those statements did not contain, in truth, any real evidence of Mr Vik’s own recollection and he had, it would appear from his evidence, no documents of his own upon which to draw which would support his case.  Selfevidently, what he had done was to study the disclosure given by DBAG and, so far as it was possible to do so, to mould his evidence by reference to such documents where they could in any way be thought of as supportive.  I do not however accept that SHI’s disclosure was adequate and Mr Vik’s own stance on such matters does not do him any credit.  It reinforces the views I had already reached as to his unreliability as a witness.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Nonetheless, as indicated earlier in this judgment, I warned the parties very early on about issues which did not pass the “red face test” and the possibility of indemnity costs being awarded in respect of them.  Whilst such a sanction is of very limited force in an action involving sums of the size in question here and where the costs are also so large, it may be that it would be appropriate in this case to treat pursuit of some of the issues as “outside the norm” and to make indemnity costs orders in respect of them, in the probably forlorn hope that it may discourage other litigants from pursuing hopeless points.  The written submissions of the parties, whilst ultimately obviating the need by agreement for long oral submissions, were extended to cover such a wide range of arguments as to be almost unmanageable.  The process also had the effect of detracting from the traditional approach in closing submissions where the Court has the opportunity to question, challenge and probe the arguments made.  It would be highly regrettable, in my view, if in future substantial litigation, the oral tradition was subverted and replaced by lengthy submissions of the kind with which the Court was faced here.   </p>
