	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The dispute arises between GHU as borrower and Carey as lender.  It relates to the development of a hotel and apartments on the site of the old Marconi Building, which is a prime site on the corner of Aldwych and the Strand in central London.  The site was bought in 2004 by Urvasco Ltd, an English subsidiary of GHU which was set up as the vehicle for the development.  Carey came on the scene in 2007, when GHU had difficulties increasing its bank finance.  Various agreements were entered into on 21 December 2007, including a Loan Agreement. Had the agreements run their course, at completion, Carey would have acquired the property under a Share Purchase Agreement, subject to a leaseback to GHU, which would have had an option to repurchase after seven years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, GHU claims damages against Carey for failing to advance funding under the Loan Agreement.  (The other defendant is Carey’s nominee company London Value Added I Ltd which plays no independent role in the proceedings.)  Lending stopped in June 2008.  GHU says that the failure to lend any more money was in breach of contract, and that it starved the development of funding at a time of tight credit and thereby caused its failure.  Work on the development stopped in September 2008.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GHU’s claim is based on the premise that, but for Carey’s breaches of the Loan Agreement, completion would have taken place under the contractual arrangements between the parties on time.  GHU says it lost the profits it would otherwise have earned on the hotel’s operation, and incurred extra loss over and above the loss that it accepts would have been incurred on the development anyway.  Its damages claim was valued in closing (on the basis of an exchange rate of £1 = €1.16) at about £71.38m.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On its side, Carey says that it was not in breach, because it was not obliged to continue to lend.  This is because GHU was in default within the terms of the Loan Agreement.  Carey’s case at trial had two parts.  The first part concerned alleged “financial defaults” arising from the financial difficulties in which it says the Urvasco group found itself in 2008.  These were associated with the collapse in the property market in Spain.  This part of the case raises significant issues as to the application of the “material adverse change” clause that routinely appears in corporate loan agreements internationally.  The second part concerns alleged “development defaults” relating to the London development, which is effectively a construction case added during the course of the litigation.</p>

However, there was no doubt as to the central battleground.

Each side submits that the other is precluded under Spanish law from relying on points that might otherwise be open to them.  The case is notable for the number of issues, both factual and legal, advanced by the parties at trial (particularly Carey). </p>

On 9 July 2009, GHU commenced the first action against Carey (2009 Folio 931) though it was not served until later in the year.  The claim is for declaratory relief in respect of GHU’s right to rescind the Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to the exculpatory clause 6.17.  If successful, the effect is to cancel the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement.  GHU also claims damages in respect of Carey’s breaches of the Loan Agreement which exceed the sums advanced in respect of which it claims a set off.  Carey filed a counterclaim claiming repayment of the sums which it advanced under the Loan Agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 29 December 2009, Carey commenced the second action against GU (2009 Folio 1692) claiming payment under a guarantee also dated 21 December 2007.  GU’s defence to this claim is that, as guarantor, it is entitled to avail itself of the defences which are available to GHU, as principal debtor.  On 23 July 2010, I dismissed Carey’s application for summary judgment which had been made on the basis that the guarantee was a first demand guarantee and therefore payable without regard to the underlying contract (see [2011] 1 B.C.L.C. 352).  As already indicated, it is not now in dispute that GU’s liability under the guarantee is coterminous with that of GHU.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The summary judgment proceedings were the first of a considerable number of interlocutory disputes between the parties.  The start date of the trial was postponed on two occasions.  GHU says that to a large extent these difficulties have been caused by the changing, and expanding, case which GHU has had to face, involving an increased reliance on construction-based as opposed to financial issues.  It is correct, it appears to me, that Carey’s construction-based case has arisen and been developed substantially during the course of the proceedings.  Carey responds that so far as this is so, it is because of late disclosure of matters about which it should have been told at the time.  I do not intend to debate this further in the present judgment, in case it is relevant to the question of costs.</p>

In opening, Carey translated the word as “forced” or “distorted”.  GHU said that the word “rather referred to estimations which were at the upper end of the reasonable range”, capturing “the idea that the [project manager] had pushed the valuation/certification as far as he felt he properly could, and that anything more could not be justified”.  I do not think that this was pursued in closing.  I am satisfied from the evidence of the translators at trial that in context the word means “forced”.  In the end, the parties sensibly just used the Spanish word.</p>

His evidence was subject to a strong attack in Carey’s closing submissions, some of his evidence being it was said patently untrue.  I reject this attack.  In my view, Mr Couto was an honest witness, who answered questions over some three days of cross-examination as best he could.  He is an experienced businessman who was strongly committed to the London project, and attended court nearly every day of the trial.  He is also strongly committed to Grupo Urvasco, which in some respects at least is a family company.  At times, that commitment led to him giving evidence which I cannot accept.  Where that is so, I have rejected it in favour of other evidence, particularly from the contemporaneous documents.  </p>

Much of the funding anticipated for the project was also in euros.  Specifically, the loan made by Carey (the subject of this action) was in the euro equivalent of £70m. There was, however, a fixed contractual exchange rate of €1.386 to £1.  Finally, GHU had hedging arrangements with a bank, BBVA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Urvasco group is a Spanish enterprise with interests in construction and hotels.  Mr Couto explained in his evidence that Grupo Urvasco S.A., that is, GU, is a private company which was established in 1998 as part of a restructuring of the interests of the main shareholders, Mr Anton Iraculis and Ms Maria Carmen Hernandez.  GU is the holding company for construction companies based in various Spanish cities and provides management services to them.  Since 1973, the group has built over 15,000 apartments in Spain.  By the end of 2006, the value of the construction business was over €1.6 billion (land and sites plus work in progress).  According to Mr Carlos Ramos of Ahorro Corporación Financiera, at the time of the agreements with GHU at the end of 2007, GU was one of the main real estate developers in Spain.  The group is based in the Basque Country, and is particularly strong in the North of Spain. </p>

In 1995, Mr Anton Iraculis (who is the founder of the business and I infer is still its driving force) set up a company called Hoteles Silken S.A. to manage the group’s hotels. </p>

GHU is also the immediate holding company for the individual hotel companies, and has a small number of employees, the people who work at the hotels being employed by the individual hotel companies.  GU owns 93.25% of GHU, the remaining shares being held by individuals involved in the business.  The total hotel revenue for 2006 was more than €125m.  Hoteles Silken is owned 55.55% by GHU (5.55% indirectly).  The company currently manages 34 hotels, most of which are owned by the Urvasco group.  They operate under the Silken brand.</p>

GU’s shareholding in Urvasco Energia was 70%, the remaining 30% being held by individuals involved in the company.  By 2006, the turnover of Urvasco Energia was €22.9m.

By the end of 2006, Grupo Urvasco had funding arrangements in place with forty six (mainly Spanish) banks.

In the ten years up to 2007, the business grew rapidly encouraged by the banks which were, as he puts it, very willing to provide the group with the funds it needed.  Some of its projects were very substantial, for example, that at the site of the old Heineken brewery in Seville purchased in 2006 for €400m with 100% bank finance.  The banks also provided mortgages to prospective buyers of the apartments.  Due to the nature of its business model, he says, and I accept, that liquidity was constantly an issue for the group.</p>

Even given the size of the business, it is plain that this was an enormous sum.  According to Mr Couto’s second witness statement, as at September 2008 it had reduced to €1.77 billion “for the real estate division”.  By then, there was a massive restructuring going on, which involved lenders accepting assets in satisfaction of debts.  By the end of 2008, the figure had fallen to €1.348m.  Some indication of the extent of the contraction can be seen by the fact that as at June 2011, the figure stood at €354 million.</p>

It was a central location, and Mr Couto was enthusiastic about its possibilities for development as a hotel and apartments.  He was able to engage for the project Sir Norman Foster’s firm of architects, whom he knew from working on a hotel in Madrid.

The new building was to consist of four basement levels, a ground floor and ten further floors.  The hotel would occupy most of the Strand and Aldwych sides, with the West Tower providing the main entrance.  The apartments were primarily on the Montreal Place side.

He set IDOM a target of £55m for the construction works.  As he put it, when he proposed this, “The team of IDOM looked at me, unbelieving, like cows look at a train”.  Nevertheless, in April 2006 a revised budget was prepared by the UST of £57.6m as at February 2006 for the construction works.  However, IDOM made it clear to Mr Couto that this was unachievable, as it clearly was, even on the most optimistic basis.</p>

The UST’s Programme Manager was Mr Utrilla.  As is standard practice on such developments, there were two types of project programme, Long Term Programmes (“LTPs”), which covered the entire duration of the project, and Short Term Programmes (“STPs”) which covered a shorter time period but in greater detail.

The consideration for the lease was agreed at £70m.  This was increased by a variation of the lease agreement on 30 October 2007 to £71m when LPS asked for the plans to have fewer apartments.

As is well known, from about mid-2007, the so-called credit crunch marked a freeze in lending between financial institutions internationally.  Although the development was in London, the position in Spain was also very important, because the Urvasco group was funded by Spanish credit institutions, as indeed was Carey itself.

However, in 2008, the reduction in Spain was much greater than that experienced in the main European economies”.</p>

These had not been referred to in the evidence, and there was no real analysis of them.  Notwithstanding, GHU says that they show that GU was in a poor financial condition in 2007, so that the communications in the first half of 2008 which are relied on by Carey are not any evidence of a change in financial condition.  It accepts that the company faced financial difficulties, but says that these were extant at the time of the Loan Agreement entered into with Carey on 21 December 2007.  This in turn supports a submission that there was no material adverse <span style="font-style:italic">change</span> in the company’s financial condition at the time Carey withheld lending.  In my view however, the communications identified from the second half of 2007 are not as serious as those which followed in the first half of 2008.  In fact, it is common ground that the position was deteriorating during that period.  I deal with this issue later in this judgment.</p>

Mr García-Tapia says, and I accept, that he understood that the end of March was a date by which GHU thought the development would be completed, which allowed for some slippage from the date at which GHU was aiming, which at that time was December 2008.</p>

Of the €3.4m, €2,700,018 was transferred to GU.  This was for the purposes of repaying a loan owed by one of its subsidiaries, Viviendas Ciudad de Sevilla which had nothing to do with the London development.

The provision of this security amounted to financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares by Urvasco Ltd within the meaning ss 151 and 152 Companies Act 1985, and it was accordingly necessary to undertake the so-called “whitewash” procedure provided for under that Act.  Carey strongly criticised GHU for the cashflow statement prepared in connection with this procedure.  It is not necessary to resolve the points raised for the issues which I have to decide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, the method by which Carey paid the £30m was a circuitous one.  On 28 December 2007, it advanced a First Tranche of €8m.  As regards the Second Tranche, instead of cash, it provided GHU with pagarés (a form of promissory note) issued by Caja Burgos in the sum of €33.58m.  Out of that, Caja Burgos (one of Carey’s shareholders) itself retained €4m to discharge debts of the Urvasco group. GHU used the balance of the instruments to secure a short term loan of €29.58m from Banco Vasconia.  That bank allowed €14m to be drawn down, and the loan was repaid on 15 January 2008 when GHU received the cash payment due under the pagarés.</p>

Indeed GHU submits that one of the commercial purposes of the transaction from the Urvasco group’s perspective was to raise this finance in order to pay other debts of the group which were due to be settled by the end of 2007.  In the event, of the sum advanced, GHU only transferred €4.28m to Urvasco Ltd.  This directly led to a funding gap further down the line.</p>

Although (as I have explained) Carey was set up as a fund to acquire interests in hotels, by this transaction it was providing funding for the Urvasco group generally.  When I raised this point, Carey responded that whatever money was advanced under the loan agreement was going to be an offset against the price to be paid in due course under the SPA.  That is correct, but is a partial answer.  It is unclear to me why Carey should have been providing such a substantial amount of funding to the Urvasco group generally, rather than directing the funds to the construction of the hotel which it was buying.  </p>

Now a third party funder had appeared on the scene, with its own monitoring surveyors, G&amp;T.  It would not be surprising if there was a degree of tension, particularly bearing in mind the difficulties the site had been experiencing, and the informal way in which the development had been conducted between Mr Fernandez and Mr Couto to date.  As Mr Fernandez put it in his evidence, Mr Couto preferred to deal on the phone rather than written communication.</p>

However, Mr Couto’s evidence was that the situation in 2008 was such that most of his attention had to be elsewhere, not least as regards the sale of the wind farm business (Urvasco Energia), which Urvasco regarded as essential in stabilising the financial position of the group.</p>

This reflected the fact that whilst Carey was providing the financing, it had also agreed to acquire the hotel, albeit on a leaseback basis.  In other words, it was a purchaser as well as a financier.  Mr Fernandez was at the Bilbao meetings, and would have been aware of these obligations.  However, he may not have fully appreciated the potential extent of the consequences of a breach.</p>

This was because of its unfamiliarity with a deal that involved the acquisition of a hotel in the course of being built.  Mr Fernandez says that on 11 January 2008 when she visited the site, he gave her copies of the reports which had been provided to BBVA, stating that they would from now on be issuing such reports to both Carey and BBVA.  He did the same as regards G&amp;T at the beginning of February.  He says that Carey did not take issue with the proposed form of the reports, and that if any complaint had been made, steps would have been taken to ensure that the reports were compliant with Schedule 3 of the SPA.  I accept this evidence. </p>

Mr Couto said that he understood that the first “Subsequent Tranche”, that is the amounts available for drawdown after the initial £30m, was to be paid by Carey at the end of February to cover the works done in <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> January and February.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally on the question of funding, in January 2008 there was also a drawdown under the BBVA Credit Agreement, but Urvasco Ltd used it (again no doubt at the bank’s insistence) to pay the interest due under the agreement as at 31 December 2007.  As already stated, of the £30m advanced by Carey over the December–January period, €4.28m was transferred to Urvasco Ltd.  This is not the whole picture, however, because Mr Esparza’s witness statement (paragraph 70 of which was not in dispute) shows about €5.1m paid by GHU to Urvasco Ltd on 31 December 2007 and in January 2008.  (According to Carey, this is minus a transfer the other way of €380,000 on 28 January 2008 evident from Urvasco Ltd’s bank statements.)</p>

Whilst I accept Mr Farmiloe’s evidence that IDOM was not particularly forthcoming, I also consider that, perhaps because of the limit which Carey had put on its remuneration, G&amp;T was not as proactive in seeking information as it might have been.  In fact, it did press for information particularly after 6 June 2008, but by that stage it was plain that its client Carey wanted to exit the deal.    </p>

I set this passage out below when dealing with Carey’s <span style="font-style:italic">forzado</span> case.  Presently, it is sufficient to note that it is potentially significant in this context.  Carey submits that it contains an “early admission by Mr Fernandez of … the improper adjustment of certifications ultimately designed to extract more money than was due from Urvasco’s lenders”.   Whilst I do not accept that loaded way of putting it, the email does in terms show that Mr Fernandez anticipated that the certification that IDOM would issue for the February works, which (as I have explained) was the first month in respect of which Carey was obliged to pay, would include certain works carried over from the month of January.  This is the foundation for an important aspect of Carey’s breach of contract case.</p>

According to Mr Garcia-Tapia the process started in about February 2008.  Carey’s case is that it wanted financing because “leveraging was a means of increasing the return to its shareholders, and had nothing to do with the financial position of the fund”.  Mr Garcia-Tapia explained that Carey usually leveraged its transactions with between 60% to 75% debt.  I accept that leverage was part of its business model, but I am satisfied that Carey needed to finance the advances which it was obliged to make to GHU under the Loan Agreement and the SPA.  These obligations could only be met in part out of shareholder funds.</p>

The salient facts were substantially not in dispute.  As explained above, having put Urvasco Energia on the market in January, a binding offer was received from RWE in April, and the sale completed at a price of €363.5m on 6 June 2008. The date is significant, because it is the date when the Subsequent Tranche in respect of the April works was due from Carey, and just before Carey’s letter of 9 June 2008 withholding it.  The sale of Urvasco Energia is relevant to Carey’s claim that a material adverse change in the financial condition of relevant companies in the Urvaso group is established as at this point in time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A considerable complicating factor arose from the fact that since February 2007, Ms Maria Carmen Hernandez (known as Maricar), who was one of the GU’s two main shareholders (the other being Mr Anton Iraculis), had been negotiating to sell her stake in the business.  Given the financial pressure that was building on the group, this was (to say the least) badly timed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulties in the negotiations are illustrated by the fact that in May 2008, obviously in an attempt to put pressure on Mr Iraculis, Ms Hernandez sought to block the sale of Urvaco Energia by refusing her consent.  She also threatened to place GU into court administration, a process known as a <span style="font-style:italic">concurso de acreedores</span>, which is similar to voluntary liquidation in English procedure. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In late May 2008, agreement was reached with Ms Hernandez whereby her shares would be acquired for a price of €79.6m. To implement the purchase, a new company called Numerus Clausus SL was set up by Mr Iraculis, which was in effect a new holding company for GU.  The shares were held 45% by Anton Iraculis, 45% by his wife, the remaining 10% being divided between Mr Couto, Mr Esparza, Mr Jesus Esparza (Mr Esparza’s uncle) and a company called RCM S.L. It appears that the payment to Ms Hernandez mainly came from Mr Iraculis and his wife, and from Mr Couto and Mr Esparza.  As to the rest, GHU says that part came from a dividend of €17.5m declared by GU to Numerus Clausus which was paid from the proceeds of the sale of Urvasco Energia.  The balance was provided by a bank loan of €22.5m from a syndicate of Spanish banks which were lenders to the group.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Numerus Clausus transaction is part of the background, and no more than that in my view.  I do not accept GHU’s submission that the substantial investment by GU’s shareholders and management is inconsistent with a belief that the financial position of GU at this time was poor, or that the syndicated loan was inconsistent with the banks concerned thinking that the group was in a poor state.  Nor do I think that there is much force in Carey’s submission that since the purchase price for the 50% interest was €79,615,527.57, this implies a value for 100% of GU as approximately €159m, and when taken with the cash gain from its share of Urvasco Energia, the construction and hotel divisions had little or no residual value. The answer to these submissions, in my view, is that the deal was conducted in abnormal circumstances, and driven by necessity, probably on both sides.  It is to be noted that only €55m was paid at the time, the rest of the money being paid in 2009 and 2011.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the use of the sale proceeds of Urvasco Energia, Mr Esparza explained that after paying off mortgages relating to the wind farms, repaying a debt of €14.3m, and placing €17.5m into escrow against contingencies, net proceeds of €135.9m were received by GU for its 70% stake.  From these funds, the Banco Vasconia short term loans of €20m mentioned above were repaid.  That left a net sum of €115,619,000.  Bank statements confirmed that on 9 June 2008 that sum was transferred from GU’s Banco Vasconia account to GHU’s Banco Vasconia account.  As Mr Esparza explained, it then went to service various debts.</p>

She asked Mr Losada whether he knew if the company had anything on sale.  As Mr Losada put it to Mr Garcia-Tapia, “We will face trouble unless we speed up the financing process”.

Instead, it is a case where Carey was motivated only by what it perceived to be its financial interests, irrespective of the contractual rights or wrongs vis-a-vis GU and GHU.  It decided on that basis to adopt alternative two, and thereby pull the plug on the investment.</p>

It looked to us from the information which we had available as though it was highly probable that a default had arisen under the contracts we signed in December 2007 and that if Carey continued to pay monies to GHU, the fund would increase its exposure and there was no comfort that those monies would be used for the purposes of the Development. As it was, the Carey fund already had about €50 million at risk. Rather than risk more of the fund's monies, we decided on about 4 June 2008 not to pay the April tranche at this stage until GHU had satisfied us in respect of the issues raised by the accounts, the press and Gardiner &amp; Theobald. We informed the LHW Board of the position and that decision, which they supported.”</p>

In fact, at some time prior to 9 June 2008, Mr Garcia-Tapia came to see Carey’s London lawyers.  I infer that this was to take advice as to Carey’s position, and to draft the letter that was sent on that date.  Board minutes from a meeting on 16 June 2008 express a concern on the part of Board members that it was Carey that might find itself in default.</p>

A very unsatisfactory feature of Carey’s handling of the situation was that no attempt was made to discuss the matter with Mr Couto first.  It was a very unsatisfactory situation generally.  Of the initial disbursement under the loan, most had gone for purposes other than the development.  Of the subsequent monthly tranches due, only two were ever advanced.  The Loan Agreement now effectively in suspension had only been signed some five and a half months before.</p>

According to GHU, the deed establishing the escrow provided that the second charge had to be provided within 15 days, and Mr Losada must have known that it was very unlikely that GHU would be able to complete all the formalities by then.

Mr Couto said that BBVA (which was the group’s largest lender) had outstanding loans of about €400m at this time.

Furthermore, GU by this time was facing substantial potential losses on derivative transactions entered into with the bank, which the bank was trying to get secured.  There is no support in any of the contemporary documents for any such promise by BBVA as GHU suggests.  The bank may have been supportive to GHU at the meeting, and it was certainly in its interests that Carey put more money into the London development, but on the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that it went no further than that. </p>

I deal with this issue below.  GHU contends that it does not show that a default had occurred by 6 June 2008.  All it shows, according to GHU, is that “almost four months later, at the end of September 2008, GU, anticipating possible future financial difficulties, had started negotiations with its lenders to restructure its affairs and reduce its debt burden”.</p>

According to the report prepared by IREA in November 2008, the total indebtedness of GU as of September 2008 was €2.28 billion (which did not include liabilities under derivatives contracts).  GU was facing bankruptcy unless it could persuade its lenders to agree to a massive reduction in its debt.

It is alleged that Mr Losada was discovered to have fraudulently extracted payments from Carey’s funds in the sum of about €23 million by the submission of false invoices for brokerage fees.  Mr Garcia-Tapia described how he took it up in a confrontation with Mr Losada on 6 November 2008, and how he was himself dismissed.  On 12 November 2008, a board meeting of Losan Hotels World asked Mr Losada to return the allegedly misappropriated money.  At the beginning of November 2008, the Spanish police commenced an investigation into criminal complaints made against him and, according to the agreed chronology, criminal charges were subsequently brought.

In this case, it is based on the letter agreement of 21 October 2008 between GHU and Carey, as extended on 26 November 2008.</p>

The commercial purpose was to provide a mechanism whereby Carey might be substituted as lender under the Loan Agreement and the SPA.  If this happened, then a settlement was to be concluded whereby Carey would be paid the agreed sums, would be substituted as lender and a waiver and release of all claims would be concluded.  But, if this did not happen because a replacement funder could not be found and the agreement was allowed to lapse, then it was not to have any permanent effect. </p>

Though the period was extended by the letter of 26 November 2008, in the event, GHU was unable to find an alternative funder.

That would depend, he said, on whether the statute of limitations had run under Spanish law.  This in my view is not realistic.  Carey has sought in these proceedings to recover the sums due under the Loan Agreement, not the letter agreements.  It is obviously much too late now to seek to enforce the letter agreements.

He accepts that the parties’ freedom of contract may be subject to a limited exception that Spanish law would not permit the parties to provide for the contract to be terminated upon any breach no matter how miniscule or trivial.  Professor Gomez does not identify any clauses which in his opinion fall in this category.  A breach would have to meet a materiality requirement, i.e. an <span style="font-style:italic">incumplimiento resolutorio</span>, in order for a right of termination to arise under Article 1124 of the Spanish Civil Code, but this article is not relied upon by Carey. </p>

In general terms I preferred GHU’s case on this point, since it is unlikely that the parties would have intended that <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> breach of the Loan Agreement or of the SPA, even a minor and irrelevant one, would give rise to a default with the potentially drastic consequences which would then follow.

In my view, the evidence of Spanish law is consistent with the formulation proposed by Lord Grabiner QC, that where there is a materiality requirement, the court must consider the effect of the relevant breach or failure, in the context of the relevant obligation.  If it is significant, then the materiality requirement is satisfied.  This contextual analysis is supported by the view of a leading commentator, who says that “… material means material.  If materiality meant only impingement on ability to pay then the test would be stringent since a borrower is only unable to pay if it is insolvent—which is always an event of default in any event” (Philip R Wood, <span style="font-style:italic">International Loans, Bonds, Guarantees, Legal Opinions</span>, 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed, 2007, at 4-008).</p>

This resulted in a material adverse change in their financial condition which (in the case of GHU and Urvasco Ltd) falsified the representation under clause 8(h) of the Loan Agreement, and (in the case of GU), falsified the representation under clause 21.4 of the BBVA Credit Agreement which was, in turn, a default under clauses 10(b)(iii) and (iv) of the Loan Agreement.</p>

However, Carey was unable to rely on this more widely drafted provision since the bank’s opinion so far as expressed at the time was supportive of the borrower.  It relies therefore on the borrower’s representation as to material adverse change.  But whilst a misrepresentation under the BBVA Credit Agreement results in a default under the Carey Loan Agreement, in terms of timing the representation is repeated at the time of advances by <span style="font-style:italic">BBVA</span>.

The court therefore is concerned with MAC clauses in plain vanilla form, the company in question representing that there has been no material adverse change in its financial condition (consolidated if applicable) since the date of the agreement, which for these purposes is 21 December 2007.</p>

It is not, for example, limited to particular parts of company accounts such as net current assets or profits.  It allows the court to consider all aspects of the company’s finances including balance sheet items (assets and liabilities), profit and loss account items and cash-flow or liquidity items, and the impact on these of the state of the markets in which the company was operating.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GHU, on the other hand, submits that the purpose of a company’s accounts (and, in the case of the year end, the financial statements which include notes, an audit report and directors’ report) is to provide a picture of the financial state of the company.

Where a MAC clause is intended to extend to such matters, then these will be expressly stated in the clause.  In the present case, the clauses are limited to changes in “financial condition”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On a construction of the clauses in question, I consider that GHU’s emphasis on the company’s financial information is correct.  Some light is shed by other provisions of the BBVA Credit Agreement.  This includes as an event of default in clause 21.17, “Any event or series of events occurs which, in the opinion of the Agent, might have a Material Adverse Effect”.  This is defined to include a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of an obligor.  The inclusion of events which have a material adverse effect on the company’s <span style="font-style:italic">business</span> covers a broader scope than the MAC which is limited to the company’s financial condition.  For reasons I have explained, Carey could not invoke this provision.  There was no similar clause in Carey’s own Loan Agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, there is a contextual argument that supports GHU’s construction.  The language of the MAC clauses uses the words “<span style="font-style:italic">consolidated if applicable</span>” in relation to financial condition.  I agree with GHU that this appears to be a reference to consolidated accounts.  In my view, it shows that the parties understood that “financial condition” would be principally assessed by reference to accounts and, in particular, consolidated accounts where applicable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my opinion, an assessment of the financial condition of the company should normally begin with its financial information at the relevant times, and a lender seeking to demonstrate a MAC should show an adverse change over the period in question by reference to that information.  The financial condition of a company during the course of an accounting year will usually be capable of being established from interim financial information and/or management accounts.  On the broader construction proposed by the lender, the enquiry becomes wide ranging and imprecise.  For that reason (as explained below) I prefer the approach of GHU’s expert to that of Carey’s expert.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the lender however that the enquiry is not necessarily limited to the company’s financial information.  There may be compelling evidence to show that an adverse change sufficient to satisfy a MAC clause has occurred, even if an analysis limited to the company’s financial information might suggest otherwise.  The present case provides an example.  GHU accepts that from mid to late June 2008 GU ceased paying bank debts.  (There is a question which I will have to address as to the position at the relevant date, namely 6 June 2008.)  Clearly, the act of ceasing to pay bank debts may be highly relevant to the question whether a material adverse change has occurred in GU’s financial condition.</p>

GHU submits that the purpose of a MAC clause in the context of a loan agreement is ultimately to protect the rights of the lender to payment of interest and repayment of principal.  Accordingly, a material adverse change in financial condition should be assessed by reference to those changes in a company’s balance sheet position which are relevant to the company’s ability to meet such obligations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is some academic writing on this point which supports this view.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Encyclopaedia of Banking Law</span> says at F[1862] that, “It is considered that normally an adverse change in financial condition would be material if the change would have caused the bank not to lend at all or to lend on significantly more onerous terms, eg, as to margin, maturity or security”.  Zakrzewski (ibid at p. 350) puts it slightly differently, considering a change to be material that substantially affects the borrower’s ability to repay, or, more generally, significantly increases the risks assumed by the lender.  In other words, to be material, the adverse change must be material in a substantial way to the borrower’s ability to perform the transaction in question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with this approach.  Unless the adverse change in its financial condition significantly affects the borrower’s ability to perform its obligations, and in particular its ability to repay the loan, it is not a material change.  I would emphasise the word “significant”.  Unless the clause is read in this way, a lender may be in a position to suspend lending and/or call a default at a time when the borrower’s financial condition does not fully justify it, thereby propelling it towards insolvency.  Suitably modified, the same test applies where the obligation is one of guarantee.</p>

GHU submits that if a state of affairs at the time of drawdown was already subsisting at the date of the loan agreement, it will not give rise to a MAC.  An event which is continuing between the two dates by definition will not constitute a change in financial condition between the two dates.  Also, if the lender was aware of the state of affairs at the time of entry into the loan agreement, it will be taken to have entered into the contract notwithstanding their existence.  This latter point, GHU submits, applies equally in relation to a state of affairs which is <span style="font-style:italic">likely</span> to occur at the time of entry into the loan agreement, since it cannot be said that the occurrence of the change is such as would have caused the lender not to lend at all or on materially different terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In summary, authority supports the following conclusions.  The interpretation of a “material adverse change” clause depends on the terms of the clause construed according to well established principles.  In the present case, the clause is in simple form, the borrower representing that there has been no material adverse change in its financial condition since the date of the loan agreement.  Under such terms, the assessment of the financial condition of the borrower should normally begin with its financial information at the relevant times, and a lender seeking to demonstrate a MAC should show an adverse change over the period in question by reference to that information.  However the enquiry is not necessarily limited to the financial information if there is other compelling evidence.  The adverse change will be material if it significantly affects the borrower’s ability to repay the loan in question.  However, a lender cannot trigger such a clause on the basis of circumstances of which it was aware at the time of the agreement.  Finally, it is up to the lender to prove the breach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Clause 16.28 deals with this issue under the heading, “Times for making representations”.  The provision is in conventional terms.  Its effect is that the representations made at the time of the agreement were deemed to be repeated by GU on three occasions.  These were, first, the date of each Request (which as defined in the agreement was essentially the date of the request for drawdown), second, on each Utilisation Date (again defined, but essentially the date of drawdown) and third—and this is the material part of the provision for present purposes—on the “first day of each Interest Period”.  This term, as I shall explain shortly, was also defined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its written opening submissions, GHU said that “Carey’s pleading appears to proceed on the assumption that such a representation [that is, as regards material adverse change] was made by GU in around June 2008 (Defence paragraph 56A). However, there is no plea of when such a representation was made, or was deemed to have been made, by GU. This part of the pleading is for this reason defective and fails to disclose a proper cause of action …”.  The submissions on the point go on to state that they are without prejudice to that contention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its written opening submissions, Carey countered that, “As GHU recognises, the pleading is based on the making of a representation at least in early June 2008”.   It went on to assert that there being no agreement to the contrary, the first day of the Interest Period in respect of the 5 December 2007 drawdown under the BBVA Credit Agreement following the first period of six months, was on 6 June 2008.  In other words, it was asserting that the third of the times identified in clause 16.28 was applicable.  Factually, it is not in dispute that there was a drawdown (or more precisely two drawdowns under facility B and C of the BBVA Credit Agreement) of about €3.4m on 5 December 2007.  I have referred to it in the factual narrative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey then applied for permission to further amend paragraph 56 of its Defence to assert the representation it had alleged in its opening submissions.  For reasons which I gave at the time, and need not repeat, I granted permission to amend, and permission to GHU to plead a consequential amendment to paragraph 40 its Reply.  The issue, therefore, no longer turns on a pleading point, but is whether Carey’s contention is correct.  Carey’s amendment is limited to 6 June 2008, because the six month period from 5 December 2007 and thereafter for which it contends does not cover the remaining drawdown dates under the Loan Agreement prior to its cancellation.</p>

Where a drawdown was made during an interest period—and that applies to the drawdown of 5 December 2007—interest would be due from the date of the drawdown to the end of the relevant period.  So as regards the 5 December 2007 drawdown, interest accrued until 31 December 2007, which was the end of year interest period, and then the new interest period started on 1 January 2008, and again on 1 July and so on.</p>

Interest statements show, GHU submits, that where a drawdown was made during an interest period, the interest period for that drawdown would run to the end of the existing period, and then fit into the six monthly scheme. An example is a statement from BBVA with a date of 31 December 2007 dealing with facility B under the agreement, which was the facility concerned with the hotel. The statement shows the “periodo de liquidacion”—which it is not in dispute translates as “calculation period”—in respect of interest.  This is stated as 1 July 2007–31 December 2007.  The statement shows the amount of principal outstanding, increasing according to the various drawdowns.</p>

The same reference appears on the equivalent document relating to facility C, which referred to the apartments.  This, GHU submits, shows interest in respect of the 5 December 2007 drawdowns being accounted for on the basis that interest was to accrue until the end of the existing period on 31 December 2007, and then starting a new interest period on 1 January 2008.  I am not sure that this was in dispute, and in any case is clear from the face of the document.  From 5 December 2007, a period of 26 days takes one to 31 December 2007.  </p>

Since the starting figure on this statement is the same as the closing figure on the previous statement, it follows that the 5 December 2007 drawdown is included within the new interest period beginning on 1 January 2008.  There is no document in the files in relation to facility C, but there is no reason to suppose it would be any different.  The same position is shown in the interest statements for facilities B and C for the period of calculation from 1 July–31 December 2008. </p>

It may have suited the bookkeeping arrangements of BBVA to have half year and end year arrangements, but that does not mean that the interest period was amended.  As to clause 9.2, it is submitted that this is simply a boilerplate provision designed to bring under the umbrella of an interest period multiple drawdowns.

It is important to appreciate that Carey alleges and pleads that the relevant representation was made <span style="text-decoration:underline">on</span> 6 June 2008.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also to be noted that it is coincidence that an argument is available to Carey as regards GU’s financial condition on that date.  Drawdowns under the BBVA Credit Agreement were not made at regular intervals.  The evidence is that they were made at irregular intervals, depending on the state of play between BBVA and the Urvasco group at the time.  The drawdowns on 5 December 2007 could easily have been made on some other day, or indeed some other month, and if so, the foundation for Carey’s material adverse change case as regards GU would not exist.  Of course, this does not in any way prevent Carey relying on the contractual provisions if it can show that they apply. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey’s contention is that GHU cannot make out any agreement that the interest period was to run other than by reference to the date of the drawdown, that is, 5 December 2007.   However, as lender, it is Carey that is asserting that there has been a material adverse change. The onus of proof lies on Carey to prove its case under clause 16.10 and the other relevant provisions of the BBVA Credit Agreement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is ample evidence, in my opinion, to demonstrate that the agreed Interest Periods were from 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December in each year.  “Agreed” in this context means agreed between BBVA and Urvasco Ltd.  Carey is not a party to this agreement.  Apart from Ms Santamaria’s witness statement, this clearly appears from the BBVA interest statements themselves.  These show that interest on the 5 December 2007 drawdowns was calculated on a 26 day basis until 31 December 2007, with a new Interest Period beginning on 1 January 2008.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is nothing commercially surprising about such an agreement.  On the contrary, it would be commercially surprising if a situation obtained by which there were multiple different interest periods under the BBVA Credit Agreement, depending on the date of the drawdown.  In any case, in my view, and as GHU submits, the evidence shows what was agreed.  It shows, as GHU submits, that the agreed Interest Periods were from 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December in each year.  Any doubt on the matter is dispelled, in my view, by clause 9.2, providing that unless Urvasco Ltd otherwise requested— and no one suggests that it did—an Interest Period for Loans under the Agreement ended on the same day as the current Interest Period for any other Loan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, it is fair to say that Carey could (as BBVA did) have incorporated in its own Loan Agreement a representation as to material adverse change by GU (which also gave a guarantee of that agreement), and provide that it was to be repeated at each drawdown under that Loan Agreement.

Mr Beltrán’s analysis which then leads him to conclude that these MACs had occurred by 6 June 2008 is based on the weakness of the condition of GU, GHU and Urvasco Ltd as at 21 December 2007, the nature and extent of the changes in 2008 and his consideration of the business model of GU, the development of the macro-economic and sector and market indicators during 2008, and other sources of evidence including problems with payment of creditors in the first half of 2008, the sale of Urvasco Energia, statements made in the 2008 accounts, the engagement of IREA and statements made in the IREA restructuring plan and in press reports.

Mr MacGregor considers that, although there are some limitations to this information, it represents the best means of the assessing the companies’ financial conditions at 6 June 2008.

His starting point was that the year end accounts to 31 December 2008 showed that a material adverse change had occurred by that time.  He did not however prepare balance sheets for any of the companies as at June 2008.  He relied on the surrounding circumstances, and in particular the state of the Spanish economy as he saw it, and in particular the construction sector where his special expertise lies, to infer that the change must have taken place by 6 June 2008.</p>

In the case of Urvasco Ltd there are accounts as at 31 May 2008 prepared in connection with the “whitewash” necessary to provide Carey with the second charge.  Mr MacGregor sought to construct consolidated balance sheets and use the aggregated profit and loss accounts for GHU and GU at 30 June 2008 based on the IREA financial information.  In the case of Urvasco, he considered the 31 May 2008 management accounts.  On that basis, he prepared an analysis of the financial condition of each of the companies as at 6 June 2008 and then compared this with their financial conditions at 31 December 2007 for the purposes of identifying whether there were any changes in their financial condition.</p>

Its case, GHU says, is heavily based on matters which took place in the first half of 2008, without undertaking a proper analysis as to the extent to which those matters represented a change from the position prevailing at 21 December 2007.  Second, the material it relies on is diffuse and difficult to analyse.  There is, in my view, force in both these points.  Mr Beltrán did not convincingly analyse the change in his reports, and I preferred GHU’s analysis.  Nevertheless, as I shall explain, some of the material that Carey relies on is of considerable weight in itself, particularly when considered in its overall context.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A final and important general point as to the evidence on the MAC issue is as to accounting standards.  New Spanish GAAP came into force at the beginning of 2008.  Significant changes were made, including as to the treatment of property sales, and derivatives liabilities, to bring Spain within current international standards.  This means that it is not possible to compare directly accounts at year end 2007 with those at year end 2008.</p>

It says that while part of the changes would have been caused by the new Spanish GAAP which came into force in respect of the 2008 accounts, the nature and size of the changes is consistent only with a substantial deterioration in the underlying financial condition of GU.

Mr Beltrán accepted that this took place from September 2008 onwards, so it was not a loss which was realised at 6 June 2008.  This submission appears to me to be correct.</p>

Accordingly, an analysis of the items in the GU 2008 accounts relied on by Mr Beltrán in support of his conclusion that there had been a MAC in relation to GU by 31 December 2008 does not lend any support to a conclusion that this MAC had occurred by 6 June 2008.</p>

In that regard, I accept GHU’s point that the major components of the 2008 end of year loss are derivatives and land sales, and not necessarily attributable to matters which resulted in realised losses as at 6 June 2008.  More generally, I also accept its point that there is no analysis by Carey of the financial condition of any of the companies as at 6 June 2008 by reference to their balance sheet position as at that date.</p>

Accordingly, KPMG had to be satisfied at 15 June 2009 (when the report was signed) that GU was a going concern.  Mr MacGregor explained that the rule of thumb is that when an auditor accepts financial statements and signs them off on a going concern basis he must be satisfied that the company will continue as a going concern for the later of 12 months after the balance sheet date or six months after the date of the audit report.  Thus, although there was a qualification, KPMG were nonetheless satisfied that GU would continue as a going concern until at least the end of 2009.  I do not think that this evidence was in dispute, and in any case accept it.</p>

Although the audit report in the accounts is dated 31 March 2008, the evidence shows that the accounts were in fact finalised some time later probably during June 2008 (see, in particular, the reference in the directors’ report to the closing of the sale of Urvasco Energia).  This means, GHU says, that as at June 2008 KPMG considered that GU was a going concern and, moreover, that they were satisfied that it would continue as a going concern until at least the end of 2008.</p>

On this basis, GU was a highly profitable business in the first half of 2008, making a profit of €170,312,554 despite the fact that it had made losses the previous year.  This implies that all the deterioration in the company’s position took place in the second half.  GU’s current assets improved by approximately €460 million in the first six months of 2008.  On the face of it, therefore, the group’s ability to pay its debts would have improved substantially, and yet, as Carey says, it was reliant on the prospect of the sale of Urvasco Energia to stave off its banking creditors in the period between March and June 2008.</p>

On this basis, I consider that the figures cannot be fully accepted, though GHU stood by them in closing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are various factors that may explain this, without impeaching Mr MacGregor’s basic approach.  One may be that he did not see the relevant trial balances.  Carey submits that these suggest fewer sales in the first half of 2008 than recorded by IREA.  GHU says that it is possible that the IREA financial information was prepared on the basis of 2007 Spanish GAAP, whereas the trial balance information may well not have been prepared on the same basis.  This is supported by the fact that in relation to the hotel companies, there are, with one small exception, no differences between the information shown in the IREA financial information and that shown in the trial balances.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider however that the more substantial point in this respect was made by Carey as follows. In terms of GU’s financial condition, it is important to know how many new sales took place in the first half of 2008, and how much actual cash these had generated.  This was particularly important because the change in Spanish GAAP resulted in a very large volume of sales—€135,216,000—which had been recorded in 2007 being reversed out of that year (see note in the GU 2008 accounts under “Ordinary income from the sale of properties”).  They were subsequently accounted for in 2008 (and, Mr MacGregor appears to have assumed, in the IREA figures to 30 June 2008).  The effect of this was that the sales figures for 2008 would not accurately reflect the state of the market in that year because a significant portion of the turnover in 2008 reflected customers who had agreed to buy properties in 2007.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further point is that there is no provision made by Mr MacGregor for the impairment of stocks, whilst such a provision (of €77,746,575) is included in the 31 December 2008 accounts.  Carey says that a provision should be made based on what it says was the fall in the value of land in Spain in the first half of 2008.  Mr Beltrán’s evidence that the valuation of land in Spain decreased by 9.3 per cent during the first half of 2008.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept a number of the points which GHU makes in this regard.  The evidence is that the Group’s property holdings were generally of a good quality, and for that reason a figure relating to the whole country is of limited use.  Further, a fall in value would only require provision in the accounts if it took the value of the land below its original cost (see note 4(i) to GU 2008 accounts).  Mr Beltrán accepted that he did not know as at June 2008 whether the cost of GU’s land and developments exceeded the net realisable value of that land.  As he admitted in cross-examination, “So I don’t know if it was 70, 30, 40, 50, 80, I don’t know”.</p>

It also relied on the fact of the sale to show that GU was in severe financial straits.  However, I consider that in itself the sale of the company says little about the state of GU’s finances.  Further, I accept GHU’s criticism of Carey’s treatment of the topic of adjustments made by Mr MacGregor as regards the sale, which does not distinguish between matters which are relevant to the IREA interim financial information, and adjustments which he made for the purpose of comparing the 2007 and 2008 accounts.</p>

Whilst accepting that there were cashflow problems in the first half of 2008, GHU submits that as at 6 June 2008, these problems were much less acute given the completion of the sale of Urvasco Energia that day for net proceeds of €135.9m.

Mr Couto did not accept this, but there is ample evidence in the contemporary emails of banks being told that the sale of the company would ease the position.  In fact, Carey submits that the cash injection only brought temporary liquidity to GU, the effect of which lasted only for a matter of weeks.  As regards GHU, it says that the company got no practical benefit from the transaction, since (as set out above) an inter-company loan on its books was converted into equity.  There was no substantial cash injection into the company.</p>

This was because the sale realised a substantial profit for GU and generated liquidity which could then be used for other purposes. It offers no support for the conclusion that a MAC had occurred by 6 June 2008.

That, it points out, was only days after receiving the proceeds from the sale of Urvasco Energia.  It refers to what appears to be an internal email of 9 June 2008 within Kuxta (one of the savings banks) which suggests that it had been told that the sale would allow the group to service its payments for 12 months or more, but that was clearly not the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion on this issue is as follows.  Whilst I accept GHU’s contention that the proceeds of the Urvasco Energia sale were substantial, and to that extent improved GU’s position temporarily, I am satisfied that they were nowhere near enough to satisfy GU’s needs.  I agree with Carey that this is demonstrated by the admitted fact that shortly afterwards GU ceased paying bank debts.  It is not difficult to see why that happened.  So far as reliance was placed on Urvasco Energia, the overall impact of the sale was much less than the directors had hoped, or their creditor banks had been led to believe.  It may be that this is the meaning of the passage in the directors’ report to the 2008 GU accounts (set out below) which refers to the capital gains on the wind farm division being “watered down”.  Further, the position was not improved by the fact that (as I have explained) some of the proceeds had to be used to buy out Maricar, who was one of GU’s founding shareholders.</p>

It is common ground that the derivatives contracts are set out in the 2008 GU consolidated accounts at note (15).  The change in the “fair value” of these instruments held over the course of 2008 resulted in a loss of €82.6m being recorded in GU’s profit and loss account as at 31 December 2008.   As GHU puts it, the requirement to include this impairment reflected a change from the position in the 2007 accounts as a result of the new accountancy rules introduced in Spain.  This is a reference to changes to Spanish GAAP which were effective from 1 January 2008.  The result was that changes in fair value had to be shown on the face of the balance sheet and profit and loss account.  The IREA financial information did not include provision for any such change as at 30 June 2008, and for that reason it is not reflected in Mr MacGregor’s figures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey submits that at the end of 2007, GU was very severely exposed to a downturn in the Spanish property market because its business model involved taking on extremely high levels of debt both to purchase land and thereafter to develop it.   As a result, GU needed access to more borrowing, which relied on the continued buoyancy of the Spanish property market.  As Carey put it, “This was a gamble which GU chose to take and is the reason why the business was speculative”.  It failed when the downturn in the Spanish property market which had started, Carey says, towards the end of 2007, continued and worsened in 2008.  Some of this submission is based on Mr Beltrán’s evidence and some on that of Mr Couto, and contemporary emails.  Leaving aside the sentence referring to a “gamble”, I do not think that (in substance) it is factually greatly in dispute.</p>

They knew about the group’s heavy debts, its difficulty in raising finance, and the gathering crisis in the property market in Spain.  Carey nevertheless decided to enter into the agreement.  It did so because it considered that the proposed transaction was very attractive and that the returns which it offered outweighed the risks which it had identified.</p>

GHU says that Carey’s heavy reliance on correspondence between GU and its lenders in the first half of 2008 is flawed because it does not address the question which the court has to decide, namely, whether there was a change in financial condition between 21 December 2007 and 6 June 2008.

In fact, an examination of the material shows that the communications which Carey relies on in the first half of 2008 as showing GU’s poor financial condition were similar to communications which took place in the second half of 2007.  The material relating to the two periods is of similar type.  It is not therefore any evidence of a change in financial condition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I express my views as follows.  A feature of the case is the number of banks with which the group had facilities (by the end of 2006, GU had funding arrangements in place with forty six banks).  It is not difficult therefore to find remonstrations by lenders in the email record, and in my view, these are of themselves of limited assistance on the MAC issue.  I accept that an important part of Mr Esparza’s role throughout was, to put it colloquially, keeping the group’s banks happy, and that liquidity was always an issue for the group.  I also accept GHU’s point that there are communications with the banks prior to 21 December 2007 which are at least not dissimilar to the ones that came afterwards.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, I am satisfied that GU’s problems with its bank creditors did get much worse during the first half of 2008.  This appears from the changing tone of some of the communications, and I give particular weight to those with BBVA.  It is consistent with the rest of the evidence.  It is also of some note that a bank guarantee was called by Heineken on 3 April 2008 in the sum of €4.8m in connection with the Seville development.  This shows that the London development was far from being Mr Couto’s only pressing problem.  So while I accept GHU’s submission that none of the bank material is sufficient in itself to prove a material adverse change, it is in my view part of an overall picture of deterioration in GU’s financial position after 21 December 2007. </p>

It was said that the evidence shows “that at all times GHU was in the business of concealing the truth from Carey”.  There is no evidential basis for that proposition, and I reject it.  In any case, prior to the agreements of 21 December 2007 being signed, there was the usual disclosure and due diligence.

The group’s fragility must, in any case, have been obvious.  The fact that it was reduced to seeking finance from Carey at all made clear that its sources of bank finance had dried up.  In that regard, Carey was well aware that the initial £30m advance (nearly half the total loan) was mainly going to be used for general group purposes.  As I have explained, only €4.28m went into the London development.

(It will be recalled that its right to a second charge over the property was of limited value, since it ranked behind that of BBVA.)  There is no evidence that either Mr Couto or Mr Losada appreciated the extent to which the property crisis would deepen.  There is a suggestion in Mr Beltrán’s report that at this time the general consensus was that the market was experiencing a slow depreciation, and that demand would recover albeit slowly in subsequent years.

I am satisfied that neither Mr Couto nor Mr Losada could have anticipated this, and in my opinion Carey did not assume the risk of it happening.   In short, although the position of GU was poor at the end of 2007, during 2008 it got much worse, and the question is how much worse by 6 June 2008. </p>

Articles of this kind appearing on the internet (or in print) are of variable quality, and are not reliable evidence of the underlying facts.  They amount to a report by the author on the basis of source material, which may be reliable, or which may not be reliable.  Furthermore, there is no particular strength in numbers, since a report can multiply where there is in reality only a single story, and a single source.  Such reports cannot in my view do much in themselves to substantiate a claim by a lender that the financial condition of a borrower has been the subject of material adverse change.</p>

But the economic situation showed no signs of improving, rather quite the opposite, the capital gains on the wind farm division were watered down, handover of housing became extremely complicated owing to the lack of confidence in the sector, numerous buyers pulled out, delivery times were delayed and no sales whatsoever were obtained for developments in progress.

However, I consider that it at least confirms it, and is more explicit in terms of its reference to the decision being taken midway through the year, and as an alternative to an insolvency process.  These reports are contemporaneous, are made by the directors who were in a position to know the facts, and are made in a formal context.  By the time the accounts were signed off, the directors were doubtless concerned to justify the restructuring, which was well underway by then, and which clearly resulted in large losses for the banks.  It is right to say that there must be an element of hyperbole in the reports, in that the reference to “no sales whatever” is inconsistent with other evidence (Carey did not submit otherwise).  For example, the IREA Report recorded that some 35% of buyers were pulling out of sale transactions before completing.  (The reference to a reduction of 30/40% in the value of real estate assets as against mortgage valuations is more plausible.)</p>

Although it is correct (as GHU says) that there is a reference to “gradual deterioration”, the deterioration is said to be “such that in the Spring of 2008 we decided to sell our wind power division”.  (In fact, as the factual narrative shows, that decision was taken in January 2008.)  But, the report goes on to state, the situation showed no signs of improving, rather “quite the opposite”.  I agree with Carey that, when placed against the other evidence, the directors’ reports in respect of GU and Vizcaina can reasonably be understood as referring to problems in the construction side of the business which already existed by 6 June 2008.</p>

As stated in GHU’s closing submissions, this meant that from mid to late June 2008 GU ceased paying bank debts which meant that defaults on those debts began to arise from mid to late September 2008.  As GHU put it in oral closing, if one knows that one is going to go to the banks and invite them to come to the table, it makes little sense to be paying individual banks piecemeal in advance of that process.  In the light of that, it is difficult to see that a material adverse change had not occurred from mid to late June 2008 in the case of GU.</p>

I will not repeat the detailed points made above.  This period is a very short one, only five and half months. Plainly, in normal circumstances it will be difficult for a lender to show a material adverse change over such a short period of time.  Carey has not analysed the financial condition of any of the companies as at 6 June 2008 by reference to their balance sheet position as at that date, which might normally be fatal to such a claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the circumstances of this case are unusual, because (as I have found), it was only in 2008 that the full force of the bursting of the property bubble on GU’s business became apparent.  It is necessary to stand back from the detail at this point.  The business was highly leveraged, property sales were drying up, and the future was in doubt, to the extent that from mid to late June 2008 GU ceased paying its bank debts.  As the directors themselves put it in their report to the 2008 accounts, the economic situation mid-year 2008 showed no signs of improving, rather quite the opposite, which is what led to the restructuring.  In this particular case, I do not think that the balance sheet position is decisive.  I am satisfied that Carey or any lender which knew the facts would have regarded these as changes from the financial condition of GU as it was at 21 December 2007, and would have regarded them as both material and adverse.  That is the conclusion which I reach on the facts as regards GU.  I do so leaving out of account the disputed position under the derivative contracts.  It would be difficult to pinpoint a precise time after 21 December 2007 when the deterioration in GU’s financial condition became a material adverse change, but I am satisfied on the totality of the evidence that it had occurred as at 6 June 2008.</p>

If so, it must determine whether or not any MAC it finds was a default under the Loan Agreement.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Beltrán’s point on exchange losses is the subject only of mention in the part of Carey’s closing submissions dealing with GHU.  It may be noted that the exchange differences component of €33.057m of GHU’s 2008 year end loss includes the euro equivalent of the £26,408,685 unrealised exchange loss in Urvasco Ltd.  As Carey says, the exchange losses arising largely in Urvasco Ltd reflected the fact that Urvasco Ltd was liable to repay BBVA in euros but that it accounted in sterling, so that as the latter weakened in 2008, it would need more sterling to repay the same amount of euros.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as GHU submitted in my view correctly, these are unrealised and uncrystallised losses. They did not result in a cash outflow, and did not reflect liabilities which had to be settled by GHU or Urvasco Ltd as at 30 June 2008.  The actual amount of the liabilities of GHU and Urvasco Ltd would depend on future movements in the exchange rate up to the date when the liabilities fell due for payment.  In any case, some of the BBVA loan could have been repaid using euro proceeds out of the sums payable under the SPA.  Even if it was appropriate to take into account a provision for movement in foreign exchange on the loans at 30 June 2008, which in my view it was not, it was not in dispute that such provision would only be in the region of €9m.  That is not sufficient to make a material difference.</p>

The categories of derivatives are set out below.  Broadly, those with GU as counterparty were interest rate swaps, and those with GHU as counterparty were FX forward agreements and listed options.  According to the accounts, the interest rate swaps were used for hedging purposes, and an internal GU document mainly describes the others as speculative.  In the case of GHU, changes in the fair value of derivatives of €49.575m were carried to its profit and loss account.</p>

Thus an essential building block of a MAC case based on change in the value of the derivatives is missing.  I agree with GHU that even if a change in the fair value of derivatives is relevant to an assessment of financial condition of the companies at 6 June 2008, there is no reliable information available to the court from which the amount of any fair value provision as at 6 June 2008 can safely be determined.  Save that as at 21 December 2007, GU and GHU each had open (and speculative) derivatives positions, I do not consider that the evidence supports even the limited findings of fact that Carey invites the court to make in relation to the derivatives in paragraph 1096 of its closing submissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the trial, I was inclined to agree with Carey that assuming that a change in fair value could be established as at 6 June 2008, this would be a relevant factor in determining whether there had been a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company concerned.  Insofar as GAAP requires a change in fair value in derivative instruments to be shown in a company’s accounts at year end, this (as Carey pointed out) is clearly intended to provide transparency.  There seems on the face of it no reason why (in principle) a similar calculation should not be made as at 6 June 2008, where one is seeking to ascertain changes in the financial condition of the company as at that date.</p>

Mr Beltrán accepted that the ultimate touchstone is whether the ability of the company to meet its financial obligations was seriously damaged and, in particular, in relation to the present case, whether the ability to pay the principal and interest under the Loan Agreement was seriously damaged.  GHU agrees with this part of Mr Beltrán’s approach, and for the reasons explained in the discussion on the interpretation of the MAC clauses, I also agree with it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with GHU that there is a distinction between a change in fair value reflected in a company’s profit and loss account, as happened in this case as at 31 December 2008 in accordance with Spanish GAAP, and a change in the liabilities of the company concerned.  Fair value, as GHU says, is an accounting construct for the purposes of international accounting standards based on a hypothetical disposal to a hypothetical buyer in circumstances where no such disposal is proposed or may even take place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difference in this notional loss and the actual position is illustrated in respect of these instruments by what happened as between GU/GHU and the banks concerned.  This is described in the summary set out above. As at 31 December 2008, the banks essentially put off maturity of the instruments.  Plainly, this was because GHU/GU would have been unable to meet the liabilities if called upon to pay.  It is clear that they (in fact the principal bank concerned was BBVA) treated liability under the derivatives very flexibly.  In the result, under the sterling/euro contracts and Transaction II, GHU will not have to make any payment until 2016.  The interest rate swaps mature over a number of years up to 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I think that there is a limit as to how far this point can be taken.  A material adverse change in a borrower’s derivatives exposure, if it can be demonstrated, may, in my view, go to show a material adverse change in the borrower’s financial condition for the purposes of a MAC clause.  GHU ultimately accepted that there is bound to be a degree of judgment involved, and there cannot be a hard and fast rule.  So, it was accepted that if one has a derivative that is about to mature, the position may be different than in relation to a derivative which is going to mature some time in the future.  Otherwise, it was said, one has to assume that derivatives are going to continue through to maturity.  The question is one of value in respect of a future and contingent right to an asset which is changing in value over time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my opinion, the position depends on the particular facts of the case.  An apparently serious exposure to derivatives may, on analysis, be less so, and vice versa, when considered against its effect on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan in question, which is the question which is relevant to materiality.  The likelihood of margin calls, or compulsory close out prior to maturity, may be relevant.</p>

In oral closing Carey submitted that it had been omitted from its calculations, and when it was included, it increased liability as at 31 December 2008 by €6.3m.

Thus, although Carey cited this transaction as giving rise to a substantial additional liability, in the result it was of negligible effect. </p>

In the absence of specific submissions I do not make findings as to later dates, and because of my findings on other issues, it is any case academic.</p>

The company was incorporated to purchase the London site and build the hotel.  Its shares were wholly owned by GHU, and would have been sold to Carey had the transaction completed.  During the relevant period, that is 21 December 2007 to 6 June 2008, the building works were proceeding.  Urvasco Ltd incurred liabilities to contractors and in respect of the BBVA Credit Agreement.  The funds it received came solely from BBVA, Carey and the Urvasco group itself.  The building works stopped after Carey withheld funding.  A case of material adverse change in the financial condition of Urvasco Ltd has to be seen in this light.  The position as regards Urvasco Ltd did not feature at length in the written submissions or the oral argument.</p>

In fact, the parties’ submissions were relatively straightforward.  Carey’s case is that Urvasco Ltd’s financial condition, as revealed purely in its accounting documents, deteriorated substantially in 2008.  This was largely, it says, because of a very large exchange loss as sterling weakened against the euro.  Carey says that the changing exchange rate “cannot be written off as irrelevant”, because the exchange rate loss presented Urvasco Ltd with a substantial issue as the gap between the amounts it would receive on completion and the amount it had to repay to BBVA widened.</p>

However, in 2008, this loss increased to £26.8m.   Of this loss, £6.5m had accrued by 31 May 2008.  This was according to the interim accounts for Urvasco Ltd prepared in the context of the “whitewash” procedure carried out in relation to the granting of a second-ranking charge to Carey.  Thus, the loss for the whole of 2007 was matched by the loss in the first 5 months alone of 2008.</p>

The loss on foreign exchange to 31 May 2008 was £6,407,536 which is the great majority of the total loss of £6,535,982 (see the 31 May 2008 management accounts).</p>

As GHU says, they represented losses that might be incurred, if at all, when the BBVA loan came to be repaid.  The actual liabilities depended on future movements of exchange rates.

In fact, these amounted to liabilities of £27,844,723.  This was the subject of evidence at trial, and I accept the evidence of Ms Santamaria that the intention always was that these loans would be capitalised on completion.  This was because on completion, Carey would acquire the shares.  £15 million of that lending was in fact capitalised on 31 July 2008 as part of the “whitewash” arrangements.  GHU says, and I accept, that it was always open to the Group to capitalise these loans as required and, in these circumstances, a negative net equity position was not itself an indicator of a poor financial condition of Urvasco Ltd.  I reject these submissions of Carey, therefore.</p>

Completion of the development was crucial to its financial condition but Urvasco Ltd lacked sufficient funding to achieve this even on the September 2007 budget.  Further, the cost of completion was getting more expensive and was not going to be achieved by the Long Stop Date because of the serious lack of design and progress.  The increase in the costs of the development gave rise to a funding gap.  (Again, these issues are discussed in other sections of this judgment.)</p>

In any case, I accept GHU’s submission that these matters are not in themselves evidence of a change in the financial condition of Urvasco Ltd between 21 December 2007 and 6 June 2008, and I reject Mr Beltrán’s suggestions to the contrary.</p>

But the question is whether they go to show a <span style="font-style:italic">change</span> in Urvasco Ltd’s financial condition between December 2007 and June 2008.  The factual position is that on 10 January 2008, a claim form was issued by Cantillon against Urvasco Ltd to recover £461,089.58 owed pursuant to an Adjudicator’s decision dated 28 November 2007.  Despite reminders from Mr Fernandez, this amount had still not been paid by 20 March 2008 when Cantillon issued Urvasco with a statutory demand.  (It was paid shortly afterwards)  This issue therefore well pre-dated the Loan Agreement, and does not assist Carey.</p>

Again, I have analysed the factual content of this issue elsewhere.  The facts are complex and interlocking, and the result is that I have accepted that such a gap existed.  However, to place reliance on the funding gap for MAC purposes involves taking into account the ability of the company to fund future prospective liabilities which it has not yet incurred.  I am satisfied that this is impermissible as matter of principle, and would introduce uncertainty.  There is a further question as to whether it would amount to a change, given the existence of the gap from the outset of the relationship, compared with the extent of the gap as at 6 June 2008 so far as ascertainable.</p>

This is particularly the case where, as here, the company is a wholly owned SPV without resources of its own and, when incurred, the liabilities would be funded by its parent company.

This may be conducted: (1) through the exchange of an existing debt instrument for a new one, as in refinancing or debt exchanges; or (2) through a change of the terms and conditions of the existing contracts (this is often simply referred to as rescheduling, as opposed to refinancing). Rescheduling may or may not result in a reduction in the present value of debt, as calculated by discounting the old and new payment schedule by a common interest rate.</p>

A highly leveraged company such as GU, it was submitted, must be making calls of that sort every day. Rather, the term “rescheduling” in this context captures the idea of a formal rescheduling of a company's debt book.  GHU emphasises the necessity for formality.</p>

As is explained in Shutter, <span style="font-style:italic">A Practitioner’s Guide to Syndicated Lending</span>, pp.314-316, the interests of the creditor and borrower are different in respect of this type of provision. The creditor is concerned to safeguard its position prior to the formal commencement of insolvency proceedings.  The borrower’s concern is not to agree a clause which imposes impractical restrictions on its ability to conduct business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A borrower in the business context may have constant dealings with respect to its indebtedness, postponing it, renegotiating it, refinancing it, and so on.  For this reason, I accept GHU’s proposition that the term “rescheduling” implies a degree of formality.  Adopting the approach of the IMF in its <span style="font-style:italic">External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users</span>, “rescheduling” refers to the formal deferment of debt-service payments and the application of new and extended maturities to the deferred amount.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the reference to formality may be of limited assistance to GHU in this case.  This is because sub-clause 21.6(d) of the BBVA Credit Agreement provides that an event of default occurs if the company <span style="font-style:italic">begins</span> negotiations with <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> creditor for the rescheduling of any of its indebtedness.  It is not limited to the commencement of negotiations with creditors generally with a view to formally rescheduling the company’s whole debt book.  The primary protection to the borrower against the clause being given an unreasonably wide ambit is to be found in the fact that beginning negotiations for rescheduling will only constitute an event of default if it happens “by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, part of that matrix concerns the nature of the Urvasco group’s business.  At the end of 2007, it owed about €2.3 billion to over forty banks, mostly Spanish banks.  The business, even in a benign economic climate, required constant negotiations with financial institutions.  Such negotiations would not, in my view, constitute an event of default, whether or not resulting in a formal agreement.  Carey (as lender) was in any case well aware of the group’s position in this respect in general terms.  Carey’s case, it seems to me, and the case I have to decide, is whether negotiations with particular creditors for the rescheduling of any of its indebtedness occurred, not in the ordinary course of its business, but by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey’s case is that in the first part of 2008, the economic situation in which the Urvasco group found itself deteriorated sharply, and that such negotiations did take place, well before the breach admitted by GHU when formal negotiations opened with its banking creditors in September to achieve a global settlement that would save the group.  Carey relies on negotiations with three banks (each of them <span style="font-style:italic">cajas</span>) to make good its case as follows.  </p>

Indeed, there was no debt rescheduling: all that happened was that a facility matured and the terms of a new facility were negotiated and entered into.

It argues that the directors were planning ahead, because they knew that there were problems, and that they decided to take pre-emptive action, which it says is not at all unusual in the context of a restructuring.  As it was put, “If one knows one is going to go to the banks and invite them to come to the table, it makes little sense to be paying individual banks piecemeal in advance of that process”.</p>

On the evidence, such agreements clearly were reached, and I infer that this was to avoid the debts becoming <span style="font-style:italic">en mora</span> in circumstances in which GU was having difficulties in repaying them.  Whilst it is correct that the antecedent negotiations were not negotiations for a wholesale restructuring of GU’s debt, clause 21.6(d) applies to negotiations with <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> creditor.  In the case of Unicaja at least, there is clear evidence that these negotiations resulted in a formal agreement deferring GU’s liabilities, insofar as this is necessary for the sub-clause to apply.  It follows that an event of default occurred as regards the negotiations with Unicaja, and in my view probably with the other two banks as well.  I am further satisfied that Carey has established an event of default in this respect as at 6 June 2008.  </p>

These drawdowns therefore pre-date the 21 December 2007 Loan Agreement with Carey.  I accept the evidence of Mr Couto and Mr Esparza that BBVA knew that drawdowns under the BBVA Credit Agreement were being used for purposes other than the development.  In fact, the evidence goes beyond that, because a considerable part of the drawdown of 27 November 2007 (the date may have been 26 November 2007 but it makes no difference) was used to pay interest due on 30 June 2007 to BBVA.  I infer that this was at the bank’s insistence.  In any case, it plainly could not assert any breach in that regard.</p>

The letter was concerned with what Carey has called “financial defaults”.  As I have held, Carey has made that case good by reference to the rescheduling negotiations which caused an event of default under clause 21.6(d) of the BBVA Credit Agreement.  This was not a breach which was identified in the letter.  But as I have said, GHU did not contend in closing that notice of defaults had to be given in order for defaults to be relied on, or that Carey is restricted to reliance on what was set out in the letter of 9 June 2008.  Whether a creditor could usually adopt such a position is beside the point.

However, as a statement of fact, much of the trial was taken up with an examination of the course of the building works, sometimes in considerable detail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The list of development defaults relied upon by Carey extends to ten categories.  (It claims that the evidence has disclosed that there are more.)  There are, it asserts, two main themes running through most of the defaults: (a) the failure by Urvasco Ltd to pay the contractors and professionals working on the development and (b) problems with progress on the development.  These failures it is said led to breaches in their own right. They also led to a series of failures by GHU to procure that Urvasco Ltd or IDOM provided accurate and complete information about the development to Carey or G&amp;T.  They are therefore, Carey says, at the heart of the “development defaults”.</p>

But this, it says, is GHU’s choice.  In my view, it is rather a consequence of the number of points relied on by Carey.  Where it has established a breach under a particular head, I have sought to apply a proportionate approach, and have not necessarily examined in the same detail all the other breaches asserted under that head.</p>

In summary, its case is that in the months before 6 June 2008, the development was beset with problems—defects, lack of progress, delays, disputes with trade contractors, suspensions of work, and failures to pay contractors and professionals.  Further, it is submitted that Carey (or its monitoring surveyors) ought to have been told of these problems, but it was not.  Consistently during the trial he described the development as being in “disarray”.</p>

Not too much should be made of such a high level description, however, because the question I have to decide is whether Carey can prove a breach of contract.  I give relatively little weight to some of the causes cited by Carey.  There was no inherent reason why the “construction management” methodology (by which Urvasco Ltd entered into contracts with contractors rather than having a contract with a single contractor which subcontracted) should not have worked.  It did, I accept, add a degree of complexity, but it had the practical advantage that some of the contractors were Spanish and the group was used to working with them.</p>

He said that in addition to this amount, because they had <span style="font-style:italic">forzado</span> the certification, a further €4m would need to be paid within 3 months.  GHU responds that if Carey had paid the April tranche of £2,258,784.70 (€3,226,835.29) on 6 June 2008, then combined with the sum of €4.456m actually paid by GHU to Urvasco Ltd in June 2008, there would have been little if any remaining arrears to contractors.  However this assumes that €4.456m would still have been made available by GHU had Carey advanced the April tranche, an assumption which in view of the history is far from self evident.</p>

First, its case is that a breach of the obligation in paragraph 1.1 of Schedule 2, Part 2, could only occur after the Long Stop Date had passed. This, it submits, is clear from the use of the future perfect tense: “The Seller [i.e. GHU] will procure that the Company [i.e. Urvasco Ltd] uses reasonable endeavours to procure that the Development is carried out so that the Date of Practical Completion <span style="text-decoration:underline">shall have occurred</span> by the Long Stop Date ...” (underlining added).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not think that Carey dealt with this in its written closings, though the point was articulated by GHU in opening.  In oral closings, Carey submitted that the only, or real, point of such a clause is so that, before one reaches the Long Stop Date, the counterparty and the party to each of the building contracts are carrying out their obligations.  There was, it was submitted, a clear relationship between this clause, and clause 1.3(c), which placed an obligation on GHU to procure that Urvasco Ltd promptly informed the monitoring surveyors upon becoming aware of any breach or alleged breach under any Development Document.  The two provisions, it was submitted, fit together, because there was an obligation, first, to tell Carey what was going on, and then the obligation to procure that the building contracts were being fulfilled by the counterparties.  To suggest that this obligation would only arise after the date of practical completion was closing the stable door after the horse had bolted, because the whole point was that Carey wanted to know before things were too late. This provision was needed before the Long Stop Date to protect Carey’s position.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with this argument is that there are other provisions of the contract which provide protection to Carey prior to the Long Stop Date.  The language used in these provisions (clause 4.4(b), clause 4.4(c) and clause 4.5(b)) make it clear that a breach may occur before the Long Stop Date has been reached.  In contrast, GHU says, it is clear from the language in paragraph 1.1 that a breach of that paragraph may only occur once the Long Stop Date has passed.</p>

Unlike some commercial negotiations, this was a negotiation between principals, who were well aware of what they were doing.  It is particularly important, therefore, to have regard to the language which the parties agreed, which reflects the give and take.  As a matter of interpretation applying ordinary principles (which are not in dispute), I agree with GHU that a breach of this particular obligation may only occur after the Long Stop Date has passed.  This (in my view) follows straightforwardly from the use of the words “shall have occurred”.   That puts the relevant event in the past, not the future.  I further agree with GHU that Carey’s interpretation to the contrary is productive of uncertainty.  It follows that Carey has not established the first default that it relies upon.  </p>

Carey attaches particular importance to the word “status” in paragraph 1.3(a).  It asserts that compliance by Urvasco Ltd with its contractual obligations was an integral part of the status of the Development, and that Urvasco Ltd’s failure to include in the Employer’s Agent Reports information about breaches of Development Documents (i.e. alleged breaches of the Building Contracts and Professional Appointment through non- or late payment) was a breach by GHU of its obligations under paragraph 1.3(a).</p>

Carey says that Schedule 3 provides a detailed set of development controls which GHU was obliged to procure that Urvasco Ltd complied with between the date of the agreement and completion.  It also contains the provisions requiring GHU to procure Urvasco Ltd to complete the Development by the Long Stop Date and provides the detailed mechanism by which Carey, as lender, was to be provided with extensive information about the status and progress of the Development in order that it could monitor the Development.  Without this information Carey would potentially be lending money into a black hole.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth default alleged by Carey concerns paragraph 1.3(c)(i) which provides that GHU had to procure that Urvasco Ltd promptly informed the Monitoring Surveyor (G&amp;T) upon becoming aware of any breach or alleged breach under any Development Document.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The uncommercial nature of this interpretation becomes apparent when one appreciates that there were over a hundred construction packages in the project, each of which could give rise to breaches or alleged breaches, on top of which were the contracts with professionals.  I agree with GHU that on its proper interpretation, paragraph 1.3(c)(i) required Urvasco Ltd to identify breaches of Development Documents which were material, alternatively that such a qualification should be implied.  As it says, it would be bizarre if the obligation to inform extended to any breach no matter how immaterial, nor would G&amp;T have been interested in such breaches. The purpose of the obligation in paragraph 1(c)(i) was to assist it as Monitoring Surveyor in monitoring the Development and in producing the Project Certificates.</p>

It points out that paragraph 1.3(c)(i) is conditioned on GHU “becoming aware of” a breach of a Development Document.  This shows, it submits, that the sub-paragraph is intended to cover breaches or alleged breaches by contractors and professionals, not breaches or alleged breaches by Urvasco Ltd itself.  This is another example, it says, of Carey attempting to “shoehorn” its allegations into a contractual framework not intended to address such allegations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In agreement with GHU, this in my view is the right interpretation of the provision.  Apart from being consonant with the language used, it fits with the overall structure of paragraph 1.3(c) of Schedule 3 of the SPA.  Breaches by Urvasco Ltd itself are covered by the following sub-paragraph 1.3(c)(ii), which deals with the situation in which there is “any claim or demand against the Company…”.  On the basis that paragraph 1.3(c)(i) applies to breaches by contractors and professionals, I consider that it does not include non-payment of contractors by Urvasco Ltd in breach of contract.  This is sufficient to find that Carey has not established the fourth default which it alleges under this heading, which in any case I consider is subject to a materiality threshold.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That leaves only the second default.  To make it good, Carey has to show that there was a failure by Urvasco Ltd to pay contractors, and that on 6 June 2008 this falsified the representation by GHU and Urvasco Ltd that there was no outstanding breach of any term of any Development Document in any material respect (there being an admitted materiality threshold).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GHU does not deny that it failed to pay contractors, which would obviously be unsustainable on the evidence.  It says that the slow payment of builders and professionals was unattractive and unfortunate, but is common in the industry.  As to the alleged breaches themselves, it says that Carey accepts that in most cases there were no written agreed terms as to payment.  Carey’s general approach has been to assume that a failure to pay an invoice on the date stated on the invoice itself evidences a breach of the relevant contract by Urvasco Ltd.  However, the payment date unilaterally stated by a contractor in an invoice may or may not represent the agreed date for payment.  GHU stands by its pleaded case that failure to pay an invoice in accordance with the time specified in the invoice is not evidence of a breach of contract.  Urvasco Ltd does not admit breach of any Building Contracts and/or Professional Appointments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey says that this is an unrealistic approach and should be rejected.  It refers to the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, by which a party to a construction contract is entitled to payment by instalments, stage payments or other periodic payments for any work under the contract unless the duration of the work was to be less than 45 days, or estimated to be less than 45 days.  There is a dispute between the parties as to the precise legal effect of the Act, but in general terms it is clear that the Act militates against non-payment of contractors, and was to that extent, a change of culture in the UK construction industry.</p>

There is a good deal of evidence from which I am entitled to, and do infer, that as at 6 June 2008, Urvasco Ltd was in breach of a significant number of Development Documents by failing to make payment under them when due.  For reasons already given, I do not accept GHU’s suggestion that this can be laid at Carey’s door by reason of “its failure to make any advance for the January works”.  It follows (subject to the materiality threshold) that the representation made in clause 8(e) of the Loan Agreement was falsified on this date.  </p>

Mr Saulsbury’s ‘baseline’ analysis (he is GHU’s expert witness in programming matters) takes into account all critical delays, including the effect of all suspensions of work, which had occurred as at 6 June 2008.  Taking all those matters into account, as at 6 June 2008 critical delay was between 4 and 11.6 weeks (depending on the extent to which resequencing is taken into account).  This meant that there remained a period of between 7.5 and 15 weeks of float (i.e. spare time) in the programme for the outstanding works (less 2 weeks if there was to be a Christmas stoppage).  The programme for the follow-on activities after 6 June 2008 was therefore able to accommodate further critical delays of between 7.5 and 15 weeks before Practical Completion of the Development would have been delayed beyond the Long Stop Date.

At 6 June 2008, Urvasco Ltd was in breach of a very significant number of Development Documents with both contractors and professionals and in very substantial amounts.  These breaches were material to its ability to complete the Development by the Long Stop Date not least because, only a few months earlier, a very substantial delay had occurred because of a failure to pay a minor sum (£52,000) to the crane operator.  GHU cannot realistically say (Carey submits) that the failure to pay millions of pounds to dozens of professionals and contractors was immaterial to Urvasco Ltd’s ability to complete.  It was highly relevant to that issue and therefore the falsity of the representation was highly material.</p>

Serious enough in themselves (particularly as regards A&amp;T), they were part of a pattern that had continued since the project began, which had led to Mr Fernandez himself envisaging suspension in October 2007, and contractors walking off the site in March 2008.

I am satisfied that it has made this point good.

Carey’s case is that by reason of this, and what it says are other deficiencies in the reports provided by IDOM, the representation in the Loan Agreement that all information supplied by it or on its behalf was true and accurate in all material respects as at 6 June 2008 was falsified.</p>

Before coming to them, it is helpful to give them context.  As explained by Carey (and I do not think this is in dispute) in broad terms the contractual scheme was as follows.  Contractors would apply for payment, IDOM would consider the applications, and certify what it considered was due to the contractors.  These amounts would then be certified by IDOM in its “Employer’s Agent Report” sent to Carey’s Monitoring Surveyor, Gardiner &amp; Theobald, as having been incurred in the calendar month immediately preceding the issue of the report.  G&amp;T would then issue its Project Certificate, which Carey was supposed to pay.  The contractual provisions that give effect to this scheme are, therefore, important ones, because they condition what Carey was being asked to pay over the lifetime of the loan.</p>

Its case ultimately focused on the proposition that IDOM was obliged to, but did not, provide certificates that reflected actual costs incurred or the invoices or certificates it had issued.  Instead estimates were used in some cases.  IDOM says the estimates were reasonable.  Carey says they were not, as evidenced by the fact that a number of the contractors had to be valued at £0 in the following month or months when G&amp;T asked searching questions.  I have taken this from Carey’s “Guide to the Construction Aspects of the Case”, and shorn of exaggeration, this is what the <span style="font-style:italic">forzado</span> issue comes to.</p>

These go to issues such as the estimated completion date, the budget, extensions of time and the March 2008 suspensions.  GHU says that these complaints misrepresent the particular circumstances of the development, and the role of G&amp;T, which could have asked for further information had they wanted it.</p>

Carey responds that the “estimate” was considerably above the value of the work applied for by the client.  A number of examples from IDOM’s report in respect of the April 2008 works are relied on.</p>

It is not in dispute that this was in excess of the amounts that IDOM had certified to AMSA.  Mr Fernandez explained that he had included material that AMSA had delivered to site.  However, that explanation is difficult to accept, since AMSA was not at the time claiming payment for it.  I should add that GHU says correctly that in certificates issued after 6 June 2008 there was an adjustment, so that in that sense “Carey was not out of pocket”.  But by that time, Carey had ceased to lend, and the question of what had been certified was a sensitive one for Mr Fernandez, as I shall describe.</p>

Mr Fernandez accepts this, but says that by the time of the May Project Certificate, a nil valuation was given in respect of Bellapart’s works, so that the figure to date was less than the amounts certified to Bellapart.  GHU says that taking a “rolling account” analysis, over time Carey was never out of pocket.  Factually, this is correct but the same point I made in regard to AMSA applies.</p>

Pursuant to Schedule 3, paragraph 1.4 of the SPA, each Employer’s Agent Report (“EAR”) was to include details of Development Costs which had been incurred in the month preceding the issue of the EAR. (This is common ground.)  The reference to the certifications being <span style="font-style:italic">forzado</span> arose, GHU says, because (as Mr Fernandez says) at the point of preparing the EARs it was not always possible to determine precisely the value of a contractor’s work.  Applications for payment might not have been received, and accordingly where necessary IDOM would estimate the value of the works based on its view of the work which had been undertaken.  Where there was a range of reasonable estimated costs, GHU says that IDOM tended to use the figures at the higher end of the range.  Mr Fernandez used the word <span style="font-style:italic">forzado</span> to reflect the fact that, as a consequence, there would probably be a gap in the sense of the certifications being above the amounts subsequently invoiced.  However, the estimates were always within what IDOM considered reasonable for the works that were being carried out.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This approach, GHU submits, was not unreasonable or inappropriate given that it was necessary to use estimates, and it would not cause any prejudice to Carey in circumstances where the total amount of the Subsequent Tranches available under the Loan Agreement (£40 million) was going to be drawn down.  Moreover, any over-payments made in respect of a particular contractor would be reversed when a final account was agreed with that contractor.  However, one consequence was that when it transpired in a later month that there had been over estimates of the value of work done in earlier months it would then be necessary to include reduced or nil valuations for that contractor’s works in that later month.</p>

It is plain from this email that because the certification for April was forced, for the next month he was going to certify zero in respect of some of the contractors.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, there can be no question in my view of conducting the certification procedure in a way that allowed for, as Carey put it, everything coming out in the wash.  It had to be done by reference to the month in question.  The SPA provided in clauses 1.3(a) and 1.4(a) (set out above) that the Employer’s Agent Report which IDOM had to prepare had to include details of such Development Costs which Urvasco Ltd had incurred in the month in question.  In some respects at least, the April certification did not comply with this requirement.  I infer that this was a consequence of Mr Fernandez’s need to prioritise payments to contractors in view of the endemic shortage of funding with which he was faced.</p>

The April certification was materially inaccurate to such an extent that it had to be remedied by an artificially low certification the following month.  I am satisfied that Carey has proved the default alleged under this heading.  Of the defaults proved by Carey, this in my view was the most central, because it goes directly to the advance due on 6 June 2008, which is at the heart of the case. </p>

For reasons given by GHU in its closing submissions, I do not think that Carey’s case was particularly persuasive in these respects. The Employer’s Agent Report made it clear that the completion date was under review.  Had G&amp;T (as monitoring surveyors) been dissatisfied as to the budgetary information or LTPs, this could have been raised at the time.  No extensions of time had in fact been granted to contractors, so that issue did not arise either.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The March suspension falls into a different class in my view. This was plainly something which had to be made known to G&amp;T.  However, G&amp;T paid its monthly site visit on 14 April 2008, and it is clear that the effects of the March suspension were obvious.  G&amp;T reported appropriately to Carey.  Their Monitoring Report No. 2 said that “the last site walkabout revealed lack of discernible progress on the 9th and 10th Floors, from both the concrete and steel structure point of view”.  The Report said, “Progress on concrete and structural steel has slowed and impacts the rest of the job as shown by a net movement of 3% from the previous month to the current month”.  The Report said, “The overall progress on concrete on the 9th and 10th floors on both the hotel and apartments side is very slow and almost stagnant ...”.  Given what he reported, it would be surprising if the G&amp;T surveyor had not asked about the cause when he was on site.</p>

The fact that completion was unlikely to take place by the LSD reflected the fact that Urvasco had failed to comply with its obligations under the Building Contracts and Professional Appointments to pay the contractors and professionals.  In oral submissions, Carey confirmed that failure to pay contractors was the only issue under this obligation.

The relevant part of clause 6.17 provided that, “In the event of delay on the part of the Purchaser in advancing any Tranche, the Long Stop Date shall be extended by an equivalent period”.  There were delays, GHU says, and the effect was to extend the Long Stop Date to 14 May 2009.</p>

The fact that such a point should be taken at all (given that only a few days are involved) goes to show that its Long Stop Date case is tight on the facts.

The first, which I think was the one addressed by Carey in oral submissions, is whether Practical Completion would have been, or would be likely to have been, delayed beyond the Long Stop Date as at 6 June 2008.  At trial, this factual question has been addressed by reference to the evidence, and the expert evidence of the programming experts in response to the series of questions that were put to them (this was the first and main question).</p>

To make good its case as to default, Carey must prove that GHU had become aware by 6 June 2008 that Practical Completion would, or would be likely to be, delayed beyond the Long Stop Date.  The duty to notify Carey can only apply if GHU had that awareness as at 6 June 2008.  I do not think that this analysis is in dispute.</p>

There is no evidence in the contemporary documents that Mr Fernandez or Mr Utrilla (IDOM’s programmer) thought that completion by the Long Stop Date would not be achieved at this time.  The projected timescale for its completion was monitored by IDOM using short-term plans (“STPs”) which were six week programmes produced every fortnight.</p>

On 23 April 2008 LTP revision 17 was produced in draft (with a target date for the completion of the works of January 2009).  On 30 April 2008, LTP revision 18 was produced in draft showing a target date for the completion of the works of 20 March 2009.  As I have explained in the narrative section of this judgment, G&amp;T knew that the target date had changed, and had reported it to Carey.  The upshot was, as Carey says, that while IDOM’s programming up until March 2008 suggested that the works would be completed by Christmas of that year leaving a “buffer” or “float” of some four months before the LSD, by the start of May of 2008 three of the four months had gone.</p>

However, as he explained, this was his conservative view, and under pressure from both Mr Couto and Mr Losada, he proposed that the earliest date that should be agreed for practical completion was April 2009.  That was in fact the date agreed.  This was months before the time at which the issue has to be decided, and I consider it to be of limited assistance. </p>

Attached to a response document on behalf of Urvasco Ltd dated 12 December 2008, there was a programme that showed a 10 month period to carry out the works on the west core and complete the follow-on works for the Development.  This would have taken completion well beyond the Long Stop Date.</p>

I agree with GHU that it is unfair of Carey to criticise Mr Utrilla in this respect.  In cross-examination, he explained that after he had left the development and returned to work in Spain, Mr Zadeh (who did not have the necessary Microsoft Project software) asked him to transcribe information provided by Mr Zadeh.  Mr Utrilla disagreed with the suggestion that he “produced” the adjudication programmes—his point was that he was merely acting as a Microsoft Project transcriber for Mr Zadeh.  I accept his evidence in this regard.  In any case, I am satisfied that this programme does not reflect Mr Utrilla’s thinking as at 6 June 2008. </p>

G&amp;T had visited the site on 16 June 2008, at which time Carey had withheld its 6 June 2008 advance.

In cross-examination, Mr Chamberlain accepted that Mr Saulsbury’s 11.6 weeks and his 14.1 weeks included the effect of the suspension in March 2008.  Even on the basis of Mr Chamberlain’s higher figure of 14.1 weeks, therefore, there was a remaining period of float of 6 weeks as at 2 June 2008 (i.e. his float of 20 weeks less his maximum figure for delay of 14.1 weeks).

It follows that Practical Completion would not have been reached for that reason alone. However, when non-payment was put to him in cross examination, Mr Saulsbury said that he had assumed for the purposes of his report that contractors would be paid as and when moneys were due, otherwise, as he put it, the work would not go on.  He was clearly right to make that assumption in giving his evidence, and for the purposes of discussing this issue, I have to assume the same.</p>

There would, I find, have been sufficient time to manufacture the dormer windows.  I accept that Carey is right to say that for GHU to be correct on the mansard roof issue, all assumptions must be made in its favour and there had to be no other problems which delayed the works.  I also accept that the package would need to be properly managed, but do not accept Carey’s submission that IDOM were unable properly to manage the works.  On these assumptions, including timely payment (which as I have said is the premise upon which this part of the analysis must proceed) I accept Mr Saulsbury’s evidence that it could have been done by the LSD (though with little time to spare).  </p>

Mr Utrilla, Mr Inigo Aguirre (IDOM’s mechanical engineer) and Ms Maria Azpiroz (IDOM’s project designer) were familiar with the site, and I accept their evidence that overlap could have taken place.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts disagreed as to whether delays to other packages are relevant in assessing whether the development would be completed by the Long Stop date. (These were blockwork (Amsa), remedial concrete works (including the basement structure and sprinkler room not being watertight, the lift shafts and snagging works – Knight Build), stoneworks (Astec), façade cladding and glazed elements (Bellapart), external windows to the Marconi building (Carpinteria Couto), fire proofing (Pyrotherm), plasterboard setting out and the interior fit out (B&amp;B, DMP), scaffolding (H&amp;B), and cranes (Select)).  Whilst this was referred to briefly in Carey’s written closings, the court being invited to “peruse” the Chamberlain reports, I think that GHU was right to say that raising these miscellaneous issues does not amount to an analysed case on delay.</p>

Carey’s case is that IDOM was incompetent and incapable of managing the development, and would have been incapable of re-sequencing or accelerating the works.  Having seen numerous IDOM employees cross-examined, I reject that assertion.  In my view, IDOM was perfectly capable of managing this development <span style="font-style:italic">provided</span> it was properly funded.  For reasons I have already explained, this aspect of the case has to assume that the development could have been funded to completion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, Carey’s submissions tended not to differentiate between events before, and after, 6 June 2008.  I do not consider that events afterwards are a safe basis upon which to reach conclusions on this aspect of the case.  Apart from the funding implications, Carey’s sudden refusal to make further advances must have seriously undermined the morale of the IDOM employees responsible for managing the development.  It is difficult to say, for example, whether this slowed the engagement of Coffey to replace Knight Build in respect of work on the vaults.</p>

For the Long Stop Date to have been achieved, I am satisfied that there was little or no room for anything further going wrong.  On the other hand, Mr Farmiloe, who was Carey’s own monitoring surveyor, accepted in his evidence that the Long Stop Date was not impacted by the known delay as at June 2008.  Carey itself was telling the banks at this time that its information was that the work would be finished by the Long Stop Date.  I have set out the facts above.</p>

On 28 March 2008, GU obtained two short term €10m loans from Banco Vasconia secured against the offer made by RWE for Urvasco Energia and against personal guarantees from among others Mr Couto.  €1.9m of these funds was transferred to Urvasco Ltd so that it could make outstanding payments due to its contractors and suppliers.  Along with the €2.3m transferred by GHU a few days later, the full amount of the €4.1m was transferred to Urvasco Ltd either before or shortly after its advance by Carey.  When one bears in mind my finding that the advance was due on 27 March 2008 but was paid late by Carey on 2 April 2008, it is apparent that this point is hopeless.</p>

GHU transferred a total of €3,008,000 to Urvasco Ltd, and as the figures in paragraph 17 of Mr Esparza’s first witness statement show, these were the only transfers to Urvasco Ltd in May 2008.  Further, the only transfers made in <span style="font-style:italic">April</span> were the €2.3m I referred to in the last paragraph.

Such a restriction would also be uncommercial, because if before payment of a Subsequent Tranche fell due from Carey, there was an urgent need for payments to be made on the development and GHU advanced monies to Urvasco Ltd to enable it to make those payments, it would be absurd if when GHU received the Subsequent Tranche it was immediately obliged to hand over the entire sum to Urvasco Ltd and could not make a deduction from the amount which it had already advanced.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey submits that the purpose of clause 8.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement is to ensure that an amount equal to the monies Carey advanced to GHU was then transferred on to Urvasco Ltd.  That way Urvasco Ltd would receive (and Carey would know that it had received) sufficient funds to pay the amounts certified as having been carried out on the development and which made up the relevant Subsequent Tranche. If GHU was entitled to rely on earlier or later transfers, Carey would not have the security that Urvasco Ltd had received the funds necessary to pay the costs certified on a timely basis.  Instead, Urvasco Ltd would be likely to be left short of funds to pay the relevant certification as the historic transfers would be likely to have been used to pay other, earlier, costs and future transfers may not even have yet been made.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, as a matter of construction, paragraph 8.2 is referring to “Subsequent Tranches” individually, rather than as a whole.  The obligation placed on GHU to advance an amount equal to a Subsequent Tranche to Urvasco Ltd has (in my view) to be fulfilled at the time.  On the other hand, the word “immediately” is not used in the sub-paragraph, and I see no need to imply it.  The facts relating to the advance made on 2 April 2008 show that that would lead to an inflexible result that the parties cannot have intended.  Equally, the parties cannot have intended (for example) to allow GHU to use advances for non-development purposes, so long as by the time of the last advance, a sum equal to the totality had been paid over.  As Carey says, this would leave it exposed (among other things) to the risk of intervening insolvency.  I find therefore, either as a matter of interpretation, or as a matter of implication, that each Subsequent Tranche advanced by Carey to GHU had to be transferred by GHU to Urvasco Ltd at the time, but with a degree of flexibility to allow for circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It may seem odd to deal with GHU’s damages claim at the end of this judgment since GHU is the claimant, at least in the proceedings first brought.  However, this was how GHU itself dealt with its damages claim in its written opening (it said very little about it in oral opening).  The reason, as I have explained elsewhere in this judgment, is that the principal issue at trial has been whether Carey could prove that GHU was in default under the Loan Agreement as at 6 June 2008.  Most of the evidence went to that issue.  Since I have found in Carey’s favour on that issue, it follows that GHU’s claim fails.  Since it was argued, I set out my views below in relation to the decisive issues which would have arisen for decision had I been in GHU’s favour on the default question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In summary, GHU’s case is that but for Carey’s breaches of the Loan Agreement, the development would have proceeded to completion.  There are two elements to its claim for loss and damage.  The first is the loss of the profit which it says would otherwise have arisen from the operation of the hotel.  The second is the loss which it says arises from the early termination of the construction of the development caused, it says, by Carey’s breach in failing to make the advances due.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even had I been in favour of GHU on liability, it is to be noted that there were a number of significant difficulties in the way of its damages claim.  These stem from the fact that, given the economics of the situation, and the terms of the deal with Carey, had Carey continued to fund the project GHU would nevertheless have ended at completion facing a large loss.</p>

I am satisfied that the hotel has the potential to be successful, even iconic.  It is solely the result of the size of the rental payments due to Carey under the December 2007 agreements.  The loss of profits claim was effectively a notional capitalisation of income after the initial period of seven years’ operation, and the development loss was the loss GHU said it incurred over and above the loss which it accepts which it would have suffered anyway.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further obstacle in the way of the claim is that GHU admits a default under the Loan Agreement.  This is the default which happened when GU began negotiations for the rescheduling of its indebtedness, which it admits doing at the end of September 2008 (in fact I have found that negotiations with individual creditors began much earlier).  GHU has to show, therefore, that Carey would not have pulled out at that stage anyway, which for reasons I give below, it has not succeeded in doing.</p>

A key issue therefore is whether GHU had the money required to finish the building works and thereafter to repay BBVA, which was a condition precedent to Completion.  This raises issues as to costs to completion, and GHU’s ability to find the money needed.  </p>

Among the complications is comparing like with like.  As Carey puts it, in order to ensure that the figures are comparable, there are three main elements which make up the complete costs of the development: (a) the costs of construction (split between contractors and consultants); (b) the costs of purchasing the land and other fees associated with it (such as amounts due to Westminster Council pursuant to the s.106 agreement); and (c) financing costs, essentially interest due under the loans taken out for the development.  It was the first and last of these three elements which went up over time.  Some of the budgets omit one or more of these items.  However, during the trial the focus was firmly on the first.  A further complication was mentioned earlier in this judgment, namely that some of the costs were incurred (or were anticipated to be incurred) in pounds, and some in euros, and there is the perennial problem of identifying an exchange rate.</p>

GHU’s primary position is that the April 2008 Budget is an adequate and reasonable basis for assessing both GHU’s ability to fund the development works to completion and for assessing the quantum of GHU’s claim for damages.  It invites the court to accept the April 2008 Budget as reflecting the total costs of the development from which the costs to complete can be calculated.  Alternatively, GHU invites the court to adopt Mr Brooker’s figures in relation to the total estimated out-turn cost of the development.  Although Mr Brooker addresses the question of whether the April 2008 Budget was reasonable, for comparative purposes, he does this by producing his own estimates of the various construction and consultant work packages which make up the April 2008 Budget, and, in that way, carries out an exercise equivalent to that carried out by Mr Boultwood.</p>

It is true, as GHU points out, that the document is a draft, but the covering email says that it is the “budget updated to June 2008”, and the evidence suggests that IDOM treated budgets as draft until approval by GHU.

The budget contains a wide range of different columns dealing with different aspects of the work.   The court can, Carey submits, legitimately ask which of the columns was altered to include a figure which was a “worst case” and what was the nature of the alteration.</p>

In the opinion of GHU’s quantity surveying expert, Mr Brooker, this was a reasonable budget, and the assessments of IDOM contained in it are reasonable, an opinion which he says is unaffected by the adjustments he has made in his own figures, which add some £2m (see the summary above).  GHU says that although that document was produced in January 2010, it was produced from information that Mr Fernandez had collated in April 2008 from the UST’s electronic records relating to the estimates of the construction costs of the project as at April 2008. The April 2008 Budget shows a total construction budget, expressed in sterling, of £91,213,733.  Although that was nearly £11 million higher than the September 2007 target budget, GHU says that a significant proportion of that increase related to exchange rate fluctuation.</p>

Furthermore, even if Mr Iraculis was right to say that the figures were at the top end of the range of what the potential costs might be to complete the project, there is no reason, in my view, not to accept them as realistic.  In this regard, it is relevant to take into account GHU’s previous disinclination to accept realistic budgets, and the consequent production of budgets that were too low.

In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal with the evidence on a package by package basis, and it would be disproportionate to do so.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Brooker and Mr Boultwood did reach varying conclusions as to individual packages, but the greatest point of difference between them is that, in the absence of agreed prices, Mr Boultwood has generally applied a contingency of 20%, whereas Mr Brooker has generally applied 5%, though sometimes 3%.  The disagreement particularly affects the packages where there was no contract price agreed between Urvasco Ltd and a contractor for the package.  However, GHU says, and I do not understand this to be in dispute, that for the most part, both experts use the same pre-contingency base cost information.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Brooker’s most common approach, where there is no agreed contract price in relation to a specific package, is to take the notional contract price from a document produced by IDOM called the March 2008 Procurement Commentary and add a contingency of 5%.  Mr Boultwood’s most common approach in these circumstances is to take the figure from IDOM's June 2008 Cost Report (see above) and add a contingency of 20%.  However, the base cost information in both the March 2008 Procurement Commentary and the June 2008 Cost Report, GHU says, is largely the same.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey’s answer is that such reduction depends on the continual letting of packages so that the risk associated with buying the packages falls.  If the packages are not being let, then the risk remains.  It also assumes that the ongoing packages are being carried out in line with the budgeted costs.  If they are not, then the contingency does not fall.  In this instance, it says, risks were becoming realities, as occurs on badly run projects.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey maintains that Mr Boultwood’s application of a higher contingency reflects the lack of certainty in the base contract cost for those packages where procurement of the contractor to carry out the work was underway (described by the experts as category 2), and those in respect of which a contractor had not been procured (described by the experts as category 3), along with the other substantial body of evidence that the development was in disarray, and that the packages actually in progress were experiencing very substantial delay and disruption, variations and additions.  Mr Brooker did not, Carey says, consider the actual conditions on site because he was not provided with the relevant documentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GHU’s response is that although it is true that in some instances Mr Brooker and Mr Boultwood had access to only limited costs information for the purposes of their reports, particularly in relation to packages in respect of which a contractor had not been procured, it would not follow that the base cost information is unreliable.  IDOM was in the best position to estimate and monitor the base cost information and there is no reason to suggest that these figures should be treated as inaccurate or that they justify such a high additional contingency figure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, GHU points out that Mr Brooker’s view on contingency is consistent with the views of other professionals associated with the development.  This includes the December 2007 Due Diligence Report which G&amp;T produced for Carey on the development.  G&amp;T concluded that, based on their benchmarking exercise, the development budget fell within an “acceptable range”, and that a level of contingency at 5.5% would be “sufficient for a project of this size”.  I should add that G&amp;T’s approach to budgeting and contingency was criticised by Mr Boultwood (not very convincingly in my view).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Carey’s answer on this point is that G&amp;T and other consultants were commenting at the stage of the development when the works being carried out were effectively those of Knight Build and Rowen.  They did not know of the actual and nascent problems on the site.  Further, Carey says, the track record on the site so far as increase in the budget was concerned, even in the period September 2007 - April 2008, was that the contingency applied in late 2007 proved to be insufficient<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion on this point is as follows.  I accept Mr Brooker’s general point that the application by Mr Boultwood of a prospective 20% contingency is an unconventional and unusual approach for a quantity surveyor.  On the other hand, this contingency particularly affects the packages in respect of which a contractor had not been procured.  This is what the experts described as category 3. Given the problems which the site was experiencing in 2008 (and indeed earlier), I think it is reasonable to apply a contingency higher than 5% to category 3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Understandably, neither party attempted calculations which would reflect an uplift in Mr Brooker’s contingency for category 3, though not to the extent contemplated by Mr Boultwood.  On the whole, Mr Boultwood’s numbers appear to me to be out of step with the rest of the evidence, and too high by a considerable margin.  The conclusion that I draw from the expert evidence is that it supports the factual finding I have made, because an uplift in the contingency would push Mr Brooker’s figures towards those in IDOM’s June 2008 Budget.</p>

In its written opening submissions, it set out the amount which remained to be funded as at April 2008 and the sources of funding which left, it said, a gap of €19,303,319.96.  This would have been met, it says, by delaying payments to contractors, and by further funding provided by BBVA.

In fact, this is not far off the number given in Carey’s closing submissions, which state that “while the Court will not be able to put a precise figure on the gap because there is insufficient evidence from GHU to quantify certain costs, it is clear that the gap was in excess of €40 million”.

I have dealt with this in the factual narrative.  Mr Couto’s evidence was that at this meeting BBVA said words to the effect that it would fund the gap between the amount to be paid by Carey under the Loan Agreement, and the final sum to be paid by Carey on completion of the SPA. </p>

However, evidence of this kind produced at the last minute carried little or no weight.  As Carey put it, he was a cautious man who would have taken legal and financial advice before advancing any money.  He would also have been looking for security.  The same in my view applies to Mr Esparza.  Meaningful security could not have been given by GU or GHU because of their financial problems.</p>

By June 2008, I am satisfied that Carey had determined to get out of the deal.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept GHU’s point that by completion, there would have been, at least on the face of it, a strong commercial imperative on the group to find the funds that were required to repay BBVA.  It had been well capable in the past of juggling its finances to keep particular parts of the enterprise afloat, and these are points which support its case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, it is worth standing back to consider the financial effect of the transaction which GHU entered into with Carey.  Even on GHU’s basis of calculation, it accepts that had all gone according to plan, and Carey met its obligations in full, GHU would have incurred a deficit at completion of about €34m.  In my view, the root cause of the gap was that (as I have explained above) a substantial proportion of the total facility available under the Loan Agreement was advanced up front in December/January 2007, but only a small part of it went into the development, the remainder being applied to other indebtedness of the group. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That brings into relief the question of the profitability of the hotel.  It was not in dispute at trial that because of the rent under the leaseback arrangement, the hotel would have operated at a loss.  Accordingly, had this transaction gone to completion, GHU would have incurred a large loss on the development, whilst being committed under the leaseback arrangements to a loss-making hotel.  Effectively, and with the qualifications as to the figures which are dealt with above, this is common ground.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since finance could not be raised on the hotel at that point, the group would have had to find the sums required from its general resources.  This would have been very difficult at a time when it was being forced to reduce its massive debt overhang.  I accept that GHU has made strong arguments in favour of its position, but I prefer Carey’s case on this aspect of the matter, and conclude that GHU would not have been in a position to fund the gap, and was not in a position to complete, even if the project had got there.</p>

This applied to the first seven years after completion.  At the end of the period of seven years, Mr Couto says that GHU would have exercised its option under the Call Option Agreement to acquire the shares in LVA which in turn held the shares in Urvasco Ltd (which owned the hotel). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When asked on the first day of oral closings to confirm that the hotel would have been loss making, GHU did so. The following day, it said that in fact the true position was that hotel would have been loss making for the first two years, but for the following five years there would have been “a small excess of cash flow from operations over and above the rent payments”.  Carey responded (again in oral closing) saying that this depended on converting the euro rental to sterling at the exchange rate in the Loan Agreement, whereas sterling had weakened substantially since then.  Carey’s calculation was to the effect that at current rates, none of the seven years would have been profitable.  That I accept is the effect of the evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the period that extends beyond seven years, the position is clearly hard to forecast.  Nevertheless, I accept that the hotel would have become profitable once the rental obligation owed to Carey ceased.  The hotel has in fact (as explained above) now opened under different owners, albeit, I infer, after very considerable extra expenditure.  There was also an increase in the number of suites, which was presumably deemed appropriate for a hotel of this class.  This suggests that the hotel, as conceived by GHU, was potentially a money-making proposition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts agree that the valuation of the loss of profits from the operation of the hotel involves determining the future net cashflows which the operation of the hotel would have generated and discounting these back to present value using an appropriate discount rate.  Leaving aside the first seven loss-making years, GHU’s claim in this regard comprises the future cashflows earned directly by GHU from its operation of the hotel and by Urvasco Ltd after the exercise by GHU of its option to purchase the shares in LVA after seven years of operating the hotel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Carey points out, this would result in GHU owning a company which owned the company which owned the hotel.  It is by no means evident that discounting the cash flow represents recoverable loss as regards GHU, since its loss may properly be referable to the diminution in the value of its shareholding in the structure.  I shall assume this point in GHU’s favour. However, I would have rejected the claim based on Silken cash flows, because GHU held only 55.55 per cent of the shares in Silken.</p>

Further, Mr Smith’s evidence that the hotel would have been a high-end four star property (in cross-examination he said four to five star) does not fit with the facts.  The hotel was clearly positioned as a five star property, and the Norman Foster connection gives it extra cachet.  One only has to look at Carey’s own press release issued in January 2008 to see that a four star rating was completely unrealistic.</p>

He initially placed these in the third year of operation, but since he assumed that the hotel would open on 1 June 2009, the events (the Olympics among others) would fall in the fourth year of operation.</p>

Even if the building works had been practically completed by that date, I think this is very unlikely.  There would have been little chance to get staff in place in the run up to 30 April 2009.  Given GHU’s ambitions for the hotel, I have no doubt that the opening would have been closer to the date proposed by Mr Smith, namely the beginning of 2010.  But this does not make much difference to the figures.</p>

Mr Smith has applied the same adjustments to his operating cash flows (albeit for the shorter period of seven years and without the premium payment, as he says GHU would not have exercised its option to acquire LVA, owner of Urvasco Ltd, because the value of the cashflows he calculates is lower than the premium payable).</p>

However, I am not satisfied that such a decision would have been justified on business grounds, and I am sure that he would have strictly based it on business grounds.
