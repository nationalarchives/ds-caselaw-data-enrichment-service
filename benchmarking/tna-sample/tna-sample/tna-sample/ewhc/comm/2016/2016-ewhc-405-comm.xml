	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first claimant in this action, the Republic of Djibouti (to which I will refer as “the Republic”) is a small country in the Horn of Africa with a population of less than one million. It was formerly a French colony, known as the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, before gaining its independence in 1977. Its strategic importance in the region is that, at least since the hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea began in 1998, the Republic and specifically its port facilities have provided the only access to the sea for otherwise land-locked Ethiopia.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the last fifteen years, a new port and free zone complex has been built at Doraleh, to the south of Djibouti City, on what was previously waste land on which the local population eked out a precarious existence. In that period, the area has been transformed, with about half a billion U.S. dollars of investment in the complex, making it the leading port in the region with a new oil terminal and one of the largest container terminals in the region, capable of receiving the new generation of deeper draught container ships. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before this transformation, the old port facilities at Djibouti City were out of date and run down. The port was too shallow for modern container ships and there was no room for expansion. The existing oil storage tanks and piping, some of which had been constructed in the 1930s, leaked and posed a threat to the environment. The management of the port authority, the third claimant, to which I will refer as “PAID”, was inefficient and corrupt.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first stage of the development was the creation of Djibouti Dry Port SAZF (“DDP”) in two phases, the first a large container yard hub and warehouse facility outside the existing port, for the trade into and out of Ethiopia, and the second the development of office and warehouse space for companies to enjoy free zone status, modelled on the facilities at Jebel Ali in Dubai, owned and operated by Dubai Ports International, part of the DP World group of companies. Save where the context requires otherwise I will refer in this judgment to the Dubai Ports entities which became involved in the running of the facilities in Djibouti as DP World.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">DDP was Mr Boreh’s idea. It represented a type of venture which was new in Djibouti, a public/private collaboration, a private company in which the government also held a minor shareholding in return for the provision of land. The largest single private investor was Mr Boreh, through his principal company Boreh International, the second defendant. DDP was a considerable success, increasing the throughput of Ethiopian trade in the port and bringing new business and employment to the country. Although the Republic originally made a series of claims against the defendants in relation to DDP, those claims had all been abandoned by the end of the trial. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">After he first met Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman of DP World in 1999, Mr Boreh developed the idea of outsourcing the entire management of the port of Djibouti to DP World, thereby avoiding all the problems of inefficiency and corruption which had beset it in the past. In 2000, a Concession Agreement for the management of the port was entered into between PAID and DP World. With the transfer of management control to DP World, the port became much more efficient and its profits increased and have continued to increase.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Since 1999, the President of the Republic has been Ismail Omar Guelleh (to whom I will refer as “the President”). Until sometime in the second half of 2008, the President and Mr Boreh were good friends and, although Mr Boreh never held a formal position in Government, he was a close and influential adviser of the President. In one email, Mr David Hawker, an employee of DP World who was CEO of PAID from November 2004 described Mr Boreh in these terms: <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr Boreh is the King Maker in Djibouti and is both a fairly close business associate and friend/acquaintance of Sultan and many other Dubain (sic) businessmen. He was responsible for getting Dubai involved in Djibouti in the first place and continues to actively expand that involvement at any opportunity.” </span></p>

The President emerges as a shrewd politician with considerable commercial acumen, who always took a keen interest in the commercial development of the port facilities of the Republic. All important decisions to do with the new port facilities were clearly taken by the President personally. This is only to be expected, since it is he who is the sole effective ruler of the Republic and who dictates Government policy. It was quite clear that all the witnesses called by the Republic at trial, all of whom were present or former Government ministers or high-ranking civil servants, were in fear of the President and were not prepared to say anything in their oral evidence which might contradict the position which the President has adopted towards Mr Boreh in this litigation, of which the President is clearly in ultimate control.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One aspect of the development of new port facilities in which the President took a particular interest was the construction of a new oil terminal at Doraleh. Since the mid-1990s, the Republic had tried, without success, to persuade the three oil majors who had the existing facilities in Djibouti City, Total, Mobil and Shell, to move and build new facilities outside the existing port. From 2000 onwards, when Mr Boreh met Mr Hussain Sultan, the Chairman of the Emirates National Oil Company (“ENOC”), another Dubai entity, and introduced him to the President, negotiations began for the construction of an oil terminal and tank farm at Doraleh. The company which owned the terminal, Horizon Djibouti Terminals Limited was one in which ENOC, the Kuwait oil company Independent Petroleum Group (“IPG”) and Mr Boreh through his companies had the principal shareholdings. As with DDP, the Republic provided the land and had a minority shareholding of 10%. DP World paid for the construction of the terminal jetty, for which it has been repaid from the management fees earned by it from management of the port. The Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed, as a gift to the Republic, paid for the new roads linking the terminal to both Djibouti City and the highway leading to Ethiopia.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Much of the construction work on the terminal and the infrastructure, including the roads, was undertaken by Mr Boreh’s company, Soprim. The Republic advanced claims against the defendants in respect of some of the construction work undertaken, including the road link, but by the end of the trial, all those Soprim claims had been abandoned.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The oil terminal and tank farm ultimately became operational in late 2005. The amount of business through the terminal, which includes a contract for storage of oil on behalf of the United States Navy, far exceeds that which passed through the old facilities and the venture has proved profitable. One of the principal claims which continues to be advanced against the defendants in this litigation concerns the shareholdings held by the Boreh companies in Horizon (25% held by Boreh International and 5% by the third defendant (to which I will refer as “Essense”).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It will obviously be necessary to look at this claim and how it has developed in much greater detail later in the judgment, but for the present, it is simply to be noted that, as advanced by the end of the trial, the claim is that no-one in the Government, including the President, knew that Mr Boreh had his own shareholding(s), that the Republic would have purchased all these shareholdings for itself if the President had known they were on offer, but that Mr Boreh dishonestly told the President that 10% was the largest shareholding that the Republic would be able to have in Horizon. This claim is strenuously denied by Mr Boreh, whose case is that the President and others in Government were well aware that, as with DDP, Mr Boreh was taking a substantial private shareholding in Horizon. His case is that the President decided on the amount of the Republic’s shareholding, 10%, and that the President did not want a greater shareholding for the Republic. Mr Boreh denies that he ever told the President that only 10% was available. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">After the construction of the Horizon terminal began, the next stage of development of the new port facilities was the Free Zone. The Djibouti Free Zone Authority (“DFZA”) was created by Presidential Decree in June 2002, although at that stage it had no functions and Mr Boreh was not involved with it. He was appointed as unpaid Chairman of the Board of Directors by a Presidential Decree dated 29 May 2003. The other directors were public officials such as Mr Aden Douale. Under Article 4 of the Decree, the DFZA operated under the direct authority of the President, with complete autonomy from any ministry. By a further Decree in October 2003, it changed its name to the Djibouti Ports and Free Zone Authority (“DPFZA”, the second claimant) although no new powers were conferred on it.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In April 2004, a Free Zone law was passed under which the DPFZA would be the sole authority to administer the Free Zone, to operate as a one stop shop and to sign an administration agreement with the Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (“JAFZA”, another entity in the DP World group). It was Mr Boreh who brought in JAFZA to manage the Free Zone, which opened up for business in June 2004. Under JAFZA management, the enterprise was extremely successful with demand for office and warehouse space such that a major expansion was required. Again the construction work was carried out by Soprim. The claimants originally advanced a claim against the defendants in respect of that construction work, but that too was abandoned.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final stage of the development of the new facilities at Doraleh was the construction of the Doraleh Container Terminal (“DCT”) which cost some U.S. $400 million. DP World committed to obtaining the finance for its construction. Mr Boreh negotiated the terms of the concession, procuring a two thirds shareholding for PAID in the joint venture company which was to own the DCT, the minority one third shareholding being owned by DP World. However, as with the old port and DDP, DP World was to be in exclusive control of the management of the DCT, with PAID and the Government having no right to exercise any control. It is Mr Boreh’s case that it was the fact that DP World was to have exclusive control of the management of the DCT without any political interference which enabled DP World to raise some U.S. $263 million on non-recourse terms.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The DCT opened in December 2008. It has been a tremendous success, with a turnover of some U.S. $160 million a year and net profits of U.S. $70 million, with the Republic receiving U.S. $35 million or more in dividends each year, together with a royalty (which is set at a minimum of U.S. $6 million per year). The investment of the Republic, through PAID, in the DCT was paid back in some four years. Notwithstanding that success and the funds it has received, the Republic claims against Mr Boreh, alleging that the terms of the various agreements which were negotiated by Mr Boreh were disadvantageous to the Republic, in effect “soft terms” which he agreed with DP World, in return for bribes or the promises of bribes in the form of a shareholding in the joint venture company and payments under various Consultancy Agreements with another of his companies S Flame, which the Republic contends were in effect sham agreements designed to disguise the true nature of the payments as bribes. The Republic claims damages against Mr Boreh for loss suffered because the terms of the DCT agreement were less advantageous than they should have been. It also seeks the disgorgement by Mr Boreh of what it alleges were the bribes paid to him by DP World.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In parallel with its claim against Mr Boreh to that effect in the current litigation, in about July 2014, the Republic sought rescission of the Concession Agreement and Joint Venture Agreement with DP World and commenced LCIA arbitration against DP World, alleging that the Agreements had been procured on terms which were unfavourable to the Republic through bribery and corruption of Mr Boreh. The Court has not had sight of the pleadings in that arbitration, which remains confidential, although it is apparent that the allegations are strenuously resisted by DP World. The arbitration hearing was originally due to be heard during the same period of time as the present trial, but was eventually adjourned, as I understand it due to the logistical difficulties of witnesses who were due to give evidence in the arbitration being required to give evidence at the trial. </p>

To the extent that the Republic’s complaint is about the so called “reserved matters” giving exclusive management control to DP World, he contends that neither it nor its financiers and political risk insurers would have agreed to anything less than complete control without any interference from the President or ministers.

It will be necessary to consider this issue in more detail later, but it does seem clear that it was the fact that Mr Boreh would not support President Guelleh standing again which led to the breakdown of their relationship when Mr Boreh left Djibouti in October 2008.  </p>

Mr Boreh contends that the claims being advanced against him are not bona fide claims but are politically motivated, motivated by the malice the President has for Mr Boreh whom he sees as a rival to be destroyed. Normally, the motivation for bringing a claim is of no particular relevance. The claim is either a good one or a bad one. If it is a good one, then it will succeed and the fact that the claimant brought the claim out of malice is irrelevant and will not prevent the success of the claim. If the claim is a bad one it will fail and the fact that it was motivated by malice will only be relevant to the question whether the claimant should be liable to pay the defendant’s costs on the indemnity basis. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Dominic Kendrick QC submits on behalf of Mr Boreh that, in the present case, the fact that the litigation is part of a relentless political campaign against Mr Boreh is of forensic relevance in a number of inter-related ways. First, it explains why the President, in the name of the Republic has brought a number of claims with no prospect of success, many of which were abandoned in the claimants’ opening and during the course of the trial. Second, it provides an explanation for why the witnesses called by the Republic lied, specifically about their knowledge of Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon, because once the President denied knowledge, they had to follow suit. Third, the political campaign had its sinister side, namely Mr Boreh’s conviction in his absence of an offence of terrorism on the basis of false evidence. As detailed in my judgment setting aside the freezing injunction ([2015] EWHC 769 (Comm)), there was an attempt when this was discovered to justify the conviction by reference to concocted evidence. This called into question the bona fides of Mr Sultan, the State Inspector General, who was the person in charge of the present litigation and, although Lord Falconer on behalf of the claimants had said at the hearing to set aside the freezing injunction that Mr Sultan would be replaced and someone else would be put in charge of the litigation, this had not occurred. Fourth, Mr Kendrick QC submits that the political campaign demonstrates the extreme country risk of investment in Djibouti under the current regime, fully justifying the control provisions that DP World insisted on in the DCT agreements.  </p>

In so far as those claims were ever quantified, they exceeded U.S. $35 million. Many of them involved allegations of dishonesty: serious breaches of duty or receipt of bribes. Some of the matters complained of continue to have a twilight existence in the sense that the claimants still rely upon some of them (specifically the ZPMC commission, the circumstances in which Soprim obtained the Horizon civil works contract, the Horizon consultancy payments and the Dry Port finder’s fee) as evidence that Mr Boreh was dishonest and/or of a corrupt relationship with DP World. It will be necessary to consider those matters at appropriate points in this judgment.  </p>

The split trial came about because of the quantum issues raised by the claim then being pursued by the Republic that it had suffered a loss as a consequence of Mr Boreh’s company Soprim having procured the various construction contracts. However, given that the claimants were already running their “soft terms” case in the DP World arbitration, for some unexplained reason, they seem to have decided not to plead out that case in these proceedings. </p>

Mr Kendrick QC submitted that this was not just a pleading point, but that in fairness to Mr Boreh, he was entitled to know precisely what the case against him was as to “soft terms” and to have that case put to him in cross-examination at the liability trial. Mr Kendrick QC also submitted that it would be unsatisfactory for the court simply to say that it was to be inferred that soft terms were given, but leave the enquiry as to the respects in which they might have been disadvantageous to a stage two trial, which might be conducted by a different judge. There was a risk of inconsistent judgments if the second judge then concluded that none of the terms were disadvantageous.

(b) The principle of DP World managing the terminal being acknowledged, the other provisions giving DP World exclusive control (and in particular over the board and budget, of DCT, the appointment of the contractor to construct it, and of the rights of its shareholders) were unnecessary and disadvantageous.”</span></p>

The Skeleton then went on to set out the respects in which the Agreements were said to have been disadvantageous by reference to evidence which the claimants were seeking to adduce as to terms agreed by DP World in relation to other terminals they operate elsewhere in the world. For example, in relation to the royalty, the claimants contended: <span style="font-style:italic">“No minimum traffic level is included in the calculation of the royalty and, under a Concession Agreement with a term of up to 50 years, the payments do not increase with inflation. By contrast DP World pays 65% at the Jeddah South terminal, another operator pays 48% at Jeddah North; at Dakar DP World paid US$93m upfront, a fee of $1/sqm of land conceded per year, and royalties per container handled (see Concession Agreement, clauses 11.2.1 and 11.2.2; at Algiers, €16m upfront, €4/sqm of land; 4% of container revenues and 15% of other revenues.”</span></p>

He called Mr Qureshi of DP World (whose statement was served on 19 October 2015 during the trial) to deal with the allegation that the terms of the DCT Agreements were not as favourable as they might have been. The claimants did not call any evidence on those matters, other than that of Ms Ali, who was not really qualified to give evidence about technical matters such as royalties, management fees and the length of the concession. In particular, the claimants did not call any expert evidence on these issues.  </p>

However, by the end of the trial, I was very troubled by the unsatisfactory limbo in which the serious issue of whether Mr Boreh had been bribed to agree to “soft terms” had been left. Lord Falconer submitted in his oral closing submissions that, if the court concluded that Mr Boreh had been bribed, then all I should decide at this stage was whether, on the balance of probabilities, that bribery caused some loss to the claimants. If I concluded that it did, then all issues as to what terms would have been agreed were for another day at the stage two trial.

He urged me against taking the course advocated by Lord Falconer of just deciding whether, if there was bribery, it had caused some loss, leaving the detail of any loss to a stage two trial, where Mr Kendrick QC pointed out, as he had done at the pre-trial review, that another judge might decide, for example, that DP World would never have agreed any other terms than the ones </p>

Whilst it can no doubt be said on behalf of the claimants that they have not called their expert evidence, it seems to me that they could have made an application to do so, given that the relevant evidence has already been prepared for the purposes of the DP World arbitration. In any event, I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that expert evidence of comparisons with other container terminals would be unlikely to be of any real assistance, since the DCT and the Agreements relating to it are in a very real sense unique. I have concluded that, both in the  interests of justice and of proper case management, I have to decide now, not only whether there was bribery, but whether if there was, it caused the terms of the DCT Agreements to be less advantageous to the Republic/PAID than they would otherwise have been and in what respects. </p>

However, there are two caveats in relation to that approach. The first is that, in some respects, the contemporaneous documentation is thin, particularly in relation to the negotiations with ENOC of the Horizon agreements, so that there is not always contemporaneous documentation against which to test the recollection of witnesses. The second is that, in a very real sense, this case is a “swearing match” between two protagonists, the President and Mr Boreh, with Mr Boreh maintaining that the President was well aware of Mr Boreh’s personal interests in the various ventures of which complaint is now made, specifically his shareholding in Horizon, all such matters having been discussed orally between them and agreed by the President. The President on the other hand denied all such knowledge. </p>

In the event, Mr Boreh did give evidence at the trial and was cross-examined by Lord Falconer on behalf of the Republic for four and a half days. I had the opportunity to observe Mr Boreh in the witness box, not just in terms of the evidence he gave but the way in which he gave it, which was of invaluable assistance in assessing the extent to which he was an honest and reliable witness.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also important to remember two points about Mr Boreh as a witness. The first is that he gave his evidence in English. Although he speaks extremely good English, it is not his mother tongue and there were occasions when his answers to questions came across rather oddly because of his use of the English language. The second and related point is that Mr Boreh suffers from dyslexia, which causes some difficulty in processing information. Although Lord Falconer’s cross-examination was a model of fairness and clarity, I considered that there were occasions when Mr Boreh was having difficulty following what he was being asked about and gave confused answers. What the claimants submit were evasive answers seem to me better categorised as being confused, particularly when Mr Boreh was tired.  </p>

With the exception of the allegation that he received bribes from DP World in return for negotiation of “soft terms” on the DCT Agreements, all the matters raised are ones in relation to which the Republic no longer maintains any claim against Mr Boreh, whether in relation to the Horizon success fee or consultancy payments, the DDP finders’ fee, the ZPMC commission, the procuring of Nomad security contracts or the procuring of construction contracts for Soprim. Those claims are no longer pursued against Mr Boreh or his companies because the Republic could not sustain an argument that it had suffered a loss. Had it been able to do so, one can be sure these claims would have been maintained, given the Republic’s relentless pursuit of Mr Boreh. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to an assessment of the witnesses who were actually called by the Republic, as I have already observed, they were all former ministers or high ranking civil servants. In my judgment, there are three reasons for approaching with considerable circumspection the evidence of all the Republic’s witnesses. First, they all exhibited a marked reluctance to say anything in evidence which might contradict or question the President’s stance in the litigation, which is of course that of the Republic. At its most extreme, this meant that, because the President’s stance was that he did not know that Mr Boreh had a shareholding in Horizon, all the witnesses called had to claim that they were equally ignorant of the shareholding at the time, even though Djibouti is a small place where everyone knows everyone else’s business, particularly in the case of anyone of prominence such as Mr Boreh. There was something unreal, which would have been comic were it not for the seriousness of the allegations made by the Republic, in former ministers and high ranking civil servants avowing ignorance of the shareholding, when the fact that Mr Boreh held a shareholding was reported several times in Africa Intelligence, an internet media service and in Wikileaks cables from the U.S. Ambassador which showed that she was aware that Mr Boreh had invested in Horizon. Indeed, the most farcical aspect of this was that, in one such cable, Mr Tani, the cabinet director, who was one of the Republic’s witnesses, was quoted by the Ambassador as saying <span style="font-style:italic">“of course”</span> Mr Boreh had shares.  His attempt to explain this away, as relating to Mr Boreh’s interest through Soprim in the construction of the terminal, was thoroughly unconvincing and contradicted what he had clearly told the Ambassador. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second reason for approaching the evidence of the Djibouti witnesses with considerable caution is that it was quite obvious that they had had witness training and been carefully prepared for giving evidence. Mr Douale admitted as much. Mr Kendrick QC relied upon two matters as demonstrating such preparation. First, that although a number of the witnesses, specifically Mr Douale and Ms Zeinab Ali, are pretty fluent in English, they all insisted on giving their evidence in French, with simultaneous translation. I did not regard that as necessarily indicative of overpreparation or “schooling” as Mr Kendrick QC described it, as it seems to me that even someone who is apparently fluent in a foreign language may misinterpret the nuances of questions in that language and, if they wish to do so, should be entitled to give their evidence in their mother tongue. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second matter on which Mr Kendrick QC relied as evidence of careful preparation of the witnesses had considerably more force. None of them accepted (with the exceptions of minor corrections) anything said in his or her witness statement as being wrong. The most extreme example of this was in the crossexamination of Mr Douale, when Mr Kendrick QC put to him two completely inconsistent paragraphs in his witness statement, one where he said he always believed that Mr Boreh was working for the good of Djibouti and the other where he claimed that Mr Boreh had told him that, if they signed the DCT contract with DP World, they would both be rich for life. Mr Douale seemed incapable of recognising the inconsistency, although tellingly whilst he insisted that the paragraphs were not versions or stories, but were facts, he continued: <span style="font-style:italic">“and they have gone off the rails”</span></p>

He was also a member of the board of DDP after January 2002, representing the interest of PAID, which became a shareholder in DDP at that time. I found his evidence to the effect that he did not know about Mr Boreh’s investment in Horizon most unconvincing. He accepted that he knew about Mr Boreh’s interest in Soprim and DDP and it seems to me that, given his role at all material times as one of the cadre of influential people in Djibouti with responsibility for the port, it is inconceivable that he did not know about Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon. Indeed, there was a telling moment in cross-examination when he said: <span style="font-style:italic">“I felt rather that Mr Boreh was working on a parallel line for his own business and also Djibouti's interest, that's what I could note.”</span> He clearly intended that as a smear on Mr Boreh to suggest that he had acted in conflict of interest, but it seemed to me to suggest he did know about Mr Boreh’s interest in Horizon.</p>

Two further examples are (i) his evidence in his witness statement that he did not know, until the meeting with the Arab Funds in February 2002, that ENOC was going to fund the oil terminal, which was demonstrably untrue, notwithstanding which, as he put it: <span style="font-style:italic">“that's what I say in my witness statement and I will stick with that”</span>; (ii)  his evidence when asked whether everyone in the Government knew how much control they were giving up to DP World under the DCT Agreements and the President had to decide whether to approve it or not. He persisted in stating what the claimants’ case was, namely that as majority shareholder PAID should have had control, without answering the question.

I refer to two by way of example.  In his witness statement, he said that the only work carried out by Soprim at the Presidential Palace for which any invoice was outstanding at the time of the sale of the land for Horizon was relatively minor electrical work following fire damage. This was clearly designed to give the impression that nothing like the U.S. $1,676,000 which was the amount off-set against the sale proceeds in the second MOU in respect of the Soprim debt was in fact due, the implication being that Mr Boreh had misappropriated that amount. In fact the outstanding invoices which he had approved exceeded U.S. $1.5 million and additional work had been carried out since the last invoice, amply justifying the amount of the off-set. Mr Bouh accepted these invoices were correct when confronted with what he had approved in crossexamination, but would not accept that what he had said in his statement was wrong, shifting his ground to saying that he had known about the invoices, but not known about the agreement for their payment in the second MOU.

The sale agreement which Mr Bouh signed referred to a <span style="font-style:italic">“protocol d’accord” </span>(memorandum of understanding) which was a reference to the document which set out the agreement between ENOC and the Government as to the sale proceeds (including that U.S.$1,676,000 of those proceeds would be used to pay the Government debt to Soprim). In his evidence, Mr Bouh maintained that he had neither looked at nor asked the notary for the MOU. This was an unsustainable stance, as it is inconceivable (for reasons I set out in detail in the relevant section of my findings of fact) that the notary would not have ensured that the MOU was produced to and read by the parties, before the sale agreement was signed. It is equally inconceivable that, as a lawyer, Mr Bouh would not have read all the documents with which he was presented very carefully. This evasive piece of evidence on Mr Bouh’s part was obviously designed to avoid the Court concluding that he had been aware at the time of the terms of the so called second MOU. </p>

Although the charges were withdrawn, as she said in cross-examination the damage had been done. However, as Mr Kendrick QC puts it, there was a <span style="font-style:italic">“lucky redemption”</span>. The Republic needed her assistance in an arbitration in which it was being pursued by Soprim and she provided a witness statement in November 2014. In what clearly was a reward for her cooperation, in January 2015, the Prime Minister wrote a memorandum assigning her to the Ministry of Transport, but with a year’s backdated pay to January 2014. However, she explained in evidence that she no longer wanted to be a civil servant and wanted to be a lawyer in private practice. This apparently requires a decree from the president licensing a lawyer to practice and there are only about fifty such lawyers in Djibouti. Before her statement was served in the present proceedings in July 2015, the President passed a Decree licensing her to practice as a lawyer. I have no doubt that this was the reward for her continued cooperation. </p>

She is clearly a serious and conscientious person and appeared to be by far and away the most straightforward and honest of the Republic’s witnesses. However, equally clearly she is in thrall to the President and was anxious not to say anything in evidence which might offend him, which is perfectly understandable given her rollercoaster experience since Mr Boreh fell out of favour. However, inevitably it means that I have to approach her evidence with considerable caution. Like many of the other witnesses she was intent on following what might be described as the “party line” of the claimants’ case, although when pressed she was prepared to accept that she had considered that the DCT Agreements were commercially very advantageous for the Republic, as indeed they were. She also made some other concessions in her evidence. On balance though, I formed the view that where her evidence contradicted that of Mr Boreh, I preferred his evidence.  </p>

However, as I will discuss in more detail later in dealing with the issue of political motivation, as a counter attack on what Mr Boreh said, this rather backfired on the claimants.

DP World is fighting the arbitration against the Republic/PAID, in which it has its own interests and agenda which are not necessarily aligned with those of Mr Boreh, which might make it reluctant to make witnesses available in the Court proceedings. Mr Kendrick QC said that they, meaning Mr Boreh’s legal team, had not had access to the higher echelons of DP World and I see no reason not to accept that statement.

I decline to draw any such inference. ENOC is an independent entity which is not a party to either these proceedings or the DP World arbitration. There may be any number of reasons why its senior personnel might not want to become embroiled in this dispute, not least the commercial one that ENOC is running the Horizon terminal and may not want to fall out with the President and the Republic. Furthermore, to the extent that it is being said by the claimants that Mr Boreh has not called any evidence to corroborate oral discussions he says took place, the short answer is that he was prepared to come and be cross-examined about those discussions, whereas the President, who was involved in most of those discussions, was not.        </p>

On incorporation of DDP, Dry Port Invest owned 74.8% of the shares in DDP, having invested U.S. $4 million in cash. Dry Port Invest in turn was owned 33% by Mr Boreh and 17% by Essense, the third defendant, one of his companies. Mr Boreh’s evidence was that Essense, a Hong Kong company was set up to hold investments which the President might be interested in acquiring in due course when he retired.

DP World was also interested in managing DDP. Mr Douale confirmed that negotiations reached an impasse, so he arranged for Mr Boreh, who was in Dubai, to join the negotiations, after which they proceeded much more smoothly.

The core management team for running the port was to be recruited and selected solely by DP World. Tariffs were to be set by DP World. Thus, many of the features of which the Republic complains in relation to the DCT Agreements with DP World, such as complete management control without any Government interference, formed an integral part of the original agreement for the management of the existing port from 2000 onwards.

All those claims have now been abandoned and it is unnecessary to say anything about them in this judgment, save that the claimants’ pleaded case, that the U.S. $6 million paid by JAFZA for the shares was a bribe or secret commission, was utterly hopeless and should never have been advanced. Given that JAFZA paid Mr Boreh the same price as he paid Finafo, he made no gain. The DDP claims also included a claim in respect of a “finder’s fee” in respect of the Dry Port originally sought by Mr Boreh from Mr Fewer of DP World in 2004, with the request being renewed to Mr Fewer in July 2006. In the event, no finder’s fee was paid and Mr Boreh did not pursue his request thereafter. The claimants’ claim in so far as it relates to the finder’s fee has been abandoned, but the claimants still rely upon the circumstances in which it was discussed as indicative of the corrupt relationship between Mr Boreh and DP World. I will consider the finder’s fee later in the context of the DCT claims.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That case raises a number of questions in relation to which it is necessary to make detailed findings of fact, primarily: (i) were the President and the Government unaware of Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon; (ii) what shareholding was the Republic prepared to take in the Horizon venture; (iii) what, if anything, did Mr Boreh tell the President about the shareholding which was available. Before analysing the evidence on these questions and making my detailed findings, it is as well to start by looking at the inherent probabilities, in line with the approach of Robert Goff LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost</span>. The background is that it was well known to those in Government, including the President, that Mr Boreh was one of the private investors in the DDP. In those circumstances, what reason would Mr Boreh have for concealing his shareholding in Horizon from the Government? Why not simply inform them about it, as he had with the shareholding in DDP? On this basis, concealing the shareholding makes absolutely no sense. Furthermore, it was a high risk strategy to seek to conceal it or mislead the Government as to what shareholding was available for the Government, since in a small country like Djibouti, where everyone in a position of authority knows each other’s business, it was bound to come out that Mr Boreh had a substantial personal shareholding in Horizon. Indeed it did come out, since the U.S. Ambassador knew and so did Africa Intelligence. It is not suggested that Mr Boreh sought to conceal his shareholding in Horizon from the Ambassador or from the media. On analysis, the Republic’s case of a “secret shareholding” in Horizon is inherently improbable.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is common ground that by 2000, the existing oil facilities in Djibouti City were a danger to the environment. The underground pipes were leaking and causing subsurface pollution and tankers ran through the city causing an environmental hazard and a safety risk. The facilities, some of which had been built in the 1930s, but all of which were of considerable age, were owned and operated by the oil majors, Total, Mobil and Shell. As Mr Douale agreed in cross-examination, the oil trade had always been a private one, in other words, the Government did not engage in oil storage. Prior to the construction of the Horizon Terminal, the port dues on hydrocarbons made up only a small proportion of PAID revenue which was mainly derived from container business.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">By early 2000, the construction of a new oil terminal was seen by the Republic as part of an ambitious plan to create new oil, container and bulk goods terminals and a free zone at Doraleh, as appears from a study produced by PAID in February 2000. A briefing paper for the Ministry of Energy in April 2000 refers to the Government looking for funding to build a new hydrocarbons storage facility for the benefit of Société Internationale des Hydrocarbures de Djibouti (“SIHD”) described as a private company which:  <span style="font-style:italic">“reflects the concern of the government in the domain of hydrocarbon fuels and the protection of the environment and is in the process of privatisation and disengagement of the State.”</span> This briefing paper was forwarded to the President by the Minister of Energy, together with a paper on the search for a donation of oil for a year from a friendly oil producer. I suspect that it is to the latter proposal that the power of attorney given by the President to Mr Boreh in December 2000 (to which I refer below) relates. At all events, what the briefing paper demonstrates, as is borne out by other documents subsequently, is that it was never intended that the oil storage business to be established at Doraleh should be Government run. Rather the Government policy was one of privatisation pursuant to its agreements with the IMF, as Mr Bouh (who was Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2005) accepted in cross-examination. I accept Mr Kendrick QC’s submission that the relevant political environment at the time that the Horizon Terminal was being proposed and subsequently constructed was one in which the Government was seeking to cut public spending and borrowing (as required by the IMF) and reduce, not expand, its commercial ventures.   </p>

Mr Douale stated in November 2000 that the project was headed by the Office of the President. Mr Dileita (who was Prime Minister at the time) refers to the Doraleh project (including the Horizon Terminal) as: <span style="font-style:italic">“a special project under the supervision of the Presidency.”</span> Mr Boreh said in cross-examination when Lord Falconer put to him that he was authorised by the Government to have discussions with ENOC: <span style="font-style:italic">“I was a go-between, I was a facilitator, and all decisions was made by the President himself, and this was something he had very close to his heart, he was not going to leave this kind of after opportunity for me to make it happen or not happen.

In addition to pressing for the development of a new Free Zone as soon as possible, the President asked DP World to <span style="font-style:italic">“re-contact [ENOC] to renew discussions”</span> for the development of the Doraleh area for oil storage and distribution. The President referred to the fact that the Kuwait Oil Company wanted to develop a refinery, but the Arab Investment Bank said this was too ambitious, and whilst it was prepared to fund the development, it wanted to see a more practical usage. Mr Fewer’s note refers to the fact that the Government wanted to relocate the oil majors’ existing facilities away from the existing port because of their environmental impact.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In fact, the President had written to Mr Douale as the director of PAID earlier, in March 2000 referring to oil spillage in the existing port and stating (in translation): <span style="font-style:italic">“Having regard to the extremely dangerous nature, both for all of the facilities located within and outside the [PAID] and for the city of Djibouti, 1 would ask that you kindly consider, as soon as possible, the total transfer of the hydrocarbon and derivatives storage areas and construction for that purpose, and with financing by the [PAID], of a jetty and associated infrastructure at Doraleh.  In this regard, all of the companies concerned must immediately undertake the necessary arrangements for their facilities at the new site in Doraleh.” </span>This suggests that a major objective of the Government in seeking the construction of a new oil terminal was the elimination of pollution at the old facilities.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Douale accepted in cross-examination that the Government’s idea at that time was that it would give the land to the oil majors for nothing if they would build a terminal and the Government for its part would get financing for the jetty and the infrastructure. As is apparent from a later letter in November 2001 from the Office of the President to the Kuwaiti Fund (in the context of seeking funding from the Arab Funds for the construction of the terminal which was to be operated by ENOC) this remained the Government’s position at least until that time in late 2001. Paragraph 4 of that letter states: <span style="font-style:italic">“The Government of Djibouti will make the ground areas required for the proposed project available at no cost to the operator.  The operator, DPI, will have control of the facility within the guidelines laid down from time to time by the Government of Djibouti.  The oil installation operator ENOC will be responsible to DPI for the safe and efficient operation of the oil facility.” </span>Mr Douale accepted in cross-examination that the President’s idea at that time (in November 2001) was that if ENOC built the terminal, they would get the land for free. This all strongly suggests that, from at least early 2000 to late 2001, the Government had no intention of taking any shareholding in the oil terminal or the company which ran it. The land would be provided for free, not in return for a shareholding.</p>

Mr Fewer recollected Mr Boreh urging DP World to set up meetings with ENOC. Furthermore, the President made a similar request to Mr Fewer at the meeting on 19 September 2000 and the fact that he referred to <span style="font-style:italic">“recontact”</span> suggests there had already been some contact between the Government and ENOC. In cross-examination Mr Boreh said that he and the President in fact met Mr Sultan on the same day.  In their written closing submissions, the claimants appear to be suggesting that this was after the President met Mr Fewer on 19 September 2000, but that cannot be right given the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“re-contact” </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">“renewing discussions”</span>.

		<span style="font-style:italic">Q.  Well, if you are going to attract a major investor to build a storage terminal in Doraleh, if you are the Republic of Djibouti, somebody has to negotiate on behalf of the Republic of Djibouti the terms upon which that investment will be made, and somebody has to talk on behalf of the Republic of Djibouti with the prospective investor; isn't that right? </span>

When you send someone, you say you go and negotiate, normally what you do is you give him a guidelines of what you want to do, you tell him if you want to buy and how much you want to buy, whether you have high attitude for investment, low or medium, you give them directions.  I have not been given any such responsibility to go -- the way you put it, to go and negotiate.  What do you exactly mean by "go and negotiate"?  I introduced them, they were talking face-to-face to each other.  Everything, all the cards were on the table.”</span>

He also makes the perfectly valid point that, if he had been appointed by the Government to negotiate an agreement with ENOC, he would expect some guidelines, in other words some form of formal written authority.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In that context, it is instructive to look at this stage of the analysis at how the claimants’ case on the appointment of Mr Boreh to act on its behalf in negotiations with ENOC has changed over time. Although that case obviously seeks to cover the entire period from early 2000 through until the various agreements were concluded in December 2002, if the claimants are right that Mr Boreh was appointed by the President in 2000 to negotiate with ENOC, then that appointment would hold good through the period until December 2002 (there being no allegation of a revocation of authority). Conversely, if the claimants’ case that the President appointed Mr Boreh in 2000 to negotiate with ENOC on behalf of the Republic is a bad one, it will remain bad for the period through until December 2002, it not being alleged by the claimants that there was some separate or fresh appointment by the President of Mr Boreh in 2001 or 2002. </p>

The case that the acquisition of the Horizon shareholding was a breach of duty by Mr Boreh was based solely upon his appointment as President of the Board of the DPFZA. The difficulty with that plea, as detailed further below, is that to the extent that the agreement for the shareholding was made in December 2002, it antedated Mr Boreh’s appointment to the DPFZA in May 2003. </p>

In [36] of his first report he set out the six specific delegations of powers (i.e. powers of attorney) granted by the President to Mr Boreh, starting with that of 12 December 2000 (which he misinterprets as being some general authority to negotiate and sign contracts with ENOC as opposed to being limited to contracts for crude oil). The next he refers to is the power of attorney dated 30 November 2002 to attend meetings of what became HDTL, followed by that of 16 June 2004 to participate in the General Meeting of HDTL of 2 July 2004 and <span style="font-style:italic">“do the necessary”</span>. The other three specific powers of attorney are dated October 2006 and October and December 2007 and relate to signing the DCT agreements, not to Horizon. At [38], Professor Delebecque infers the existence of a general mandate to conclude the Horizon transaction from these specific powers of attorney in these terms: </p>

Also, it is clearly and expressly stated in one of the mandats (16 June 2004) that Mr. Boreh has the power to "do the necessary" to complete the transaction, which gave him authority to carry out all acts necessary for the successful conclusion of the transaction.  </span>

This must be the case for two other related reasons. First, if such a wide general mandate had been granted, it would have been extremely important, granting Mr Boreh extensive powers in relation to several multi-million dollar projects. It is inconceivable that such a mandate would not have been committed to writing, particularly in circumstances where the President committed the delegation to represent the Republic at a particular meeting to writing. Second, if there had been such a wide general mandate, the specific mandates would have been unnecessary. As Mr Kendrick QC correctly submitted, if there had been a wide oral mandate, it would have been perverse for Mr Boreh to ask for a whole series of narrow delegations of power. He would simply have asked for the wide oral mandate to be committed to writing. Accordingly, the claimants’ case, that there was some wide oral mandate granted by the President to Mr Boreh at some unidentified time to negotiate the terms of the Horizon agreement with ENOC, is simply unsustainable.  </p>

Mr Boreh accepted in cross-examination that he continued to have discussions with ENOC during that period. On 3 April 2001, ENOC sent Mr Boreh a draft of a letter which it proposed that the Government should send to ENOC granting it a licence to own and operate the proposed oil terminal and to market petroleum in Djibouti. Mr Boreh explained that this was ENOC wanting to test the market before committing itself to building the facility. However, contrary to the claimants’ submissions, this is not Mr Boreh acting as the representative of the Government: he had no authority to grant such a licence and would simply have passed this on to the Government. He could not recall whether he did so.  </p>

A meeting had originally been arranged with the Arab Funds in Djibouti for February 2001, but this had been postponed to March, then May and finally June 2001. In the context of the fact that Technital had still not been paid for the Master Plan and Preliminary Design study in relation to the oil terminal, Mr Douale complained that in consequence the Doraleh project was falling behind schedule. He urged the President to set up a meeting with DP World: <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr President, it is important that you bring about a meeting at our level, with the participation of DPI, in order to define a new strategy regarding the implementation of this important project.” </span>After some reluctance, in cross-examination Mr Douale accepted, in answer to a question from me, that this was him asking the President to get DP World involved in the funding. </p>

Mr Boreh’s evidence was that he then discussed the MOU with the President. Mr Boreh went back to Mr Sultan on 2 July 2001 with three proposed changes. In relation to clause 2.2.1 which referred to the levelling of the land on which the terminal was to be built and its transfer to the joint venture company, which it was proposed was to construct and operate the terminal, Mr Boreh proposed the addition after <span style="font-style:italic">“level and transfer to the company” </span>of the words<span style="font-style:italic"> “at agreed rent”. </span>He said in cross-examination that these words were inserted after his discussion with the President who had said that they should be inserted. I see no reason not to accept that evidence which seems to me to accord with the inherent probabilities. As I have found, contrary to the claimants’ submissions, Mr Boreh was not a representative of the Government. In those circumstances, it is more than likely that he did discuss the draft MOU with the President and that it was the President who wanted the words <span style="font-style:italic">“at agreed rent”</span> to be inserted.  </p>

I will return below to the position of the President, but so far as ENOC is concerned, what is said by the claimants is that he was not the type of third party investor ENOC would have encouraged to participate in the construction and ownership of the oil terminal.

However, it was never intended by the Government that the terminal would be state owned and operated. Rather, this was part of the overall programme of privatisation and private investment which the President was pursuing with the agreement of the IMF. In all probability, this would have been known to the Dubai interests, including ENOC. Contrary to the claimants’ submissions, I consider that Mr Boreh and his companies were precisely the type of investor for whom ENOC would have been looking, local and with political influence and an ability to get things done despite Government bureaucracy, as indeed proved to be the case.  </p>

This is correct as far as it goes, but on the other hand the November 2000 draft MOU also produced by the legal department had contained a clause 3 providing: <span style="font-style:italic">“the Proposed Facility will be owned by the government, ENOC and any third party approved by the Government and ENOC.” </span>That provision demonstrates that, at that stage, ENOC had in mind possible third party investors who may well have included Mr Boreh. Subsequently, in July 2001, Mr Boreh asked for the inclusion of the additional wording in clause 10.2 of the then draft MOU, referring to third party investors and ENOC did not cavil at that, which suggests that ENOC had not changed its mind about third party investors such as Mr Boreh. It is much more likely that the omission by ENOC from its first draft in June 2001 of a provision equivalent to clause 3 in the November 2000 draft, was an oversight. In the circumstances, I see no reason not to accept Mr Boreh’s evidence that, from an early stage, he had discussed with Mr Sultan the fact that he would be interested in investing personally in the Horizon project.  </p>

This was put to Mr Boreh as part of the claimants’ case that he had also concealed his intention to invest personally from the Arab Funds at the meeting with them in February 2002 (to which I refer in more detail below). Lord Falconer put that clause 3 in the draft MOU produced by the ENOC legal department in November 2000 suggested that ENOC were happy for the Government to be involved in the approval of any third party investor. Mr Boreh had then put into the July 2001 MOU a provision that any third party investor only had to be approved by ENOC. The suggestion that this was done deliberately was refuted by Mr Boreh:  </p>

The submission that there was some deliberate “change” by Mr Boreh from clause 3 of the November 2000 draft to his proposed addition to clause 10.2 of the July 2001 draft only has any force if Mr Boreh had seen and was aware of the November 2000 draft, which, as I have held, he was not.  </p>

It seems to me that his speculation about the views of ENOC concerning approval of third party investors, was really to do with why ENOC would have been happy to accept his addition to clause 10.2, rather than inserting something equivalent to clause 3 in the November 2000 draft, namely that ENOC may have considered that it was not for the Government to dictate to ENOC as businessmen who else invested in the Horizon project.

Rather, what he says, in the context of his decision (to which I return below) not to pursue funding from the Arab Funds is: <span style="font-style:italic">“Thus, I thought that the plan for the terminal could progress more quickly if Dubai Ports could arrange financing instead of the Arab Funds. However, I was on the look-out for any partner capable of commencing the construction of the oil port.” </span>In fact, as the letter in November 2001 from the Office of the President to the Kuwait Fund which I quoted at [129] above demonstrates, and as Mr Douale accepted in cross-examination, even after this July 2001 MOU was signed, the President’s idea remained that, if ENOC built the terminal, it would get the land for free.

He had been telling them from the time he first got elected (echoing pressure which started about 1995) to close the oil terminal down and go to Doraleh. They simply ignored him, which he felt was humiliating. So if the time came when ENOC were to lead this project and he no longer had to turn to the oil majors in Djibouti to help, it would give him great personal pleasure.” </span>

Mr Boreh demonstrated his commitment to the Doraleh project by, amongst other things, his investment in DDP, of which the President was clearly aware, so he had no reason to conceal his intention to invest in the Horizon Terminal from the President. Mr Boreh’s commitment to the project, including through his personal investment, was something which clearly encouraged the Dubai interests (DP World and ENOC) to invest in Djibouti, which was what the President wanted at that time. It is quite clear that the President’s priority, so far as the oil terminal was concerned, was to find a company such as ENOC which was prepared to construct and run a new terminal in Doraleh, in circumstances where the oil majors had refused to do so. The claimants’ case that the President or the Republic was ever interested at any relevant time in taking a shareholding in Horizon which was more than “symbolic” (to use Mr Moussa’s telling description in his interviews with Gibson Dunn) or concerned about either the fact or the scale of Mr Boreh’s investment is, as Mr Kendrick described it, “reverse engineering”, thought up after the event to support a claim against Mr Boreh after the President had fallen out with him. </p>

I was not impressed with this point. Frankly, I would have been far more sceptical about Mr Boreh’s evidence that his intention to invest was discussed with the President if, after fifteen years or more, Mr Boreh could recall a specific time and place when such an oral discussion took place. I am quite satisfied that, at some stage during the preliminary negotiations with ENOC in 2000 or early 2001, Mr Boreh did tell the President that he intended to invest in the new oil terminal personally and that the President encouraged him to make such an investment.  </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC submitted, this would have been a far sighted conspiracy, dreamt up and implemented before any detailed discussions about shareholdings took place. The suggestion that he had that fraudulent plan has to be predicated upon his concealing the intended shareholding from the President because the President would not have allowed it.  There is no reason for the President to be against private investment by Mr Boreh. As I have found, the President was well aware of Mr Boreh’s substantial investment in DDP and raised no objection to it, so there would be no rhyme or reason to his objecting to the Horizon investment and certainly no reason for Mr Boreh to think that he would.  </p>

In my judgment, it is also extremely unlikely that Mr Moussa, who was the Minister for Presidential Affairs, would have signed the MOU, let alone made that manuscript deletion, without discussing the terms of the MOU with the President, not only because of the political reality in Djibouti, which is that the President is in overall control of everything, but because the oil terminal project was one in which the President took a keen personal interest.  Furthermore, given that, when Mr Sultan came to Djibouti to sign the MOU, he had a meeting with the President (as recorded in the note of the meeting between ENOC and Mr Douale and Mr Liberati of Technital on 15 July 2001), it is likely that at that meeting, they discussed the terms of the MOU. </p>

The overall purpose of the meeting seems to have been to discuss in detail the current and projected performance of the port. As Mr Kendrick QC correctly submits, the sheer detail of the agenda is revealing. It shows that the President was deeply involved in matters concerning the port and Horizon, which is scarcely surprising given how critical the success of the existing port and of the Doraleh project was to the economy of his country. In relation to the Doraleh project, the MOU with ENOC was on the agenda for discussion, together with a proposed storage area for EPE, the Ethiopian Oil Company, Ethiopian Petroleum Enterprise. Also for discussion were issues concerning the financing of the project, specifically finance from the Arab Funds and the possible intervention of Dubai to obtain financing. There is no reason to suppose that the matters on the agenda were not discussed between the President and DP World. It is striking that the President does not deal with this meeting at all in either of his witness statements.  </p>

However, as appears from a report dated 19 June 2001 headed “Clarification on the Development of the Doraleh Project” prepared by Mr El Hag (who was the President’s Advisor for Investment Projects and an enthusiastic supporter of the Arab Funds), DP World (who were now managing the old port) considered that phase 4 was useless and recommended the development of Doraleh instead. Accordingly, on the instructions of the President, Mr El Hag had approached the Funds and asked them to agree to transfer the U.S. $32 million of funding to the Horizon project. Mr El Hag’s report records that, following receipt of the Technital preliminary study, the Kuwait Fund agreed to attend a meeting in Djibouti in early June 2001, but the other Funds wanted to discuss this at their coordination meeting in Kuwait on 6 June 2001. At that meeting the other Funds thought that, since the study was incomplete, it was premature to have a meeting with DP World, although the Funds gave their agreement in principle to the Doraleh project.  </p>

I simply do not accept that evidence. As I have said, I did not regard Mr Douale as a reliable witness. The passage I have just quoted where he says that the first he knew about Dubai interests funding the oil terminal was when Mr Boreh mentioned it at the meeting was simply not true. It is quite clear from earlier contemporaneous documents that he already knew that ENOC was going to be funding the construction of the oil terminal. When he was confronted with this in cross-examination, he stuck to what he said in his witness statement, even though it was not true, in a distinctly unimpressive manner.  </p>

He accepted in cross-examination that Mr Hawker may have told him overnight about the fact that the Arab Funds were asking about the 2000 Concession Agreement, but denied that that was the reason for attending the meeting, maintaining that the reason why he attended was that the President had asked him to do so. Although the claimants contend that this evidence about the President being concerned about delay on the part of the Arab Funds is not true, I do not agree. In my judgment, Mr Boreh’s explanation is consistent with the contemporaneous evidence. Mr Douale had expressed concern about delay by the Arab Funds as long ago as June 2001 and now, eight months later, things were still at a preliminary stage, the Funds were still asking for information (however reasonable their requests were) and there was no commitment.  The President himself does not deal with this aspect of the evidence in either of his witness statements although he acknowledges that he knew that obtaining financing from the Arab Funds <span style="font-style:italic">“would be a slow process”</span>.    </p>

This was refuted by Mr Boreh, but the claimants maintain the case that he was impatient with the Arab Funds and wanted the finance for the project to be found elsewhere because he did not want questions to be asked about his potential investment. In my judgment this conspiracy theory is fanciful in the extreme. As the defendants submit, the Arab Funds were not asking questions about who was going to invest in the oil terminal and in what shares and Mr Boreh had no reason to be embarrassed about wanting to invest. Common sense suggests that, just as the Dubai interests were encouraged by Mr Boreh’s enthusiasm for the project to the extent of being prepared to make a personal investment, so too would the Arab Funds have been. The suggestion that he and the Dubai interests were engaged in some dishonest conspiracy for him to make a secret personal investment and he would have been prepared to wreck the funding initiative with the Funds as part of that conspiracy is frankly nonsensical. </p>

My overall impression from the discussion at the meeting was that the Funds were preoccupied with the possibility of a private enterprise profiting from the project, when they were more accustomed to purely public or sovereign investments. In saying that, if I had received an instruction from either Djibouti or my superiors to provide the Arab Funds with copies of the 2000 Concession Agreement, I would have had no problem doing so.

It is one thing for the Republic to make serious allegations amounting to dishonesty against DP World, with whom it has a current dispute in arbitration, but quite another to make allegations against ENOC which is a reputable oil company and is not a party to the present proceedings and has therefore had no opportunity to refute the allegations and set out its own case.

As already noted, the July MOU was silent about the amount of any equity contribution. The concern was that the Republic should not be required to make a 50% equity contribution which would have an adverse effect upon the economic viability of the project. In my judgment, this had nothing at all to do with any personal investment by Mr Boreh. Indeed, to the extent that investment by private investors such as him would reduce the equity contribution that the Republic was expected to make, it appears that would have allayed some of the Fund’s concern.  </p>

In September 2002, at around the time when the President was in all probability making his decision to seek finance by way of private sector funding rather than from the Funds, the Republic was in arrears again on various loans from the Kuwait Fund which was threatening to invoke Article 5 to suspend further payments.

Thus, the Republic gained considerably from proceeding down the private finance route, rather than taking out a loan from the Arab Funds (even assuming such a loan would have been forthcoming), since it received the entire infrastructure from Dubai for no more than an offset against future cash flow.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">What the note also demonstrates is that no final decision had yet been taken by the President as to whether to lease or to sell the land to the new company. In relation to the shareholding which the Government might take in the new company, what the President is recorded as saying is: “<span style="font-style:italic">It is estimated that Govt. of Djibouti may like to have an equity participation of 10 to 15%.  This could be in the form of value of plot allotted for the project</span>”.  In their written closing submissions, the claimants sought to argue that the words <span style="font-style:italic">“it is estimated that”</span> were inconsistent with an expressed desire to take that level of shareholding. However, the obvious difficulty with that submission is that, if the President wanted to give evidence that he was not telling ENOC what level of shareholding the Government wanted to take, he could and should have said so in his statement and come to be cross-examined about it. It seems to me the most likely explanation of the use of the words <span style="font-style:italic">“It is estimated that”</span> is that no final decision had been taken by the President as to whether to have an equity participation at all. Given that he tied any equity participation to the value of the land, if the decision eventually reached was to lease the land, the Government might not take a shareholding. What he was not saying was that, if the Government took a shareholding, it might be more, but rather he was saying that if it did so, it would be no more than 10 or 15%.  </p>

It demonstrates that, in line with the Government’s earlier position, at least until late 2001, that it would give away the land for free if an oil company would construct and run a new oil terminal at Doraleh, the Government’s main interest was to shut down the old, polluting facilities in the city and have a new oil terminal at Doraleh and the shareholding was a means to that end.  </p>

Quite apart from the fact that, as I have found, the President knew from an early stage in 2000 that Mr Boreh was proposing to take a shareholding in the oil terminal and certainly knew that by the time of this meeting in September 2002, the Republic clearly did not have the appetite for taking any larger equity share in the project than the President indicated, which is scarcely surprising since it was a high risk project. The Republic would not have wanted to take the risk of having to make substantial contributions as a shareholder if the project went wrong, as it might have done. Contrary to the picture which Lord Falconer sought to paint, Djibouti was not a rich country, as the defaults on the Arab Funds loans demonstrate and, at the relevant time, still required assistance from the IMF.  At a meeting of the Council of Ministers chaired by the President on 19 December 2001, at which the state budget for 2002 was discussed, one of the goals of that budget was said to be: “<span style="font-style:italic">Diligence in controlling public spending by limiting expenses to the real revenues of the State”</span>, reflecting the demands of the IMF.   </p>

What emerged is that Mr Boreh obviously had had some discussions with the President, but that he could not recall the detail, and it seemed to me highly unlikely that the President had had a detailed discussion with Mr Boreh of all the matters referred to in the note of the meeting. As Mr Boreh pointed out, the President had other advisers, including Mr Moussa, and as is clear from the materials relating to the discussions with the Arab Funds, there was no shortage of people providing him with advice other than Mr Boreh, such as Mr El Hag and Mr Douale. Furthermore, the submission that there must have been prior discussions between Mr Boreh and the President faces the obvious difficulty that the President does not even begin to suggest that in his witness statement. Indeed, as I have already said, in effect he avoids dealing with the 19 September 2002 meeting at all. In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is simply not open to the claimants to run a case that what the President said to ENOC at the 19 September 2002 meeting was somehow fed to him by Mr Boreh, but even if that case were open to them, I reject it.   </p>

I did not consider this a fair criticism of Mr Boreh, who can be forgiven for not recalling any detail of discussions with ENOC thirteen to fourteen years ago, where no documents have survived which would assist his memory. I decline to draw the inference which the claimants invite me to draw. It seems to me far more likely that, as Mr Boreh said, whilst he had indicated to ENOC that he would take a shareholding, at the time of the meeting, the precise amount of any shareholding to be taken by the investors had not been determined. The probability is that the size of his shareholding was discussed between him and ENOC later, at some point before the agenda for the first shareholders meeting on 1 December 2002 was produced by ENOC on 28 November 2002.</p>

They contended that the traders that the parties (i.e. ENOC and the President) would have had in mind were oil traders who would use the facilities, such as other oil companies. I do not accept that submission. Whilst it is true that other oil companies, such as Independent Petroleum Group (“IPG”) the Kuwaiti oil company, were interested in investing and did, indeed, invest, it is clear that, as I have found, ENOC was aware that Mr Boreh wanted to invest and was encouraged by that. His business interests by now extended beyond cigarette trading, including his substantial investment in DDP, and he would have been seen as exactly the sort of dynamic local businessman who had the ear of the President and could make things happen whom ENOC would have wanted as an investment partner. Since, as I have also found, by this stage the President was well aware that Mr Boreh intended to invest in Horizon, it seems to me that both ENOC and the President had in mind that the <span style="font-style:italic">“other traders”</span> would include Mr Boreh. </p>

I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that it is contrived, appearing to be designed to blame Mr Boreh for the President’s own decision that the Republic should only take a 10% shareholding and to suggest that he wanted more shares. No doubt now that the Horizon terminal has proved extremely profitable, the Republic wishes that it had taken a 40% shareholding but that is not what the President wanted or what he said he wanted at the time in 2002 or 2003.  The only record of the President ever telling anyone contemporaneously what shareholding the Republic wanted is the 10-15% he referred to at the September 2002 meeting. In any event, the second sentence of this section of the President’s statement: <span style="font-style:italic">“He said that Djibouti did not have to make any additional investment”</span> is telling, since that suggests that Mr Boreh told the President that the Republic did not have to invest more than 10-15% equity, which then begs the question as to what the President means by <span style="font-style:italic">“the best”. </span> Does he in fact mean the biggest shareholding or the safest as Mr Kendrick QC put it? Since the President did not come to be cross-examined about this, I do not consider that the Court should simply assume in the claimants’ favour that this passage in his evidence has anything to do with what he said at the meeting on 19 September 2002. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is also the question of the inherent probabilities. The claimants’ case is that Mr Boreh had formulated his fraudulent plan to take a secret shareholding in Horizon as early as July 2001, when the July 2001 MOU was signed. I have already dealt with the implausibility of that case when making my earlier findings in relation to the July 2001 MOU, but in summary, it makes no sense in circumstances where the alleged concealment has to be predicated on Mr Boreh thinking that the President would object to his having a shareholding in Horizon. However, there would be no reason for the President to have such an objection (let alone for Mr Boreh to think that he had) in circumstances where, as I have also found, the President was well aware of Mr Boreh’s investment in DDP and raised no objection to that. Given that Mr Boreh was not a government employee, there could have been no objection in principle to his private investment and no motive for concealing it. Indeed, given that the intention of Mr Boreh to invest in the terminal would have encouraged ENOC to invest itself, the President would surely have been pleased since this all helped to get the Doraleh oil terminal, which he regarded as so critical, constructed.    </p>

As Lord Falconer put it in cross-examination (albeit in the context of the meeting with the President and Mr Sultan in December 2002, to which I will return later, but the point would be equally applicable to the position at the time of the meeting in September 2002):   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On any view, telling different things to each of ENOC and the President would have been an incredibly high risk strategy, particularly in the event that (as happened in September 2002) they had a meeting at which he was not present. How could Mr Boreh ever have thought that ENOC would not tell the Government who its partners were? On this hypothesis, if the truth came out (as it almost certainly would) and they discovered he had told each of them something different, he would be in serious trouble. Furthermore, why would he take such an incredible risk?  As I have already said, this whole case is predicated upon the President objecting to Mr Boreh’s investment in Horizon if he learnt about it. Quite apart from the fact that, as I have held, the President did know about Mr Boreh’s proposed investment in 2000 or early 2001 and raised no objection to it, even if he had not known about it, why would he have objected, given that he was already aware of and did not object to Mr Boreh’s substantial investment in DDP and the private investment by Mr Boreh in Horizon clearly encouraged ENOC to invest?   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, what is far more inherently probable is that the President opted for the 10-15% shareholding, not because of anything which Mr Boreh had told him, but because it made perfect sense to take only this symbolic shareholding for the Republic. It meant that ENOC would commit to building the much needed oil terminal without the Republic having to make any financial commitment. This would have been attractive to the Republic given that it was, as I have found, short of money.  </p>

Whilst it is correct that, as I have held, PAID had reserves, as at the end of 2002, those reserves would not have been sufficient to fund the entire Horizon project. Furthermore, PAID was an essential source of income for the Government, which borrowed against its future income from PAID, and also drew excessive advances on its future dividend stream, which then had to be compensated out of the reserves, thereby depleting the reserves. </p>

It is striking that, in neither of his witness statements does the President say that he would have used the PAID reserves to finance in part the purchase of an equity participation in Horizon. The closest he comes to it is in a passage in his second statement dealing with the Republic’s finances generally where he says: <span style="font-style:italic">“Furthermore, PAID had substantial cash reserves at this time which might have been used, and we had always been able to secure financing for infrastructure projects from the Arab Funds.”</span> This falls a long way short of establishing that he would ever have used PAID reserves to finance a larger shareholding than the 10-15% he intimated to ENOC at the meeting on 19 September 2002.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As at the end of 2002, the total PAID reserves were only U.S. $11.5 million and the estimated cost of constructing the terminal, (as opposed to the jetty and infrastructure), as set out in an annex to the notes of the meeting with the Arab Funds in February 2002, was U.S. $41 million. I consider it highly unlikely that the President would have wanted to deplete the reserves by taking a larger investment in the terminal than the one he intimated. The Republic had never been in the business of operating an oil terminal, as the old tank facilities in the city were owned and operated by the oil majors. In my judgment, the President, who knew full well at the time of the meeting in September 2002, that Mr Boreh was proposing to make a private investment in Horizon, never wanted the Republic to take any part of Mr Boreh’s investment, whether by use of the PAID reserves or otherwise. He was content to take the small symbolic share he intimated to ENOC, exactly as Mr Moussa described the shareholding: <span style="font-style:italic">“the 10% shareholding was symbolic, as the government needed to be represented to avoid attracting criticism from Shell, Total and Exxon Mobil.”</span></p>

The directors were Hussain Sultan and Yusr Sultan. The First Resolution of the Directors dated 2 October 2002 resolved to commence business and to issue 50,000 shares to ENOC. Thereafter,  there was to be what was described by Mr Jerome Gelineau of ENOC in an email to, amongst others, Mr Boreh, on 28 November 2002, as “the first shareholders’ meeting” of Djibouti Tank Terminal Limited (which became HDTL), to be held on 1 December 2002 in Dubai. As Mr Boreh said in his witness statement, this description was premature, since shareholder percentages had not yet been fixed. The email (which was also sent to IPG, but not separately to the Government) enclosed the agenda for the meeting. The claimants suggested that because the agenda was sent to Mr Boreh, but not to the Government, this demonstrated that ENOC regarded Mr Boreh as the representative of the Government. In my judgment, that overstates the position. All that sending the agenda to Mr Boreh, but not separately to the Government, demonstrates is that ENOC regarded Mr Boreh as a convenient conduit through which to pass on information to the Government, as indeed he was.  </p>

There was thus a tight and ambitious timetable with the terminal operational in just over eighteen months, which of course proved unrealistic, but demonstrates that there was a sense of urgency at the time. Although certain items were said to be for Boreh International, it is self-evident that many of these (such as item 3, delineation and valuation of land to be sold to the terminal company, item 7 the limit on the jetty royalty and item 8 the obtaining of necessary permits) could only be achieved by Mr Boreh consulting with the Government and ENOC must have known that this is what would happen. Equally, although item 2, the signing of the MOU between the Government and ENOC, was said to be for Boreh International, clearly what ENOC had in mind was that Mr Boreh would arrange the necessary meeting for signature. This is all a further indication that ENOC regarded Mr Boreh as a go-between with the Government, not that it thought he had authority to determine such matters for the Government. In any event, as I have held, he had no such authority; there was no wide oral mandate as alleged by the claimants.  </p>

It is evident from the reference to IPG taking 10% that ENOC had been in discussion with IPG and this figure had, at least provisionally, been agreed. Equally, the fact that the shareholding for Boreh International is stated to be 20% means there must have been some discussion between ENOC and Mr Boreh about this level of shareholding before the end of November 2002. It is extremely unlikely that ENOC would have arrived at this figure unilaterally.   </p>

I have already said at [250] above that I regard that latter criticism as unfair and equally, I consider the suggestion that his evidence was that he had no discussions about his shareholding with ENOC a complete mischaracterisation of his evidence.

If Mr Boreh was in Dubai, the discussion of the agenda would have been over the telephone.

After all, the President had had a meeting with ENOC on 19 September 2002, at which strategic and commercial matters had been discussed in detail, so the President was clearly interested and involved in the project. He would have wanted to know what was being discussed at the meeting, to see how it tied in with what he had discussed with ENOC in September and in order to brief Mr Boreh as to what he, the President, wanted to achieve and ensure that what Mr Boreh discussed or agreed at the meeting was in accordance with the President’s objectives. </p>

The idea that they could have discussed what was going to be raised at the meeting without it emerging that there was a written agenda is fanciful and, once the President knew there was an agenda, as I have said, it is inconceivable that he would have given Mr Boreh a Power of Attorney without seeing the agenda and discussing it with him.  </p>

The President does not say in his witness statement that he had a discussion with Mr Boreh about what was to be raised at the shareholders meeting but without having seen the agenda. He simply denies having seen the agenda and states blandly that he gave Mr Boreh the Power of Attorney. The impression he is no doubt seeking to create is that he left it all to Mr Boreh, but that is implausible. Given the extent to which the President was involved with the detail at the meeting in September 2002, if he was going to delegate power to Mr Boreh, he would surely have wanted to know what was going to be discussed. </p>

The first is that, if Mr Boreh was in Dubai when the agenda was sent to him and the Power of Attorney was signed by the President, the emails or faxes by which Mr Boreh sent the agenda to his staff in Djibouti and by which Mr Boreh received the Power of Attorney from the President’s Office, are examples of documents which have been mislaid and which are not available after such an extensive period of time. There are plenty of other examples of documents missing from the chronological sequence. The other possibility, which may be more likely, is that Mr Boreh is either mistaken in his recollection (which was not in any sense firm) that he was in Dubai when he received the agenda, rather than Djibouti, or that, whether in Dubai when he received it, either way he took it to the President’s Office and their discussion was face to face, followed by the President giving him the Power of Attorney.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, whatever the explanation for why there is no written communication from Mr Boreh to his staff enclosing the agenda or from the President’s Office to either Mr Boreh or Mr Sultan enclosing the Power of Attorney, I am quite satisfied that the President did see the agenda and discuss it with Mr Boreh, prior to signing the Power of Attorney. Once that conclusion is reached, it must inevitably follow that the President saw that Mr Boreh was taking a 20% shareholding. Either he did not discuss it further with Mr Boreh because he did not need to as it accorded with what he knew already, that Mr Boreh was going to make a substantial personal investment, or they had a discussion and the President agreed to Mr Boreh taking that level of shareholding. Either way, the President knew about the 20% shareholding when he saw the agenda and before he gave Mr Boreh the Power of Attorney and did not object to it. As Mr Kendrick QC rightly submits, at the time, the interests of Mr Boreh as a private investor and the Republic as a public investor were aligned. The President had decided that he wanted no more than 10-15%  for the Republic and it is striking that his reaction to seeing what shareholding Mr Boreh was taking was not to ask for a larger shareholding for the Republic, as is contended for now, many years later. The proper inference to be drawn and I draw it, is that, at the time, the President was quite happy for Mr Boreh to invest, since the involvement of a dynamic local businessman in the project would undoubtedly encourage ENOC to proceed with the project, as indeed it seems to have done.  </p>

I rather doubt whether he gave the President the draft minutes, but it seems to me highly likely that he did give the President a full debriefing about the meeting. The claimants challenge the suggestion that there was a full debriefing, pointing out that no mention was made of this in Mr Boreh’s pleaded case. Of course there is force in this point, but since there was no mention in the pleadings at all of his attending the shareholders meeting on 1 December 2002 with a Power of Attorney to represent the Government, and yet he undoubtedly did attend that meeting in that capacity, I prefer to consider the inherent probabilities rather than place too much emphasis on what was or was not pleaded. It is true that there have been changes in his pleaded case, but the same is equally true of the claimants’ pleaded case.  </p>

Even if he did not ask to see the minutes, he would have wanted to have a full discussion about the meeting with Mr Boreh.  The President’s attempt in his witness statement to give the impression that he had no involvement in any of the discussions leading up to the signature of the two MOUs is not credible. I find that Mr Boreh did go to Djibouti after the shareholders meeting to discuss in detail with the President what had been discussed at the meeting. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s evidence was that they discussed the cost of the project and the Republic’s cost exposure, which the President was not happy about. If all went well the project was estimated to cost U.S. $25 million and only 30% of that would have to come from the shareholders’ equity, but if finance was not found or if the project cost more than U.S. $ 25 million, a 15% share might expose the Republic to calls of U.S. $3.75 million. Lord Falconer made the perfectly valid point that, if finance had not been obtained by ENOC the project would not have gone ahead, but that is not a certainty and, as a matter of common sense in a venture of this kind, the larger the shareholding, the larger the exposure to cash calls.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, the estimate of U.S. $25 million as the cost of construction might well prove an underestimate (as indeed it did). I suspect that, if the President had attended Court to be cross-examined, he would have had to accept that the U.S. $25 million estimate was somewhat optimistic, given that a figure of U.S. $41 million as the cost of construction of the terminal had been given to the Arab Funds earlier in the year. That may explain why he was worried about cost exposure. Of course, the Government might theoretically have obtained finance to cover that exposure, but it had no experience of doing so. As Mr Boreh said: <span style="font-style:italic">“…we did not have finance and the Government was not ready to go and borrow money from outside banks and they have never done it before, they only deal with institutional financiers.” </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A 10% shareholding would lead to exposure of U.S. $2.5 million on the U.S. $25 million estimate which, on the figures for the value of the land discussed at the shareholders’ meeting, would exceed the value of the land which it was intended would be the Republic’s contribution to the equity.  However, Mr Boreh’s evidence was that, since the shareholders had thought that the price of U.S. $ 8-10 per square metre was a good deal, he believed that the price could be pushed up, so that the value of 200 hectares (200,000 square metres) would cover the U.S. $2.5 million exposure. He recommended to the President that they should seek a higher price.  Given that a higher price of U.S. $12 per square metre had been agreed by the time that the MOUs were signed on 21 December 2002 and the impetus for a price increase in all probability came from the Republic rather than ENOC, I see no reason not to accept that evidence.  </p>

Again, it seems to me that it is overwhelmingly likely that it was the President who made that decision. Given that Mr Moussa signed the second MOU on 21 December 2002, which referred to the Republic’s shareholding as 10%, it seems to me inconceivable that, as Minister of Presidential Affairs, he would have signed that MOU without checking with the President first that 10% rather than 15% or some other figure was the amount of the shareholding that the President wanted for the Republic. I will return to the signature of the MOUs a little later, but in the present context simply find that the signature of that MOU with the 10% figure in it is compelling evidence that it was the President who decided on 10% and that he was content with that. </p>

Mr Boreh denied this, saying: <span style="font-style:italic">“I did not say to the President the way you are putting it.  The President have decided himself, and this happened after this meeting, when the delegation came to Djibouti, he sat with them face-to-face and he made his own decisions.” </span>In their closing submissions, the claimants described this as Mr Boreh being unable to respond with a straight answer to a straightforward question. I regard that criticism as extremely unfair. My recollection is that Mr Boreh was understandably somewhat bemused by the repeated suggestion that he had said this to the President. I consider that his reference to not having said something to the President: <span style="font-style:italic">“the way you are putting it”</span> was making the point that, whilst they had had a discussion about the size of the Republic’s shareholding, he had never told the President that 10% was the most that would be available for the Republic.

As I have found and as the note of the 19 September 2002 meeting records, the President had already decided that the range of any shareholding the Republic would take was 10-15% and had told ENOC that at the meeting, uninfluenced by anything Mr Boreh had said. It is simply not credible that Mr Boreh would have sought to persuade the President that only 10% for the Republic was on offer, given that the 10-15% range had been discussed by the President in person with ENOC in September 2002 and ENOC representatives were about to come to Djibouti later in December 2002 and any reduction would need to be discussed with them.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, what happened in December 2002 when Mr Boreh discussed the shareholders’ meeting with the President is that they discussed the options and the cost exposure and the President made up his own mind. He did so in the full knowledge that Mr Boreh would be taking a shareholding of 20% or 25%, and without any suggestion on his part that the Republic wanted some or all of that shareholding for itself. The claimants’ submission that, if only the President had known about Mr Boreh’s shareholding, he would have wanted it for the Republic (quite apart from the fact that the whole case is defeated by his actual knowledge of the shareholding), is simply not credible. It is, as Mr Kendrick QC submits, reverse engineering, an attempt to take advantage many years later of what has turned out to be an extremely successful venture, but which at the time was risky and speculative, so that the President only wanted a small symbolic shareholding.  </p>

That is no doubt mathematically correct, but it is looking at the matter with the benefit of hindsight. At the time the Horizon project was seen as risky and speculative and the Government had no experience of commercial investment. Hence the President was only ever interested in taking a symbolic shareholding which he decided should be 10%.  </p>

Mr Boreh’s evidence in cross-examination was that the company was acquired either just before or during the President’s first election campaign, as the President wanted Mr Boreh to look after his interests. The intention was to use Essense to hold investments which, if they were profitable, the President would buy from Mr Boreh when he retired. As Mr Kendrick QC submitted, the spur for acquiring a nominee company to give effect to this plan is likely to have been the imminent formation of DDP. The initial letter of intention for DDP was signed shortly after this on 5 December 1998. Mr Boreh’s evidence was that he involved Maitre Martinet, the Djiboutian lawyer who also acted for the President.  Contemporaneous documents in December 1998 demonstrate that the nominees of Essense sent Me Martinet the power of attorney for Mr Mehta (Mr Boreh’s employee) to sign on behalf of Essense to acquire shares in Port Invest. </p>

The claimants have not advanced any other reason, so it seems to me more probable than not that Mr Boreh kept it separate because it was, potentially, earmarked for the President. </p>

As I read his evidence as a whole, the suggestion that in this passage he was: <span style="font-style:italic">“confirming that he had not told the President about having an ownership interest in advance of 21 December 2002”</span> is a complete mischaracterisation of his evidence, which was clearly and consistently to the effect that the President had known that Mr Boreh was proposing to take a shareholding in Horizon from an early stage of discussions with ENOC in 2000 or 2001 and that the President was aware that the Boreh International shareholding was to be 20% or 25%, at the time that he decided to fix the Republic’s shareholding at 10% in December 2002.

The President quite properly and honestly decided to fix the Government shareholding at 10%, not 15% without there being any question of his having been misled into doing so because Mr Boreh told him only 10% was available.  There is no evidential basis for any suggestion by the claimants that the decision of the President that the Republic should only take 10% was improperly influenced by a desire that the other 5% should be taken for him by Mr Boreh into Essense, not least because the President’s own evidence is that he did not know about Essense at all. I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that the President’s subsequent pressure on Mr Boreh to acquire through Essense the 5% which the Republic did not want (and which might or might not find its way to the President at some stage in the future) does not give the claimants any rights against Mr Boreh in respect of that 5%.  In the circumstances, the difficult issue of whether, on the assumption there was a corrupt scheme between the two of them, in effect to steal the 5% shareholding from the Republic, the knowledge of the President should be attributed to the Republic, does not arise on the facts. </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC says, the contemporaneous evidence shows that the Republic owed substantial sums to Soprim for work on the Presidential Palace. A letter from Soprim to the Minister of Presidential Affairs on 14 August 2000 enclosed a bill for the renovation work. The work done was extensive and the amount outstanding was just over DJF 225,000,000 (about US$1.27 million).  The covering letter noted that no payment had been made since the start of the work in June 1999.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>On 29 December 2001, Mr Moussa sent a fax to Mr Boreh, acknowledging that the Government owed Soprim DJF 270,000,000 (just over $1.5 million) for renovation work to the Presidential Palace. The fax enclosed the formal “private contract by mutual agreement” dated 25 January 2001 for that renovation work to the Palace, signed by Mr Moussa and by the Finance Minister, Mr Bouh. The work carried out by Soprim did not stop there, but was continuing and, at the time that the off-set was made against the purchase price for the land later in 2003 (which I deal with below), nothing had been paid and the amount outstanding was in excess of the amount off-set. </p>

Initially in cross-examination, Mr Bouh maintained that he had only known about that smaller invoice being outstanding, but when confronted later with the acknowledgment of the debt of DJF 270 million, he agreed that that was the amount due at the time.  </p>

As with the July 2001 MOU, it said nothing about shareholdings. The appendices included a map showing the land required for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project. The MOU itself proposed only the purchase of the land specified by points A to D on the map which corresponded to the Phase 1 land only. The definition of the land area in the MOU had been discussed earlier that day by Mr Gelineau and Mr James Small of the ENOC legal department, and they decided to leave it as drafted.  In the email accompanying the draft MOU, Mr Gelineau asked Mr Boreh for any comments, presumably on the basis that he would pass on any comments the Government had. In fact he said in evidence that he felt no need to do so. Since ENOC were coming to Djibouti soon, they could discuss it with the President in person. </p>

On that day Mr Small, who was in Dubai, sent an email to Mr Gelineau enclosing a French translation of the draft MOU which Mr Gelineau had sent to Mr Boreh. As a matter of common sense, the most likely explanation for having a French version was to discuss the draft with French speakers, who would include the President and any relevant ministers. </p>

The Defendant was able to persuade ENOC to pay $12 per square metre for the land. ENOC was also prepared to purchase more land for the purpose of future expansion. Once the debt due to the Boreh Group was deducted, the residual land value for the purpose of the First Claimant’s equity in the Horizon project was US$2.5 million which, given the value of the project, justified a maximum 10% equity interest.

There is some force in that point and it will be necessary, as I go through the rest of the chronology, to analyse the contemporaneous correspondence carefully, but ultimately I have to consider the inherent probabilities. If, as I have concluded (for reasons elaborated below), the second MOU (in which formal written agreement on these matters is set out) is genuine and was signed by Mr Moussa on behalf of the Republic, with the full knowledge and consent of the President, then the various matters must have been discussed and agreed in principle with the President by Mr Boreh and/or Mr Sultan at some stage during the visit of the delegation.  </p>

It is inconceivable that Mr Moussa as Minister for Presidential Affairs would have signed the second MOU on Mr Boreh’s say-so, which seems to be the claimants’ case, without consulting the President and satisfying himself that the President had agreed the matters covered by it. If those matters had not previously been discussed with and agreed by the President, it is pretty obvious that when Mr Moussa showed the second MOU to the President, he would have queried what it was all about and would not have permitted it to be signed.

Its structure very much follows that of the July 2001 MOU, save that what is proposed is that the land on which the terminal was to be built would be transferred to the new joint venture company (HDTL), with no rent being payable.

There is simply no evidential basis for the suggestion. Mr Moussa does not make this suggestion at any point in the interview in December 2012. There is no sensible basis for drawing an inference to that effect. Mr Moussa was a senior Government minister and official and it is inconceivable that he would simply have signed something because Mr Boreh told him to. As Mr Kendrick QC rightly submits, even on the extremely unlikely basis that Mr Boreh persuaded Mr Moussa to sign, by telling him that the President had agreed the MOU when, on this hypothesis, he had not, the risk of Mr Boreh being found out by the President was overwhelming.  I found Mr Boreh’s answer to a question from me on this point compelling:  </p>

I consider that the genesis of the second MOU is exactly as described by Mr Boreh. It dealt with those matters finally agreed between the President, Mr Sultan and Mr Boreh on the afternoon of 20 December 2002 and the President then instructed Mr Moussa to prepare and sign the second MOU. This also provides the answer to the suggestion by the claimants in their closing submissions that there is no proper explanation as to why two MOUs were signed on the same day. Quite apart from the fact that, given that the MOUs were signed by the Government representative, Mr Moussa, so that in a sense it is for the Republic, not Mr Boreh, to provide the explanation, the explanation becomes apparent. The second MOU dealt with certain matters only finally agreed on the day before and rather than rewrite the first MOU, a second MOU was prepared and signed.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lord Falconer also sought to suggest to Mr Boreh in cross-examination that the second MOU was nothing to do with the value of the land on which the terminal was to be built, but was an unrelated side agreement for a loan from ENOC to Mr Boreh in respect of the debt owed to Soprim. However, this point seems to be based on a misunderstanding on the part of Mr Gelineau in January 2003 as to what had been agreed, and Mr Boreh clarified with him at a meeting at the end of January 2003 (to which I return below) that he did not need a loan. Slightly later in cross-examination, Lord Falconer put that all the sale proceeds from sale of the land should have gone to the Republic, but that is inconsistent with what the second MOU says. The MOU is quite clear: of the U.S. $4,176,000 sale proceeds generated by sale of 348,000 square metres at U.S. $12 per square metre, U.S. $2.5 million would be applied towards the Republic’s 10% shareholding in Horizon. The balance of U.S. $1,676,000 was to be paid to Soprim in discharge of the Government’s debt on terms to be sorted out with HDTL. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that, once it is recognised that the second MOU is a valid and authorised document, its implications are devastating for the claimants’ case. In particular, it demolishes any suggestion that Mr Boreh secretly siphoned off the proceeds of sale of the land to cover the Soprim debt when they should have been put towards additional shares in Horizon for the Republic. As I have found, the second MOU reflected what had been agreed with the President on the afternoon of 20 December 2002 and Mr Moussa must have confirmed with the President prior to signing it that it accorded with what the President had agreed and that it was authorised. </p>

Of course, this cash call would not have told Mr Moussa, or for that matter the President, anything they did not know already. However, if it really had been the case that Mr Moussa did not already know that Mr Boreh was making a substantial private investment in Horizon or what the extent of that investment was, then that information would have jumped off the page at him. In circumstances where, on that hypothesis, he (and therefore the Government) did not already know that Mr Boreh was taking a shareholding or the extent of that shareholding, it is inconceivable that Mr Moussa would not have contacted the President. Indeed, it seems to me likely that, even if he did already know about the shareholding, he would have passed on the information to the President to check that he was aware of the extent of the shareholding.  </p>

The President would have complained to Mr Boreh, to put it at its lowest, and insisted on increasing the Government shareholding. None of that happened and no complaint was made about Mr Boreh’s shareholding until long after the President had fallen out with Mr Boreh in late 2008. The reason is not hard to discern: the President and the Government did know about the shareholding at the time and not only approved of it but were not interested in increasing the Government shareholding.

If that was what Mr Gelineau meant, Mr Boreh was unable to explain where he got it from. Since Mr Gelineau was not party to any discussions between the President and Mr Boreh, he may well have thought that, because 5% was being taken by Essense in circumstances where the President had previously indicated that the Republic might take up to 15%, Mr Boreh had persuaded the Republic to take less than that and only take 10%. However, whatever Mr Gelineau thought, what matters is the discussion Mr Boreh actually had with the President. After all, as will be seen in relation to the Soprim debt, Mr Gelineau was quite capable of getting the wrong end of the stick. As I have held, Mr Boreh did not persuade the President to reduce the Republic’s shareholding. Rather the decision to take only 10% was the President’s own decision. </p>

However, this completely overlooks the second MOU, which is not talking about a loan to Soprim, but about the liability of the Government to Soprim being discharged by HDTL. What the second MOU clearly contemplated was that in so far as the value of the land to be transferred to HDTL exceeded the U.S. $2.5 million value of  the Government’s 10% shareholding by U.S. $1,676,000, rather than that sum being paid to the Government, it would be paid to Soprim.

Much more likely is that Mr Gelineau had completely misunderstood what the second MOU required or that he was being deliberately obstructive (a point to which I return below).

Mr Gelineau indicated that the cash call would have to be paid and Mr Boreh said he was willing to do so. This part of his evidence was not challenged in cross-examination. After that meeting, on 2 February 2003, Mr Gelineau sent Mr Boreh an email stating: <span style="font-style:italic">“Following our meeting in Dubai last week, can you instruct your bank to send us 187,500 usd representing the first cash call from the shareholders of the company. 20% = 150,000 usd for BI, 5% = 37,500 usd for Essences Management.

The claimants submit that this is implausible, but what is striking is that no success fee was ever paid. Although the claimants seek to keep alive the possibility that it was paid as part of the consultancy fees, those only came some four years later and there is no evidential basis for any suggestion that Mr Boreh was ever paid a success fee by ENOC, which is no doubt one of the reasons why the claim in respect of the Horizon success fee has been abandoned. Furthermore, in their letter of 7 July 2015, ENOC’s solicitors, Baker Botts (UK) LLP, confirmed that the discussion about the success fee in February 2003 was abandoned and no fee was paid.   </p>

The fact that he did not is consistent with his evidence that he was not interested in the idea of a success fee. On balance I consider it more likely that there had been no previous discussion, but even if there had been, it is clear that Mr Boreh thought better of receiving a success fee, so that the scope for any criticism of him on this score by the claimants is limited.  </p>

He put forward three possible solutions to the contradiction, the details of which do not matter for the present. </p>

One paragraph read: <span style="font-style:italic">“It seems, from the MOU, that the land will be sold to D.T. Terminal SAZF for a formal price of 1 USD but under the conditions that D.T. Limited Bahamas have invested 22 500 000 USD and that D.T.T SAZF reimburse SOPRIM 1 676 000 USD, in a certain delay. If correct please confirm the delay and we can· prepare a sale agreement with such suspensive conditions. When the conditions will have been performed, the land automatically will be owned by SAZF.”</span> Lord Falconer cross-examined Mr Boreh on the basis that Me Martinet thought that Soprim was going to receive a loan from HDTL. I am not sure that can be right and the fact that Mr Small refers to a “loan” in inverted commas suggests that he was aware that this was not in truth a loan.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I pointed out at this stage of the cross-examination, what was required cannot have been a loan, as the second MOU contemplated reimbursement of Soprim from the sale proceeds of a debt owed by the Government not a loan to Soprim. In other words, as I said at the time, the obligation is pointing the other way and the reference to a loan is very confused. Lord Falconer said he completely agreed with that. Given that agreement, it is somewhat surprising that the claimants appear to be trying to cling on to this point about there being a loan to Soprim in their written closing submissions. The short answer is that the agreement reflected in the second MOU was never one for a loan and references by Mr Gelineau and Mr Small to a loan are a complete misconception. At least so far as Mr Gelineau is concerned, there is a real question mark as to whether this misconception was genuine, since subsequent internal ENOC correspondence referred to below, demonstrates that Mr Gelineau wanted to stall on the sale of the land and on settlement of the Soprim debt, which he clearly understood did involve a debt owed to Soprim rather than some loan to Soprim.</p>

In crossexamination, Mr Boreh was insistent that he had not asked to be appointed.  He thought that maybe Mr Sultan had asked the President to appoint him because the Dubai interests were not happy with the incumbent, Mr Bahdon, and Mr Boreh was someone they felt they could deal with. At the end of the day, it may not matter much, but on balance it seems to me more likely that the Dubai interests asked the President to appoint Mr Boreh than that he asked himself.  </p>

That purpose of his appointment was reflected in one of the roles that he fulfilled, as described by Ms Ali in her 17 August 2008 note to the Secretary General for Presidential Affairs: “<span style="font-style:italic">the Chairman of the Board of Directors in his current position has separate powers outside the Board: the power to negotiate with Dubai's partners and the power to act as a spokesperson and gobetween.</span>” This was a power which Mr Boreh exercised when instructed by the President, under his control, outside any Decree. A relevant example of the exercise of this power derived from the President is when he charged the DPFZA with negotiating the DCT concession with DP World, to which I will turn later in the judgment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The other principal functions of the DPFZA were twofold. First it administered the Free Zone, the model being Jebel Ali, whereby the President tried to avoid ministerial interference, as described by Ms Ali in the passage in her 17 August 2008 note which I quoted at [373] above. Second, the DPFZA sat as the board of PAID, which did not have a functioning board since the ministers who had been on the board were no longer permitted to sit, once the Port was under the management of DP World pursuant to the 2000 Concession Agreement. However, that Agreement required the approval of the budget of PAID, so that the DPFZA sat as the board of PAID to approve the budget. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In practice, this was all under the control of the President, both before and after the DPFZA took over as the board of PAID. As Mr De Jong, the General Manager of the Port appointed by DP World said in an email to Mr Fewer in October 2003 when the board of the DPFZA was set up: <span style="font-style:italic">“From my GM position, l fear little will change as all the hot issues that remain without a solution have gone from me to Aden to the president in the past anyway, without the transport minister.

These do not include any duty to negotiate the agreement with ENOC for the Horizon oil terminal which is not mentioned at all, an extraordinary omission if Mr Boreh was supposed to be representing the Republic in those negotiations. The second difficulty is that, since the agreement that Mr Boreh would take a shareholding was made in December 2002, before he was appointed the President of the DPFZA, taking the shareholding cannot have been a breach of any duty he owed as a consequence of that appointment. </p>

It will be necessary to examine the sequence of events carefully to establish if there is any force in these allegations. However, as I have already held, the fact that Mr Boreh was taking a 25% shareholding (including the 5% through Essense) was known to the President months before Mr Boreh was appointed by him as President of the Board of the DPFZA. The fact that the debt owed by the Government to Soprim was going to be repaid through U.S. $1,676,000 of what was to be paid for the sale of the land was set out in the second MOU, which as I have also held, was signed by Mr Moussa with the authorisation and knowledge of the </p>

The claimants are highly critical of that evidence in their written closing submissions, suggesting that this is implausible. However, the tone of Mr Heath’s letter of 25 October 2003 suggests that JAFZA was raising the issue of non-payment for the land of its own volition, as the body responsible for managing the area where the terminal was to be built. In any event, whether the demands in this letter were being raised by JAFZA of its own volition or at the behest of Mr Boreh, there is no reason to suppose that the demands were not genuine. I did not understand the claimants to be suggesting that this was not a genuine request by Mr Heath for payment of the sale price or of rent on behalf of the Government.  </p>

As with Mr Boreh’s intervention at the meeting with the Arab Funds in February 2002 being part of some plot to avoid the Funds enquiring too closely into the relationship between Mr Boreh and the Dubai interests, this would involve imbuing Mr Boreh with a Svengali like quality, whereby he was able to persuade the people with whom he did business to act in an unethical manner in order to assist him. This does not seem very likely and the obvious question is, why would Mr Boreh need to devise such a plan, given the clear terms of the second MOU? Furthermore, there is no pleaded case that DP World or ENOC were party to some conspiracy to deceive the Government at this point in time and there is no evidential basis for it.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There was a meeting of HDTL attended by Mr Hussain Sultan on 26 October 2003 in Dubai, to discuss outstanding issues such as the signature of the shareholders agreement and the purchase of the land. The agenda gave the target date for the latter as 29 October 2003, so that it was obviously regarded as urgent. There is manuscript notation on the agenda, although not in Mr Boreh’s handwriting. At the bottom of the document is written <span style="font-style:italic">“Chuck Heath”</span> although I doubt whether it is his handwriting, since there would seem to be no reason for him to be at the meeting. Against item 1: <span style="font-style:italic">“Payments of U.S.$4,176,000 for the land”</span> there are two notations. The first appears to read: <span style="font-style:italic">“$12 </span>[obviously a reference to the price per square metre] <span style="font-style:italic">to obtain a letter for correct value from JAFZA to execute payment” </span>with above that <span style="font-style:italic">“along with bank details and how money should be paid”. </span> This appears to be a reference to the fact that Mr Heath’s letter had set out the wrong price per square metre (U.S. $21 rather than U.S. $12). Despite Lord Falconer’s submission that U.S. $21 was the right price if you added in the rent of U.S. $9 per square metre referred to in Mr Heath’s letter, I consider that the notation demonstrates that those at the meeting thought Mr Heath had got it wrong, which given that the first MOU said no rent would be payable, he had. The notation also demonstrates that, assuming this was discussed at the meeting, those at the meeting thought that the demand for payment would be coming from JAFZA.  </p>

However, this makes no sense, since Mr Gelineau was not due to pay anything towards the purchase price and, in any event, his initials are JFG. It seems to me more likely that it says: <span style="font-style:italic">“IPG will pay” </span>i.e. the other shareholder.

Although there is no board resolution, there is a letter also dated 26 October 2003 from Mr Sultan on behalf of HDTL, authorising Mr Boreh to enter into a land sale/purchase agreement on behalf of HDTL with the Government and/or DPFZA for the price of U.S. $4,176,000.

In my judgment, this is taking the conspiracy theory to extremes. Given that the Government knew the land was being sold on the terms of the second MOU, it is difficult to see what questions Mr Boreh is supposed to have prevented Mr Bouh from asking. It is striking that the suggestion that he had procured the authorisation for that purpose or that he had prevented Mr Bouh from asking any questions at the formal meeting before the notary, were not matters which were put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination.   </p>

He spoke to the President who was concerned about losing money through that service charge and they agreed he should ask JAFZA for the money back. He then wrote to Mr Sharaf [managing director of DP World] asking for the money to be returned, and the money was returned.  </p>

First and foremost, given that the second MOU was authorised by the President, so that it had been agreed by the Government that the Soprim debt would be repaid from the sale proceeds in the amount of U.S. $1,676,000, it is difficult to see what Mr Boreh’s motive would have been in suggesting payment to JAFZA then payment back. There is also the fact that someone other than Mr Boreh made the manuscript notation on the agenda. On the basis that this was someone at HDTL (i.e. ENOC) that suggests that that person was suggesting the payment and repayment and that others at the meeting agreed. Unless they were parties to some nefarious plan with Mr Boreh (for which as I have said, there is no evidential basis) there must have been some genuine reason for the proposal. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me that what needs to be remembered is that, pursuant to the terms of the second MOU, U.S. $2,500,000 represented the value of the Government shareholding in HDTL, in return for which the Government was contributing the land. This represented the Government 10% share of the anticipated building costs of U.S. $25 million referred to in the MOU. Even if paid to the Government, it would have been required for payment of cash calls up to that amount of U.S. $2,500,000. The balance of U.S. $1,676,000 was to be paid by HDTL to Soprim in discharge of the Government’s debt. However, two matters arose in late October 2003. First, JAFZA made demand in Mr Heath’s letter on 25 October 2003 for immediate payment of the purchase price failing which only a 20 year lease would be available, so I can see that HDTL may well have thought full payment had to be made to JAFZA in the first instance. Second, ENOC/HDTL must have known at the time of that meeting that a further cash call was imminent. It was in fact made by Mr Iyer of ENOC on 4 November 2003. The amount due from the Government was U.S. $855,000. Of course this would be covered by the U.S. $2,500,000 which the Government was contributing by making the land available, but if the full purchase price was paid to JAFZA, then that amount at least would have to be paid back immediately to cover the cash call.  </p>

That this was a genuine arrangement on the part of ENOC/HDTL rather than some charade to assist Mr Boreh is borne out by the fact that, as contemplated by the other notation on the agenda, a letter for the correct price was sent by JAFZA on 3 November 2003.  </p>

During the course of doing so, she made some manuscript amendments, specifically (i) in Article 1 where she changed <span style="font-style:italic">“cet immeuble”</span> to <span style="font-style:italic">“ce terrain” </span>picking up that what was being sold was the land not a house; (ii) in Article 2 headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Protocol d’Accord” </span>(Memorandum of Understanding) where she changed the date of the MOU from 21 December 2003 to 2002; and (iii) in Article 4 the Price, where she changed: <span style="font-style:italic">“Lequel prix a ete paye”</span>  (has been paid) to <span style="font-style:italic">“sera paye” </span>(will be paid). She accepted that she must have had the MOU in front of her to make those changes (in the event the third one was not incorporated in the final sale agreement).

Ms Ali (a Djiboutian lawyer) confirmed this notarial practice in answer to me during cross-examination. Even if that were not so and Mr Bouh had not already been shown the MOU by the notary at the signing meeting, I consider that in reading through the sale contract and seeing the reference to an MOU, he would inevitably have asked to see the MOU and would have read it. </p>

Mr Kendrick QC put to Mr Bouh that it was a reference to the second MOU and it seems to me that must be right. As he says, the reference to an MOU containing <span style="font-style:italic">“article 1-2.1.5” </span>relating to an agreement relating to the sale of land does not make sense on a literal reading of either MOU. The first MOU contains articles numbered in that way, but neither the MOU itself nor specifically those articles deal with the sale of land. Article 1 deals with the setting up of the company and Articles 2.1.1 to 2.1.5 deal with obligations of HDTL in relation to matters such feasibility studies and funding. On the other hand, the second MOU does relate to the sale of the land but contains no numbering at all other than of Article 1. However, as Mr Kendrick QC submits, if one adds the numbers 2.1.1 to 2.1.5 to the currently unnumbered paragraphs in the second MOU which follow Article 1, it is precisely those paragraphs which deal with all the arrangements for the sale of the land.</p>

Mr Bouh accepted in cross-examination that the tick against the price in Article 4 demonstrated that one of his civil servants must have checked that the price was right. However, he or she can only have checked against some other document and this must have been the MOU referred to, unless there was some other government record which is not suggested. This is a further indication that it was the second MOU which contains the price which was produced and which was being referred to in the sale agreement.</p>

It follows that he must have appreciated that no actual monies would be received by the Government.</p>

The fact that he did not raise an issue demonstrates that none of this came as a surprise and the overwhelming likelihood as I see it, is that as Finance Minister, he already knew what the deal was in the second MOU, from discussions with the President or otherwise. </p>

Although Mr Bouh denied any personal knowledge, he accepted in cross-examination that one of his civil servants must have checked this. He said the state auditor would also have had responsibility to do so. The fact that there was never any outcry about the Government not receiving any sale proceeds at all, speaks volumes and demonstrates clearly that the second MOU was known about and approved by the Government. </p>

Even if I accepted (which I do not) that Mr Bouh did not know the extent of the shareholding, the President clearly knew that the 10% shareholding was valued at U.S. $2,500,000. After all, a critical part of the claimants’ case is that the value of the land actually sold would have enabled the Republic to take a much bigger shareholding, but Mr Boreh told the President that 10% was the best he could get. In those circumstances, on the claimants’ case the President must have been expecting to get the balance, U.S. $1,676,000, paid in cash. Even if Mr Bouh did not check what had become of the purchase price, he accepted that his staff and the state auditor would have done, in which case it would have quickly emerged that the government had not received its money. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Equally, even if the claimants’ version of events were correct and the Government was not expecting any cash, because it thought the shareholding was equivalent to the entire value of the land, there must still have been a check by the civil servants in the Ministry of Finance and the state auditor. The idea that the functionaries employed by the Government never checked up to satisfy themselves as to the disposition of over U.S. $4 million in sale proceeds beggars belief. That check would have revealed that Mr Boreh was retaining money against future cash calls. If this had not been authorised by the President, no doubt complaint would have been made. The fact that none was made is a strong indication that what Mr Boreh did was authorised.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is a further point which makes the Republic’s whole case that the Government did not know how the proceeds of sale were being used implausible. That is the position of Mr Moussa, who had signed the second MOU in December 2002 and who signed the shareholders’ agreement in September 2003. As I said during the course of the cross-examination of Mr Boreh on the basis that he had concealed the cash calls from Mr Moussa, it is a little surprising that Mr Moussa did not come back at some stage and ask where the U.S. $4,176,000 was. In their closing submissions, the claimants seek to counter that by saying that so far as the Government was concerned, the land was being exchanged for shares. Leaving to one side the President’s knowledge that the 10% shareholding was valued at U.S. $2,500,000 so that there was a surplus of U.S. $1,676,000, Mr Moussa was the person who had signed the second MOU which set all this out. If, as the claimants contend, that second MOU was not authorised, they cannot simply ignore the fact that he signed it and, on that hypothesis, one might have expected him to make enquiry as to the whereabouts at least of the U.S. $1,676,000.   </p>

The President gave me the instruction to make sure that the 2.5 million is paid and that you collect this money and you keep it for the future payments.  And I have informed the President, and I would not write such a letter, okay, without talking to the President clearly.  And what happened after that, my Lord, in the next six, seven months, the money was paid back on behalf of the Djibouti Government for their shares.” </span>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Again, I do not find that convincing. In my judgment, the inherent probabilities point to Mr Boreh’s explanation being the correct one. The President was interested in the success of the project and anxious to keep the whole Horizon project away from the interference of other ministers. In fact, at a shareholders meeting of HDHL in Dubai on 13 November 2003, at which it was stated that the project cost was now U.S. $58.4 million, Mr Gelineau hand delivered to Mr Boreh a copy of the 4 November 2003 status report containing the third cash call for Mr Boreh to give to Mr Moussa. Lord Falconer put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination that he had deliberately not passed on that cash call to Mr Moussa, so that the Government would not find out that he had been using the land sale proceeds to finance his own cash calls. Mr Boreh denied that, saying that if he was given something to pass on to Mr Moussa he would have done so.  I accept that evidence. It seems to me inherently improbable that he would take such a huge risk given that, at some stage it was likely that ENOC would find out that he had not passed on important documents.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, the position had now been reached where, with the project cost having more than doubled to nearly U.S. $60 million, the Republic’s 10% shareholding was likely to expose it to cash calls over and above the total value of the land in any event.  It is difficult to see what motive Mr Boreh would have had for not telling the President about the increased cost of the project. It was in no sense his fault that this increase had occurred. The claimants’ case that Mr Boreh deliberately kept everything secret from the President and the Government might have some force, if Mr Boreh had simply stolen the U.S. $1,383,000 or used it for some extraneous purpose, but he </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me that the likelihood is that Mr Boreh did give the status report to Mr Moussa, as requested by Mr Gelineau and that Mr Moussa reported to the President, following which there was a discussion between Mr Boreh and the President, as Mr Boreh said. The fact that Mr Boreh did not get back to Mr Iyer about the cash calls until 7 December 2003 suggests that he had been having discussions since the board meeting on 13 November 2003. It also seems to me more likely than not that Mr Boreh did discuss with the President the retention by Mr Boreh of the balance of the proceeds to be used for subsequent cash calls.  The President’s anxiety to avoid interference by ministers is likely to have included the Treasury and, if the monies were paid to the Treasury they might very well not have been available thereafter, given the propensity of the Government to use monies derived from the activities of the Port for other pressing commitments. The claimants suggest that it is unlikely that he President would have been prepared for Mr Boreh to keep the monies in an unsegregated account rather than for example with HDTL. The short answer is that Mr Boreh was his friend and he trusted him. Much better to have the money with Mr Boreh so that, if any cash call was contested, he would not pay it over, rather than leave it with the entity which was making the cash call and which might just appropriate the money required for a particular cash call. </p>

Although three sets of minutes were produced, there was only one meeting. In addition to the representatives of Shell, Total and Mobil, Mr Boreh was in attendance with representatives of ENOC, Mr Douale for PAID and Mr Hawker for DP World. Mr Boreh described the plans for the new terminal and said that ENOC was now ready to go ahead with the terminal. The three majors were invited to participate in the project as partners through a joint venture and as users of the terminal. If they did not wish to participate, they would be offered land at Doraleh to build their own facilities. </p>

None of them did so and a year passed before there were any further discussions. They apparently did not believe that the project would get off the ground. On 10 May 2004 Mr Boreh, as President of the DPFZA, wrote to Shell, giving it official notice that the existing oil terminal would be closed with effect from May 2005 for security and environmental reasons. Thereafter services would be provided </p>

He deprecates: “<span style="font-style:italic">the negative attitude of these three petroleum companies, which have not even bothered to negotiate with ENOC.  They seem to be expecting everything from us without having to make the least effort themselves.</span>” Representatives of DP World also met the oil majors on 27 May 2004 to discuss the practicalities of moving to Doraleh. Mr Hawker was critical of their attitude: <span style="font-style:italic">“it would appear that the three oil companies are emulating the typical Djibouti attitude.  It’s not up to me to ask any questions, it’s up to you to know what I need to know and then to tell me the answers to the questions I should have asked.” </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s evidence was that the oil majors were reluctant to invest in Horizon because of the political risk in Djibouti. In my judgment that assessment was entirely correct: all the country analyses identify this as a risky part of the world, which is one of the things that makes the commitment of the Dubai interests generally to investment in Djibouti and the success they have made of that investment, all the more remarkable. Mr Boreh also identified another major concern of the oil majors as the possibility that Assab in Eritrea might reopen to tanker traffic. As he said: <span style="font-style:italic">“Because if the Ethiopian market for one reason goes to Assab, then you end up with this infrastructure and you don't know what to do with it.  So it's a very risky business, that's why they were very reluctant.”</span> A related issue was that the oil majors had built their existing facilities many years ago and a new terminal might struggle to be competitive.</p>

By July 2004, Mobil had commenced litigation against the Government seeking to annul the notice requiring it to move from the existing facilities and the Government was contemplation litigation against Mobil to recover the costs of the clean-up of pollution. In the event, Mobil sold its Djibouti assets to Total and withdrew from the country.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Shell wanted compensation for leaving its existing facilities and was not interesting in taking a shareholding unless it was involved in the operation of the Horizon terminal, which is understandable but equally one can see why that would be unacceptable to ENOC.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Total was the most positive of the majors, possibly because of its position as the oil company of the former colonial power. Its existing tanks were the most modern and it proposed a basis of contribution which involved treating the existing tanks as a contribution in kind to any joint venture. It also wanted compensation for closure of its existing facility. Mr Boreh’s recollection was that it also wanted control of the venture. In the event, although, unlike the other majors, Total remained in Djibouti, it did so on the basis of taking a storage contract. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The overall picture which emerges is that, despite the best efforts of Mr Boreh and HDTL to persuade the oil majors to take shareholdings in the Horizon project, none of them had any real interest in that proposal and simply used it as leverage on the Government to seek to persuade it to provide compensation for loss of the existing facilities. The truth is, as Mr Kendrick QC submits, that the oil majors would rather wind up their operations in Djibouti than take a shareholding. None of this assists the claimants’ case that the reason why the majors did not invest was the reluctance of the existing investors to countenance outside investment. That case is unsustainable: the contemporaneous correspondence demonstrates that HDTL and Mr Boreh did everything they could to persuade the majors to invest. Their reasons for not doing so were those set out above, which had nothing to do with any alleged reluctance of the existing shareholders to allow further outside investment.</p>

That reluctance became more marked. Mr Gelineau visited Addis Ababa on 17 September 2003, to discuss the project. EPE asked if shares were available. Mr Gelineau said no, but the question would be raised at board level. It was raised at the board in October 2003 and rejected.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s evidence was that the Ethiopians were not really interested in taking shares in the terminal and had expressed no such interest at the governmental level. The claimants challenged that evidence in cross-examination. They refer in their closing submissions to an inter-governmental meeting in March 2003 which records:<span style="font-style:italic"> “The Ethiopian side raised the issue of oil storage tank construction around Dorale and showed its interest to know the status of the study in order to allocate budget for pre planning purposes.”</span>  The claimants submitted that the reference to needing to allocate a budget is only consistent with Ethiopia either becoming a partner or building its own facility. I am not sure I accept that. The context appears to be the amount of storage that would be available and I suspect the pre-planning and budget were to do with a potential long term storage contract. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It appears that there was a renewed request from EPE about shares in about May 2004. Mr Gelineau is recorded as saying that, in view of the nature of EPE and the benefits it could bring to the project, the shareholders had decided to put the issue on the agenda for the next board meeting in June 2004. The President seems to have been keen for EPE to become a shareholder and Mr Boreh had discussions on the subject with ENOC. On 18 May 2004, Mr Boreh sent the President a note of those discussions under cover of a fax saying: <span style="font-style:italic">“After discussions with ENOC</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">this is the best scenario that could be reached”. </span> The note referred to the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">“10% of the shares of the projects are parked with IPG (5%) and BI (5%)”</span>, once again informing the President that Boreh International had a shareholding, a point I return to below. The note indicated that HDTL/ENOC would be willing for EPE to become a shareholder but only on the basis that it enter into a long term storage and handling agreement for a minimum capacity of 75,000 m3 at 6.0 USD/m3/month with 12 throughputs included.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s evidence in cross-examination was that EPE wanted its own berth and its own land in Doraleh, which would of course provide Ethiopia with a corridor to the sea, but that made the Government of Djibouti nervous for strategic reasons. That is borne out by what Ambassador Ragsdale said in a cable in June 2004. I return below to the significance of what the U.S. Ambassador knew or was told about Mr Boreh’s investment in Horizon, but in relation to investment in the project, she reported:  </p>

Some place Boreh's holdings at 20 percent, with the rest of the 40 per cent share divided equally between the Government of Djibouti and President Ismail Omar Guelleh. In addition, at the May 1820 meeting in Djibouti of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Economic and Commercial Ministerial Working Group, Ethiopia requested land at Doraleh to invest in and build a petroleum depot to accept petroleum products in transit to Ethiopia. The Djiboutian side explained to the Ethiopians that, for security reasons, it preferred to place petroleum activities at Doraleh in the hands of ENOC. After much discussion of this issue, Djibouti rescinded and agreed to include Ethiopia in the project because of the two countries' "strategic partnership." It is unclear if Ethiopia will follow through on its request and also unclear as to which partner would provide the percentage to Ethiopia.”  </span>

It was still a condition of the offer that EPE should enter into a three year storage contract. The offer made required a response by the end of January 2005.  EPE rejected the offer and continued talks just for a storage contract. It appears that the rejection was based on “<span style="font-style:italic">the importance of the investment and the location being outside of Ethiopia</span>” but there may also have been concerns about the throughput price. Thus, ultimately, EPE, like the majors, decided not to invest in Horizon, as Mr Boreh correctly said in his second witness statement.  </p>

The Information Memorandum was sent out to a number of potential investors: Standard Bank, BNP Paribas, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Arab Petroleum Investment Corporation and Emirates Bank International. The Information Memorandum was sent to the shareholders including the Government (for the attention of Mr Moussa) under cover of a letter from Mr Gelineau as Chief Operating Officer of Horizon Terminals Limited dated 9 November 2003. There is no suggestion in the letter that Mr Gelineau sent it to Mr Moussa via Mr Boreh, nor was it suggested to Mr Boreh in cross-examination that he had kept it back from the Government.   </p>

Given the length of the Information Memorandum, the likelihood is that they wanted to send him that and the covering letter. Mr Mehta provided full details by return and, contrary to the suggestion by Lord Falconer in cross-examination of Mr Boreh that these contact details were never passed on to ENOC, I see no reason not to conclude that, in the ordinary course, ENOC was given the contact details. The suggestion that, having asked for the details and obtained them, Mr Wahdwani then did not pass them on, makes no sense at all.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One of the points made by Lord Falconer in cross-examination as to why the contact details were not passed on was that, at the meeting in Dubai on 13 November 2003 to which I referred at [446] above, Mr Gelineau had hand-delivered to Mr Boreh a copy of the updated status report of 4 November 2003 containing the third cash call for him to deliver to Mr Moussa. The suggestion was that this would not have been necessary if Mr Wahdwani had already passed on Mr Moussa’s contact details. It seems to me that that may be a false point because of the timing. The exchange between Mr Wahdwani and Mr Mehta where Mr Mehta gave all the contact details was on 11 November and even if they were passed on to whoever he was dealing with (and there is no reason to suppose it was Mr Gelineau) the following day, I do not regard Mr Gelineau giving Mr Boreh something to deliver to Mr Moussa as inconsistent with someone else at ENOC having been given his contact details the day before. The likelihood is that, if having asked Mr Wahdwani for his contact details, they had not been provided as Lord Falconer suggests, ENOC would have chased for the contact details and ultimately protested that they had not been provided. The absence of any chaser or protest points to the details having been provided. In the circumstances, I find that the Information Memorandum was provided to Mr Moussa.      </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I have already held, there was no question of Mr Boreh making off with the proceeds of the sale of the land. Rather, they were used to honour the cash calls due from the Government. After the proceeds were used to pay the third cash call due of U.S. $855,000 in December 2003, Mr Boreh subsequently paid cash calls 4, 5 and 6 on behalf of the Government in a total amount of U.S. $1,146,000 in April, July and October 2004. This was accepted by Lord Falconer in cross-examination, but he put to Mr Boreh that the emails containing the cash calls had not been sent by him to Mr Moussa and that this had been done deliberately, so that the Government would not find out that Mr Boreh had been using the proceeds of sale to pay his own cash calls.  At this point on the fourth day of his cross-examination Mr Boreh repeated his evidence that this had all been agreed with the President and became understandably agitated and bemused:  </p>

I feel it's not fair.  I have been through a lot, you know, and I'm tired of, you know, accusation after accusation after accusation.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In fact, as noted above in the context of the Information Memorandum, ENOC almost certainly had Mr Moussa’s contact details and there is no reason to suppose that it did not send copies of the cash call demands to him. The Republic has not produced any evidence that he did not receive the cash calls and the President’s contention in two sentences of his second witness statement (which I have already quoted above), that he was never informed about either the increase in project costs or the requirement for the Government to pay cash calls, is implausible in the extreme. In any event, the theory that Mr Boreh withheld the cash calls to conceal his own use of the sale proceeds to pay his calls makes little sense. The U.S. $1,383,000 would have been exhausted by the April 2004 payment, which was U.S. $1,616,000 in all (including the Government’s share) and in July 2004 and October 2004, the total amounts paid out by Mr Boreh (inclusive of the Government’s share) were U.S. $2,224,000 and U.S. $746,400 respectively, so that there is no question of Mr Boreh having used the proceeds of sale to fund those later cash calls. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants seek to make much in their written closing submissions of the request by HDTL’s auditors for confirmation of balances as at 31 December 2003 from Boreh International, Essense and the Government. These were emailed to Mr Boreh on 26 February 2004, with a request for assistance in obtaining the confirmation from the Government. The request for confirmation of balances from the Government treated the U.S. $855,000 cash call in November 2003 as: <span style="font-style:italic">“Long Term Loan to Horizon Djibouti Terminals Ltd SAZF USD 854,000, Share Capital USD 1,000”</span>.  The claimants suggest that Mr Boreh could not disclose this to the Government, because no-one there knew that the Government was being treated as having contributed U.S. $855,000 to cash calls or that Mr Boreh had taken the proceeds. Reliance is placed upon the fact that, on 25 May 2004, ENOC sent a follow up email to Boreh International saying that it had still not received the confirmation from the Government. </p>

The claimants asserted in their opening Skeleton Argument that, in effect, it was this conundrum about the confirmation being required, but Mr Boreh having to keep the fact that he had used the proceeds of sale to pay the cash calls, which led him to request the Power of Attorney which the President gave him in June 2004, referred to below. However, as Mr Kendrick QC points out, that is wrong: the confirmation he signed pursuant to the Power of Attorney was for the 2004 financial year produced in February 2005 and there is no evidence that he signed the 2003 confirmation.  </p>

The project was one in which the President took a close personal interest and it was delayed with cost overruns. This evidence involves what seems to me the absurd proposition that the Government knew about the delay and wrote complaining about it (as recorded in the minutes of the shareholders meeting in July 2005), but did not know about the overruns and hence about the Republic’s liability to pay cash calls. The absurdity of this position would, no doubt, have been put to the President if he had come to be cross-examined.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In their opening Skeleton Argument, the claimants made two points about these favourable terms. First, apparently in an effort to deal with the fact that ENOC treated the Republic and Essense on the same footing, they asserted that Mr Boreh must have lied to Mr Sultan about the Essense shareholding being for the President, but that, as Mr Kendrick QC says, is verging on the perverse and, in any event, the point was not put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination. Second, it is asserted that ENOC gave these loans on soft terms because it knew that Mr Boreh had not been authorised to deal with the land as he did, and was corruptly colluding with him to hide this from the Republic. This is a serious allegation which seeks to implicate ENOC, which is not a party to these proceedings. The point is unpleaded and, if it was to be made, it should have been pleaded and ENOC should have been informed that it was being suggested that it had acted in bad faith so that it could respond if it saw fit. This point too was not put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination. I have assumed that neither of these points is being pursued, since they do not seem to be referred to in the claimants’ written closing submissions.  However, if I am wrong about that, I consider both points wholly without merit and reject them. </p>

Mr Boreh describes in his witness statement how there was an opening ceremony attended by the President, who insisted that all his ministers attend as well. As appears from the press report of the opening ceremony, by this stage a storage contract had been entered into with the U.S. Navy. Ambassador Ragsdale was in attendance and the ceremony culminated in a reception on board the USS Vicksburg. There were other foreign diplomats present as well. Mr Boreh made a speech as Chairman of the DPFZA.  </p>

I was told that this sum was the maximum annual sum that ENOC could pay me. We expected the agreement to continue until I had been paid an amount equivalent to what I had spent on moving the graves and relocating residents, plus interest (which is why a further US$150,000 payment was made under the agreement the following year). This was an artificial way of doing things, because most of the expenses had been incurred earlier, and not at a precise rate of US$150,000 per year. However, ENOC wanted to draw up the agreement in this way, and provided that I received payment for my expenses, I did not greatly mind what form the agreement took.” </span>

The defence pleaded was that the payment was for genuine services rendered to HDTL and that, if the Consultancy Agreement had caused any loss, it was a loss suffered by HDTL alone, not by the Republic. Unsurprisingly, the claim in respect of the monies received by Mr Boreh under the Consultancy Agreement had been abandoned by the end of the trial.

I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the "sham" which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think, is clear in legal principle, morality and the authorities (see <span style="font-style:italic">Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co. v. Maclure</span> (1882) 21 Ch.

No unexpressed intentions of a "shammer" affect the rights of a party whom he deceived.” </p>

That seems to me to be saying that it was a genuine agreement, not a sham one. Furthermore, I would be most reluctant to conclude that ENOC had participated in a dishonest arrangement with Mr Boreh.

Mr Boreh’s point about artificiality in his witness statement is not an admission that the Agreement was a sham or not what it purported to be, but the much narrower point that the services he had performed could not be valued at precisely U.S. $150,000 a year, but that ENOC had wanted the Agreement framed this way.

The claimants sought to meet the point about the Agreement being openly discussed and agreed at the board meeting by saying that there is nothing in the minutes to suggest that the board was told the agreement was a sham. That argument is predicated upon the claimants’ case that the agreement was a sham or not what it purported to be, but I have already rejected that case. Also, given that the director present apart from the two Mr Sultans and Mr Boreh was Mr Wadeed of IPG, this argument necessarily involves the allegation that ENOC and Mr Boreh misled Mr Wadeed as to the true nature of the agreement. Quite apart from the inherent implausibility of that argument, since it is difficult to see what motive ENOC would have for doing that, this is another serious unpleaded allegation against ENOC of which it has had no notice.  Furthermore, as Mr Kendrick QC correctly points out, the existence of the Consultancy Agreement is openly referred to in the HDTL accounts, so that, if it was not genuine as the Republic suggests, it would seem that ENOC must have misled the accountants as well, all thoroughly implausible. </p>

When cross-examined about this, he said he could not remember whether he showed the President the minutes or whether he told him about it verbally. He said that the President knew that it was Mr Boreh who had arranged for the clearing of the land, which seems likely. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see that it would take the President by surprise that Mr Boreh was seeking reimbursement for the cost of doing so.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also striking that, although the claimants sought to make something of the fact that no Government representative is recorded as present at the board meeting, Mr Moussa had given a written authorisation on behalf of the President for Mr Abdourahman Abdillahi, described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the legal adviser to the President” </span>to attend the board meeting in Dubai on 3 June 2007. If he was intended to attend it would be surprising if he did not do so. Whether he did or not, a copy of the minutes of the meeting was disclosed by the claimants from his file. This demonstrates that he knew about the Consultancy Agreement and the likelihood is that he would have told the President about it, so that one way or another, the President knew about the Consultancy Agreement. However, whether the President knew about the Consultancy Agreement or not, I do not consider that it gives the Republic any legitimate basis for complaint against Mr Boreh or criticism of him.

I am also quite satisfied that in their discussions in December 2002, Mr Boreh told the President that he was taking 20% or 25% (depending on whether further investors were obtained) and the President asked Mr Boreh to take an additional 5% through Essense. Quite apart from the fact that I accept Mr Boreh’s evidence about this, the President has not come to be crossexamined about his knowledge and I would if necessary draw the adverse inference that at least one reason why he did not come is concern that his knowledge of Mr Boreh’s business interests, including his shareholding in Horizon, would be exposed.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Quite apart from Mr Boreh’s evidence about the President knowing about the shareholding, which I accept, there is documentary evidence that the President was told by Mr Boreh in 2004 about the shareholding. First, there is the fax dated 18 May 2004 referred to at [469] above enclosing the note of Mr Boreh’s discussion with ENOC about EPE which states that: “<span style="font-style:italic">10% of the shares of the [Horizon] projects are parked with IPG (5%) and BI (5%)</span>” As the defendants say in their written closing submissions, whilst this does not refer to the totality of Mr Boreh’s interest, it is consistent with Mr Boreh having been open with the President about his shareholding, and it would be unlikely that he would send a note referring to Boreh International having shares if he was trying to conceal the fact that he had a shareholding at all.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The President must have read that letter since he passed it to Mr Moussa for action, with an explanation of its contents. This is wholly inconsistent with Mr Boreh wanting to keep his interest in Horizon secret and with the President not already being well aware of the shareholding, since otherwise an alarm bell would have rung at this point. In their opening Skeleton, the claimants sought to address this point by suggesting that, following the meeting at which the US Ambassador discussed Mr Boreh’s shareholding with Mr Tani (referred to below), questions were being asked about Mr Boreh’s interest in Horizon and that, by December 2004, Mr Boreh was taking the risk of referring to it in passing, as a ‘double bluff,’ in the hope of creating a paper trail to suggest in future years that his interest had been disclosed. This suggestion is nonsensical. The overwhelming likelihood is that Mr Boreh referred to his investment in Horizon because he had always been open with the President about it. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another compelling reason for concluding that the President and the Government were well aware of Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon by 2004 at the latest is that Mr Moussa was clearly aware of the shareholding. The claimants have sought to downplay the significance of Mr Moussa, but he was the Minister of Presidential Affairs and a key adviser to the President, effectively his second in command as the defendants put it. He was the Government appointed director of HDTL. The evidence that he knew about Mr Boreh’s shareholding and interest in the proceeds of the sale of the land is overwhelming and, like the President, he has not come to give evidence to explain his role or to gainsay the conclusion to which the documents lead, that he was well aware of the shareholding and interest in the proceeds of sale from as early as December 2002. I consider that the claimants could have called Mr Moussa to give evidence had they wanted to. If necessary I would draw the adverse inference that they did not want to do so, because he would be forced in cross-examination about documents he received, to accept that he knew about Mr Boreh’s shareholding and the offset of the Soprim debt against the proceeds of the sale of the land.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">To begin with, Mr Moussa signed the second MOU on 21 December 2002 on behalf of the Government, which referred to the Soprim debt and entitlement to a share of the land proceeds. The suggestion that somehow Mr Boreh hoodwinked him into signing it is clearly nonsense. As I have found, it was signed on the instruction and with the knowledge of the President, following his meeting with Mr Hussain Sultan and Mr Boreh the previous day. Within a matter of days, on 7 January 2003, ENOC sent Mr Moussa a fax setting out the first cash call on all the shareholders, with Boreh International referred to as a paying party as well as the Government. If Mr Moussa had not previously known about the shareholding, he knew now and would surely have raised it with the President if he had any concern. The claimants clearly appreciate that this cash call presents them with difficulty, and in their opening Skeleton speculated that Mr Boreh may have told Mr Moussa there was a mistake.  This fanciful suggestion was not put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I have also found, Mr Moussa received the Information Memorandum sent out by ENOC to potential financiers in November 2003. That told him: (i) that the shareholdings of Mr Boreh’s companies were in HDHL; (ii) what the size of those shareholdings was and the effective holding in HDTL to which it corresponded and (iii) that, in the event that an additional investor came on board, the Boreh International shareholding would reduce by 5.56%.  If any of that was news to him, it seems to me inevitable that he would have raised it with the President. I have also found that, in all likelihood, Mr Boreh did provide Mr Moussa with the status update report dated 4 November 2003 containing the third cash call as requested by Mr Gelineau. That made clear what sums were required from all the shareholders including Boreh International and Essense. It is also likely that Mr Moussa discussed this with the President, following which Mr Boreh and the President had a discussion in which it was agreed that the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the land should be retained by Mr Boreh to pay cash calls.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Later in the story, on 5 February 2007, Mr Moussa attended a board meeting of HDTL as the representative of the Government, at which Mr Boreh was also present as the representative of Boreh International and Essense. It must have been perfectly obvious to Mr Moussa that Mr Boreh was a shareholder, even if he not already known it. There was no surprise expressed or suggestion that there was anything untoward. Again, as already noted above, for the next board meeting in June 2007, at which the Consultancy Agreement was approved, Mr Moussa on behalf of the President authorised Mr Abdillahi, legal adviser to the President to attend the meeting in his stead. It would be a little surprising if, having gone to the trouble of providing that written authorisation, Mr Abdillahi had not attended that meeting. Although it is fair to say that the minutes do not record his having been there, the minutes of the subsequent meeting on 25 February 2008 referred to below do not refer to his having been at  that meeting either, although it is pretty clear he was. If he was not there at the June 2007 meeting, given that he had been given the authorisation, there is all the more reason to suppose that he would have read the minutes of the meeting which have been disclosed by the claimants from his file and communicated their contents to Mr Moussa and the President.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A final piece of evidence in relation to Mr Moussa’s knowledge of Mr Boreh’s shareholding comes later, but casts important light on what his knowledge and that of the President was at an earlier time. At the subsequent board meeting of HDTL on 25 February 2008, there was consideration of dividend distribution for the first time. The amount proposed for immediate distribution was U.S. $443,000, so the Government share was a modest U.S. 44,300. The board was asked to approve the dividend policy. The minutes record Mr Boreh having said: <span style="font-style:italic">“the share of the dividend for the Government of Djibouti (GD) should be allotted to Boreh Int'l (BI) for the reason that BI has paid the share capital of the GD. He added that though there may not be a written agreement between the GD and BI, there is evidence of payment.”</span> Lord Falconer suggested in cross-examination that he was misrepresenting the position to the board, but his explanation, which I see no reason not to accept, was that he mistakenly thought at the time that he had overpaid, but was content for the matter to </p>

The minutes continue that NH [Mr Haider the finance director of HDTL] replied <span style="font-style:italic">“that a review of the loan agreements between shareholders and any relevant documents will be conducted for the purpose of dividend distribution.”</span> There is no reason to suppose there was not a review. Since this matter was raised openly by Mr Boreh at the meeting, there is no basis for the suggestion he was improperly seeking to take money due to the Government. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">According to Mr Moussa in his interview with Gibson Dunn, Mr Abdillahi was at the meeting and, when Mr Boreh asked for the Government dividends to be paid to him, Mr Abdillahi stopped the meeting and rang Mr Moussa to discuss it. Mr Moussa says he remembers Mr Abdillahi telling him that Mr Boreh’s point was based on: “<span style="font-style:italic">nonpayment by the national treasury of invoices Mr Boreh had raised.</span>” Mr Moussa then wrote a letter to Mr Haider on 6 March 2008 saying that the Government would not accept any reduction in its dividends. What is striking about this is that there was no protest by Mr Moussa or the Government at that point about Mr Boreh having a shareholding and no threat of legal action. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants sought to maintain the case that Mr Boreh had deliberately not forwarded documents to Mr Moussa, as part of their thesis that he sought to conceal the shareholding and his use of the land proceeds to pay cash calls. That was not in fact part of their pleaded case and, since Mr Moussa did not come to give evidence, there is no evidence to support it. Although the claimants are critical of Mr Boreh’s evidence about this in their closing submissions, in my judgment a fair assessment of what he was saying is that he had done his best to send all important documents to Mr Moussa. Furthermore, Mr Mehta provided Mr Gelineau with Mr Moussa’s fax details in January 2003 and there is simply no basis whatsoever for the suggestion that having gone to the trouble of obtaining Mr Moussa’s contact details from Mr Mehta, at ENOC’s request on 11 November 2003, Mr Wahdwani did not pass those details on to ENOC. I suspect there is a lot in Mr Boreh’s point that Mr Moussa had more pressing things to deal with than the Government’s share in Horizon, so that it was difficult to get him to concentrate on the detail of Horizon related matters.  This is reflected in what Me Martinet said in June 2004 and by Mr Boreh’s suggestion to the President that other ministries become involved.</p>

To begin with, there is evidence from Mr Dileita and Mr Tani that Djibouti is a country where everyone knows everyone else. As Mr Tani accepted in cross-examination: “<span style="font-style:italic">Djibouti is a country where everybody knows everybody, and also everybody is interested in other people’s business, particularly people who are close to the President.</span>” To the extent that those members of the Government and civil servants who gave evidence maintained the position in the witness box that they did not know about Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon, I do not accept that they were telling the truth. Rather, they were all intent on being consistent with the President, whom they dare not contradict and who of course maintains untruthfully in his witness statements that he did not know about the shareholding. </p>

A number of the cables from Ambassador Ragsdale show that she was well aware of Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon. Thus, in a cable on 17 May 2004, following notification to Mobil that the existing oil storage facilities were to be closed, she describes Mr Boreh as “<span style="font-style:italic">a prominent Djiboutian businessman with a 40 per cent stake in Doraleh port.

In their opening Skeleton, the claimants sought to explain this away as Mr Boreh being: “<span style="font-style:italic">unable to stop himself from bragging</span>” about his shares, but that involves the frankly ludicrous proposition that he boasted about it to the American Ambassador whilst, on the claimants’ case, seeking to conceal it from the President and the Government.

Unsurprisingly, it emerged that he was well aware of the shareholding. The Ambassador reports a discussion of the Doraleh project with Mr Tani. She says: <span style="font-style:italic">“Asked about Boreh’s share in the project, Tani responded ‘of course, Boreh has his personal interest in the port and owns some shares’.”</span> When he was asked about this in cross-examination, Mr Tani simply lied in a completely farcical manner: <span style="font-style:italic">“It's highly likely that by saying that it was to indicate that Mr Boreh, as a businessman, had in hand the subcontracting for the building of the oil terminal. I didn't have an official document or a legal document demonstrating that he was shareholder.  If I used that term, maybe it was erroneous, but there was an aspect of interest as a company that was dealing with subcontracting of the construction of the project.” </span>The discussion had nothing at all to do with Soprim carrying out the civil works, it was to do with Mr Boreh’s shareholding in Horizon. This piece of evidence seemed to me to typify the lengths to which the Republic’s witnesses would go in ensuring that they did not contradict the President. What the cable clearly demonstrates is that Mr Tani not only knew about the shareholding, but did not see it as in the slightest bit surprising or untoward.  </p>

However, I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that Mr Tani overplayed his hand on this: he asserted both that the publication is known by everyone in Djibouti to be unreliable and also that ordinary people did not read it.  Mr Tani was a former journalist and Director of the Government newspaper La Nation and he was Secretary General of Information between 1986 and 1999, with responsibility for publishing press communiques and liaising with the press and the public. Despite denying that he bothered to read Africa Intelligence because it was not accurate, I suspect that, with his background, he followed it closely. Whilst it was not always entirely accurate, it seemed to get the essential points right, as over Horizon. Given that it is one of the few publications to report Djiboutian politics and business in any depth, I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that it is inherently likely that it is widely read there. As he rightly points out, the journalists must have got their information about Mr Boreh’s shareholding from someone in Djibouti, belying the claimants’ suggestion that no-one knew about it or that Mr Boreh tried to keep it secret. </p>

Even when the President and the Government turned against Mr Boreh in the autumn of 2008 and litigation was commenced in Djibouti, it related to tax matters, not to the shareholding.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his oral closing submissions, Lord Falconer floated the suggestion that Mr Boreh might have put pressure on ENOC to allow him to take a large shareholding, in effect saying to ENOC: <span style="font-style:italic">“I am such an influential person in Djibouti that this deal will not go ahead unless you give me 30%”</span> which Lord Falconer submitted would amount to corruption, what he described as: <span style="font-style:italic">“pay to play”, </span>the implication being that this was not something Mr Boreh disclosed to the President. That is not a pleaded case, nor was it ever put to Mr Boreh in cross-examination. When I pointed this out to Lord Falconer, he submitted that it would still be open to the court to reach the conclusion on the facts that this was how Mr Boreh had procured such a large shareholding for himself. In my judgment, that submission is somewhat heterodox. It involves the proposition that where a party alleges fraud on a particular basis, which is denied, it is open to that party to invite the court to find fraud on the evidence, on a different, unpleaded basis. I am not prepared to proceed on that basis. However, in any event, I am entirely satisfied that Mr Boreh did not obtain the shareholding he did because of any such improper basis. He obtained it entirely properly for commercial reasons and ENOC was happy to have him as an investor because it held him in high regard, as evidenced, for example, by what was said in the Information Memorandum, quoted at [476] above.</p>

No objection was ever raised at the time. Furthermore, as I have found, there is no question of Mr Boreh having misled the President into believing that only 10% was available for the Republic. The decision to take only 10% was the President’s decision, uninfluenced by any representation by Mr Boreh. Equally, he did not seek to expropriate the Government’s land or the proceeds of sale. The set-off of the Soprim debt was agreed by the President, Mr Moussa and Mr Bouh and the retention of sale proceeds to pay cash calls was known to and agreed by the President. In the circumstances, there is no question of his being in breach of any private or public law duty owed to the claimants.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Doraleh Container Terminal (“DCT”) is the most technically advanced container terminal in Africa.  It was built at a cost of around US$400 million, and its facilities cover an area equivalent to about 50 football pitches.  Its quay is more than a kilometre long, with three berths; and it is built in deep water, where the 18 metre draught can accommodate the latest generation of container vessels.  The facility is computerised and has cutting-edge modern cranes.  Its current capacity is 1.6 million TEU. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The DCT is owned and operated by a joint venture company, Doraleh Container Terminals SA, in which PAID has a majority shareholding of 66.66% and DP World Djibouti (“DPWD”), a subsidiary of DP World, owns 33.33%.  Of the total construction cost of U.S. $400 million, the shareholders invested about US$130 million in the project.  PAID’s contribution came from the reserves of the old Port, which had accumulated under the successful management of the Port by DP World pursuant to the 2000 Concession Agreement, and through the transfer of its container equipment from the old container terminal.  DPW also contributed its share of the reserves from the old Port, plus about US$15 million of its own cash. The balance of some U.S. $260 million came from a syndicated bank loan arranged by DP World through Standard Chartered Bank and Dubai Islamic Bank. Somewhat extraordinarily, given the inherent risks in the project, that loan was obtained on non-recourse terms.  </p>

The DCT is integrated with the other schemes: it connects with the highway built for the Horizon Terminal, and with the container yard at DDP for further storage, and local customers have premises at the Free Zone on DDP’s land.

At the outset, however, as Mr Kendrick QC rightly submits, the project required a leap of faith. At the time when plans for constructing the DCT started to be progressed seriously in 2004, the Horizon oil terminal, which was the first stage of the transformation of Doraleh into a major new port complex, was still in the process of construction and the costs had spiralled. The DCT was on any view a speculative, high risk investment, which required a bold commitment from DP World.  </p>

The negotiations for that Agreement were conducted on behalf of the Republic by Mr Boreh in his capacity as President of the Board of Directors of the DPFZA, together with others, including Mr Douale and Ms Ali. In particular, Mr Boreh negotiated a majority shareholding in the DCT for PAID of 66.66%, recognised at the time not least by Ms Ali as a considerable achievement. There were a number of terms, primarily as regards control of the management of the terminal and absence of interference from the Government upon which DP World insisted. Those terms were controversial, so far as some of the President’s advisers were concerned, and before he approved the suite of interlocking Agreements and they were ratified by Parliament and by Decree, he was receiving advice from his legal and other advisers not to enter into Agreements on terms which effectively impugned the sovereignty of Djibouti in relation to a terminal operated in its territory. However, notwithstanding those objections, the President approved those Agreements and they were ratified.  </p>

That decision was no doubt made for sensible commercial reasons which have been fully vindicated by the fact that the DCT has proved very successful and profitable for the Republic. Within four years of the DCT becoming operational in December 2008, the original investment had been repaid. PAID’s combined dividends and royalties from DCT are more than US$46 million per year in relation to a terminal with a life of between thirty and fifty years.

I propose to make findings first about the negotiations for the DCT and the series of Agreements entered into in relation to it, then to make findings about the allegations made that Mr Boreh received bribes or the promise of bribes. Finally I will make findings about whether any of the terms now complained of are “soft terms” which were disadvantageous to the Republic and whether DP World would have been prepared to agree different terms. </p>

I spoke to the President about this and we were in agreement. DPI was looking for a long term concession to justify the commercial risks they were taking. Dubai was showing world class standards in developing ports, and it was prepared to invest heavily in Djibouti and put its reputation on the line for this ambitious project, when no one else would.

Their view was that they were going to invest a lot of money and they needed years to amortise their investment before they started giving Djibouti profits but we were asking for income from Day 1 regardless of whether they made profits. In the end, DPI gave in and agreed that the Government would get no less than the net profit it received from the old port for the Calendar Year 2004 (Clause 13).” </span>

There is a lack of any documentation relating to the negotiation of the 2004 Concession Agreement, but I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that it is clear that Mr Boreh stood up for the Republic’s interests, not only in insisting that the remuneration it received would be no less than the net profit from the old Port in 2004 (which in the event was U.S. $9.7 million, of which some 60-70% came from the container trade) but more favourable terms as to the rate at which and duration for which DP World’s investment would be repaid, together with much tighter relinquishment terms than DP World had been looking for. Clause 14.02 provided that the Republic would be entitled to renegotiate the terms if development of the new container terminal had not started by the end of 2005. This was a major improvement on what DP World had wanted, which was an eight year period during which renegotiation would be precluded. Given that the time frame of the end of 2005 which Mr Boreh had secured was not met, that provides the background for the further negotiation in 2006. In fact this clause 14.02 and the fact that it had not been complied with was expressly referred to in the meetings in Dubai on 14 and 15 February 2006, at which the principal terms of the 2006 Concession Agreement were negotiated. </p>

Given that between 60-70% of the profit of PAID came from the container trade, the minimum compensation that clause 13.0 would have secured on 2004 net profits of U.S. $9.7 million was around U.S. $6 million.

First, some of the terms of the 2006 Concession Agreement which are now alleged to have been procured by bribery had actually been agreed in the 2004 Concession Agreement, in particular the length of the concession, of up to fifty years and that DP World through DID would have complete management control over the project. Yet, there is no pleaded case that the 2004 Concession Agreement was procured by bribery. Notwithstanding the absence of any pleaded case, at one point towards the end of his cross-examination of Mr Boreh, Lord Falconer suggested that Mr Boreh had sold shares in DDP to DP World for U.S. $6 million: <span style="font-style:italic">“And in exchange for selling the shares to DPI for $6 million in DDP, you promised that you would do everything in your power to try to make the concession agreements between DP World and Djibouti as favourable as possible to DP World?”</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The reference to the sale of the shares was a reference to the claimants’ pleaded case (since abandoned) that the U.S. $6 million paid by JAFZA/DP World for the shares in DDP/Port Invest was a bribe or secret commission. Lord Falconer then put to Mr Boreh the letter of 17 April 2004 to him from Mr Sharaf which set out the terms upon which DP World was prepared to buy the shares in DDP for U.S. $6 million and which then continued: <span style="font-style:italic">“In addition to the above it is our understanding that both parties shall endeavour to change the terms of the current concession of the port of Djibouti to the satisfaction of DPI.”  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh refuted the suggestion that this was some indication that the quid pro quo for buying the shares was that he should assist DP World to change the terms of the Concession Agreement in their favour: <span style="font-style:italic">“I don't know what Mr Mohammed Sharaf was talking about. Here we are trying to sell him my shares, I bought it at 6 million, and I have sold it at 6 million.  What favour did [he do] for me that I have to do any favours for him? In fact, in 2004, in the board meeting, I have pressed DP World to reduce the 22.5% profit that they were making in the audit meeting.” </span> This was a reference to the fact that, in late 2004, Mr Boreh sought to renegotiate the 2000 Concession Agreement to reduce DP World’s profit share and increase the Government’s dividend.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As Mr Kendrick QC said in his opening Skeleton, put in its context, what Mr Sharaf said in the letter of 17 April 2004 was not an attempt to bribe Mr Boreh, but was asking for any renegotiation of terms to be done in good faith and to the reasonable satisfaction of DPW, so as to make the project more of a success. However, even if it was an attempt to bribe Mr Boreh, it failed since, as I have said, he was actually trying to reduce DP World’s profit from the 2000 Concession Agreement.  As Mr Kendrick QC pointed out, this issue came up again at the beginning of 2006. Again Mr Boreh would not approve the PAID budget because he felt that the Government’s dividend was too low and DP World was making too much profit from the Port, as set out in an email from Mr Hawker to Mr Raj of 31 January 2006:<span style="font-style:italic"> “PAID budget has been submitted to ARB but like last year’s budget he is not accepting. The stumbling block is once again the government’s dividend which he feels is too low and that Dubai is making too much profit from PAID.” </span>This tough stance was being taken by Mr Boreh a matter of days before he was negotiating the 2006 Concession Agreement with DP World on behalf of the Government, hardly consistent with his taking bribes to negotiate “soft” terms.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second aspect of the 2004 Concession Agreement which is of significance is that it envisaged a very different basis for the Government to profit than that eventually agreed in 2006. There was no idea of a joint venture or of the Government or PAID having a shareholding. The entire concession was to be owned by DID, which would pay rent at a level to be agreed. The Government would receive a royalty, but only on net profits and after DP World had been repaid. The deal which Mr Boreh negotiated in 2006 was far more favourable to the Republic and PAID. </p>

In his first statement he says no more than: <span style="font-style:italic">“Nobody ever showed me or discussed with me any so-called "concession agreement" signed by Mr. Boreh with DP World in 2004.” </span> In his second statement he denies discussing it with Mr Boreh or authorising him to sign it. Mr Douale also said in his witness statement that he was ignorant of the Agreement at the time though he recalled: <span style="font-style:italic">“discovering it later on”. </span> The implication of these witness statements was that this was some secret deal negotiated by Mr Boreh without authorisation.

The suggestion that the President was not told that such an Agreement was being negotiated, at the time that he signed the Decree setting aside the land on which the container terminal would be located, is frankly farcical. As Mr Kendrick QC pointed out, the Secretary-General of the Government sent out the Decree by fax on 9 February 2004, the day the Concession Agreement was signed, showing that the Government clearly linked the Decree to the Concession Agreement. As for Mr Douale only finding out about the agreement <span style="font-style:italic">“later on”, </span> the <span style="font-style:italic">“later on” </span> was on 17 February 2004, a week after it was signed, when Mr Bilkey of DP World told him about it and, when Mr Douale asked to see it, promised to forward a copy immediately.

The President was informed of the master plan, for example in a letter from Mr Douale of 18 April 2004, referring to a meeting he and Mr Boreh had had with DP World in Dubai on 10 April 2004, at which the master plan was discussed with the chosen consultant.

It confirmed the viability of the project, but indicated there were still significant risks. The forecast for local container traffic for Ethiopia was modest, so that the real profit would lie in transhipment. On that, competing ports were improving their infrastructure and because modern container ships were too large for the old container terminal, the business was going elsewhere. The plan said that without a new terminal, Djibouti would handle <span style="font-style:italic">“no more than minor volumes of relay traffic (mainly for very small ports around the Red Sea)</span>”. However, that new terminal would obviously face competition from other hub ports, not least Salalah in Oman where Maersk Sealand run the terminal. The assessment was that a number of major shipping lines might not be willing to use Djibouti. Mr Douale accepted in cross-examination that, at the time, there was uncertainty as to the volume of business which DCT would achieve. As the master plan said, the development of the terminal before any contractual commitment from the major shipping lines was: <span style="font-style:italic">“an inherently risky undertaking”.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In parallel with the completion of the master plan, DP World was preparing for upcoming negotiations of concession terms with the Republic. On 10 June 2005, an internal email from Mr Raj to Mr Sharaf set out the financial model for the DCT on various scenarios. The assumptions included a royalty of 5% and management fee of U.S. $2.4 million per annum payable to the Government, but did not apparently include any assumption that the Government would have a shareholding in the terminal company and therefore would receive dividends. Hence he makes the point that whilst the model looks acceptable for DP World, the problem would be meeting the expectations of the Government. He set out revenue and expense figures for PAID on the basis of the 2005 budget which showed the profit at the existing port for container activities of U.S. $16.8 million but a loss for non-container activities of U.S. $5.7 million, thus giving an overall profit of U.S. $11.1 million. </p>

I do not see Govt of Djibouti willing to lose its current earnings of USD 11.1 million in profit and start incurring a loss of USD 3 million per annum.”</span> As Mr Kendrick QC submitted in closing, that passage demonstrates that there was no intention on the part of DP World to deceive or take advantage of PAID in negotiations for a new container terminal.</p>

Ms Ali confirmed in cross-examination that she was making a constitutional law point. She also commented on the length of the proposed contract (30 years with 10 year extensions as in the 2004 concession agreement) as too long because a normal tenancy agreement would normally be for 20 years. She agreed in this cross-examination that this draft (like the 2004 Concession Agreement) does not contemplate the terminal being operated by a joint venture company in which the Government has a shareholding, which only came up in February 2006. </p>

Against a provision that all movable assets at the existing container terminal should be transferred to DP World free of cost, she has commented (in translation): <span style="font-style:italic">“NO, after evaluation of the market value of the equipment[s], it must constitute a contribution in kind of the participating shares for PAID [in the] BOT”</span>. She makes the same point in another note dated 2 January 2006 (after the meeting in Dubai referred to in the next paragraph) commenting on the draft Agreement. The claimants suggest that this demonstrates that she either did not understand the draft Agreement or thought that it would involve PAID having an equity stake. Ms Ali does not deal with this specific point in any of her evidence, and the claimants’ point is inconsistent with the evidence she did give referred to above that the draft Agreement does not contemplate PAID having a shareholding. </p>

No minute was prepared and Ms Ali had a very limited recollection of it. In her witness statement, she said that the discussion focused on matters such as royalties and the implications for Djibouti of a move of container operations to Doraleh in terms of lost revenue, which would be consistent with Mr Raj’s email in June 2005. It is probable that Mr Boreh made it clear, as he had done with the 2004 Concession Agreement, that it was imperative that the Republic did not lose money from the move and should have a minimum guaranteed return. There is no evidence that there was any discussion of a possible joint venture with the Government taking a shareholding. It follows that, even if Ms Ali had thought that PAID would have a shareholding as the consideration for making existing container equipment available as the claimants suggest, she kept that thought to herself and did not raise it at the meeting.  </p>

In advance of the meetings, DP World’s lawyers Economic Laws Practice produced a note of the issues for negotiation. It is striking that in that note the <span style="font-style:italic">“Structure of the Concession”</span> is described as: <span style="font-style:italic">“BOT v BOOT, BOOT preferred.”</span>  BOT stands for “Build, Operate, Transfer” and is a form of contract under which a private sector entity in the position of DP World builds a facility, operates it for a period of time and then transfers it to the Government. BOOT stands for “Build, Own, Operate and Transfer” and is a form of contract similar to BOT, except that during the period of operation, the private sector entity also owns the facility prior to its transfer to the Government for whatever price is agreed. These are both forms of Concession Agreement which do not envisage the Government having a shareholding at all, <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori </span>in the case of the preferred option, BOOT.  </p>

He says he advised that it would be better to have a partnership with a share of the profits than have a situation where they would not see money for years and had also lost complete control to DP World. He says the President agreed and wanted him to see if he could negotiate a 50% stake in the project for the Government, although he was willing to settle for less.

Mr Hawker said in cross-examination that this had been done informally since 2003-2004. As Mr Kendrick QC said in an intervention during the cross-examination of Mr Hawker, these reserves were earmarked for DCT, not Horizon. At a PAID board meeting on 20-23 September 2004, it was agreed: “<span style="font-style:italic">that 50% of the profit after tax would be kept in an investment reserve account to be used for investment in capital equipment and infrastructure in the port.</span>” Of course, it does not follow from the earmarking of those funds for the development of DCT that the Republic or PAID would necessarily take a shareholding in the terminal company. </p>

If the President already had it mind that the Republic should seek to obtain a large majority shareholding in the terminal company, once he read the memo, it would have been apparent that: (a) the draft concession agreement was not offering the Republic any shareholding at all and (b) his civil servants Mr Douale and Ms Ali had failed to spot this critical point in the comments they made. In those circumstances, one would have expected, at the very least, clear instructions to them and to Mr Boreh prior to the meeting with Mr Sharaf at the end of December 2005, that they should press in the negotiations for a large shareholding.

When Lord Falconer put to Mr Hawker that, if the PAID contractual reserves were earmarked for building the terminal, it must have been envisaged that PAID or the Government would have a substantial ownership stake in the terminal, Mr Hawker was unable to say, because he was never present at any relevant discussions about PAID or the Government having a stake. There is certainly no evidence, in the context of the accrual of the contractual reserves, of any discussion between DP World and PAID or the Republic about PAID/the Republic having an equity interest in the container terminal if built, let alone what size such an interest might be. </p>

Accordingly, in my judgment, the claimants’ thesis that DP World would always have been prepared to cede a substantial shareholding is not borne out by any contemporaneous evidence.</p>

As I said during cross-examination of Ms Ali, there is no documentary evidence of any further increase in the shareholding during the intervening three days.  It may well be that the note of the meeting is slightly inaccurate and that the 66.66/33.33% split was agreed at the meeting on 15 February 2006. Understandably, Ms Ali really had no recollection beyond the note of a meeting nearly ten years before she gave evidence. If there was some further movement in the shareholding between 15 and 18 February 2006, it was in favour of the Republic, inconsistent (as set out in more detail below) with Mr Boreh having been bribed by DP World.</p>

In view of the seriousness of the allegations now pursued in these proceedings, the failure to deal with any of those matters in the witness statements of the one man who could and did approve these agreements is frankly astonishing and inevitably casts doubt upon the <span style="font-style:italic">bona fides</span> of the claim. </p>

Having said that Mr Boreh was very keen on the deal going ahead, he then refers to being invited to Mr Boreh’s house and Mr Boreh asking him to help Mr Boreh convince the Government to go with the Dubai plan and saying that, if they signed a contract with Dubai, they could develop a container terminal and would both be so rich they would be satisfied for life. This is the paragraph which Mr Douale seemed incapable of recognising as completely inconsistent with his evidence, elsewhere in his statement, that he always believed that Mr Boreh was working for the good of Djibouti. His reaction when confronted with this inconsistency that something <span style="font-style:italic">“had gone off the rails”</span> speaks for itself.

In principle this was obviously a sensible idea, seeking to emulate the involvement of Maersk at Salalah. The point made by the Republic in its closing submissions is that, whereas the draft Agreement circulated on 18 February 2006 after the February 2006 meeting in Dubai, contemplated the issue of further equity shares, in which event both shareholders’ shareholdings would be diluted, the Joint Venture Agreement eventually signed on 22 May 2007 contained a buy-out clause, pursuant to which DP World could require the sale of up to 15% of PAID’s shares to a shipping company at any time during the period of the concession agreement.  </p>

In my judgment, this is a false point.  The preamble to the Joint Venture agreement stated: “<span style="font-style:italic">the Shareholders shall use their best endeavours to bona fide and diligently exercise their rights and fulfil their obligations under this agreement in their mutual best interests and those of the Company.</span>” It would not have been open to DP World to act in bad faith and change the capital structure in a way adverse to the Government, to “<span style="font-style:italic">dilute Djibouti down to nothing</span>” as the claimants suggested in their opening Skeleton Argument. Even if a shipping line had come in and taken 15%, PAID would still have had a majority shareholding of 51.66% and if a shipping line had taken correspondingly less, PAID’s shareholding would have been correspondingly higher.   </p>

Despite the written submissions now made by the Republic, it was not put to Mr Boreh in crossexamination that he had agreed terms as regards sale of a proportion of the PAID shareholding to a shipping company which were less advantageous than those proposed in February 2006, because he had been bribed and, in any event, I decline to make any such finding.  </p>

Of course these allegations made by the claimants will need to be considered slightly later in the judgment in relation to the Agreements eventually signed, which were approved by the President and ratified by Parliament and, at this stage, I am essentially concerned with the extent to which there is any force in the claimants’ suggestion that there was no negotiation of these terms in February 2006, but Mr Boreh simply agreed whatever DP World proposed.  </p>

It was submitted that Mr Boreh should have procured a much greater royalty of 40% given the profits made by the container business in the old port in 2005 of U.S. $16.85 million and the loss of tax revenues from container traffic because the DCT is essentially tax exempt. The Republic contended that Mr Boreh should have negotiated a much higher royalty which would have been of much greater value to the Republic than the notional dividend to be obtained from a venture which might take years to generate a profit (and thus a dividend for the shareholders). It was submitted that there was no contemporaneous record of the royalty having been negotiated and that the 5% which was agreed was in effect what DP World had been prepared to agree in June 2005, so that this was an example of supine inactivity by Mr Boreh, indicative of his having been bribed by DP World.   </p>

That appears to have remained its position immediately prior to the February 2006 meeting, since the agenda or “Issues for Negotiation” which was produced dated 14 February 2006 has the words <span style="font-style:italic">“throughput based revenues” </span>crossed out and replaced by <span style="font-style:italic">“net profit share” </span>so that the provision in relation to royalty read: <span style="font-style:italic">“Royalty Share on net profit share earned from Container Handling services -quantum of royalty and manner of payment?”</span> That agenda also contemplated not that the Republic would receive a minimum royalty figure (as eventually agreed) but that it would share the market risks with DP World, so that if the Ethiopian trade declined, the fixed fee and the royalty would reduce.  </p>

Lord Falconer is quite right to say that this interpretation was not put to Ms Ali in cross-examination, although given her inability to recall the meeting other than through the note, I doubt whether she could have cast any light on the point. However, whether that interpretation of the note is right or not, the fact that the draft agreement produced by Economic Laws Practice on 18 February 2006 a few days after the meeting contained in Article 11 the provision that the Republic should be paid a royalty of whichever was the greater of U.S. $6 million or 5% of gross revenue, is strongly suggestive that the royalty was discussed and negotiated at the meeting, as Mr Boreh said in evidence. Lord Falconer invited the Court to be sceptical of Mr Boreh’s evidence that he had fought for the royalty that was agreed and that he had negotiated it verbally, on the basis that he was unable to say what DP World’s starting point was on royalty. </p>

Mr Boreh’s inability to recall details after nearly ten years, in circumstances where the claimants’ allegations have only recently been made, was scarcely surprising and, whether he could remember or not, the starting point of DP World is pretty clear from the agenda for the meeting to which I have referred. Lord Falconer also relied upon the fact that Mr Hawker, who was at the February 2006 meeting, said in cross-examination that he was never present at any discussion of the royalty. However, whether Mr Hawker was present when any specific discussion took place, that there must have been some discussion and negotiation is apparent, as I have said, from the fact that Article 11 in the 18 February 2006 draft is more favourable to the Republic than the provision DP World had in mind in the agenda. Furthermore, at the end of his cross-examination, Mr Douale accepted that both the management fee payable to DP World and the royalty payable to the Republic had been negotiated and agreed at the February 2006 meeting in Dubai. In the circumstances, I see no reason not to conclude that it was Mr Boreh who pressed for and obtained the U.S. $6 million minimum royalty in the February negotiations.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is also borne out by two other pieces of evidence. First, Article 11 in the 18 February draft Concession Agreement erroneously stated that the U.S. $6 million was payable per month, not per annum. This error was evidently picked up by Ms Ali, when she read through the draft and was passed by her to Mr Raj, who passed it on to Economic Laws Practice the following day, 19 February 2006. This is a further indication that, as Mr Douale accepted when that document was put to him, there had been discussion and agreement of the royalty at the meeting. Second, in the report dated 21 March 2006 prepared by Ms Ali and sent to the President, a footnote to the reference to the amount of royalty payments states: <span style="font-style:italic">“Acquired during the Dubai negotiations, the proposal put forward by the Djibouti party consists of the following position: the Djibouti State must receive half the current total revenue from dividends plus taxes; the other half lost must be justified by the economic growth effort and must be recovered in other ways”</span>, a yet further indication that the royalty figures were discussed and agreed at the meeting.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the circumstances it is probably not necessary to determine the genesis of the U.S. $6 million minimum royalty. As I have already said at [561] above, Mr Boreh’s recollection was that it derived from clause 13.0 of the 2004 Concession Agreement, which reflected the concern of the President that the Government should not lose money from the move to Doraleh. However, when Mr Kendrick QC put this point to Mr Douale in cross-examination, he said that the figure was intended to compensate for the Republic’s loss of tax revenues from the container business at the old Port. Whoever is right about the reason for the U.S. $6 million minimum, it was clearly designed to cover the Republic and PAID for the loss of revenues from container business at the old Port.  </p>

If (as is now suggested) the Government had wanted a larger royalty figure, it could have suggested that to DP World, but there is nothing to suggest that those within the Government were not perfectly happy with what had been negotiated at the meeting.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, that the provision in relation to royalty represented a good deal overall for the claimants is demonstrated by the financial model spreadsheet used by DP World at the financial closing in 2009 which showed projected revenue for PAID in the first year that the DCT was operational of U.S $13.339 million, U.S. $6 million of which was the minimum amount of royalty and U.S. $7.339 million of which was cash flow from the 66.66% shareholding. Those projections showed the cash flow increasing year on year and the minimum royalty being paid until the 5% projected share exceeded U.S. $6 million from 2013 onwards.  On the basis that these projections were achieved (and my understanding is that in fact they have been exceeded) the combined effect of the U.S. $6 million minimum royalty and the 66.66% shareholding negotiated by Mr Boreh was far more advantageous to the claimants than the financial model being discussed internally by DP World in June 2005 where a 5% royalty without an equity share was predicted to generate about U.S. $2.6 million per annum which would not have compensated the claimants for the loss of U.S. $5.7 million on non-container activities at the old Port once container activities had moved out.  </p>

The claimants say that only Mr Boreh was involved in the negotiation of that Agreement, and that he agreed that management fee, because he had been bribed and thought he was going to gain personally, because of the 15% shareholding he was promised, from the profits made by DP World.   </p>

In the agenda or “issues for negotiation” document produced by DP World for the February 2006 meeting under the section headed “Concession Period” DP World simply said: <span style="font-style:italic">“30 + 10 + 10 option to continue to lie with the Concessionaire”. </span>It is tolerably clear that DP World was unlikely to shift on the length of the concession and at whose option any extension should be.

The claimants submit that the difference between his position in January 2004 and his position in February 2006 is that by the later date, he was expecting to become a shareholder in DCT (by way of bribe) and thus had a personal interest in the period of the concession being as long as possible.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Because the draft Concession Agreement upon which Mr Boreh was commenting in January 2004 has not survived, it is unclear whether the provision in relation to the term was the same in the 2004 Agreement as signed. However, whether it was or not, the 2004 Agreement as signed contained the provision for a thirty year term renewable for two further ten year terms, in materially identical terms to the provision in the draft Concession Agreement of 18 February 2006 produced after the February 2006 meeting.  It is clear that, whether Mr Sharaf took any account of Mr Boreh’s views about the length of the concession in January 2004, DP World’s consistent position was that it wanted the period to be 30 years with two 10 year extensions at its option and in my judgment, it would not have been prepared to shift from that position.  As I have already said, although the claimants now complain about the length of the concession, no-one acting for the Government appears to have regarded it as controversial at the time in February 2006. Furthermore, in any event, as I have found, Mr Boreh was not induced to agree the length of the concession at the meeting in February 2006 by any bribe or promise of a bribe. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The provision in the Agreements signed of which most complaint is made by the claimants is the provision about DP World having autonomy and complete control over management of the DCT with no interference from the Government and the socalled “reserved matters”, to which I will return in more detail later. The essential complaint is that it is completely anomalous that PAID should have a majority shareholding, but that the minority shareholder should have complete management control. However, it is absolutely plain that DP World was only prepared to embark on the DCT venture if it had complete management control, with no interference from the Djiboutian Government. That was its consistent position throughout in relation to its investment in Djibouti, in the 2000 Concession Agreement for the management of the old Port, in the 2004 Concession Agreement, in the draft Concession Agreement produced in about December 2005, in the discussions in February 2006 and in the suite of Agreements eventually signed in relation to the DCT. The President and his advisers were well aware of this and the commercial reasons for it. They may not have liked it and some of his advisers recommended insisting on a level of control for the Government, but ultimately the President made a commercial decision with his eyes open to approve and ratify those Agreements giving that level of control to DP World. For reasons I will develop later, the fact that he did so is fatal to the claimants’ case against Mr Boreh in relation to DCT.  </p>

It is quite clear that, even after DP World agreed at the February 2006 meeting that PAID was to have a majority shareholding, so that the structure of the concession changed from what was contemplated by the agenda, DP World still required full management control, without interference by the Government. As I have said, this had been its consistent position throughout.  </p>

It follows that, in the discussions in February 2006, all the main commercial terms of the deal eventually signed between the Republic/PAID and DP World (and certainly those matters of which complaint is now made by the claimants) had been agreed in principle in the discussions in February 2006, all at a time, as I have found, when there is no question of Mr Boreh having been bribed or promised a bribe.  </p>

It is striking that neither the report nor the marked up copy contained any adverse comment about clause 3.2, which would give management control to DP World.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Some ten days after the draft Concession Agreement was prepared, on 28 February 2006, Economic Laws Practice produced a first draft of the Joint Venture Agreement, which DP World emailed to Mr Boreh on 2 March 2006 <span style="font-style:italic">“for your perusal”. </span>This contained at clause 9 a provision as to the management of the container terminal operating company with twelve reserved matters, where, as the claimants point out, PAID’s director was not required to vote in accordance with the wishes of the DP World directors, so that PAID’s rights on the board were protected. The claimants make a point in their closing submissions that this draft agreement was discussed with DP World by Mr Boreh alone, the implication being that he was conducting some form of clandestine negotiations with the entity which was bribing him. Nothing could be further from the true position. Quite apart from the fact that there had yet to be any discussion about any shareholding for Mr Boreh in DCT, even if it was a bribe, which it was not, the President and the Government were well aware of DP World’s requirement for management control.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants also contrast that draft of the Joint Venture Agreement with the one eventually signed which contained thirty eight reserved matters, a considerable tightening up of complete management control. However, it is to be noted that the first draft of the Joint Venture Agreement included amongst the reserved matters the declaration or payment of a dividend, one of the matters of which particular complaint is now made by the claimants.  The claimants submit that it is unlikely that the increase in the number of reserved matters was required by the financiers of the project, but say that if they were, Mr Boreh is at fault for not insisting that these matters were only reserved until the finance was repaid. The only witness from DP World who cast any light on this was Mr Qureshi who said in cross-examination that the lenders had sought amendments to the terms of the Concession Agreement and Joint Venture Agreement and that it was the implicit understanding with the lenders that they expected DP World to take control of the DCT. The claimants are critical of this evidence in their written closing submissions, pointing out that this was not mentioned in his witness statement. However, since he was involved in the finalisation of the financing from early 2007 onwards, I see no reason not to accept his evidence. He was a perfectly straightforward witness.   </p>

What can be said with confidence, however, is that both the banks and MIGA, the political risks insurers, required the management of the DCT to be in the control of DP World, without the possibility of any interference from the Government. I suspect that the original clause 9 of the first draft of the Joint Venture Agreement which provided that the reserved matters were not to be carried out without the approval of both the DP World and Government directors or shareholders was exactly the sort of reservation of a degree of control with the Government that the banks would not have wanted.  Whilst it may not be possible to say which of the reserved matters was required by the banks and which by DP World itself, under the Common Terms Agreement dated 17 December 2007 with the banks, it was an event of default for there to be any change of control from that set out in the Joint Venture Agreement. It follows that it would have been an event of default under the financing arrangements for DP World to relinquish any of the reserved matters.  </p>

Ms Ali suggested in her witness statement that Mr Boreh had been bribed to concede this point in favour of DP World. However, in cross-examination it emerged that she was just the mouthpiece for the point on which she could give no evidence, she had: </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC pointed out, DP World conceded the point at the time and, in any event, the issue was always academic as Doraleh is very deep and not subject to silting. Dredging was not discussed further.  </p>

This was really Ms Ali’s area of expertise and, as the correspondence demonstrates, it was she who took the lead in procuring the necessary approval and ratification, not Mr Boreh. As Ms Ali said in the context of the control provisions: <span style="font-style:italic">“I was the only person to negotiate on these questions, and it was my opinion, that to grant such a -- to grant autonomy and control didn't mean that the other shareholders had to disappear totally, particularly if we're talking about the State, that is where I had a big question.”</span></p>

Then, on 29 April 2006, Ms Ali wrote to Mr Kruijning saying that subject to some outstanding points: “<span style="font-style:italic">the Government of the Republic of Djibouti is ready as of today to submit to the Parliament the Law or Act concerning the ratification of the concession agreement</span>” and that “<span style="font-style:italic">The office of the President is on its way of passing the law starting next week, Tuesday the 2</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of May 2006</span>”.

This is a success for the Djibouti side, which is happy about this and which is grateful to the Dubai partner, the Port manager, because it was this good management that today enables us to be given the financial means to take up this challenge.

In anticipation of that ceremony, on 29 October 2006, Ms Ali on behalf of the DPFZA sought from Mr Abdillahi, the Secretary General of the Government authority for Mr Boreh to sign the Concession Agreement on behalf of the Republic. The following day, 30 October 2006, the President signed a Power of Attorney for Mr Boreh to sign the Concession Agreement on behalf of the Republic. It seems extremely unlikely, given that the President and his advisers had by this stage had five months to scrutinise the terms of the Concession Agreement, that he would have granted that Power of Attorney unless he was satisfied that this Concession Agreement was in the best interests of the Republic.

As discussed during our various meetings in 2006, DPW is seeking to retain management control (including at the Board level) for the following reasons: (a) to ensure that the required funding is obtained for this Project in an efficient and optimum manner; (ii) to protect the revenue stream of both equity partners from the Project; (iii) to ensure that the Project is developed, operated and maintained in a fair and equitable manner, without any road blocks being created by the Government. It is also DPW's concern that decisions regarding the Project should not be adversely affected by any potential political conflicts in Djibouti. For all of the above reasons, we have drafted a rather large list of Reserved Matters and have also made a few minor changes to Ver 13.0 of the JV Agreement.

Indeed, we believe in DPWORLD management getting all the necessary margins to operate DCT in the most suitable manner for our common interests. However I must pursue the "reserved matters" further and I am obliged to point out that point (ss) is equally unacceptable from the Djibouti government's stand point as it reads reserved matter may be: ‘Any other matters required to be determined by or decided at the discretion of the Company under the Concession Agreement and all other Transaction Documents.’ Furthermore we would like to add the Notion of National Interest or general public interests that must also be preserved in the calling of a reserved matter. I suggest to be inserted in the general disposition, that under no circumstances the decision taken under the govern of the ‘Reserved Matters’ decisional process could not go against or cause any risk what so ever to the Djiboutian Government and the Nation's interest, as well as to its sovereignty. Consequently where a decision holds aspects that allude to the above-mentioned interests, DP World's administrator will come to term with the Government Administrator's position.

Even if such a suggestion had been put, there would have been no evidential basis for it.

His own evidence in his second witness statement was: <span style="font-style:italic">“several further agreements relating to the container terminal were entered into after the 2006 Concession Agreement – most notably the DCT JVA and the Management Agreement, which were signed in May and December 2007 respectively.  These agreements covered further practical issues which had not been addressed in the 2006 Concession Agreement. As the main commercial terms of the deal had been finalised and these agreements were largely about the legal details, I took a back seat and essentially left Ms Ali to finalise them.” </span> That evidence was not challenged in cross-examination and, in any event, it is borne out by the contemporaneous documentation I have been analysing, from which it is clear that it was Ms Ali, as a lawyer, who was involved most closely in discussions with DP World and, specifically, Mr Kruijning. Whilst Mr Boreh was present at some of the meetings, there is simply no basis for any suggestion that he was engaged in some continuing process of negotiation with DP World, in which he should have spoken out against the various provisions of which complaint is now made by the claimants.</p>

Although Ms Ali had suggested in her witness statement that Mr Boreh had been involved in obtaining the finance with DP World, she accepted in cross-examination that he had not been involved in negotiations with Standard Bank and the other banks. His only involvement was to sign the agreements which had been negotiated by DP World.  This is confirmed in his own evidence in his second witness statement, which I accept: <span style="font-style:italic">“I was not personally involved in negotiating the finance arrangements, which were handled by DP World, but my understanding at the time was that the banks agreed to loan the money on the basis that DP World would have management control. This was to be expected. DP World had a proven track record of operating ports efficiently and profitably, whereas Djibouti was a country with a very low investment rating, the Government of which was known for inefficiency, nepotism and corruption. The need to obtain financing meant that the project would not have gone ahead unless DP World was in control.” </span></p>

On 13 August 1998, the Chinese company ZPMC and Mr Boreh entered into an agency agreement under which he was to be paid 10% of the purchase price of two cranes, the purchase of which from ZPMC was being negotiated at meetings in China. The claimants contend that, on the same day, the Republic entered into a contract with ZPMC for the supply of the two cranes, so that Mr Boreh had done nothing to introduce ZPMC to the claimants or to negotiate the contract.   The claimants contend that during his visit to China as part of the relevant trade delegation, Mr Boreh gave the impression that he was a minister and persuaded ZPMC that, in order for there to be a binding agreement (there having previously been only a letter of intent), ZPMC would have to pay him “commission”, in other words that this was not a genuine agency agreement but bribery or corruption. Mr Boreh’s case is that he had visited ZPMC in China and negotiated a keen price for the purchase of the cranes, with soft loan terms, and that this was a genuine agency agreement.  </p>

In my judgment, this is a flimsy point, since the addressee of the letter is Mr Boreh as <span style="font-style:italic">“Vice President, International Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Djibouti”</span> which was in fact his role. That suggests that “minister” is being used as a courtesy title, not because he had held himself out as a minister. Furthermore, contrary to the claimants’ contention, there was no concluded agreement made in China, but only an agreement in principle which would require Presidential approval in Djibouti, the terms of which were improved thereafter so far as the Republic was concerned (particularly payment by instalments over some ten years) through further negotiation after the visit to China.  </p>

In the circumstances, even if that agreement were one in respect of which the claimants had a claim (which they do not), I would be reluctant to conclude that this was bribery or corruption, certainly in circumstances where ZPMC is not a party to the proceedings. Furthermore, it seems to me that the subsequent refusal of ZPMC to pay Mr Boreh commission on the later 2007 contracts, with which he and his company had had no involvement, even though they were still paying or had only recently stopped paying commission to him under the 1998 contract, is inconsistent with a corrupt relationship or with the commission under the 1998 contract being anything other than genuine commission. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh contends that, not long after the President came to power in April 1999, at a time when Mr Boreh had only received U.S. $224,000 in commission, he asked Mr Boreh to pay him upfront a sum equivalent to all the outstanding ZPMC commission, on the basis that his election expenses were heavy, and Mr Boreh would be recouped in time when ZPMC paid the later instalments of commission. Mr Boreh agreed to this and the sum of U.S. $1,271,393 representing the total outstanding commission less bank charges was paid by Boreh International to a personal account of the President at a Paris bank. That bank returned the money because of concern about such a large sum being paid to a serving head of state. The President then demanded payment in cash and on 20 October 1999, Boreh International transferred U.S. $2 million to Red Sea Central, another Boreh company, on 20 October 1999, to pay cash to the President. Mr Boreh produced a bank statement from Credit Agricole Indosuez showing the beneficiary of the transfer of U.S. $1,271,393 as “<span style="font-style:italic">Ismail Guelleh</span>”, the return of the same sum the same day and the transfer to Red Sea Central days later.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants seek to make much of the fact that Mr Boreh alleges he agreed to transfer money years before he was paid, that his oral evidence about all this was somewhat confused and that he could not identify when the cash was allegedly withdrawn and paid over to the President. These forensic points all had force, but they do not really answer the fact that Mr Boreh’s case as to what he was asked to transfer is borne out almost exactly by what was transferred to the President on 11 October 1999, the difference most likely being accounted for as bank charges. The remainder of his case on this issue is borne out by the bank statement and, despite Lord Falconer’s criticism, it is not surprising that he cannot identify exactly when cash was transferred to the President. What is also striking, despite the criticism, is that the President has provided no explanation whatsoever as to the reason for the transfer and re-transfer unless it was for the reason Mr Boreh gives. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The significance of this payment of commission to the President in 1999 is the light it casts on what happened when other contracts were made with ZPMC in May and November 2007, in which Mr Boreh was not involved and on which he was not expecting to receive commission. Mr Boreh’s case is that when the President learnt that two new contracts for cranes had been made with ZPMC, he refused to believe that Mr Boreh had not been paid commission and he and the First Lady accused Mr Boreh of <span style="font-style:italic">“eating”</span> the commission. Accordingly, Mr Boreh belatedly demanded commission on the contracts on the basis that he was ZPMC’s agent in Djibouti.

He sought to involve DP World, as he admitted in cross-examination.  Although the claimants suggested in their closing submissions that DP World then threatened ZPMC that “<span style="font-style:italic">if the matter is not resolved amicably, this will reflect on the delivery schedule of the </span>[cranes]”, this does not seem to me to be a threat, but simply a realistic recognition of the possible effect of any dispute.

As such we inform you that we will take whatever action required to secure our rights. These measures could turn out to be very embarrassing and expensive to parties”</span>.  Even if this was a threat, the obvious question is why on earth was Mr Boreh demanding payment of commission on contracts where he knew that none had been agreed and his companies had not been involved. It seems to me that the most likely explanation is the one he gave, that he was coming under increasing pressure from the President and the First Lady in late 2007 and 2008 to make payments to them. In any event, threat or not, ZPMC would not budge and refused his demands. I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that none of this is indicative of a corrupt relationship between Mr Boreh and ZPMC; quite the contrary. </p>

The claimants persist in their allegation that Mr Boreh procured that sub-contract through an abuse of his position, even though any claim in respect of the civil works has been abandoned. The circumstances were as follows. The original bids for the civil works contract received by ENOC in August 2003 were higher than expected and the various contractors, including Belleli, were invited to retender. The lowest revised bid came from Belleli and, on 14 October 2003, ENOC produced a detailed memorandum for the board of HDTL recommending that the contract be awarded to Belleli of whom ENOC had previous good experience. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Contrary to the claimants’ suggestion that this was engineered by Mr Boreh to procure a sub-contract from Belleli, it seems to me to be raising a genuine concern as to the circumstances in which Belleli had managed to drop its price. As appears from Mr Iyer’s memorandum of 4 November 2003 requesting the third cash call, at the meeting of HDTL on 26 October 2003 a decision had been made to require retendering. On 30 October 2003, Mr Boreh approached Mr Garrone, the CEO of Belleli about Soprim having a sub-contract from Belleli for the works. It was put to him in cross-examination that he had said that, unless Belleli agreed to Soprim having the sub-contract, there would be a re-tender which he was initially inclined to agree, though he went on to say:  </p>

		<span style="font-style:italic">“No, what I meant is if we do re-tendering, because our prices are cheaper, because now we know the job description, because during the tender they were revising the documents and complicating the others to compete. There was an understanding because Belleli had a lot of friends in ENOC, so as a shareholder I was just doing business, and this is business, to say "Look, we want you to reduce the price, we are cheaper than Sands", Sands' price was 15 million, ours was 9 million, so 6 million was cheaper only on the civil work, and that was the interest of Horizon, which I held 30%. So if he didn't want to accept, yes, I was going to ask for re-tender, to renegotiate with everybody, and see whether we can reduce the price, and that is business.” </span>

On 1 November 2003, Mr Boreh asked Mr Garrone for an engagement letter on the basis of their conversation, in order to avoid a re-tender. Mr Garrone sent a letter of intent on 5 November 2003, which was subject to Belleli being granted the EPC contract and also subject to Soprim entering a joint venture with an experienced civil works contractor acceptable to Belleli.  In due course the joint venture was formed with Sands. </p>

They characterise Mr Garrone sending the letter of intent as conceding defeat. What that allegation appears to completely overlook is that, as Mr Garrone had anticipated in his email of 30 October 2003, Horizon proceeded with a further re-bid anyway.

Mr Nair reported on the re-tenders, of which Belleli was again the cheapest, having achieved a modest reduction of its previous figure. Earlier that day, Belleli had written to Mr Gelineau confirming that if its bid succeeded, it would sub-contract the civil works to a joint venture between Soprim and a UAE company i.e. Sands. That letter was tabled at the meeting and, since Belleli was again the cheapest, the shareholders resolved that the contract should be awarded by HDTL to Belleli (in the full knowledge that Belleli was sub-contracting the civil works to a joint venture that included Soprim).  </p>

Whatever he may have said to Mr Garrone about avoiding a re-bid, he had no power to do so unless his fellow directors agreed and, in the event, there was a re-bid despite what he said. Belleli sub-contracted to the joint venture which included Soprim, notwithstanding the re-bidding process that it was required to go through. The re-bid led to a further modest saving which was in the best interests of HDTL.   </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC points out, working with a local contractor would lead to cost savings, Soprim was already mobilised at Doraleh for site development works and Mr Yusr Sultan in later correspondence refers to Soprim’s involvement having been approved: “<span style="font-style:italic">in view of the importance of this work to the local economy</span>”.  As Mr Kendrick QC submits: <span style="font-style:italic">“Creating employment for local Djiboutians, rather than overseas contractors, was in the best interests of HDTL (for public relations reasons) and the Republic (for policy reasons)”. </span> In all the circumstances, I reject any suggestion that Mr Boreh abused his position in relation to Soprim being awarded the sub-contract.  </p>

Mr Fewer said that there had been no agreement in 2004. Mr Boreh had asked about a share in the profits of the DDP, but Mr Fewer had said it was too early in the operation to discuss that. If and when it was profitable in the future, Mr Boreh should come back and discuss it, but anything which was proposed would have to be cleared with Dubai. This earlier discussion is of some relevance because, on any view, it precedes the DCT negotiations by eighteen months or more and has nothing to do with Mr Boreh agreeing soft terms. If Mr Fewer and Mr Boreh had agreed a finder’s fee for Mr Boreh in relation to DDP in 2004, it could not conceivably be described as a bribe, let alone a bribe to agree soft terms in Agreements which lay in the future.

In my judgment this is no more than Mr Boreh reviving a previous request in relation to the DDP, which had nothing to do with the DCT.

He then described the draft contract as: <span style="font-style:italic">“merely a document that was drafted by I know not who”. </span> Later in cross-examination, when it was put to him that it was Mr Heremans who had drafted it and that he and Mr Heremans had been happy to go ahead, subject to approval from higher up in DP World, he accepted that that was correct.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Although his contemporaneous email had indicated that he was prepared to agree this in principle, in cross-examination, he agreed that he would not have agreed to a percentage agreement and that it would have been wrong and not in PAID’s interest for Mr Boreh to be receiving payment from funds that would otherwise have gone to PAID. </p>

Lord Falconer put to him that he was extremely keen to keep Mr Boreh favourable to DP World. His response was; “<span style="font-style:italic">not more so than usual</span>”, what was usual being: <span style="font-style:italic">“an openhanded approach”</span>. The claimants appear to be seeking to imply from this that Mr Hawker was trying to “keep Mr Boreh sweet” for the purposes of the DCT negotiations and they tie all this in with what Mr Gilfillan said: <span style="font-style:italic">“I guess this is what we need to do to remain a preferred business partner in Djibouti”</span> to suggest that in effect what was being proposed was some sort of bribe.</p>

He appears to have decided not to make any agreement, as the matter proceeded no further. Mr Boreh’s evidence was that he did not know that any draft agreement had been drawn up and, clearly, the issue of whether he would wait to be paid after the audit was never in fact raised with him. Mr Boreh did not return to the subject and no payment was ever made. The relations between himself and DP World remained unchanged. In my judgment, the characterization of this issue of the finder’s fee as complicity between them in entering into corrupt transactions is unwarranted. Even if any agreement had been made, which it was not, it would have had nothing whatever to do with the negotiations of the DCT agreements and would not have been a bribe.  </p>

That refers to the company being set up as a free zone company: <span style="font-style:italic">“as there is the possibility a 3rd party share holder for DPWD (this mechanism is being used to allow for a split distribution of dividends received from DCT).”</span> The memo continues that: <span style="font-style:italic">“it is intended that DPWD entity will own 33.3% of DCT” </span>and states under <span style="font-style:italic">“Ownership”</span>: <span style="font-style:italic">“85% by DP World FZE, 15% by DPI World Terminals FZE (note: this is a parking holder).”</span></p>

Indeed, if the position reached at the meeting was a 60/40 split, as the note and some of the witness evidence suggests, then there was an increase in the Government’s share by 6.66% shortly after the meeting.

I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that this email is consistent with the proposed shareholding of 5% in DCT having only been recently agreed. By that stage the terms of the Concession Agreement had already been agreed (as set out above, it was signed by Mr Boreh pursuant to a Power of Attorney granted by the President at a signing ceremony in Djibouti at the end of October 2006), so that it seems to me extremely unlikely that any agreement to provide a shareholding to Mr Boreh was part of a campaign of bribery.  </p>

In any event, even if that were the explanation, it would be wholly inconsistent with an agreement to sell shares for over U.S. $6.5 million being some sort of bribe or reward for corrupt actions. Mr Kendrick QC submitted that the fact that this price was not renegotiated makes perfect sense if it was always intended that, if Mr Boreh took a shareholding, he would have to pay the cash calls and that this was the explanation as to why the original draft had a price of U.S. $1. Although the claimants were critical of this explanation, saying that it did not correspond with Mr Boreh’s evidence, it does seem to me the most likely explanation for the apparent change of price is that it was always contemplated that Mr Boreh/Value Additions would be liable for the relevant proportion of the cash calls, a further indication that this would have been a commercial transaction, not a bribe.  </p>

The claimants have sought to maintain that it is not clear whether he did acquire the shares. They rely upon an asset disclosure schedule produced by Mr Boreh’s lawyers in Singapore in November 2013 in response to the Worldwide Freezing Order which acknowledged the Share Purchase Agreement. However, as Mr Kendrick QC points out, they noted that: <span style="font-style:italic">“Value Additions has not received the new share certificate(s) and the updated share register” </span>and that DP World had been contacted about this without response. The reason is that the price of U.S. $6.56 million was never paid by Mr Boreh or his company and so the shares were never transferred. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s explanation as to why the purchase of shares was never completed was as follows. When the Concession Agreement was signed in October 2006, the President was very pleased but was convinced that Mr Boreh would be receiving millions personally from the deal and, as with DDP and Horizon previously, pressed Mr Boreh for his share. Accordingly, the agreement to purchase a stake in DCT was to meet the President’s demands. In late 2007, the President started making further demands for commission (as he had in 1999) in relation to cranes being supplied by the Chinese company ZPMC. These demands are referred to in scarcely veiled references in emails from Mr Boreh and his employees to ZPMC about adding agency fees: “<span style="font-style:italic">we have third party who involve in this business</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">we have engagements with other interested parties and commitments which have to be honoured</span>”.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Boreh’s evidence was that the fact that the shareholding was to be in effect part of the “fund” for the President is the explanation for the delay in completing the transaction. Mr Boreh was uncomfortable with the transaction. He had not planned to be a private investor in DCT and by October 2008, when he left Djibouti and the Soprim equipment was seized by the Government, it was clear that there was an irreconcilable rift with the President and there was no point in continuing to appease him. Accordingly, Mr Boreh did not go through with the transaction.  </p>

However, the fact remains that if, as the claimants contend, the shareholding was a bribe of Mr Boreh or a reward for having agreed soft terms, it is very difficult to see why he would not have completed the transaction as quickly as possible and paid the price, particularly since, had he taken a shareholding, it would have made him a very substantial profit. </p>

In any event, even if Mr Boreh/Value Additions had acquired the shares, it would not have been a bribe. As Mr Kendrick QC rightly submits, DP World had a legitimate interest in Mr Boreh having a shareholding in DCT. He would act as a go-between with the Government and would be of assistance in avoiding any disruption of the project. </p>

In those circumstances, it is impossible to characterise the Agreements as being a sham.

In the case of the S Flame Consultancy Agreements, the parties intended to create the rights set out in the Agreements.

There are a number of other matters which run contrary to the suggestion that these were part of a campaign of bribery, not least the timing of the Agreements and the fact that there are three such Agreements. Try as the claimants may to link the dates when the Agreements were made with the provision of “services” which consisted of agreeing soft terms in the DCT Agreements, there is no such correlation. Whilst it is correct that the first Agreement signed in April 2007 related to services provided by Mr Boreh in the twelve months from April 2006, as I have already held, the essential commercial terms of the DCT deal with DP World had been negotiated by Mr Boreh at the meetings in Dubai in February 2006. In so far as anyone on behalf of PAID was involved in further negotiation of the terms of the Concession Agreement produced in draft by DP World immediately after those meetings, this was Ms Ali rather than Mr Boreh. By April 2006, the process of approval by the Government and the legal formalities were under way and those matters were the responsibility of Ms Ali rather than Mr Boreh.   </p>

There is no basis for the suggestion that Mr Boreh “went soft” on that issue at any of the meetings he attended, let alone that the Consultancy Agreement was a bribe or reward for agreeing the control provisions. The idea that he could in some respect have extracted concessions from DP World, if only he had tried harder, makes no sense and is against the weight of the evidence, which is that DP World was always going to insist on these provisions, irrespective of what Mr Boreh or the Republic said. </p>

The Joint Venture Agreement in particular had been signed on 22 May 2007. The somewhat slow and bureaucratic process which led to the approval and ratification of the DCT Agreements by the President and the Parliament was in train. There was no question of any further negotiation of the terms of the Agreements, as the angry emails from Mr Kruijning of DP World which I have quoted at [681] and [683] above demonstrate.

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants are therefore reduced to contending that the Agreements are in effect a reward for past “services” provided by Mr Boreh in agreeing “soft terms”. That contention must involve there having been some promise made to Mr Boreh during the course of the negotiations in February 2006 that he would receive a reward, if he acted in the best interests of DP World and against the interests of the Republic in the negotiations or, at least some understanding to that effect between Mr Boreh and DP World. In my judgment, this contention is hopeless. It faces three principal difficulties. First, there is simply no evidence of any such promise or understanding. Indeed, such evidence as there is, for example the internal email within DP World’s lawyers on 23 February 2006 saying that they had tried to draft a more or less balanced document, points away from the negotiations having been in any sense onesided because of some promise or understanding.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, there is the question of timing. If, as the claimants contend, there had been some promise or understanding that Mr Boreh would receive a reward, the obvious question is why did he not receive it at the time that he signed the Concession Agreement in December 2006 or the Joint Venture Agreement in May 2007. The timing of the Consultancy Agreements, dated as they were in April 2007, September 2007 and June 2008, makes no sense in that context. Nor does the fact that three separate Agreements were signed, the final one of which was for three years from 1 June 2008. As Mr Kendrick QC said, the latter two Agreements point to a continuing relationship in the future and have no connection with what had been negotiated 18 months or 2 ¼ years previously. If, as the claimants suggest, these Agreements were a reward for past corrupt services, the fact that there were three Agreements spread out over fourteen months makes no sense at all. Surely such reward would have been given in one Agreement. Also if these were bribes, there is a question as to why only one payment was made under the third agreement. The obvious answer is that these were not bribes, but that after November 2008, Mr Boreh no longer had any influence in Djibouti and so could no longer provide any useful consultancy services to DP World.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, there are the inherent probabilities. I have already dealt with these to an extent at the beginning of the section of the judgment dealing with the Doraleh Container Terminal and do not propose to repeat everything I said there. I merely emphasise four points. First, unlike in the usual case of agreements procured by bribes, there is nothing about the suite of DCT Agreements which sticks out as what Mr Kendrick QC described as <span style="font-style:italic">“a white elephant”,</span> the clearly disadvantageous contract such as the charterparty in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ocean Frost</span>. Despite the best efforts of the claimants’ legal team to demonstrate that these Agreements were disadvantageous to the Republic and PAID, the evidence of the financial success of the DCT proves otherwise. I deal briefly below with whether the terms were “soft”.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, it is difficult to see what motive DP World would have had for bribing Mr Boreh, given that whatever he might or might not agree with DP World, any Agreements entered into would be subject to the scrutiny and approval process of the President and his advisers as well as Parliament. The obvious example of this is the so-called reserved matters, on which DP World was unmoveable. It is quite clear that, </p>

I suppose it is theoretically possible that DP World could have made some contingent promise to Mr Boreh to reward him if the President agreed its terms, but that seems extremely improbable, since on that hypothesis, Mr Boreh would not have provided DP World with any real service at all, given that the securing of the deal ultimately depended on the President’s decision, not Mr Boreh’s. Given that both the first two Consultancy Agreements were concluded before the President had in fact approved and ratified the DCT Agreements, it would make no sense for DP World to bribe Mr Boreh, since the successful ratification of the Agreements was by no means guaranteed.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, DP World had an existing relationship with the claimants and had entered two previous Agreements, the 2000 Concession Agreement for management of the old Port and the 2004 Concession Agreement, and its associated company JAFZA had a Management Agreement to run the Free Zone. There is no suggestion that any of those Agreements (with the negotiation of some of which Mr Boreh was also involved) was procured by bribery of Mr Boreh and it makes no sense for DP World to start bribing him now seven years after the first of those Agreements.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, there is the position of Mr Boreh himself. The claimants seek to portray him as a greedy, unscrupulous, corrupt businessman, who would stop at nothing to make himself money, including the betrayal of his country by agreeing soft terms in the DCT Agreements. That is not the man I observed giving evidence in the witness box for four and a half days. Yes, on occasions his evidence was exaggerated, yes there are aspects of his behaviour which do not do him credit (such as asking for finder’s fees) but overall, I simply refuse to accept the claimants’ picture of him as a traitor, who sold his country short for what, given his wealth, was the very modest amount of U.S. $1,250,000 paid under the S-Flame Consultancy Agreements. As Mr Kendrick QC put it, he is a patriot. He has a strong desire to improve his country and is justly proud of what has been achieved at Doraleh through his and the Republic’s cooperation with Dubai. He is not a man who would take bribes to sell his country short.  </p>

It would be equally inappropriate for DP World to pay him for such a thing.” </span>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, the forensic outrage is misplaced. The starting point is that, it was because he could ensure smooth relations between the Republic and the Dubai investors, that the President had used Mr Boreh to negotiate with DP World, just as previously he had asked him to deal with ENOC. Mr Boreh could speak the same language as the Dubai investors, not only linguistically (he spoke good English, whereas many in the Government could not) but commercially. This was the reason why he was appointed the Chairman of the DPFZA in the first place. Even the President admits in his witness statement that he took the decision to nominate Mr Boreh as Chairman of the DPFZA in order to encourage the Dubai partners to invest in the Port project.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Equally, the Dubai investors, whether ENOC or DP World saw Mr Boreh as a wellplaced local partner who could advise on local politics and business and lobby those with influence, including the President himself. As Mr Kendrick QC puts it, accurately: <span style="font-style:italic">“He had, literally, a hot-line to a President who wielded virtually complete power and kept a keen interest in the Port, as the source of much of the Government’s income.”</span> Mr Boreh was able to raise issues direct with the President and by-pass ministers and functionaries who often had their own agenda. As ENOC said in the Information Memorandum to potential investors in Horizon in November 2003: he was: “<span style="font-style:italic">a high profile and high net worth entrepreneur of Djibouti. He is perceived as a highly influential person with contacts in various Government quarters.</span>” It is important to have in mind that he had this lobbying power with the President independently of and irrespective of his role as chairman of the DPFZA. </p>

As I have found, this was known to the President and others in Government.  Equally importantly for present purposes, Mr Boreh was seen by the business world in the region as a consultant for the Dubai interests. Thus, an Africa Intelligence report of 21 May 2005 headed: <span style="font-style:italic">“The essential Abdourahman Boreh in Djibouti”</span> describes him in these terms: <span style="font-style:italic">“The Djiboutian Abdourahman Mahamoud Boreh is a veritable travelling salesman for Dubai companies in Djibouti, where he is managing a new project for one of them.

Furthermore, even if, contrary to that finding, the President was not putting financial pressure on Mr Boreh, what was in the public domain would have told the President that Mr Boreh had a consultancy role for DP World. Given that Mr Boreh’s position as Chairman of the DPFZA was unpaid, I rather doubt whether, had he come to be cross-examined, the President could have sustained the position that he was not aware that Mr Boreh was carrying out consultancy services for DP World and being paid for those services.

However, this is not an English law case and strict English standards do not apply. The starting point would never be reached in this country: no Government here would appoint a businessman and investor in companies such as Horizon, DDP and Soprim as the head of the government body which was administering the Free Zone, let alone then appoint him to conduct negotiations for the DCT with DP World.  To an English lawyer, the conflicts of interest are manifold.

Generalised allegations in cross-examination such as that the payments under the consultancy agreements were made as bribes “<span style="font-style:italic">so you would keep the President favourable to DP World</span>”, quite apart from the fact that this was convincingly denied by Mr Boreh, who said: <span style="font-style:italic">“I don't agree with that as well.

Mr Boreh promoted a mutually beneficial relationship. In my judgment, there is no evidence that any of the work Mr Boreh did for DP World conflicted with or harmed the interests of the Republic and therefore no question either of his being in breach of the duty of probity or of the claimants having suffered any loss as a consequence of such breach. </p>

In his second witness statement, Mr Boreh sets out the background to this (on which he was not challenged in cross-examination). The purchase monies were initially provided by one of Mr Boreh’s companies, but he asked Mr Hawker on the instructions of the President to arrange reimbursement by PAID which would pay from its future dividends from the port.

It would no doubt be necessary to involve the Minister of Transport in Australia where Mr Gilfillan comes from, but that was not how things operated in Djibouti. Indeed, the whole point of the law setting up the DPFZA was that the DPFZA would operate autonomously of and bypass ministers (who would often have their own agenda and engage in spoiling tactics, as with the South African scheme to open an oil refinery at Doraleh).

Mr Boreh did deny that this was about corruption between him and DP World: <span style="font-style:italic">“I was not involved with any of this”</span> and, as I understood what he was saying, it was no more than if Mr Gilfillan had been referring to things going on between him and Emiratis within DP World, he would have specifically identified Mr Boreh, which is surely a fair point.</p>

For example, who were the <span style="font-style:italic">“businessmen”</span> in the plural and which Emiratis was he referring to?

The fee under the agreement was U.S. $6,000 per month payable from 13 June 2007 to 29 September 2008. The total amount involved is thus U.S. $93,000. The services were said in the agreement to relate to: <span style="font-style:italic">“the Security systems and security intelligence for optimisation of Operations at the Port of Djibouti.”</span> An issue arises as to whether the agreement was in fact signed in June 2007 or, as Mr Kendrick QC submitted, much later, in September 2008.  He relied upon the fact that in March 2008 the accounts department of PAID raised with DP World the fact that there were invoices for security services which should be paid, but they only had a draft MOU for U.S. $6,000 per month (in fact between Port Secure a security company owned jointly by DP World and the DPFZA and Soprim Logistics, another Boreh company) and needed an executed contract before payment could be authorised. This suggests that the Security Services Agreement had not been signed at that stage.</p>

Although, this amount can even be directly remitted to the S Flame bank account while we just pass book entries to reflect the same, I suggest for the purpose of maintaining a proper trail and to avoid any confusion it is better that DPW FZE raises an invoice on Port Secure and recovers the money on one hand, and processes the payment to S.

It is true, as the claimants point out that Mr Boreh’s evidence in cross-examination was to the effect that the agreement was made in June 2007, but it is possible that he was mistaken or that the agreement was in draft, but not signed until later. Either way, the fact that payments of U.S.$6,000 per month were being openly discussed and recognised to be due by the accounts department of PAID subject to an executed contract, points away from the agreements being a sham or the payment being a bribe. </p>

Originally, Mr Boreh had started his own security company, Nomad. However, contrary to Mr Boreh’s hopes, Port Secure emerged as the main security contractor at Doraleh, using as sub-contractors: Nomad for some personnel and Hart Security, an international organisation, to help obtain Class and IMO accreditation. Later still, Nomad dropped out altogether as security providers of personnel at Doraleh, although they continued to provide security services to hotels and at the US </p>

However, Mr Boreh continued to assist Port Secure on intelligence matters and this is the reason for the monthly payment. In fact the payment of the small sum of U.S. $6,000 per month for security services can be traced back to 2005 with payment made in occasional lump sums. For example Soprim Logistics invoiced Port Secure on 22 May 2006 for U.S. $36,000 for the period 12 December 2005 to 12 June 2006.  </p>

		<span style="font-style:italic">“The intention behind this agreement was to reimburse me for some of the expenses I incurred in keeping the Doraleh container terminal site secure. The site had problems. In particular, Djibouti is a very poor place with high levels of unemployment, and therefore a new building site attracts a lot of unwanted attention. On many occasions, hundreds of people gathered outside the construction site and demanded jobs. Some of those people caused trouble and were violent. Nomad's security guards could not deal with this problem alone. I therefore spent significant amounts of my own money on various things to ensure that the site was secure, for the ultimate benefit of DCT including DP World. For example, I paid a number of well-informed locals (typically those who had retired from the military or the police force) to gather intelligence regarding security risks. </span>

Accordingly, the whole issue of security in the Port of which complaint was originally made was not fully examined in the evidence. In all the circumstances, I reject the claimants’ case that the U.S. $93,000 paid to S Flame in October 2008 can be construed as a bribe for agreeing soft terms or otherwise as a corrupt payment and I accept Mr Kendrick QC’s submission that this represented the payment of a small monthly sum for genuine local services paid for and provided by Mr Boreh. </p>

In his closing submissions, Lord Falconer referred to two other related matters, the shareholding and the entitlement to dilute the shareholding by assigning shares to a shipping line. Those additional matters are not identified in the letter of 25 September 2015 as they should have been. However, leaving that point to one side, the suggestion that the terms as regards the shareholding procured through the efforts of Mr Boreh were anything other than extremely advantageous for the claimants, let alone any suggestion that he did not achieve the best he could because he was being bribed or promised bribes is completely hopeless. I have dealt comprehensively at [586] to [610] above with why the complaints now made are without merit and do not propose to repeat what is said there.   </p>

In my judgment, this is a flawed approach, since it is important to look at the various Agreements as part of the overall deal, not at particular provisions in isolation. Ultimately, in my view, the critical question is whether the overall deal was advantageous or disadvantageous to the Republic. When that question is asked, it allows of only one answer, that this has been advantageous, even more profitable than DP World’s financial model predicted.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">By far and away the most significant complaint is about the size of the royalty payable to the Republic which was set at the higher of U.S. $6 million or 5% of gross revenues per year. The claimants’ case is that, if it had been negotiated honestly, it would have been 40% of ‘notional’ gross revenue, that is without any discounts being permissible, so that if, for good commercial reasons, DP World gave a discount for volume to a large container line, the royalty would need to be calculated ignoring that discount and DP World would have to make good the shortfall. I agree with Mr Kendrick QC that this is commercially unreal and wholly inconsistent with a joint venture. A 40% royalty on notional gross revenue would amount to a huge tax before profit, dramatically reducing the profits of the container terminal and, of course, the dividends payable to both DP World and PAID.  As Mr Kendrick QC says this would be incredibly inequitable to DP World, which was not just the manager, but a  joint venturer, supplying 1/3 of the equity and paying 1/3 of the cash calls. The payment of a 40% up-front royalty on gross revenue to the Republic/PAID would mean that in a poor year there would be profit and no dividend as the return for DP World’s investment.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The basis for the 40% royalty appears to be Jeddah, but that is a terminal built and paid for by the Saudi government, in what is regarded as a safe country, where the manager of the terminal is no more than a manager, not an investor taking a ‘country risk’. The contrast with Djibouti could not be greater. It is difficult to see what incentive DP World would have had to invest in and operate the DCT at all in those circumstances, particularly when this point about royalty is combined with the claimants’ further point that the management fee for DP World was excessive and should have been no more than a fixed figure of U.S. $1.3 million per annum. Furthermore, the marginal profitability that this royalty and reduced management fee would have produced would have made this project impossible to finance. The evidence called on behalf of Mr Boreh from Mr Qureshi dealt with this issue. </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC submits, in broad terms, that suggests that the royalty was about as high as the lenders could tolerate. Lord Falconer put to him in cross-examination that the banks would be willing to go below the 1.5 threshold from time to time, to which his answer was: <span style="font-style:italic">“Possibly, but in very, very limited circumstances.”</span> Significantly, it was not suggested to him that such circumstances were present in the case of the DCT project and any such suggestion would have been hopeless. This project was clearly at the high end on the scale of risk and I have already referred above to Mr Qureshi’s evidence that, even on the basis of the terms agreed in the DCT agreements, obtaining the necessary finance was difficult. </p>

Thus, it was suggested to Mr Qureshi in cross-examination that the banks would only be interested in the position during the financing period, so that the royalty could have increased after the period of the loan. His answer was: <span style="font-style:italic">“Predominantly, but they do recognise that they might not have their debt paid over that period, so they have to look beyond a ten-year term.”</span> Of course this suggestion of a fluctuating royalty is inconsistent with the claimants’ case that, had Mr Boreh not been bribed, the royalty could and would have been 40% of gross revenue from the outset. It has all the air of a clever lawyers’ construct to get over the obvious difficulty that a 40% royalty at the outset would not have been acceptable to the financing banks.  </p>

As I found above, as with the royalty, the management fee was agreed in the negotiations in February 2006.

Since those fees would diminish significantly with the transfer of container traffic from the old Port to the DCT, DP World would be legitimately entitled to expect to recover substantially the same, if not more, from managing the DCT. </p>

As Mr Kendrick QC said, it would have had a chilling effect, particularly when combined with the sort of royalty for which the Republic contends. Furthermore, it is simply not appropriate to look at terms such as the royalty and the management fee in isolation from the other terms of the deal, which was advantageous overall to the Republic in relation particularly to the equity share and was perceived to be so at the time.  </p>

If that point is being made (or reserved for a stage two trial) there is nothing in it. To begin with, the financial model used by DP World about which Mr Qureshi was cross-examined forecasts an IRR for DP World of 31.97% and for PAID of 29.35%, broadly equal and thus consistent not with this deal being disadvantageous to PAID because of Mr Boreh’s corruption but with it being a long term partnership in which Mr Boreh’s efforts had secured PAID a majority shareholding.  </p>

The suggestion that the IRR in this financial model meant that there was room for downwards negotiation is a false point.</p>

In my judgment, nothing could be further from the true position than the suggestion that Mr Boreh allowed DP World to take complete control of the board and the management without trying to persuade them to take less because he had been bribed.   </p>

As set out in detail above, DP World had been given extensive control under the 2000 Concession Agreement in the management of the old Port. Nevertheless DP World still encountered problems with residual government interference, as for example with the budget evidenced by Mr Heremans’ exasperated note in November 2006 referred to at [592] above. Mr Douale said in re-examination that Mr Boreh had told him that: <span style="font-style:italic">“DP World wanted to control the board of directors to prevent the Government from getting involved in the management of DCT, and avoid thus the type of problem they had had with PAID.” </span></p>

In a telling piece of evidence, Mr Douale not only agreed that it was appropriate for JAFZA to be given exclusive management control without interference because it was the expert, but that that was what he wanted it to do.

As she put it: “<span style="font-style:italic">under no circumstances could the Reserved Matters go against or cause any risk whatsoever to the Djiboutian Government and the Nation’s interest, as well as to sovereignty.</span>”  However, there are two principal reasons why any suggestion that Mr Boreh allowed DP World to have this complete control because he had been bribed (even if he had been, which I have found he was not) caused the claimants any loss, is hopeless.  </p>

Apart from the small concession to Ms Ali to remove (ss) made at the end of March 2007 referred to in [667] above, DP World did not concede any of the reserved matters.  In addition, as I have found, the banks would not have financed this project unless DP World had complete control and the risk of government interference was eliminated. Even then, as Mr Qureshi said, the relationship banks had difficulty in syndicating the loan. The fact that any change in the control provisions would have been an event of default under the finance documentation is a clear indication of the attitude of the banks.  </p>

The decision was his alone and there is no evidence that, in doing so, he was in any way influenced by, let alone being advised by, Mr Boreh. It necessarily follows that, if the claimants have suffered any loss as a consequence of entering the DCT Agreements, which seems highly unlikely given how profitable they have been, then in terms of causation, that loss was caused not by Mr Boreh’s breach of a duty of probity or loyalty, but by the President’s own commercial decision to approve and ratify the Agreements.  </p>

As Mr Dileita explained, tribal discussions had already started about who might replace the President. Whether Mr Dileita was actually tasked by the President to sound Mr Boreh out and report back may not matter given that Mr Dileita did report back to the President, although if I had to decide the point I would conclude that he was asked by the President to sound Mr Boreh out.</p>

This seems to me to be extremely unlikely. Quite apart from the fact that Mr Dileita was very firm in evidence that the meeting was in 2007, May 2006 would have been too early for the discussion which took place about the President standing for a third term, since it was only a year after the previous election. Also, the copies of the passport pages produced do not include those for 2007 and 2008 and it expired in May 2008. Mr Dileita’s evidence was that he visited Dubai on several occasions. It is also noteworthy that, although in his witness statement, the President denies that he considered Mr Boreh a political rival, he does admit that, in or around 2007, Mr Dileita told him that he had met Mr Boreh in Dubai and that Mr Boreh had told him that he might run for President. It seems to me that it is far more likely that the discussion took place sometime in 2007 and I so find. However, the fact that the claimants appeared intent on changing Mr Dileita’s evidence does suggest a level of concern about the allegations of political motivation.   </p>

Precisely why the President turned against him when he did, having parted on ostensibly good terms, is unclear and the President has not come to give evidence to explain his conduct and motives, but that the President did turn against him in October 2008 is clear.</p>

These were: (i) that the seizure must be preceded by a ‘<span style="font-style:italic">commandement</span>’; (ii) an ‘iterative <span style="font-style:italic">commandement</span>’ or final warning must be given, allowing one last chance to pay; (iii) an official must be appointed to oversee the seizure and (iv) an inventory of the seizure must be given to the taxpayer.  </p>

It supplied concrete for local construction projects. In 2005 it had made a loss and in 2006 had made a modest profit equivalent to some U.S. $55,000. It had been in discussion with the authorities about its tax liabilities and, on 16 April 2008, the Presidency wrote to Mr Jacques Lemay, the managing director of the Boreh Group, in effect waiving the relevant tax liabilities. However, without any prior warning, in November 2008, the tax department assessed Djibouti Mix’s tax liability as about DJF 1.59 billion (US$8.9 million) together with the maximum surcharge of 40%, taking the total demand to DJF 1.76 billion (US$9.8 million). This was far higher than any conceivable tax liability and Mr Abane was unable to recall any company in Djibouti with sufficient turnover to produce a tax liability on this scale. Given the previous proposal by the Presidency, the surcharge was manifestly unjustifiable.     </p>

Instead, that letter was ignored and, by notices of recovery dated 28 January 2009 and a letter of 7 March 2009, the tax department sought payment of the full amount equivalent to U.S. $9.8 million and gave the company a week to pay.  </p>

I do not find that convincing either, since the claimants were given permission by the Court at the pre-trial review to call Mr Abane.

Although, for understandable reasons, Mr Abane declined to comment on the suggestion that this was not a legitimate exercise in tax collection, but a process initiated by the President in a cynical attempt to ruin Mr Boreh financially, it seems to me very clear that the demands being made were illegitimate and grossly excessive and that the correct inference is that it was part of the political campaign against Mr Boreh.  </p>

In 2011, he was apparently convicted by a Djibouti court, in his absence and without his knowledge, of embezzlement, a conviction which has echoes of the false conviction of Mr Boreh in his absence for offences of terrorism.  </p>

In relation to public law, he confirmed that Djibouti passed its own Law on Civil servants in 1983, which adopts a different approach to the equivalent French law in terms of how potential conflicts of interest are dealt with. With that exception, Me Dini accepted that Djiboutian public law is identical to French public law as it was in 1977. Given the concessions made by Me Dini that Djiboutian law and French law were the same (save for the Law on Civil Servants), the defendants did not call their Djiboutian law expert or rely on his report. Equally, it seems to me that save for Me Dini’s evidence on the distinct Djiboutian law on Civil servants, the claimants should not be entitled to rely upon Me Dini as an extra expert on French law to contradict Professor Stoffel-Munck or Me Savoie. In any event, I had some doubts as to the objectivity of Me Dini, given that he has advised PAID not just many years ago, but in the period since 2012 and is a former member of the Djiboutian Parliament. Where his evidence as to the applicable French law contradicted that of the defendants’ experts, I much preferred their evidence.  </p>

The mission was not a public service one, but essentially commercial in character because: (a) the deal concerned shareholdings in a private company, which was going to run an oil storage terminal on a commercial basis and the relevant agreement was for the Republic to have shares in exchange for land just as a private entity might; (b) the only public element of the operation, the jetty, was excluded from HDTL and run by DP World on behalf of the Republic; (c) prior to his appointment as chairman of the DPFZA, Mr Boreh did not have any position within Government or a public body.

What you are being asked is this: assume that Mr Boreh was not given any power to perform actes juridiques, and assume that he did not perform actes juridiques; do you accept that in those circumstances he would not be a mandataire as a matter of French law?

His first point, that by necessity a negotiator is called on to execute transactions which are binding on his principal during negotiations, such as memoranda of understanding, is just wrong as a matter of fact (as evidenced in this case by the fact that the memoranda of understanding were both signed by Mr Moussa) and as a matter of analysis. Where a negotiator has no power to bind his principal to agreements preliminary to the conclusion of negotiations, such as memoranda of understanding, he is not a <span style="font-style:italic">mandataire. </span>This principle is demonstrated by the decision of the Cour d’Appel de Paris of 6 October 1964. In that case, brokers for a party entered into a letter of confirmation which said in terms that there would not be a binding contract until there had been confirmation from the principal. The decision proceeded on the basis that brokers are not usually <span style="font-style:italic">mandataires </span>and were not in that case, given the terms of the letter. As the headnote of the case states: “<span style="font-style:italic">Brokers are not usually the mandataires of the parties.  Such is indeed the case where the letter of confirmation of the contract expressly specifies that the order will ‘only be valid after having been ratified by the exchange of confirmations of the interested parties’...</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

However, as Mr Waller QC pointed out, this presupposes the power to bind prior to signature, which begs the relevant question.  In any event, it is not alleged that Mr Boreh had such a power in the present case. It follows that Me Dini’s conclusion that: <span style="font-style:italic">“[w]hat matters is that the principal wished to entrust to the mandataire the task of negotiating in order to reach an agreement”</span>, which entails the proposition that in such circumstances, the agent who is given a power to negotiate is a <span style="font-style:italic">mandataire</span>, is simply wrong as a matter of French law (as Professor Stoffel-Munck said in terms, when Mr Brook Smith QC put Me Dini’s opinion to him in cross-examination) and, necessarily as a matter of Djiboutian law, given that Me Dini accepted that they were the same.  </p>

This is because of the specific provisions of the Djibouti Law on Civil Servants of 1983 (Law no 48 of 1983) which replaced the previous French legislation. Unlike in France, there is no prohibition on <span style="font-style:italic">fonctionnaires</span> having private interests. Rather, under Article 7(4)-(5) of the Law, a <span style="font-style:italic">fonctionnaire </span>is under a duty to disclose any potential conflict of interest, so that the President can take whatever steps he deems necessary to safeguard the public interest.

The evidence of Me Savoie in his second report was that the administrative judge would only refer to principles of civil law in exceptional cases well-defined in the administrative jurisprudence, which did not include Articles 1991 to 1993 of the Civil Code, because the general rule established in the decision of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tribunal des Conflits</span> in the<span style="font-style:italic"> Blanco </span>case in 1873 is that public law drives out private law.

The Opinion related to a 1985 law that allows a public entity in charge of the management of public works to delegate certain of its management functions to a <span style="font-style:italic">mandataire</span>. It made no mention whatsoever of any of the provisions of the Civil Code. Finally, <span style="font-style:italic">Schwartz-Hautmont</span> (24 February 1954) is a decision of the <span style="font-style:italic">Conseil d’État</span> referring to Article 1998 of the Civil Code which provides, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that the principal is only bound by what his <span style="font-style:italic">mandataire </span>has done in excess of authority if he expressly ratifies the act. The issue was whether a public works contract had been ratified.

It is effectively common ground between the public law experts that in relation to a breach of a public law duty, the claimants have to establish: (i) a breach of the relevant duty; (ii) loss suffered by the claimants and (iii) a causal link between the breach and the loss. Furthermore, in the light of what Me Chahid-Nouraï accepted as set out at [907] above, it is also common ground that in a public law claim there are no gain based remedies, so that Mr Boreh cannot be obliged to hand over the Horizon shareholding to the Republic, any more than he could be obliged to disgorge a bribe, if a bribe was paid.

It was common ground between all the experts that damages in kind is an exceptional remedy, both as a matter of private law and public law. Whatever circumstances would be exceptional, they are not this case. I agree with Mr Waller QC that, given the uncertainty as to whether ENOC would have been prepared to countenance a larger shareholding for the Republic than the 10% it took, let alone 40%, this is a case of the loss of a chance, recovery for which is recoverable both in French private law and public law. However, in such a case, damages in kind are immediately unsuitable, since the loss is of a chance, not of the asset that would have been obtained if the chance had definitely materialised. As Professor Stoffel-Munck put it neatly in cross-examination: <span style="font-style:italic">“And in the context of this case, there is an important point here, because it seems to me that the damage suffered hypothetically by the claimant is a loss of a chance, and I really can't see how you can compensate properly an expectation with an asset in kind.”</span></p>

The opinion of Me Savoie, which I accept, is that compensation in kind may only be ordered where the claimant has a proprietary right to the asset in question or the defendant is contractually obliged to deliver the asset to the claimant. On a proper analysis, even if Mr Boreh was in breach of the duty of probity, that does not give the claimants a proprietary right to the shares or a contractual right to their delivery up. </p>

It was common ground between the public law experts that, in public law, the general rule is that damages are to be assessed at the date when the damaging event has stopped operating and the extent of the damage is known. Ordinarily that means that damages are assessed at the date of breach, when the damage occurred. As Me Savoie said, that principle applies in 99% of cases. Despite arguments advanced by the claimants for suspending the date of assessment to the date of judgment, if the issue were relevant, I would have concluded that there was no reason, in the present case, not to apply the general principle and I would have assessed any damages at the date of breach, December 2002, or when the Republic became aware of Mr Boreh’s shareholding and thus of his alleged breach of duty, which I would have found was in January 2003 at the latest, when Mr Moussa received the first cash call.  </p>

As set out at [314] above, the claimants advanced in closing an unpleaded case that, if the President did ask Mr Boreh to take a 5% shareholding in Essense which should otherwise have gone to the Republic, that was a corrupt scheme between the two of them which improperly preferred their personal interests over those of the Republic. The claimants contended that, in those circumstances, the knowledge of the President should not be attributed to the Republic, relying upon the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11.5pt">Bilta v Nazir </span><span style="font-size:11.5pt">[2015] UKSC 23; [2016] AC 1.

That evidence was given in the context of an issue as to whether the President could have authorised bribery, Mr Boreh contending that he had been pressed by the President to disgorge money he had made from consultancy arrangements with DP World. In fact, I have concluded that there was no question of bribery and that the Consultancy Agreements were in respect of services genuinely performed, so that again the issue of whether the President authorised bribery does not arise. </p>

Notwithstanding all that, the President made the commercial decision to approve and ratify the agreements. It follows that, even if I had concluded that Mr Boreh was in breach of duty in some way in relation to the negotiations, I would have held that any such breach of duty did not cause the claimants any loss.

As I found above, both the S Flame Consultancy Agreements and the S Flame Security Services Agreement were genuine Agreements, pursuant to which Mr Boreh provided genuine services to DP World. Mr Boreh was not in breach of the duty of probity because: (i) there is no evidence that any of the work Mr Boreh did for DP World conflicted with or harmed the interests of the Republic and (ii) in the case of at least the Consultancy Agreements, I also consider it highly likely that the President was well aware not only that Mr Boreh was providing consultancy services to DP World but that he was being paid for those services and yet the President raised no objection.
