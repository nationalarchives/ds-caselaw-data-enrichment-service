	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This case, involving allegations of fraud, arises out of the sale of a business to its management and private equity investors in July 2009. The courts are familiar with claims made by buyers of businesses against sellers who are alleged to have given the buyers far too rosy a picture of the business being sold. The present case is unusual because it is the converse. The basis of The Claimants’ claim is that the business being sold was far more successful than the sellers had been led by the management to believe, and that the sellers were misled into selling at the time when they did, and for the price which they received. The sellers contend that if the true picture had been presented to them, they would not have been willing to sell at that time at the price which was being offered. </p>

A further 12.4% of the shares were held by the Second Claimant, Newwatch Limited (“Newwatch”). This was a Jersey company which was owned by Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Hildebrandt.

The sale was successfully completed in July 2009. This was after a bidding process where there was a competing potential purchaser, Mr. Jens Nielsen and interests which he represented. Mr. Nielsen was a former chairman of Updata UK. The final LMS offer was considered more attractive by Updata Europe than the proposals which were forthcoming from Mr. Nielsen, and the sale took place. The entire issued share capital of Updata UK was purchased by a new company, Updata Infrastructure Holdings Limited (“Updata Holdings” or “newco”), in which the Defendants and LMS had significant stakes. For that purpose, a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”), and various associated documents, were signed on 11 July 2009. </p>

There is a significant issue in the case as to the validity of the assignment agreements pursuant to which Vald. Nielsen allege that they acquired the rights of Updata Europe, and the Defendants make allegations of fraud against certain individuals involved in the assignment, including Mr. Johnsen. This allegation of fraud was ultimately the only point relied upon by way of an attack on the validity of the assignment, since other arguments based upon champerty and a “non-assignment” clause in the SPA were abandoned by the Defendants in closing argument. The allegation of fraud focused on the backdating of the assignment documents so as to record a date of 19 November 2010 instead of the actual date of signature which was January 2011. </p>

Rather, the principal focus of cross-examination on both sides involved examining and exploring what was really known and happening on the other side of the fence, as it were, and which was not known at the time by the EVs on the one hand, or the Defendants on the other.  Thus, in relation to the deceit and conspiracy case, the Claimants sought to cross-examine the Defendants by reference to the picture that was said to emerge from a careful examination of the Defendants’ own internal documents; the principal feature of that picture being expected financial results which were far more optimistic than those given to the EVs. Similarly, on the issues of whether any loss had been suffered, the Defendants explored in some detail the circumstances in which Updata Europe found itself, and in particular its indebtedness to its bank. The Defendants did know at the time that there was a significant indebtedness, but they did not know much of the detail of the dealings which were explored in the evidence. Similarly, the assignment issue involved examination of dealings on the Claimants’ side of which the Defendants were unaware at the time. It was only as a result of disclosure within these proceedings that the Defendants became aware of materials which, on their case, enabled them to attack the assignment by alleging serious wrongdoing by a large number of individuals, but which ultimately narrowed so as to focus on just three: Mr. Johnsen, Mr. Homann and Mr. Bigaard.  Prior to these proceedings, the Defendants had taken no point on the validity of the assignment: for example, in February 2011 they had each been happy to sign a “Deed of Rectification” to the SPA which identified Vald.

It was obvious that a number of witnesses, in particular Mr. Jorgensen from the Bank, had great difficulty remembering those events with any degree of accuracy, given the passage of time and the ageing process. In some cases, too, illness or the effect of retirement from the business world meant that individuals who may have been much sharper 10 years ago were no longer at the top of their game. The Defendants also rightly submitted that the principal witnesses on both sides have much to gain or lose from the present litigation, which has been bitterly fought for many years, and that this will inevitably colour the ability of some of the witnesses to give objective evidence about the relevant events.  </p>

He has, quite plainly (and in my view with some justification, for the reasons set out in this judgment) nursed a grievance against the Defendants for a considerable time; in that in 2010, fairly soon after the relevant events leading to the sale, he considered that he had been misled during the course of the negotiations. He has had to struggle to bring this claim to a hearing, facing the need to raise significant funds and also needing to overcome a strike-out application made by the Defendants. He has therefore been living with this case for many years. That said, it did seem to me that he did seek to give fair answers to the questions which he was asked, with as much objectivity as one might expect in the circumstances. For example, he made no attempt to downplay the financial difficulties which confronted Updata Europe, and he gave frank evidence about his unsuccessful attempts to find outside investment in Updata Europe in late 2008 and 2009 and the reasons for that lack of success. I have significant reservations, however, about his evidence as to his knowledge of the circumstances leading to the backdating of the assignment documentation in 2011. But this does not lead me to reject his evidence on other aspects of his case where his evidence is material, in particular the issue of inducement. </p>

He gave a disarmingly frank account of the difficulties that would have confronted Updata Europe if it had tried to obtain alternative finance from a different bank in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis; evidence which to my mind holed one aspect (albeit not the most important part) of the Claimants’ case on causation. I thought that in many ways he was an impressive witness, and consider that his evidence as to how he did react to the information that he was given, and how he would have reacted to other information that he was not given, was generally reliable. </p>

He had a good relationship with the Defendants in 2008 and early 2009, assisted them and was very much on their side in relation to the proposed MBO. He maintained a good relationship thereafter, notwithstanding a degree of unhappiness arising from his shareholding being reduced by the sale. He has no financial outcome in the present litigation, but in the light of the facts which have emerged he has a strong and genuine feeling that the Defendants behaved improperly in relation to the sale.

However, neither Ms. Rana nor anyone else on the EVs’ side spotted that a potentially important document had been disclosed in the closing stages of the transaction and the EVs never looked at it. These events relating to this CD were central to the argument advanced by the Defendants on a strike out application in 2016 before Sir Richard Field. In particular, the Defendants argued on that occasion that the disclosure of this Weighted Budget meant that the Defendants could not have been dishonest, and that the case was a suitable one for striking out. By the end of the trial, however, it seemed to me that this particular argument had rather evaporated, and rightly so. Ms. Rana’s evidence as to her work on the Data Room was not the subject of any significant challenge, and she gave her evidence carefully and well.

They were each handsomely rewarded by the eventual sale to Capita, receiving around £ 21 million for their shares. In 2009 they were, in my view, very highly motivated to make sure that the LMS bid and the MBO succeeded, and that Mr. Nielsen’s bid failed. As Mr. Hooft explained in his evidence when speaking of the position in mid-April 2009, the Defendants were “very scared of losing control of the business”. Contrary to the evidence given by the First Defendant (“Mr. Baldorino”) and the Second Defendant  (“Mr. Bennett”), they were not at any stage interested at that time in trying to obtain the maximum price either for their own shares or still less for the shares owned by the majority shareholder Updata Europe. They were also highly motivated to remove, or at least significantly dilute, Updata Europe as shareholder; something which is essentially an aspect of their desire for the MBO to succeed. (I address these matters in more detail in Section F below.) Their motivation for the MBO to succeed, and for Mr. Nielsen to fail, was such that they were in my judgment prepared to lie in the two e-mails which are at the heart of the Claimants’ case on deceit. I do not consider the responses in those e-mails to be consistent with honest responses to the questions or issues raised, and to which the responses were being given: see Sections D and E below. I am also, for reasons which will be explained in this judgment, unable to accept the Defendants’ evidence on many of the critical issues in the case. I also consider that the Defendants’ evidence to Sir Richard Field was misleading; in particular in failing to explain to the Court that, as all the Defendants have now said in their evidence, the disclosure of the Weighted Budget to Ms. Rana was accidental and by mistake. Had this been explained, and for reasons also explained in Section F, I consider that the central case advanced to Sir Richard Field (namely that the Defendants could not have been dishonest because they disclosed the Weighted Budget) would have been fatally undermined and indeed would have been unarguable. It will therefore be apparent that I am not willing to accept the evidence of the Defendants on important issues unless corroborated by contemporary documents or other evidence or unless clearly consistent with the inherent probabilities. </p>

I did consider, however, that he had a tendency to seek to “spin” some of his answers on important questions so as to paint LMS in a good light and justify what, even on the Defendants’ expert evidence, was the purchase of Updata Europe’s shareholding at a significant undervalue. I was not convinced by his denial that LMS’s offer started from the level of the debt and then used the EBITDA figures to justify it, rather than the other way round. It seemed to me that this was the natural reading of the relevant slide in the presentation which LMS gave on 2 April 2009. This slide started by saying that the “Loan face value of £ 5m sets “base level” expectation for 60% stake”, and then went on to state that the historical, last 12 months and year to date figures gave “ammunition” for a lower valuation. Mr. Hooft had not, as far as I could see, exhibited or disclosed any of LMS’s internal documents relating to the transaction, and it was therefore not possible to test some of Mr. Hooft’s assertions – for example as to how the original offer was calculated, whether certain figures for future earnings prepared by Mr. Szpiro were considered too optimistic, and whether LMS had in fact reached close to the maximum amount that they were prepared to pay for the business – against such materials. I do not suggest that Mr. Hooft was other than an honest witness, but bearing in mind the above matters as well as the fact that Mr. Hooft was giving evidence in relation to matters many years ago and without LMS’s internal documents in front of him, I treat his evidence with a degree of caution. </p>

A number of the issues in the case require more detailed treatment and consideration of the facts, and these are addressed in later sections: Section D, which addresses the 20 April e-mail relied upon by the Claimants in support of their case on deceit and conspiracy; Section E, which addresses the 3 June e-mail; Section F, which addresses a number of aspects of the Defendants’ evidence and conduct at the time; Section G, which addresses inducement. I then turn to consider the arguments on causation (Section H), the fair value of Updata UK (Section I), assignment (Section J) and breach of fiduciary duty (Section K). </p>

In that year, Mr. Johnsen, a Danish citizen, founded Updata Danmark A/S. By 1999, the business of that company was the provision of network solutions to local government authorities in Denmark. It enjoyed a measure of success, winning a large proportion of new tenders for local government contracts in Denmark, although by 2009 it owed substantial amounts to its bank. In 2001, Mr. Henrik Hildebrandt joined Updata Denmark as sales director. </p>

Mr. Johnsen decided to go into business with Mr. Baldorino, who took a 15% share in the company, Updata UK. Mr. Bennett” was Mr. Johnsen’s cousin, and Mr. Johnsen offered him a position at Updata UK together with a 7.5% shareholding. Part of the initial funding for Updata UK was provided by Thomas Nyegaard. Mr. Nyegaard provided a £ 100,000 loan and received 5.1% of the shares. Mr. Johnsen’s shareholding was initially held through Newwatch, but in 2006 this was changed so that  60% of the shares were held by Updata Europe and 12.4% by Newwatch. Thus, by the time of the sale in 2009, the shares in Updata UK were held as follows:  </p>

By early 2007 the shareholders in Updata Europe were Mr. Johnsen, his father Jorgen Johnsen, his mother Kristen Johnsen, Mr. Hildebrandt, Mr. Henrik Bremerskov and Mr. Jens Nielsen. Mr. Nielsen was in due course to play an important part in the events which led to the MBO. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Prior to June 2007, Mr. Nielsen had acted as a director and chairman of Updata UK and Updata Europe. However, in June 2007 Mr. Johnsen took steps to remove Mr. Nielsen from these positions and purchased his 7.5% shareholding, although as matters transpired he defaulted on payment of the full purchase price. By December 2008, Vald. Nielsen had become a shareholder together with the individuals (apart from Mr. Nielsen) identified in the preceding paragraph. Vald. Nielsen was a company which was owned by Jorgen Johnsen and other members of his family, and it (or its subsidiaries) had been the Johnsen family business for nearly 100 years. In due course, it was to become (or purported to become) the assignee of rights of Updata Europe. The assignment was aimed at benefiting the former shareholders of Updata Europe (although not Mr. Bremerskov) who had identified potential claims against the Defendants arising out of the sale in July 2009. By the time that these claims had been identified, these shareholders were no longer the owners of Updata Europe, which had been sold in December 2009 to a company owned by Mr. Esben Bigaard. Mr. Bigaard and his company had no interest in pursuing these potential claims for their own account, and were happy to assign them to Vald. Nielsen. As already outlined, there is a significant issue as to the validity of the assignment as a result of the backdating of the assignment documents. But, unsurprisingly, arguments that the assignment fell foul of English law principles relating to champerty were ultimately abandoned; no doubt in view of the fact that the assignment was intended to benefit the Danish prior shareholders in Updata Europe who had lost out in consequence of the alleged fraud.  </p>

This was a regional Danish bank whose CEO was Mr. Lynge Thang Jorgensen.Updata Europe and Updata Denmark had been customers of the Bank for some time prior the events of 2009, and had gradually built up significant debts. By the time of the sale in July 2009, Updata Denmark owed DKK 14-16 million to the Bank, Updata Europe owed DKK 27 million and had guaranteed the debts of Updata Denmark. The total liability was in the region of DKK 41- 43 million. At the time, the DKK:£ exchange rate was around 8.5:1. The total indebtedness to the Bank was therefore around £ 5 million, inclusive of the guarantee of the debts of Updata Denmark. A further DKK 14 million (around £ 1.6 million) was owed to Vald. Nielsen. </p>

By the end of 2008, the Bank was looking to reduce this exposure, not least because of a general desire to reduce exposures in view of the global financial crisis of late 2008. Indeed, the finances of the Bank itself, as with many banks around the world, were under strain as a result of this crisis and in particular because of problems within a subsidiary bank which was heavily exposed to the property market. </p>

He was the childhood friend of Mr. Johnsen who had provided around £ 100,000 as start-up capital for Updata UK, in return for 5% of the equity (which subsequently grew to 5.1%). He was an investment banker by profession and took an active interest in Updata UK and developed a close relationship with the UK management team, and specifically Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino. He was called as a witness by the Claimants, and much of his evidence as to the events which led to the buyout was not controversial.

Mr. Nyegaard said in his witness statement that Mr. Johnsen came to be considered as the “enemy” by the UK management team. Mr. Bennett wrote a lengthy memo to Mr. Holm, in around February 2008, where he referred to the relationship being characterised “by lack of communication and mutual distrust”. The memo referred to an accusation that the UK team had provided false, incomplete information to the majority shareholders for their own gain, and it went on to deny that this had ever happened: </p>

Mr. Hildebrandt said that whilst the relationship between the UK management and Updata Europe was not the best, he did not believe (speaking of the position in June 2009) that Updata UK would hold back information, and that he “trusted” them. Mr. Holm said that he personally had good communication with the UK management, but did not think that they were “interested in co-operating with the group”.

These companies were seen as a potential drain on Updata UK, and the time of the UK management was spent in fighting internal battles with the shareholders of Updata Europe. </p>

The failure of this route led the UK management and Mr. Nyegaard to believe that the situation, which they regarded as profoundly unsatisfactory, needed to be resolved by replacing or diluting Updata Europe as the majority shareholder of Updata UK. From the UK management’s perspective, the preferred route was a management buyout rather than simply finding a new majority shareholder. Mr. Nyegaard agreed to assist the management team to find a solution that would give them more stability in the day-to-day business of running the company. </p>

This is the financial metric which is particularly relevant to potential investors in companies, with valuations commonly being based upon a multiplier being applied to EBITDA. The Financial Overview therefore indicated that Updata UK was behind budget for the financial year 2009, which by that stage had run for just over 8 months: the company’s financial year ended on 30 June of each year. It also indicated that the company’s “Middle Case” for the following year (i.e. the year ending 30 June 2010) would decline; i.e. reduce from EBITDA of £ 1,496,000 to £ 1,393,000, albeit that the “Best Case” would show an improvement to £ 3,348,000.  </p>

For present purposes, the important features of those exchanges can be summarised as follows. The attachment to the e-mail sent by Tenon following the meeting on 25 February was a document headed “Updata Infrastructure – Due Diligence”. This referred to “[weighted case] budget for the year to 30 June 2010” and the “[weighted case] projections for the year to 30 June 2010”. (The words “[weighted case]” were in square brackets in the document.) The concept of a “weighted” case was that the budget or projection would consider contract opportunities which were available to Updata UK, and give them an appropriate weighting to reflect the likelihood of a successful outcome and the consequent income generation.  This was a concept familiar to Updata UK, and in particular Mr. Baldorino who had developed his own system of weighting which depended upon the stage which a particular proposed project had reached.  </p>

It showed, in a digestible format: (i) the identity of the contracting counterparty; (ii) the value of each contact; (iii) the prospect (in a column headed “Probability”) of the contract being won by Updata UK expressed as a percentage, with a commentary on the stage reached in the negotiations; and (iv) the identity of nine contracts with 100% prospects (i.e. the contracts had been won by Updata UK albeit not yet formalised). </p>

These budget documents were authored by Mr. Mantell (as shown on the metadata), and were based on Mr. Baldorino’s weighted pipeline. Mr. Mantell circulated a number of versions of a 2009/10 weighted budget on 25 March 2009: see further Section E below. The final version, referred to at trial (and herein) as the “March Weighted Budget” was circulated at 8.50 pm that night. This showed EBITDA figures for the 2009/2010 which were in excess of £ 6 million. The EBITDA figures were not shown as such in the budget documents, but are to be derived by adding back the figure for “depreciation” to the figure for “profit before tax”; the latter figure having originally been calculated after deduction of depreciation. The depreciation figure was £ 1,057,918, and the figure for “Profit before bank expenses” was £ 5,012,270. Using these figures, the EBITDA was £ 6,070 million. An alternative calculation was to add the depreciation figure to the figure for “Profit before exceptional items” (£ 4,981,305). This would produce EBITDA of £ 6,039 million. The relatively small difference between £ 6,070 million and £ 6,039 million was the inclusion of bank charges of £ 31,000.  </p>

Nielsen (the “private individual” referred to in the above passage). It seems, however, that (as the Claimants submitted) this was not appreciated by those on the MBO side at the time. They proceeded on the basis that the Bank was owed around £ 3 million (or DKK 26 million), which was secured by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> ranking charges on the shares, with a further sum of around £ 1.5 million owed to Vald. Nielsen and secured by a 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ranking charge sitting in between the Bank’s debt. That meant that in order to pay off the Bank’s DKK 26m debt in full, any offer would need to cover the sums owed to Vald. Nielsen as well. Nobody on the MBO side appears to have appreciated that the true extent of Updata Europe’s liability to the Bank included the sums owed by Updata Denmark  to the Bank and guaranteed by Updata Europe. </p>

The true position, so the Claimants contend, is that Mr. Bennett knew that the Financial Overview was not the latest budget. The management’s real expectation for 2008/2009 was for the higher figures which can be seen in the Tenon memorandum, and their real expectation for 2009/2010 was the higher figures in the March Weighted Budget which was also reflected in the Tenon memorandum.

They also offered the EVs the opportunity for them to “rollover” part of their interests into the new company: Newwatch could roll over its entire 12.4% interest; Updata Europe could retain a 10% interest in the newco.  </p>

It was therefore a substantially lower figure than the forecast in the March Weighted Budget and used in the Tenon Memorandum.

Notwithstanding the advice of Tenon, these did not include all of the documents which “you as directors have supplied to Lee/Tenon in the course of them preparing a report for you (including any pipeline info)”. For example, there was no dispute that the Data Room was not populated with the pipeline document which Mr. Baldorino had prepared in March, and which was then used for the purposes of preparing the March Weighted Budget. The most significant omission, at least until a very late stage in the process, was the March Weighted Budget. This budget, whilst not included in the Data Room, was provided on the 6 July CD, sent to Corren Troen by Mr Mantell. </p>

Those arguments are now principally relevant to issues relating to the Defendants’ credibility, since it is no longer contended that the mistaken disclosure of the Weighted Budget at the very end of the process can realistically provide any answer to the case in fraud. I deal with the relevance of the summary judgment / strike out application, and the Defendants’ case presented to Sir Richard Field, in Section F below.  </p>

LMS provided signed heads of terms, an exclusivity agreement and proof of funds (showing £ 15 million held with HSBC). LMS offered, subject to contract, to purchase the entire company at a value of DKK 76.6 million (£ 8.8m): this was the same figure as they had offered on 15 May 2009. Mr. Bennett, Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Nyegaard would receive shares in the purchasing vehicle instead of cash. The EVs would have the option to roll over part of the consideration by acquiring up to 17.36% in the purchasing vehicle. They would retain the option to acquire shares in the purchasing vehicle for a year after the sale, but at a decreasing percentage every month. </p>

They also sought to negotiate the finer points of the sale. The parties’ lawyers (Corren Troen for EVs; Nabarro for LMS; Rosenblatt for Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino) worked on the contractual documentation. Some features of the work carried out are relevant to the issues in the case, in particular the dispute between the accounting experts as to the market value of Updata Europe’s shareholding at the material time. It is not necessary to describe this work in any detail. However, it is relevant to note that there is no suggestion that the financial and commercial due diligence caused the Defendants, or indeed LMS, to downgrade their expectations as to the future prospects of the business.  </p>

Mr. Szpiro explained that he had given some consideration to the “outer year figures as these will ultimately drive value on exit.” He explained that his assumptions were conservative and “essentially build on the 2010 figures for “current”, “in the Bag” and “Weighted” (as per Julian’s model, although there are small differences if trying to reconcile) including further contract wins (called “New”) which are not in the pipeline.” Mr. Szpiro’s spreadsheet showed the following:  </p>

It received £ 5,244 million for its 60% interest in the company. Newwatch “rolled over” its interests into the newco, Updata Holdings: it used the nominal consideration payable to them for their shares in Updata UK to subscribe for shares and apply for loan notes in Updata Holdings. Thus, Newwatch acquired: 63,046 “B” shares in Updata Holdings; £ 699,091 “A” loan notes and £ 349,546 “B” loan notes in Updata Holdings; and an option to acquire further shares and loan notes at any point in a period up to July 2010.  </p>

It also paid certain professional fees due to Corren Troen and others.

This is the principal case that has been pursued before me and which I need to resolve, although the Claimants also advance claims for breach of fiduciary duty.

That involves considering whether a reasonable representee in the position and with the known characteristics of the actual representee would reasonably have understood that an implied representation was being made and being made substantially in the terms or to the effect alleged. The test for implied representations has recently been reviewed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Property Alliance Group Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland PLC</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 355; [2018] 1 WLR 3259 at paragraphs [122] to [132]. The Court of Appeal approved as “helpful” a formulation of Colman J in a previous decision, namely “whether a reasonable representee would naturally assume that the true state of facts did not exist and that, had it existed, he would in all the circumstances necessarily have been informed of it”. But this was not to “water down the requirement that there must be clear words or clear conduct of the representor from which the relevant representation can be implied.” </p>

This issue was not directly addressed in <span style="font-style:italic">BV Nederlandse</span>, although Longmore LJ did refer to the relevant part of Lord Clarke’s judgment: see [42]. The inducement issue in <span style="font-style:italic">BV Nederlandse </span>was determined in the claimant’s favour because the representation was “one of the reasons why the representee made the relevant contract”: see [49]. It seems to me that this – combined with the statements that “it is very difficult to rebut the presumption” – indicates that it is not appropriate to try to measure the precise weight of a representation where it is one of the reasons why a representee has entered a contract. If the representation is of no real significance, then a court will decline to hold that it was one of the reasons which induced the contract. If, however, it was a matter of significance, the decision will be the other way. </p>

The subject matter of the e-mail request, and of the response, was “Latest budget”, also in Danish. The evidence of Mr. Johnsen, which was not disputed in this respect, was that the word “budget” in Danish was used synonymously with “forecast” or “projection”, and that there was only one word in Danish for it. Mr. Bennett, in response, provided the Financial Overview, which set out the “Forecasts” for 2009 (EBITDA £ 1,496,000) and the best, middle and worst case “Budget” for 2009/2010 (EBITDA £ 1,348,000; £ 1,393,000, and £ 1,129,000). The body of the e-mail refers to “the projections”, and then says: “Please see attached”.

The request was one made by the founder of the business in the context of a possible sale of Updata UK following an offer received only a few days earlier. This is relevant context. There was additional context, known to both Mr. Bennett and Mr. Johnsen, that Mr. Johnsen was looking for an outside investor and was coming to the UK for that purpose. The figures were requested from, and provided by, a senior executive director of Updata UK in response to what was obviously an important request, made by Mr. Johnsen, naturally arising from the circumstances of a possible sale or investment. The projections were presented in the format of a detailed table containing not only a projection for 2008/2009 against the original “Budget”, but a series of forecasts for 2009/2010 indicating variation between the best, middle and worst cases.  </p>

Indeed, this is a classic case where, as discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell </span>paragraph 18-13, a party provides a representation of his opinion as to what will happen in the future, and the law has no difficulty in saying that the opinion must be honestly entertained at the time that it is made. For reasons explained hereafter, I consider that this representation alone is sufficient for the purposes of the Claimants’ case based upon deceit in relation to the 20 April e-mail.

The formulation of this representation can be criticised because, in the context of a forecast as to what results will be in the future, it is inappropriate to say that the figures are “correct”; at least if “correct” means that what will actually happen in the future. However, the Claimants did not contend that this pleaded representation was to be understood in that rather literal way. Rather, this pleading is intended to reflect the type of representation discussed in paragraph 18-14 of <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell; </span>namely a representation that by expressing an opinion (here as to the future results), the representor impliedly states that he believes that facts exist which reasonably justify it. I consider that in the circumstances of this case – where the senior Updata UK management knew the up-to-date information and where there was an imbalance of information between the management and the representatives of Updata Europe – such a representation was made. Indeed, this is in my view the substance of the representation pleaded if the words “to be correct” were omitted: i.e. a representation that the UK management had a reasonable basis for believing the figures included in the Financial Overview.  </p>

I do not consider that this exchange can be read as being a representation as to the way in which LMS had calculated their offer. However, to my mind, the final sentence of the e-mail serves to reinforce my conclusion as to the meaning of the second sentence (see paragraph 180 above); i.e. that Mr. Bennett was referring to the projections which had been provided to LMS by Updata UK’s management  and that these were the projections which had been used, in the sense of being considered or evaluated, by LMS in deciding upon their offer. This is because the reference to “adjustments” only makes sense if they are adjustments to figures which have been given to LMS.

Mr. Johnsen accepted in cross-examination that it was the LMS offer letter which had prompted his e-mail. (This is a point which is relevant to inducement, as I shall describe below: see Section G). The substance of Mr. Choo Choy’s argument was that Mr. Bennett’s response was simply addressing the derivation of the figures in the passage from the LMS offer letter. Thus, the first sentence referred expressly to the “numbers used by LMS”. The second sentence, referring to the “projections” used, was only a reference to the column in the Profit and Loss Account headed “Budget 2009”, which identified that the Budget for 2009 was £ 1,695,000. The LMS letter referred to progress being required to “achieve budget results for June 2009”, and this was the only projection to which Mr. Bennett was referring. The logic of this submission, from which Mr. Choo Choy did not shrink, is that Mr. Bennett was declining to respond to Mr. Johnsen’s request for the “latest budget for Updata UK for 2008/9, 2009/10 and 2010/11”, and was providing no information at all in response to that request. </p>

Any reasonable reader would understand that Mr. Bennett was indeed responding to the request for the latest budgets, albeit that he did not provide a figure for 2010/2011.

The word “projections” might possibly be said to encompass the figure for the 2008/9 “Budget”, although given that the forecast (£ 1,496,000) was substantially behind budget (£ 1,695,000), the “budget” figure in that context would be understood to have been an earlier projection rather than the “latest” figures which were what Mr. Johnsen was asking for. On any view, however, the reference to “projections” in the e-mail was not confined to the earlier budget figure for 2008/9. Had Mr. Bennett’s intention been simply to convey information as to that earlier budget, then there was no reason to send the Financial Overview in that form, containing other forecasts. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr. Choo Choy’s argument in the present context focused heavily on the word “used” (i.e. the projections used by LMS), when read in conjunction with the relevant section of the LMS offer letter.  There was, however, an obvious difficulty (as Mr. Choo Choy’s submissions accepted) in identifying any projections “used” in the LMS offer letter itself. The explanation of the offer contained in the relevant part of the LMS letter was not based upon projections at all. Rather, LMS were referring to historic results. They referred to the “YTD February 2009 results”: this was a reference to Updata Europe’s financial year to date, namely the 8 months from July 2008 to February 2009. LMS also referred to the “actual run rate results of the company (12 months to 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Feb 2009)”: this was a reference to the results from 1 March 2008 to 28 February 2009. Therefore the offer letter did not “use” any forward projections, in the sense of basing the offer on forward projections. The letter did refer to the 2009 budget in the sentence: “significant progress is still required to achieve budget results for June 2009”. But I agree with the Claimants that it is an extraordinary interpretation of the 20 April e-mail to treat the reference to the “projections used” as being a cross-reference to this particular reference to the 2009 budget in the LMS letter, whilst ignoring everything else in the Financial Overview. I do not consider that this is how any reasonable reader would understand the e-mail and specifically the reference to “projections used”. In context, and as already explained above, I consider that this would have been understood to be a statement that the projections in the Financial Overview had been given to LMS and used, in the sense of being considered or evaluated, by LMS in deciding upon their offer.  </p>

As further discussed below, the Defendants argued – both in their written opening and written closing – that the reference to the “projections used” was indeed a reference to one of the projections contained in the Financial Overview; namely the figure of £ 1,496 million which was set out as the “Forecast 2009”. Their argument was that this was the same “projection” that had been used in the LMS offer letter. As described below, it was only after this argument was revealed to be a bad point that the Defendants sought to suggest that the “projections” could only have been a reference to the budget referred to in the LMS offer letter. </p>

The Defendants argued, in substance: that forecasting was uncertain; that any forecasts necessarily involved the use of assumptions; that Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Homann had previously been given not simply the Financial Overview, but also the assumptions upon which it was based; and that nothing could be read into the statements about “best”, “middle” and “worst” cases in the Financial Overview beyond the proposition that these were forecasts based on certain specific assumptions.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It was also argued that the concepts of “Best case”, “Middle case” and “Worst case” are too uncertain to be ascribed any meaning, at least beyond a representation that certain assumptions have been made. I disagree. I have already referred to the evidence of Mr. Hooft and Mr. Bennett in relation to these concepts: see Section B above. I agree with the Claimants that a “best” case would ordinarily be understood to be the realistic “best case”, and a worst case understood to be the realistic “worst case”. If a range from “worst” to “best” is provided, the reasonable reader would understand that the range encompasses all the reasonable assumptions that could be made at either end of the scale. The “middle” case would be understood as indicating the management’s expectation as to where, on that scale, the results were considered to be most likely to land. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Accordingly, there is nothing in the Defendants’ submissions which persuades me that the paragraph 48 (2) representation should be rejected. I next turn to the representation, based upon paragraph 48 (1), that UK management believed that facts existed which reasonably justified the figures included in the Financial Overview. I should note that in view of my findings below that there was a fraudulent misrepresentation as to the opinions held by the UK management, the paragraph 48 (1) representation is not crucial in this case. Such representations are likely to be more important in cases where the Claimants are unable to prove that opinions put forward were not genuinely held. Nevertheless, apart from the criticism that paragraph 48 (1), with its reference to the figures being “correct”, was too broadly pleaded, it did not seem to me that the Defendants had any real answer to the substance of the representation relied upon. Their principal argument was that such a representation, with its reference to “reasonable basis for believing”, was in practice an allegation of negligence, and that such a case was not permissible in view of the decision of Sir Richard Field to strike out negligence claims. I disagree. As <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> makes clear, there can in principle be a fraudulent representation by a person expressing an opinion who thereby impliedly states that he believes that facts exist which reasonably justify it. If “he does not actually believe in such facts, it follows that he will be liable in deceit”. </p>

It is not necessary to discuss in detail whether this was a misrepresentation, because – as the Defendants rightly pointed out including in brief submissions made in writing subsequent to closing – the various representations pleaded in paragraph 48 did not include an allegation of misrepresentation in relation to this first sentence, and indeed did not appear to be based upon it.

The first was the result for the year to date (i.e. commencing on 1 July 2008) as at February 2009. The numbers which LMS used (sales £ 6 million against budget of £ 8.6 million and EBITDA of £ 0.8 million against budget of £ 1.3 million) were in fact taken from the Tenon Data Pack. The relevant figures, which LMS rounded, appear on page 5, which is headed: “Management expect to exceed budget for FY09 by £ 0.8m with volatile pipeline reversing YTD trend”. It is true to say that the figures for sales of £ 6 million, and EBITDA of £ 0.8 million against budget of £ 1.3 million, can be seen or derived from the information in the pages of the management accounts which Mr. Bennett sent Mr. Johnsen. But the figure of £ 8.6 million was not contained in those numbers (the equivalent figure was £ 8.1 million), and perhaps more importantly there is no documentary or other evidence that LMS were ever given the management accounts sent to Mr. Johnsen. </p>

By that time, Updata UK’s management, in particular Mr. Mantell, had taken a very careful look at the figures in order to decide what numbers could properly be given to prospective investors in order to persuade them to offer to purchase the business. The March Weighted budget, which had been preceded by a number of iterations and eventually gave the figures seen in the Tenon Memorandum and Data Pack, did contain the figures in which the management believed and which represented their genuine forecasts at that time. (In the following Section E, I describe in more detail the process which led to the March Weighted Budget). That was why those figures were given to a large number of potential investors in the market. In so far as the Defendants gave evidence that they did not believe in the figures which were given to the market via the Tenon Memorandum and Data Pack, I regard that evidence as unreliable and reject it. (I deal in more detail below, in Section F, with my assessment of the evidence given by the Defendants). It involves the proposition that Mr. Johnsen was the only party to whom the Defendants gave their genuine opinion as to the prospects for Updata UK, and that neither Tenon nor the other market participants were given the management team’s genuine opinion. This is in my view the converse of the factual position. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Given the terms of the e-mail request, and Mr. Bennett’s response, it is obvious in my view that Mr. Bennett intended to make the representations to Mr. Johnsen. Those representations are, in my view the ordinary objective interpretation of the words used in the e-mail; i.e. the way in which the words would be understood by a reasonable recipient in Mr. Johnsen’s position. I have addressed and rejected the various different interpretations of the words used which have been advanced in the course of argument on behalf of the Defendants. I do not believe that any of those different interpretations would have occurred to Mr. Bennett at the time. It is certainly possible, at least in theory, for a person to make a written representation without intending the representation to be understood in the manner in which the words would be ordinarily be interpreted. However, the court would then need to be persuaded by credible evidence that the representor did understand the words used in a different sense. There was in my view no such evidence in this case, and indeed the thrust of Mr. Bennett’s evidence was not that he had some peculiar interpretation of the words which he was using in his 20 April e-mail, but rather that he genuinely believed in the figures being put forward; or at least genuinely believed in the “best case” figures (because he accepted that the “middle case” figures were particularly pessimistic). I deal with this issue below. But as far as intention to represent is concerned, I have no doubt that Mr. Bennett did intend Mr. Johnsen to understand that the figures provided in the Financial Overview were the management’s current figures, and that these were the figures which had been given to LMS and used by them in considering what offer to make. If a senior executive such as Mr. Bennett gives a set of figures to the founder of the business, and a representative of the majority shareholder, he will also know that the figures would be understood to represent the management’s genuine views and that there was a proper basis for those figures. </p>

The e-mail from Mr. Johnsen was clearly an important request for information, coming as it did only a few working days after the LMS offer and at a time when Mr. Johnsen was known by Mr. Bennett to be seeking outside investment. It was also unusual, in that the documents referred to at trial did not indicate that Mr. Johnsen was regularly making requests for documentation. Mr. Bennett gave careful thought to how he should respond, because he took the trouble to obtain the management accounts and then to remove certain pages from them. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I also have no doubt that Mr. Bennett knew that he was making deliberately false statements to Mr. Johnsen. The reason that he wanted to do this was straightforward. He wanted the LMS bid to succeed, because he perceived this to be in the best interests of himself and the other members of the Updata UK management team. His hope, and the hope of LMS, had been for a sale to be effected at around the level of what they understood to be Updata Europe’s debt. It was in fact Mr. Bennett who had drafted the relevant section of the Tenon Memorandum which described the “opportunity” by reference to the debt, and the possibility of acquiring the company for less than the par value of that debt. He knew that LMS had put forward an offer which reflected a valuation multiple of 6.1 applied to EBITDA of £ 1.5 million. There had been disappointment on the very morning of 20 April when Mr. Holm’s letter had come in, and the strategy developed that morning was to make contact with the Bank’s lawyers in the hope that the Bank would see the full benefits of the offer made which would result in substantial repayment to the Bank. I have no doubt that Mr. Bennett did not want to reveal to Mr. Johnsen the very much more positive outlook (compared to the Financial Overview), both for the current year and for 2009/10. To do so would have potentially very undesirable consequences for the success of the LMS bid. If the management’s expectation of EBITDA for 2009/10 of £ 6.070 million were revealed, it would naturally indicate that the price offered by LMS as set out in the LMS letter was an undervalue. That offer reflected an EBITDA of only £ 1.5 million. In addition, the better the expected results, the more likely it would be that the company would attract other investors and higher offers, including from Mr. Nielsen whom was regarded by the Defendants as a most undesirable purchaser. Mr. Bennett knew that Mr. Johnsen was coming to the UK in order to try to raise additional investment, as contemplated by the “Project Eagle” proposal on which Mr. Bennett had commented (and rejected) on the morning of 20 April. Mr. Bennett wanted to do nothing which would encourage a successful result to Mr. Johnsen’s efforts. (I return to the evidence relating to the Defendants’ motive in Section F below). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, if Updata Europe were given to understand that the budget for the current financial year (which ended around 6 weeks after the 20 April e-mail) would likely be outperformed, and that the forecast EBITDA for the following year would be in the region of £ 6 million, this might have impacted on Updata Europe’s willingness or need to sell at all; since it would raise the possibility that Updata UK would be sufficiently cash-generative in the near future to enable dividends to be paid and thereby monies repaid to the Bank. The issue of whether Updata UK could or should pay a dividend had been an issue considered in the period prior to the 20 April e-mail, with the Defendants strongly opposed to such payment.  Mr. Bennett would have been aware of this potential impact of a good set of forecasts at the time that he sent the 20 April e-mail. Indeed, on 29 April 2009 he sent an e-mail to Mr. Kidson, referring to a statement in Updata Europe’s accounts about a dividend payment from Updata UK, and expressing the view that non-payment of the dividend might mean that the Bank “deem this a breach and call in its security”. The e-mail as a whole reflects Mr. Bennett’s desire that the Bank should make life difficult for Updata Europe. He noted that if a dividend was declared, Updata UK would no longer be a going concern, and </p>

The figures were readily available, since they had been prepared by Updata UK’s management (in particular Mr. Mantell) and had been given to Tenon and used in the Tenon Memorandum and Data Pack. So there was no difficulty in Mr. Bennett identifying what the figures were. But he decided to give the different figures set out in the Financial Overview. He knew that the management’s current expectation was for much higher figures, both for 2008/9 and 2009/10. He knew that the management expected the results for 2009/10 to exceed by some considerable margin all of the figures shown in the Financial Overview for that year. He knew that the “middle case” was a very long way from the management’s forecasted results. Indeed, he accepted in evidence that the “middle case” figures were “extraordinarily pessimistic”, whilst maintaining that at the time that he sent the Financial Overview he was not actually aware of the assumptions on which those figures were based. He had in my view no reason at all to think that LMS had been given the Financial Overview, since he knew that the figures given to all potential investors were much higher. I consider that the response which Mr. Bennett gave was dishonest, in the sense in which dishonesty is required for the purposes of a claim in deceit.  </p>

Hence, it was submitted that there was a valid rationale for not providing the latest figures which had been given to Tenon, and that there can have been no dishonesty on the part of Mr. Bennett or the other Defendants.

However, even if (which I do not accept) there had been some belief at that stage that the figures given to Tenon were the management’s figures and therefore did not have to be disclosed, it was still necessary for Mr. Bennett to give an answer to the questions which Mr. Johnsen had raised, and to do so honestly. I accept the Claimants’ submission that Mr. Johnsen’s request for the latest budget presented Mr. Bennett with a choice. He could provide the latest budget figures, which were those which had been given to Tenon. He could provide something else (as he did), but with an explanation that there was a budget prepared for the MBO that was not being provided, and explaining his position in that regard.  Or he could provide something else without any explanation that information was being withheld. The first option risked derailing the MBO, since it would cast doubt on the price which LMS was offering to pay, would potentially assist Mr. Johnsen in raising alternative investment, and potentially have the other impacts described above. The second option risked the latest figures, including the March Weighted Budget, being flushed out by direct requests for its disclosure. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the management could realistically have maintained a position that they were not prepared to provide the latest budgets to the board of Updata UK (where the Danish representatives were in the majority) or to the majority shareholder. Ultimately, the board could have insisted that the management should provide up-to-date figures. The last option involved lying to Mr. Johnsen but improving the prospects of the MBO succeeding. This is the option that Mr. Bennett chose. </p>

Neither the Claimants’ opening or closing contained any reference to any evidence from Mr. Johnsen on this point, and Mr. Bennett could not recall saying this. Mr. Baldorino denied saying this. I do not think that the evidence as to this representation is sufficiently strong to enable me to come to any conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, as to what was said.

The Defendants contended that this was not the case, and that they had successfully rebutted the presumption of inducement by showing that the 20 April e-mail was not a real and substantial inducing cause. It is again appropriate to address this issue after considering the developments following 20 April, and in conjunction with figures in the Updated Kelso Presentation which were provided on 3 June, not least because the Defendants’ argument drew heavily upon those events as negating inducement (Section G below). There are also issues as to whether Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Mantell, who were not copied into the e-mail exchange on 20 April, can be held liable for Mr. Bennett’s deceit. I deal with this issue in Section F, in the context of my further consideration of the Defendants’ evidence. </p>

To some extent this point was advanced in the context of the 20 April e-mail. But there was no positive evidence from the Defendants that, in the context of the 20 April e-mail, this point was something which motivated the response: see Section D above. However the case that the March Weighted Budget was proprietary to the Defendants featured significantly in the evidence which was given in relation to the 3 June e-mail and indeed generally. Indeed, in his oral evidence, Mr. Mantell went even further, suggesting that the Weighted Budget contained “Tenon’s numbers”.

It is not clear what figures were actually provided, but this is not material. What is clear, as Mr. Mantell accepted in evidence, is that the “provision of financial information and answer of information by Tenon had already started by 16 March [2009].” On that day, Mr. Castledine of Tenon e-mailed Mr. Bennett setting out his “analysis of revenue and cash flows by project based on the budget pack”. The attachment to the e-mail showed that Tenon were working on a weighted case for sales of £ 16.24 million, and EBITDA of £ 3.799 million. </p>

He asked Mr. Mantell to give a breakdown of the “weighted prospects for 09/10 for each customer so I am able to illustrate where the £ 8.7m is coming from”. The figure of £ 8.7 million in weighted prospects for 2009/10 was taken from figures which were attached to the e-mail, and which were materially identical to those attached to Mr. Castledine’s e-mail of 16 March. So at that point, Tenon were working from “weighted” figures for FY10 of £ 16.24 million in turnover and £ 3.77 million in EBITDA. At 4.25pm Mr. Helman e-mailed Mr. Mantell to ask him for a summary of the 2005 – 2010 figures. He required “Revenue, Cost of Sales, Overheads and EBIT”. At 4.53pm Mr. Mantell replied attaching the “Financial Overview”. The “Best case” figure of £ 3.348 million set out in that document was about 10% lower than the EBITDA figure of £ 3.77 million which Tenon had used in their e-mails of 16 and 23 March. </p>

Equally, however, it is clear that the figures for the 2009/10 year in that Financial Overview were not included in the Tenon Memorandum, or indeed any draft of the Tenon Memorandum. Instead, at around this time or very shortly afterwards, detailed work was beginning on what became the March Weighted Budget, in order to have up-to-date figures for 2009/10 for inclusion in the IM. Whilst the key historic figures in the Tenon Memorandum for the years ending June 2006, June 2007 and June 2008 are materially identical to those in the Financial Overview, the forecast for the years ended 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2010 were materially different. (By way of reminder: for 2009, the EBITDA was £ 1.694 million in the Tenon Memorandum as compared to £ 1.496 million in the Financial Overview. For 2010, the respective figures were £ 1.393 million (middle case) and £ 3.348 million (best case) compared to £ 6.071 million.)  </p>

He also agreed that it could “well have been” that the intention was to update the figures in the Financial Overview in order to populate the blank table that Tenon had provided. He agreed that it was therefore not simply a question of transposing the figures from the Financial Overview into the blank table. Indeed, I note that even after receiving the Financial Overview on 23 March, Mr. Helman e-mailed Mr. Mantell at 18.28 on 23 March 2009 saying that he would “require historical and forecast figures for IM as we discussed …”. Mr. Mantell also agreed “that whatever figures you are going to put in here are figures that you would regard as reasonably reliable”. He accepted that this was because he knew that “what Tenon wanted is what you really thought would happen”. Again, I consider that this must have been the case.  </p>

On 25 March 2009, at 8.50 pm, the “Budget 2009-2010 (weighted case) (v2)” was circulated to both Mr. Bennett and Tenon, under cover of an e-mail from Mr. Mantell. The EBITDA figure which could be calculated from the figures in the Profit and Loss account in that budget was £ 6.039 million (if based upon “Profit before exceptional items”) or marginally in excess of £ 6.070 million (if based upon “Profit before bank expenses”). The figure eventually included in the Tenon Memorandum was the latter figure, rounded up to £ 6.071 million. </p>

At 13.49 he circulated a further version which showed the same figures. Then, Mr. Mantell received Mr. Baldorino’s detailed analysis of the pipeline, which listed and assigned probabilities to each contract (either 100%, 70%, 50%, 30% or 10%). He then created the March Weighted Budget, incorporating and using the substance of Mr. Baldorino’s contract information which had been provided that afternoon to both Mr. Mantell and Tenon.  </p>

He was therefore in my view endorsing the figures in the March Weighted Budget. His reference to “seems more like it” may have been a reference to the fact that the higher figures sent earlier that day were (as he said in evidence) not sustainable, or may have been referable to the lower figures which had been contained in the Financial Overview. But what is clear is that Mr. Bennett was comfortable with the reasonableness of the figures contained in the March Weighted Budget. Indeed, I consider that all members of the management team must have been comfortable with those figures, or they could not properly have allowed them to be presented to the market. On 8 April, Mr. Bennett responded to some points of detail made by one potential investor (Lloyd’s </p>

The e-mail correspondence on 25 March does indicate that Mr. Castledine was, at lunchtime, heading to Updata’s offices in Reigate. No witness from Tenon gave evidence in support of the case that the March Weighted Budget was in substance a joint management/ Tenon document. On the afternoon of 25 March 2009, Mr. Castledine raised one particular point, saying that he would “await Julian’s figures to confirm”. This confirms that the figures being produced were regarded by Tenon as those of Mr. Mantell (i.e. “Julian’s figures”) rather than their own. Since Tenon were financial advisers, it is possible that Mr. Mantell may, as he carried out his work which culminated in the March Weighted </p>

However, I see no reason why this would necessarily have happened, given that the UK management knew the business and knew how to prepare budgets with appropriate weighting. But even if there were some interaction between Mr. Mantell and Tenon as Mr. Mantell carried out his work, it would not mean that the March Weighted Budget was in any sense a joint document, as opposed to a document prepared by management and which Tenon would evaluate and review. Indeed, when Mr. Mantell did circulate the March Weighted Budget, he did so under cover of an email sent to Mr. Bennett, and copied to Mr. Castledine and Mr. Helman, saying: “Please find enclosed draft numbers for your review”. This is consistent with the March Weighted Budget being a document prepared by Updata UK’s management, with Tenon having a review function. Mr. Mantell suggested that Tenon were at times sitting alongside him as he filled in the spreadsheets, but there is no documentary or other corroborative evidence to support this, and for reasons which appear in this judgment I do not consider Mr. Mantell to be a reliable witness. </p>

The first meeting was due to start at 10.30 am. The Tenon Memorandum had obviously not been completed at this point, and Mr. Bennett and Mr. Mantell corresponded early that morning in relation to a Powerpoint presentation. Although Mr. Baldorino said that he couldn’t remember whether this Powerpoint had been used on a “roadshow”, I consider it likely that this was the document used in the discussions with the potential investors that morning. At 8.22 am, Mr. Bennett e-mailed the original Kelso Presentation to Mr. Mantell. At 8.30 am Mr. Mantell replied, using the subject-line: “Done again”. The final slide was headed “Financial Projections”. It had a column headed “Forecast 2010”, and the figures were revised by Mr. Mantell so as to reflect those contained in the March Weighted Budget which had been sent out on the previous night. The “Forecast 2010” was therefore EBITDA of £ 6.039 million based on turnover of £ 19.039 million and Net Profit of £ 4.981 million. In light of subsequent events and the 3 June e-mail, it is important to note that this figure was presented as the “Forecast”, not as the “Best Case”. </p>

It was prepared by Updata UK’s head of finance, Mr. Mantell, during company time, on a company computer. It was based on company information, in respect of which the Defendants owed confidentiality obligations to the company, about company contracts, company expenses and company pipeline opportunities. It was based on information provided by company directors and employees. In particular, the information about the “in the bag” and “weighted” contracts (including their value and duration) was based on the pipeline circulated by Mr. Baldorino to management and then to Tenon on 25 March. Mr. Bennett accepted in evidence that this pipeline information was part of the company’s business and part of the information that it needed to run that business. </p>

I have no doubt that the March Weighted Budget did contain the management’s genuine view as to the results for 2009/10. It was a document which was carefully prepared because Tenon and the market needed to know what the management really thought; i.e. what they thought that they would “really do”. As Mr. Mantell agreed, whatever figures were going to be included in the blank table in the Tenon memorandum were figures that he would regard as reasonably reliable. It was put to Mr. Baldorino in cross-examination that, in relation to the figures in the Tenon Data Pack, the figures represented the realistic view of management. He agreed.  </p>

The figure of EBITDA in excess of £ 6 million was included in the revised Kelso Presentation Powerpoint prepared on the morning of 26 March as a “forecast”, and in my view represented the management’s view as to the most likely result for 2009/10; i.e. what they really thought. This is consistent with the fact that the figures which were in this region, or higher, were contained in other documents produced in the course of the summer, and those contained in the Tenon Due Diligence report were ultimately warranted by the Defendants: see Section D above.   </p>

Their response was to say: all documents, other than the Tenon Memorandum itself. I reject Mr. Mantell’s evidence that the March Weighted Budget numbers were Tenon’s figures. I accept that Tenon were likely to have reviewed the figures provided, since that would be an important part of their role as a financial adviser. But there is no evidence that they changed anything.

It was never deliberately put into the Data Room. But the Claimants also pointed out, correctly, that there were other documents which were supplied to Tenon or LMS in the period before that representation was made, and which also were never put into the Data Room. Mr. Baldorino’s pipeline document, circulated on the afternoon of 25 March, was one such document. In addition, on 13 May 2009, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino met with LMS.  Following that meeting, Mr. Mantell e-mailed Mr. Hooft on 15 May with information “as requested”. The documents attached to his e-mail contained breakdowns on turnover, installation and rental revenue and margins in respect of the company’s FY10 contracts. Mr. Bennett agreed that this was company information and that, if requested, it was “part of all the information you’d expect to provide as part of due diligence to a potential purchaser.” Neither the pipeline document, nor the information given to LMS on 15 May, was given to the EVs or included in the Data Room. </p>

His oral evidence was that he and Mr. Bennett would both have been anticipating a data room process, even though this may not yet have been specified by the Bank. It may be that, ten years on, Mr. Nyegaard is mistaken about the timing of this conversation and that it took place after Mr. Jorgensen’s email of 20 May 2009.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr. Birkeland’s evidence was that Mr. Bennett initially claimed that no such business plan or financial projections existed. Mr. Birkeland told Mr. Bennett that he could not imagine that, if UK management had been meeting potential buyers, they had done so without some kind of information memorandum or business plan setting out the financial projections and other financial information about the company. Mr. Bennett then said that they did, in fact, have an information memorandum that had been produced by Tenon, but that it belonged to UK management and had been paid for by them. Again, this aspect of Mr. Birkeland’s evidence was not challenged, and I accept it. It was therefore common ground that the Defendants made it clear, at the meeting, that the Tenon Memorandum itself would not be provided.  </p>

He agreed that he did not say that “he was not going to give certain information which had been given to Tenon”. His evidence was that he did not remember referring to the “Tenon suite of documents” at the meeting, and in my judgment he did not. Had he done so, that would have provoked questions as to what comprised this “suite” of documents; a question to which the Defendants gave somewhat different answers in the course of their evidence. Moreover, I do not consider that Mr. Bennett by this time (or by the time that he sent the 3 June e-mail) had in mind any concept of a “Tenon suite of documents”. This phrase seems to have first emerged well into the litigation, and was used in Mr. Bennett’s third witness statement (paragraph 119) for, as far as I can see, the first time. There is no contemporaneous reference in the documents reference to this concept. Nor do I consider that the other Defendants had this concept in mind in May or June 2009. </p>

Mr. Birkeland’s evidence (which again in this respect was not challenged) was that there was then some discussion about the Kelso Presentation, which Mr. Birkeland knew about and recalled. This was in the nature of a business plan (as Mr. Bennett’s 3 June e-mail recognises) and there was some discussion about how this could be updated. Mr. Birkeland’s evidence was that he suggested to Mr. Bennett that they should update the Kelso Presentation so as to have the same financial highlights, projections and conclusions as the Tenon Memorandum. He went on to say, in his witness statement, that Mr. Bennett gave an assurance that he would do that, but (as the Defendants fairly pointed out in their written closing) his oral evidence was more equivocal as to whether there was such an assurance. I do not think that this particular dispute, as to whether there was an assurance, is of any consequence. The subsequent correspondence, including the 3 June e-mail itself, indicates that Mr. Bennett did indeed update the Kelso Presentation. It is reasonable to conclude that the idea of doing so was discussed at the 29 May meeting, albeit that it is not possible – particularly given the passage of time – for me to conclude that there was any particular assurance as to exactly how this updating would occur. </p>

He said that he agreed to Mr. Birkeland’s request on the “basis of this understanding”. He said that this was also consistent “with Tenon’s advice … that whilst the Tenon Memorandum itself did not have to be provided, all information supplied to Tenon in the course of them preparing the Tenon Memorandum should go in the data room”. He went to say, in paragraph 119 of his witness statement, that he believed that it was “well understood at the time that both parties should have access in the data room to the same information belonging to Updata UK, that this did not include the Tenon Memorandum itself but did include information of Updata UK’s which had been used to prepare the Tenon Memorandum”.

He therefore asked whether the “<span style="font-weight:bold">detailed </span>pipeline information” (emphasis in original) needed to be divulged, because there was a possibility that it could be used “against us in a detrimental way”.

He was concerned to ensure that the business plan should be put into the Data Room on the following day, before a planned visit by LMS. Mr. Birkeland said that he was trying his hardest to “ensure, that we avoid at a later date, to what extent did both parties have the same information available”. The e-mail was written in Danish, and Mr. Bennett translated it and forwarded it to Mr. Mantell, Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Cowan as well as Mr. Hooft.  Mr. Bennett said in evidence that he was aware that “both the bank and the process that was being set up was supposed to ensure equal conditions for all bidders for the business”. Mr. Mantell too said that he appreciated the significance of the request for “any current budget, forecast or business plan”, and also that the purpose of the Data Room was that there should be an equal exercise so that the bidders had access to the same documentation and information. </p>

The importance of that point had been emphasised by Mr. Holm in the conversation between Mr. Bennett and Mr. Holm following Mr. Birkeland’s e-mail of 29 May. Mr. Holm thought that this conversation had taken place on Saturday 30 May, and this was not disputed. It appears that there may have been a further conversation on 3 June as well (Mr. Bennett’s e-mail refers to “my subsequent conversation with Flemming”), where no doubt the same point was made.  </p>

In so far as Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Mantell sought to distance themselves from the figures contained in the Updated Kelso Presentation, I do not accept their evidence. I consider it inherently probable that they would have discussed with Mr. Bennett and agreed exactly what figures were to be given.

But in my view it is possible to cut through the language of the pleading in order to identify the critical representations. I consider that there are two categories of representation which are material to the case, and which the Claimants have sought to translate into their various pleaded representations. The first relates to the projections that were presented in the Updated Kelso Presentation. The second relates to the express representation concerning equality of information (“The factual data available to both Tenon at the time and LMS subsequently, does not differ from that information currently in the data room. In fact there is now far more factual data in the Data Room than has ever been supplied to Tenon or LMS in the past”). </p>

There are two pleaded implied representations which come close to reflecting this representation, namely that set out in paragraph 48 (6) (“that the UK management had not provided to LMS and/or Tenon any information which the European Vendors did not also have”) and paragraph 52 (3) (“the UK management had not provided LMS and/or Tenon any information over and above the information contained in the Data Room”). These formulations rightly focus on the information provided by UK management, rather than the information which Tenon may, as a result of work they carried out, have provided to potential investors. The only difficulty with accepting that these implied representations were made is the width of the word “information”, bearing in mind that the e-mail itself uses the words “factual data”. In theory at least, there might be a distinction between the two concepts, although there is clearly a very considerable degree of overlap.  </p>

Mr. Choo Choy argued for a narrow interpretation of the words “factual data”. His submission was that <span style="font-size:11.5pt">understood in context, the specific reference to “factual data” meant (and was intended to mean) the raw factual data from the company – not the assumptions and forecasts which the Defendants had prepared with and for Tenon as part of the MBO. He submitted that this was obvious from the fact that it was neither intended nor understood to extend to the Tenon Memorandum, the Weighted Budget, or the Data Pack. As a matter of ordinary construction, the term “factual data” did not cover forecasts or assumptions underlying forecasts as to the future. A forecast is an expression of opinion, not a statement of fact or factual data. The words “factual data” would therefore refer, for example, to the facts surrounding whether a contract had been concluded, what negotiations had taken place, and what stage of the tendering process had been reached. Documents recording judgment calls as to what probability existed of concluding a contract did not contain “raw” factual data.</span></p>

Management opinions are matters of fact, and a budget prepared by management is a factual document and would have been understood as such.

The context of that representation was of course the need, emphasised to Mr. Bennett both by Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Holm, for there to be equality of information. If a budget is prepared by the management, setting out their views and understanding of what contracts there are, how much and when income is going to be received, what expenditure will be incurred in fulfilling those contracts, it would in my view be understood that this budget and the information that it contained was “factual data”, even if that data contained an element of prediction as to what would happen in the future.  </p>

He agreed that he should have said that there was information which had been sent to Tenon and to LMS, but which he regarded as private information that shouldn’t be disclosed. To my mind, these answers reinforce my conclusion as to how a reasonable recipient would have understood what Mr. Bennett was saying. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is true, of course, that Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Holm knew that they were not going to be given the Tenon Memorandum. But it does not follow at all, in my view, that because the Tenon Memorandum would almost certainly contain some projections, that the reference to the provision of “factual data” in Mr. Bennett’s e-mail should be understood to exclude any data which had an element of futurity about it, such as budgets or projections provided by the management. There is a distinction between: (i) the Tenon Memorandum, which would have been understood to be a Tenon document containing Tenon’s views, and (ii) the materials had been provided by management to Tenon so as to enable them to form those views and write their memorandum. The discussions which led to this e-mail had focused on the need for equality of the information given by management to both bidders. There was nothing in Mr. Bennett’s e-mail which suggested that equality of information did not extend to materials provided by management which had an element of futurity, such as a recent budget. On the contrary, the prior two sentences of the e-mail (“The information  … investment memorandum”) conveyed how management had given relatively little by way of written materials to Tenon, with the Tenon Memorandum being based on the PowerPoint and subsequent questions and answers at meetings. This was reinforced by the subsequent statement that there was far more factual data in the Data Room than had ever been supplied to Tenon or LMS in the past.  </p>

Revealing the true expectation at that time would put at severe risk any willingness on the part of Updata Europe to contemplate accepting the LMS offer as well as risking offers from Mr. Nielsen which were well in excess of the LMS offer. It seemed to me that (as with the 20 April e-mail) there were a number of dishonest statements in the 3 June e-mail, as described in the following paragraphs.

The Defendants suggested that Mr. Bennett must have intended to refer to the Financial Overview, rather than the Kelso Presentation, and that his response was therefore somewhat confused.

The e-mail seeks to convey the impression that the Tenon Memorandum was the result of Tenon’s work in considering the PowerPoint and then asking questions of management in meetings. This is not what happened. </p>

The figure of EBITDA £ 3.348 million did not represent management’s genuine and current views of the “Best Case” for 2010. There had been no sudden downward shift in management’s expectation of EBITDA in excess of £ 6 million, as set out in the March Weighted Budget and subsequently used by Tenon in the Tenon Memorandum and Data Pack. This figure in the March Weighted Budget was, in my view, management’s view of the most likely result (i.e. their forecast for the year), and was not a “Best case” forecast. </p>

The original Kelso Presentation had in fact already been updated, as described above, on the morning of 26 March 2009. It was updated by Mr. Mantell, so that the final page containing financial projections included the £ 19 million turnover and £ 6 million EBITDA figures from the March Weighted Budget. The reason that it was updated that morning was in order for Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino to make presentations to a number of private equity houses that the management was planning to meet. They therefore knew about the updated figures, as did Mr. Mantell who had done the work. </p>

When Mr. Bennett came to do his separate updating prior to sending his e-mail on 3 June, he deliberately and in my view dishonestly altered the existing Kelso Presentation so as to reduce the 2010 figures, and in particular the EBITDA figure of £ 3.348 million EBITDA. He also changed the heading to the column, so that a figure of £ 6 million which was said to be the “Forecast” (i.e. not a “Best Case” forecast) was changed so as to be a “Best Case” forecast of £ 3.348 million.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross-examination, Mr. Bennett sought to justify the £ 3.348 million “best case” in the Updated Kelso Presentation. His evidence was that he had performed some sort of calculation in his head by which he took the £ 6.070 million EBITDA in the March Weighted Budget; accounted for the loss of the Hampshire and Dorset Upgrades contracts; determined that the loss of those contracts would result in reduced EBTDA; and then chose to take the “best case” figure from the Financial Overview as being a “fair” figure in the circumstances. I agree with the Claimants that this evidence should be rejected. Indeed, in his closing submissions, Mr. Choo Choy realistically did not seek to support this explanation, acknowledging that Mr. Bennett had simply used the Financial Overview figures, whilst maintaining that Mr. Bennett had been doing his best to assist the court. </p>

If this happens, the witness should not be surprised if a judge concludes, as I do in the case of Mr. Bennett (for this and many other reasons apparent from this judgment), that he is not a witness upon whose evidence reliance can be placed. Indeed, in his witness statement for the strike-out application, Mr. Bennett’s evidence was very different. In his second witness statement, Mr. Bennett’s evidence was that he did <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> update the figures, and that he did not represent that the figures were the most recent projections, because it would have been “obvious to [EVs] that the projections contained within the Updated Kelso presentation were essentially the same as the projections they had previously received”. In his third witness statement, he says he was not willing to provide the March Weighted Budget so he updated the Kelso Presentation by taking the “best case” from the Financial Overview. Mr. Bennett’s evidence at trial is also inconsistent with the fact that, two weeks later, the Defendants produced “in the bag” FY10 EBITDA projections of £ 5.55 million.  </p>

Further financial information had been given to LMS in the course of May 2009, as described above. None of this information was in the Data Room, and the Defendants knew it. They also knew, because Tenon told them in clear terms in early June, that they needed to provide “ALL” the information which had been supplied to Tenon. The Defendants decided to ignore that advice, because it did not suit their commercial interests which lay in ensuring that the LMS bid succeeded, that Updata Europe accepted it, and that Mr. Nielsen and his consortium failed. </p>

In the context of the 3 June e-mail, however, Mr. Choo Choy’s submission was that the Updated Kelso Presentation was really directed at Mr. Nielsen. It was updated in the way that it was because the Defendants did not want to “spoon-feed” Mr. Nielsen. It was for him to do his own work.

There was no practical way in which Updata UK could give up-to-date information and its current forecasts to Updata Europe, without these also becoming available to Mr. Nielsen as well. Similarly, if they were given to Mr. Nielsen, Updata Europe would necessarily see them. Therefore the desire not to “spoon-feed” Mr. Nielsen, and to “make him do his own work”, was by definition a desire not to “spoon-feed” Updata Europe as well. If the Defendants were to achieve the sale that they wanted, they needed to direct statements as much to the seller (Updata Europe) as to the bidder with whom they were in competition. </p>

It would been open to the Defendants to say to Mr. Nielsen that they were simply not willing to give him any figures, and that it was for him to do his own work on the data that had been given, and that they were not prepared to give any confirmation to the effect that the bidders had been treated equally. But this is not what the Defendants did. Instead, as part of their reluctance to “spoon-feed” Mr. Nielsen, the Defendants positively gave misleading projections to Updata Europe in the Updated Kelso Presentation. Those projections did not represent the UK management’s genuine (and current) forecast of Updata UK’s financial position. Nor did the management believe that facts existed which reasonably justified the figures included in the Updated Kelso Presentation. Quite simply, that is fraud and it is no answer to say that this was borne of a desire not to “spoon-feed” another party. A desire not to spoon-feed could lead to a person refusing to give any information and making this clear. But it cannot justify positive false statements. </p>

As for the 3 June e-mail, which had been copied to Mr. Mantell and bcc’d to Mr. Baldorino, this was again Mr. Bennett’s document. The substance of Mr. Baldorino’s evidence was that he had paid little or no attention to the figures in the Updated Kelso Presentation.  Mr. Mantell did not seek to distance himself from those figures in the same way. Indeed, it was Mr. Mantell who placed the Updated Kelso Presentation in the Data Room.  </p>

Mr. Hooft was a plainly honest witness, with an impressive recollection of events. He was clear in his witness statement that he was entirely unaware of any alleged deceit or fraud occurring at the time, and no case of fraud was made against him.

Mr. Choo Choy therefore submitted that it “made complete sense that they would have treated those documents as being for their use”. It would therefore have been natural for Mr. Bennett and the other members of the management team to think of the March Weighted Budget as their document, not the company’s document or budget; because it was the working document that provided the financial metrics for the Tenon Memorandum and the Data Pack for the purposes of the MBO. It was therefore very easy to see how, from the management’s perspective, the March Weighted Budget was honestly thought by them to be their work product. Therefore when Mr. Bennett received Mr. Johnsen’s request for the latest budgets, it is not realistic to think that he would have interpreted this as a request for the March Weighted Budget.

His oral submissions addressed this document in detail. He submitted that if there had been an intention to deceive, it was very strange that Mr. Bennett used exactly the same numbers as had been given to Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Homan in March. One would have expected him to use slightly different numbers, perhaps slightly higher. Moreover, the same numbers were used for the best case figures in circumstances where the assumptions underlying the original financial overview in March had been fully disclosed. The best case assumptions as to the pipeline in those assumptions did not reflect the additional 2009 contracts identified on the earlier page of the Updated Kelso Presentation. If there had been an intention to deceive, one would not have expected Mr. Bennett to identify the further contracts which had been obtained in 2009. A careful recipient of the document could not have failed to notice the similarity between the figures in the Financial Overview and those in the Updated Kelso Presentation. At the heart of the submission was the proposition that Mr. Bennett’s repetition of the best case FY 2010 figures was reflective or consistent with an intention on his part not to give Mr. Nielsen the benefit of the UK management’s MBO work and therefore not to “spoonfeed him and do his work for him”.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have no doubt that the Defendants’ preference was for replacement rather than dilution, if that were achievable. This is reflected in an e-mail sent by Mr. Baldorino in July 2009 after the sale: “It is now done with the Danes kicked into touch”. In late 2008, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino had contemplated putting Updata UK into administration as a means of taking control of the company through a pre-pack admininstration. In the event, this idea came to nothing. But the need for positive action was lent a degree of urgency when the Defendants was learned that Mr. Nielsen was making an unwelcome approach to buy the company in early 2009. I consider it clear that, thereafter, the last thing that the UK management wanted was for Mr. Nielsen’s bid to succeed. None of the Defendants wanted to work with Mr. Nielsen. Their response was therefore to try to put together an MBO. They spent time and money doing so, and chose an investor (LMS) with whom they could work in the future. It is obvious that the Defendants would have been highly motivated for the MBO to succeed. The Defendants were optimistic as to the future of the business, as reflected in the text of the Tenon Memorandum and the forecasts which were given to </p>

The argument (which I have already addressed) that Mr. Bennett did not want to “spoon feed” Mr. Nielsen, and that Mr. Nielsen had to do his own work, also demonstrates the Defendants motive for their bid to succeed, and for Mr. Nielsen to fail. The Defendants therefore had an obvious motive for misleading both Updata Europe and Mr. Nielsen as to the prospects of the business.  </p>

I was sceptical of this evidence at the time it was given, and after closing submissions I was helpfully provided by the parties with an agreed list of their evidence on this topic. I have reviewed it bearing in mind (as Mr. Choo Choy correctly submitted) the importance of reading a witness’s evidence as a whole, and in the context of the question asked.

When referring to his early discussions with LMS in early April 2009, in the context of a question that the pricing was always intended to be referable to the monies owed to the Bank, he said: “We are the management team wanting the highest price”.

It was unreliable and I reject it. I am inclined to think that it was deliberately untruthful as well, since it is difficult to see how these witnesses could, having seen the documents, have persuaded themselves that they wanted and sought to obtain the highest possible price. But it is not necessary to reach a positive conclusion in that regard. It is possible that these witnesses were to some extent on auto-pilot when answering these questions, responding by reference to what they knew their case was and what their answers ought to be, giving insufficient thought to the answers given. This evidence and my rejection of it is relevant to my overall assessment of the Defendants as witnesses, albeit that I agree with Mr. Choo Choy that one should not draw a general conclusion from just one area where the evidence of a witness is rejected. </p>

The Defendants, together with Tenon, were certainly seeking to maximise the amount of interest in the opportunity from the private equity houses whom they approached. A considerable amount of work and thought went into the figures which were contained in the March Weighted Budget. There was a considerable degree of optimism amongst the management as to the future results of the business, and this optimism was therefore fairly reflected in the figures which were then given to Tenon and ultimately to the market. This was certainly a way of interesting potential investors. However, when approaching the market, the Defendants were not seeking to maximise the price. Instead, the relevant section of the Tenon Memorandum, which was drafted by Mr. Bennett, described the opportunity as one to acquire the shares at or below the level of the debt. Similarly, the original approach to Tenon, as reflected in Mr. Castledine’s e-mail of 26 February 2009, was to identify funders prepared to invest £ 4-5 million to facilitate an acquisition from Updata Europe. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It is therefore no surprise that when the bids came in from the private equity houses, they were all at or around the level of the debt identified in the Tenon Memorandum. There was no evidence that the Defendants’ selection of LMS was thereafter made on the basis of seeking to maximise the price that LMS would pay for the shares, rather than by reference to the private equity house with whom the Defendants preferred to work. Neither Mr. Bennett nor Mr. Baldorino could identify any positive steps that they had taken, apart from approaching a number of private equity houses in the first instance in order to create “competitive tension”, to maximise the price. I do not accept that there was any real attempt to create competitive tension. The opportunity was presented as one to acquire the shares at the level of the debt. The hope, no doubt, would be that a number of houses would be attracted by such an opportunity, and would be willing to pitch at that level. The Defendants would then be in the position of being able to pick and choose their preferred investor. That is what in fact happened. There is no evidence that, after the bids came in, the Defendants tried to create competitive tension by encouraging the private equity houses to increase their offers, for example by playing one house off against another. </p>

The presentation referred to the possibility of using “Historical, LTM [Last 12 months] and YTD underperformance compared with budget [to] give ammunition for lower valuation.” There is no evidence of the Defendants challenging LMS as to their proposed use of “ammunition” for a lower valuation. Indeed, following this presentation, it was LMS that was selected as the Defendants’ preferred bidder. After LMS had been selected, there is nothing in the documents which evidences attempts by the management to maximise the price payable by LMS. Instead, there are some internal documents showing the management’s very real interest in their personal position, including a ratchet mechanism which would increase their shareholding. </p>

There is no evidence of any attempt by them to point this out either to LMS or to Mr. Johnsen or anyone else on the Updata side. Instead, as previously discussed, the e-mail traffic on the morning of 20 April was aimed at trying to ensure the success of the LMS bid and explaining its benefits to the Bank. </p>

The Defendants’ case at the present trial has been, in summary: (i) that they had never intended to provide the March Weighted Budget to Ms. Rana, because it was regarded as part of the “Tenon suite of documents” which were proprietary to them, and (ii) the reason that it was provided to Ms. Rana in July 2009 was because of a mistake by Mr. Mantell. Mr. Mantell’s evidence in both his witness statement and his oral evidence was that he did not appreciate, in July 2009, that he had made this mistake. In Mr. Bennett’s third witness statement (served in December 2016), he states that he was not, at the time, aware that Mr. Mantell had provided a copy of the March Weighted Budget to Corren Troen. In his oral evidence, he was unclear as to whether he knew of this mistake prior to completion of the sale transaction in July 2009, saying that when he did discover that it had been included he remembered “being quite surprised”.   </p>

I think that this is far more probable, given the efforts previously made (on 20 April and again 3 June) not to give the EVs the March Weighted Budget. Indeed, the metadata shows that Mr. Mantell printed the March Weighted Budget on 2 June 2009, and I agree with the Claimants that this is likely to have been in anticipation of putting it in the Data Room. A decision must then have been made not to do so. Mr. Mantell in his evidence could not provide any alternative explanation of why he had printed this document on that day. </p>

It made the point that the CD had in fact gone across to Corren Troen. It addressed the case that the Claimants were advancing, namely that the March Weighted Budget had been concealed, and that this was a very unlikely case of deceit. When the draft judgment had become available, the Defendants’ counsel had written to the judge, in a Note, to question the inclusion of a conclusion, in the draft judgment, that it “implicit in Mr. Choo Choy’s submissions is an acceptance that the Defendants were aware from 6 July 2009 onwards that the Weighted Budget should be disclosed to the European sellers”.

Not only does that make the Claimants’ case legally untenable, but I believe it is factually fanciful.

In the context of a witness statement relying upon the disclosure of the March Weighted Budget, this obviously implied that the Defendants assumed at the time that the contents of the March Weighted Budget would be brought to the attention of Updata Europe by Corren Troen. There were other passages, which I need not set out in full, which similarly suggested that the Defendants actively relied upon and considered that Corren Troen would check the documents and bring them to the EVs’ attention: see paragraphs 11, 57-58 and 60-61 of RB1. </p>

It was in my judgment an attempt by the Defendants to mislead the court, and to obtain the ultimate remedy of striking out a claim in consequence. And even if it were too draconian a conclusion to say that there was an attempt to mislead the court, I would nevertheless conclude that the episode indicates that the Defendants are not witnesses on whose evidence the court can rely. </p>

The Note did not explain that the March Weighted Budget had been disclosed by mistake: this is unsurprising, because there was nothing in the evidence to support such a proposition. The Note simply queried whether Sir Richard Field was correct to regard Mr. Choo Choy’s submissions as containing an implicit acceptance of the need to disclose the March Weighted Budget. Given that the case advanced was that there had been deliberate disclosure, with reliance being placed on the Defendants’ expectation that the material disclosed would be reviewed, one can well understand the judge’s conclusion in the first sentence of [45]: a sentence that he declined to change. But what matters for present purposes, in my view, is not what was implicit in the submissions, but rather what said in the witness evidence and explicitly in the submissions as summarised above.  </p>

Although neither Mr. Bennett nor Mr. Baldorino knew this, Mr. Mantell’s business career was not unblemished. In fact, Mr. Mantell had been disqualified as a director in 2014 for a period of four years for conduct which included preparing and signing false VAT returns. This related to a business concerning a bar/restaurant which had nothing to do with Updata UK. Although it was a separate business, Mr. Mantell knew that his career was not unblemished. Nevertheless, Mr. Mantell approved Mr. Bennett’s witness statement, which was served around 2 years from the time when the disqualification order was made, and during the time that it was current. Again, I consider that it is a serious matter for the court wrongly to be told on a strike-out application that a person has an unblemished professional career, when that is not the case. Again, it is a matter which I take into account in rejecting the integrity and reliability of Mr. Mantell. </p>

The e-mail was copied to Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino. Mr. Mantell e-mailed Mr. Holm on the following day to say that due to the diligence work being carried out that week, “unfortunately I have not had time to produce the weekly cash flow forecast”. Again, the e-mail was copied to Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino. I agree with the Claimants that this was transparently dishonest conduct towards Mr. Holm, who was chairman of Updata UK and Updata Europe. Mr. Mantell had no explanation for this conduct in his evidence. To my mind, the obvious explanation is that none of the Defendants wanted Mr. Holm and Updata Europe to know about the very positive cash flow figures which had just been sent to Lloyd’s. Mr. Mantell, and the other defendants who saw both e-mails, were happy to mislead Mr. Holm in that regard.  </p>

Mr. Hooft’s evidence was that by the time of the 3 June e-mail he was focusing on LMS’s own analysis rather than the numbers in the Updated Kelso Presentation. Mr. Hooft was not sent, in draft, the proposed wording of the first part of the 3 June e-mail (“Hi Mads and Flemming …. Kind regards, Richard”). Nor was he sent, in advance, the Updated Kelso Presentation. He was not asked to advise on what should be said. He had become aware of the matters which were “worrying” the UK management, and specifically asked Tenon to advise as to the management’s responsibilities. Tenon’s advice, that ALL information should go into the data room, apart from the “report by Tenon”, was copied to Mr. Hooft.  </p>

This case was cross-referenced to their case on unlawful means conspiracy, where the same facts were relied upon. The Claimants contended that the Defendants plainly acted in concert in pursuing the MBO; seeking to dispense with control by the Danish shareholders; and deciding what information was to be provided and what representations made. If any one of the three Defendants had not been party to the conspiracy, the campaign of nondisclosure and misrepresentation would have collapsed. Any one of them could have said “here is the accurate information you have asked for”; any one of them could have said “I’m afraid the figures in the Financial Overview and Updated Kelso Presentation are not accurate”; any one of them could have said “LMS and Tenon have received a lot more information than we have provided to you or to Mr Nielsen”; and any one of them could have sent an e-mail to EVs to notify them of the contract wins in early 2009. They did not do so because they were acting in concert to fraudulently withhold this information from EVs. </p>

His primary case was that the Defendants were “operating in tandem and they’re operating together and it’s inconceivable that a representation is put other than with the agreement and on behalf of the others because they are acting as a trio”. The only situation in which the unlawful means conspiracy argument potentially had an independent life was if, for some reason, there was an issue as regards authority for a particular representation. If that arose, then there would be a more relaxed test for unlawful means conspiracy; since the relevant question would be whether the Defendants were party to a conspiracy to use false information, and it would not be necessary to show who joined at which point. The essential case, however, was that Mr. Bennett was acting on behalf of all of them. </p>

As far as the 20 April e-mail was concerned, the Claimants contended that it was more likely than not that all of the Defendants discussed the information to send to Mr. Johnsen in response to his request. If Mr. Johnsen was going to be given information, it was important to all three Defendants that it was not the accurate information from the March Weighted Budget (because that would improve Mr. Johnsen’s chances of raising investment and may lead him to think the LMS offer was too low). And Mr. Bennett could not act alone without the significant risk that one of the other Defendants might give Mr. Johnsen the March Weighted Budget. Once they had decided to pursue the MBO, they were acting in concert, and had to do so. Hence, they stuck to the same position in the subsequent litigation.  They were jointly represented because there is no actual/ potential conflict: they all acted together to pursue their desired MBO and the removal of Updata Europe. </p>

Indeed, the Claimants submitted (in the context of conspiracy) that by the time that the Defendants were preparing the information to give to Tenon, they must have agreed that they were going to use such up to date and true information for their own purposes and exclude the EVs from it. That is what they in fact did. The Claimants relied upon the failure of Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Mantell to disassociate themselves from the 3 June e-mail, and the failure to act upon the clear advice of Tenon regarding disclosure.  </p>

The evidence in the case shows that, even before the 20 April e-mail, the Defendants were withholding information from Updata Europe, and that Mr. Mantell was willing positively to mislead Mr. Holm as to existence of a cash-flow statement: see Section F4 above. When Mr. Johnsen’s request for information came in on 20 April 2009, it is inherently probable that the response would have been discussed and agreed by Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Mantell with Mr. Bennett. It was an important request, at a very sensitive time; i.e. around the time when the LMS offer had come in, Mr. Holm had indicated that Mr. Nielsen had been given exclusivity, and Mr. Johnsen was seeking outside investment. It was also somewhat unusual for Mr. Johnsen to ask for information. I consider it improbable that Mr. Bennett would not have told the other Defendants about the request, or that he would acted alone in deciding how to respond. This would indeed run the risk that a request might be made by another route (for example, Mr. Holm had a channel of communication with Mr. Mantell), and different information might be provided.  </p>

This is what Mr. Bennett did, again, when he sent the Updated Kelso Presentation on 3 June. Neither Mr. Baldorino or Mr. Mantell sought to disassociate themselves from this. This was so, notwithstanding that Mr. Mantell had printed a copy of the March Weighted Budget on 2 June, and notwithstanding the advice from Tenon. The provision of out-of-date and low figures on 3 June was therefore of a piece with the provision of out-of-date and low figures on 20 April. Indeed, the figures provided on 3 June were the “Best Case” figures taken from the Financial Overview provided on 20 April.  </p>

Mr. Baldorino was clearly interested in, indeed worried by, what Mr. Birkeland was asking for. Mr. Mantell had sent out the first response on 1 June.

That explained why no-one on the Updata Europe side picked up the oddity about the contents of the Updated Kelso Presentation; specifically the fact that one of the slides indicated that new contracts had been won in 2009, but the “best case” figures were nevertheless exactly the same as those in the Financial Overview.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendants submitted that even if the lower figures being shown to Mr. Nielsen in the Updated Kelso Presentation had a causal impact, because higher figures might have led to a higher price being offered, that was not the same thing as the EVs relying on and being induced in any relevant legal way by the representations. This was a case where a sale process was already in train, and the only causal impact of the representations was on the course of the bidding process and the resulting price being offered. But it played no real and substantial part in the decision of the EVs as to whether to transact. Although Mr. Johnsen and others on the Updata Europe Board may have wanted to understand the basis of the offer being made by LMS, that did not mean that they were themselves relying on the information when deciding whether or not to sell; because the decision to sell was “essentially predetermined”, and the level of offer ultimately came through the bidding process. At best, therefore, the figures may have been given a cursory glance. The evidence as to what happened to the 3 June e-mail was consistent with this proposition: it was not forwarded either by Mr. Birkeland or Mr. Holm to the other members of the Board, and that is why there was no evidence of any Updata Europe Board discussion or consideration of the contents of the Updated Kelso Presentation.  </p>

Mr. Johnsen was seeking out information a matter of days after the LMS offer: the offer had been made on Thursday 16 April and Mr. Johnsen asked for the information on the following Monday morning. The Defendants accepted the obvious fact that Mr. Johnsen was doing this in order to evaluate the LMS proposal. He was clearly doing this because the information requested was highly material within the context of what was happening at that time. Decisions as to whether to sell, and if so at what price, were going to be required by Updata Europe as matters moved forward, within an overall context where Mr. Nielsen was also on the scene and Mr. Johnsen was himself looking for outside investors. Accordingly, this is not a case where a representee is relying upon a chance remark made to him spontaneously in the course of discussions. It is a case where the representee has deliberately sought important information. </p>

But the figures in the Financial Overview were not complex, and they could easily be compared to the figures which were set out in the LMS letter. It is inherently probable, in my view, that having asked specifically for the figures, Mr. Johnsen would have carefully considered what was provided, and discussed them with one or more of his colleagues at Updata Europe, and that this would have happened without internal analyses being prepared. As to the ease of comparison between the figures contained in the LMS offer and the Financial Overview: the LMS offer letter used an EBITDA figure of £ 1.5 million (derived from the February 2009 YTD figures), and this was in the same ballpark as the forecast for 2009 (£ 1,496,000), and rather better than the “Middle Case” forecast for 2009/10 (£ 1,393,000).

He went on to recommend that “the data room be opened for both interested parties on the same conditions applicable from Tuesday 26 May 2009”.

It is in my view inherently probable that Mr. Hildebrandt would have considered this presentation, and indeed he was cross-examined on the basis that he did. The words of Mr. Birkeland’s e-mail “as agreed” suggest that there had been some discussion about it, prior to its being sent to Mr. Hildebrandt.

He went to the trouble of reducing the figure shown for “Best Case” to the same figure as had been shown in the Financial Overview, even though management’s expectation at this time was that the results would be some millions of pounds higher. The reason that he did this was for the same reason that he had given false figures on 20 April. He again wanted, and perceived that he needed to, influence the course of the subsequent decision-making by Updata Europe in favour of the MBO.  No doubt he also wanted to give false information, as to the management’s expectations, to Mr. Nielsen as well.

His evidence in his first witness statement did not specifically address the 20 April e-mail and Financial Overview, or the Updated Kelso Presentation. He explained that he was reluctant to sell Updata UK, and that his preferred solution was to get a new investor for Updata Europe. He expressed the view that if Updata Europe had known the true financial position of Updata UK, he had no doubt that Mr. Jorgensen would have been prepared to extend the terms of Updata Europe’s loan. He was convinced that if he had been able to provide the information in the March Weighted Budget to Mr. Jorgensen, “it would not have been necessary to sell Updata UK”.  </p>

This was demonstrated when, in the course of crossexamination on Day 6, he explained the very real difficulties that there would have been in finding any other bank prepared to refinance the Bank; an answer which, in my view, made one aspect of the Claimants’ case on causation untenable. I appreciate that he too is a major protagonist in this litigation, and that his evidence must therefore be viewed carefully with close regard to his motives. Again, however, it seems to me that his evidence, as to how he understood and reacted to the statements and figures provided by Mr. Bennett and Updata UK, was consistent with the inherent probabilities and the documentary evidence.

I accept that the figures provided on 20 April, and then in the Updated Kelso Presentation, were considered by Updata Europe when evaluating the offers made by LMS and in their decision as to what to do. I accept that the Updated Kelso Presentation was understood to be showing that there was no improvement on the figures previously provided, and have no doubt that this is precisely what Mr. Bennett wanted Updata Europe to understand. Overall, in the light of the evidence of Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Hildebrandt, I accept that Updata Europe understood from the figures that there was no basis for doing anything other than accepting the LMS offer. They also recognised that they could not realistically challenge it as being at an undervalue, since Updata Europe had no material to indicate that a valuation based on EBITDA of £ 1.5 million (with a multiplier of 6.1 which was reasonable) was inappropriate. I do not accept that there was no inducement because the course of events was in some way predetermined or preordained. The process leading to sale was a dynamic one, with Updata Europe ultimately having to decide whether or not to accept the LMS offer. The representations were designed to influence Updata Europe’s decision-making in that process and ultimately did so.  </p>

Advice was taken from counsel in the Spring of 2010, and steps were then taken in 2010 in connection with the proposed assignment which contemplated the issue of proceedings of the present kind. This is not therefore a case where Mr. Johnsen or Mr. Hildebrandt were reacting with remorse when they learned of the very successful sale to Capita in 2014. </p>

Similarly, whilst Mr. Nielsen may well have distrusted the information that he was given by the Defendants, the question is whether or not <span style="text-decoration:underline">Updata Europe</span> relied upon the representations that were made. That question is not answered by demonstrating that Mr. Nielsen was suspicious that information was withheld from him, particularly in circumstances where the evidence of both Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Hildebrandt was to the effect that they trusted the UK management to give them the latest figures.

Mr. Holm’s evidence in this regard was somewhat confused. He had clearly not seen the £ 3.348 million figure in any prior Kelso Presentation. Nor had he seen the Financial Overview in October 2008 (as he indicated in re-examination). I think that Mr. Holm’s evidence as to his reaction to the figures is likely to be mistaken. But in any event, there was nothing in this evidence which leads me to reject the evidence of Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Hildebrandt as to inducement. There was no suggestion that Mr. Holm raised the issue of the figures with them. Moreover, I think that the reliance placed by the Defendants on Mr. Holm’s evidence was just another way of putting the argument that the representee could or should have discovered the falsity of the statement by exercising reasonable care and skill.

There is a further question of inducement in the context of the representation concerning equality of information. I consider that this too was an inducing cause of Updata Europe entering into the transaction, and (in so far as necessary) that it played a real and substantial part in the decision. The background to this representation is described in Section E. The question of equality of information was a matter of considerable importance to the Bank, Mr. Birkeland and Updata Europe, including in particular Mr. Holm who was personally involved in the discussions at the end of May. It was pursued by Mr. Birkeland with a degree of vigour in late May and early June. His e-mails at the end of May 2009 indicate how important it was to him. Both Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Holm understood, once they had received the 3 June e-mail, that Updata UK’s management had given the confirmation which they required.

If the representations had not been made, Updata Europe would have come to learn of the true success of Updata UK.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Defendants submitted that, on a proper analysis of the facts, Updata Europe had suffered no loss. The Bank had decided in early 2009 that the indebtedness had to be eliminated or at least very significantly reduced, and therefore that outside investment needed to be found. Updata Europe was under enormous pressure from the Bank, which was calling the shots in relation to how Updata Europe should act. Thus it was the Bank that compelled Updata Europe to deal with Mr. Nielsen in early 2009, and it was the Bank that set up the bidding process once LMS were on the scene in April 2009. Even if there had been no misrepresentations, that bidding process would have played out in the same way and on the same timescale as it did. Updata Europe had no room for manoeuvre, and even if there had been no misrepresentations they would have been in the same position as they ultimately found themselves; i.e. with the same offer from LMS which was made in June 2009, which was far more certain and beneficial than anything that Mr. Nielsen had come up with. If Updata Europe had not itself been willing to accept that offer, then the Bank would have compelled them to do so. Accordingly, no loss was suffered; because Updata Europe would, even if there had been no misrepresentations, have sold to LMS in July 2009 on the same terms. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Defendants’ argument on causation, if accepted, therefore disposed of both ways in which Vald. Nielsen advanced its case for damages. But even if this argument were not accepted in its totality, any claim for damages would be minimal. The Defendants contended that the alternative (2014 Capita) case was unsustainable, because there was no way in which the Bank would have allowed Updata Europe to postpone a sale beyond September 2009. The Bank wanted repayment and hard cash, not promises of jam tomorrow. As far as the primary (2009 “market value”) case was concerned, it was not appropriate on the facts of the present case to look at theoretical market value, whatever the experts might have said on that topic. This was a case where the Bank was, in practical terms, forcing a sale; a fact which itself inevitably depresses value. By May 2009, the sale procedures were in place, with two bidders in the frame. There was no real possibility of obtaining a higher price from LMS: Mr Hooft’s evidence was that LMS had reached its limit, with the only possibility being a fractional increase. Mr. Nielsen had not been able to show hard cash, and there were other problems which attended his whole approach. In particular he or his consortium were looking to invest in the parent company (Updata Europe), rather than simply buying Updata UK. Updata Europe had not enabled Mr. Nielsen to carry out proper due diligence in relation to Updata Europe, because no data room had been established in Denmark. Accordingly, Mr. Nielsen and his consortium would never have come up with an acceptable offer. These were the only two realistic purchasers in the frame, and there was therefore no prospect of obtaining further monies from them. It was speculative to think that other purchasers, willing to pay market value or any higher price than LMS, might exist; particularly bearing in mind that Mr. Johnsen had spent some considerable time looking for outside investors, but without success. </p>

In that sense the test is a relatively generous one, in that the misrepresenting party may have thrown upon it risks unrelated to the representation. But there is still the requirement that the loss flow from the representation, and it seems to me impossible to conclude that it does so flow if one concludes that quite apart from the representation the appellant would have entered into a transaction bringing with it the very risk which eventuated in the relevant transaction and which can be seen as the cause of the loss which the appellant seeks to recover. There may be an element of impression in all this.” </p>

Mr. Booth submitted that once this factual question was resolved in his clients’ favour, the only remaining question would be the assessment of loss. “Loss of a chance” principles had no role to play in resolving the causation question, which involved looking at the question of whether Updata Europe would, in 2009, have entered into the contract with LMS on the same terms. In the present case, the assessment of loss was straightforward and (subject only to the question of whether loss should be assessed in 2014) simply involved looking at the true or market value of the shareholding at the time of sale. Mr. Booth submitted it was not necessary or appropriate to look beyond the assessment of market value.

However, he also submitted that on the facts of the present case, loss of a chance came into the causation analysis; in particular, because the Bank (a third party) played a critical part in the chain of causation. Thus, the question of whether Updata Europe would have entered into the contract with LMS on the same terms involved considering the key question of whether the Bank would have forced them to do so. He submitted that, applying the principles in the seminal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples v Simmons v Simmons</span> [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1602, this had to be assessed on the basis of loss of a chance. He submitted that the question of whether there would have been a transaction with LMS was essentially dependent on the actions of the Bank. Where the causal chain relied upon by the Claimant “as a matter of fact involves consideration of what a third party would have done, it is not permissible to approach it otherwise than on the basis of a loss of a chance”. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, on the Defendants’ case it was not simply the position of the Bank that was relevant to the question of causation. Mr. Choo Choy submitted that the causal theory in relation to the 2009 case involved consideration of the actions of multiple third parties: not only what the Bank would have done, but also what LMS might have done, or what Mr. Nielsen might have done or what e-Kong might have done. The court therefore requires consideration of the “substantiality” of the chance in relation to the relevant acts of each of those third parties. Relying upon the recent decision of Bryan J in <span style="font-style:italic">Assetco PLC v Grant Thornton UK LLP </span>[2019] EWHC 150, Mr. Choo Choy submitted that the court should apply a mathematical approach of multiplying the probabilities. The Defendants’ submission, ultimately, was that there was no real or substantial chance of any offer being made at a higher price than that offered by LMS. </p>

Accordingly, the Bank did not take an uncompromising or inflexible attitude at that time, consistent with Mr. Jorgensen’s evidence that he did not want to bankrupt Updata. This flexibility became known to Mr. Nyegaard, who reported to Mr. Baldorino and Mr. Bennett on 25 March 2009 that: “from what I understand they have until September before the bank gets serious on them – at least that’s the last thing I heard on the matter”. In due course, the Bank was to prove to be flexible in relation to the requirement to be paid a dividend. In May 2009, by which time no dividend had been declared, an e-mail from Mr. Birkeland to the Board of Updata Europe records Mr. Jorgensen having agreed to have no objections to the board deciding to postpone the decision as to the declaration of an interim dividend, provided that it was reconsidered in a month’s time. By that time, of course, the possibility of a sale of Updata UK or investment in Updata Europe was very much a possibility, with both Mr. Nielsen and LMS on the scene. </p>

Mr. Johnsen’s evidence was that if the Bank told them to talk to Mr. Nielsen they could not in practice refuse; because the Bank’s possible next step would be to “require the votes and make it happen anyway”. This was a reference to the potential exercise by the Bank of voting rights under the pledge. </p>

The letter granted Mr. Nielsen a 5-week period to carry out due diligence and then two further working weeks to finalise his bid. The Defendants submitted that it was significant that it was the Bank which demanded and then gave Mr. Nielsen exclusivity, and that this showed that the Bank was intent on and able to control the sales process and force Updata Europe to bend to its wishes. I agree that it is clear that Mr. Jorgensen wanted Updata Europe to co-operate with Mr. Nielsen with a view to a possible deal. It is also clear that Updata Europe recognised that, as Mr. Holm had put it, there was “nothing else to do”.

It would therefore seem that, as one would expect, Mr. Jorgensen had sought and obtained Updata Europe’s agreement prior to sending that letter. I did not consider that there was anything in the documents, relating to the course of the bidding process either at that time or subsequently, which showed the Bank overriding the wishes of Updata Europe at any stage in the events leading to the ultimate sale. </p>

Apart from the meeting on 14 April 2009, LMS had almost no contact with the Bank. Their offer letters were addressed to Updata Europe. The response to their first offer on 20 April 2009 came from Mr. Holm on behalf of the Updata Europe Board. It was this which led to the flurry of activity on the morning of 20 April 2009: see Section D above. </p>

When their first offer was not accepted, they directed their efforts at persuading Updata Europe (and Mr. Johnsen in particular) to look more favourably on their offer. This led to an offer of a “roll-over” for some of the existing shares of Updata Europe and Newwatch, and the offer of cooperation in respect of a product called “Blue” which Mr. Johnsen was keen to promote. LMS’s proposals in those respects were both included in their second offer following discussions with Mr. Johnsen, not with the Bank. </p>

Ultimately, if Updata Europe had refused LMS’s offer made on 19 June 2009, the Bank could have tried to enforce its pledge over the Updata UK shares, and then sell those shares as mortgagee in possession. But as Mr. Birkeland explained, based on his experience, this is very much a last resort for a bank; not least because it would then have to consolidate the company into its group accounts.  </p>

On 20 May 2009 (the date appearing on the Danish original rather than the English translation in the hearing bundle), which was around a month after the LMS offer, Mr. Jorgensen wrote his e-mail stating that the Bank wanted to take a “more active role” in the possible transfer/ sale of the Updata Group, and expressing concern about some (unspecified) “rather unprofessional action” by management in relation to the execution of the transaction. It was in this e-mail that Mr. Jorgensen said that it was “essential that all interested buyers (management at Up-Data and Jens Nielsen via their equity funds respectively) are ensured equal conditions for the transactions.” This e-mail appears to have been prompted in part by complaints which Mr. Nielsen had made (in his “Letter of Understanding” dated 13 May 2009, described in more detail below) concerning problems in obtaining information from UK management. It also reflected an e-mail sent on 18 May 2009 by Mr. Homann to Mr. Jorgensen, to which Mr. Homann attached a memorandum and financial statement. The covering e-mail stated that the value of the group was “significantly improved” but that the cash situation was highly critical. It was “highly essential” to maintain the “cadence for completion of a capital injection or sale of the English shares”. The memorandum itself said, similarly: </p>

I consider that this rather overstates the position. It seems to me that by mid-May, Mr. Jorgensen (prompted by Mr. Homann) was concerned to ensure that matters did not drift, and that it was important to introduce a process with deadlines. This would focus the minds of participants and bring matters to a conclusion. Prior to that time, however, the Bank does not seem to have been unduly concerned with the pace of progress. Thus Mr. Nielsen had made his first proposal on 16 January 2009, but was not granted an exclusivity period until 5 March 2009.  Furthermore, if the Bank had wanted its debts repaid quickly, it could have tried to do a quick deal with LMS on 14 April 2009, as LMS and the Defendants were hoping would happen, or after the later LMS offer was made in May. It did not do so. </p>

As far as the Bank was concerned, there was no need to drag out the timetable. The timetable ensured both parties had equal information and made offers at the same time.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The picture changed somewhat after the transaction had gone through. On 2 September 2009, the Bank gave notice requiring Updata Denmark’s overdraft to be repaid immediately, and terminating its commitment if there was no repayment. It seems to me that this is consistent with the agreement made back in January, when the agreed extension of the facility was up until September. Shortly before then, on around 21 August, Mr. Jorgensen had spoken to Mr. Johnsen. The latter reported his conversation to Mr. Bigaard and others. Mr. Jorgensen “was very upset. He called us “a bunch of untrustworthy idiots””. By this time, of course, Updata UK had been sold and the amount realised had been insufficient to repay the Bank entirely. Later in 2009, Mr. Jorgensen commenced legal proceedings against both Updata Europe and Updata Denmark to try to force through a sale to Mr. Bigaard, and he told Updata’s shareholders that they should agree to sell to Mr. Bigaard for DKK 1 million or there would be adverse financial consequences.  </p>

The Bank had not enforced its pledge. If Updata Europe had refused to accept an offer that was being made, on the basis that it did not represent the fair value of the business, the Bank would have been entitled to exercise its rights under the pledge. But if the Bank were to do this, it should and would not lead to the proposed sale at an undervalue, because the Bank would have duties in that regard: see <span style="font-style:italic">Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance</span> [1971] Ch 949 at 966, 968-9 (per Salmon LJ) 977-978 (per Cairns LJ); <span style="font-style:italic">Silven Properties v RBS</span>  [2003] EWCA Civ 1409 [2004] 1 WLR 997 (CA) at [19] per Lightman J.

But this was because Updata Europe had been misled as to the figures and had also been given to understand that there had been equality of information in the Data Room process. Had the true picture as to Updata UK’s performance and forecast been known, Updata Europe would not have agreed to the LMS final offer, because it would obviously have undervalued the company. Furthermore, had Updata UK been told that LMS had received different information to that which had been given to Mr. Nielsen, both Updata Europe and the Bank would have appreciated that there had not been a fair sale process. For either or both of these reasons, it was unrealistic to imagine that the Bank would have forced Updata UK to sell at the price offered by LMS in June 2009, even assuming that this was the best offer on the table at that time. However, the Claimants also challenged the premise that, had there been no fraud, matters would have played out in the way that they in fact did, so that the best offer on the table in June 2009 was the LMS offer.  </p>

He was a witness called by the Claimants themselves. But the Claimants submitted that his evidence needed to be treated with considerable caution. Some of his answers were contradictory, and he was – certainly by the time that he was being asked questions about the counter-factual world – very confused about the facts. It was therefore important to look not at individual answers, but at his evidence as a whole and also, as indeed with all witnesses, the contemporary documents and inherent probabilities. They acknowledged that Mr. Jorgensen’s evidence was clear, and he repeated a number of times that he did not want to lose LMS as a purchaser: LMS had shown that they had the cash, and he did not want them to walk away. However, they submitted that if it had become known, even at the end of the sale process in July, that the sale process had been unequal and that the shares were undervalued, Mr. Jorgensen’s concern not to lose LMS would not have led him to a sale at the LMS price. To do so would likely have constituted a breach of the Bank’s duties. It would have exposed the Bank to a serious risk of litigation. Mr. Booth submitted that it would be an extraordinary conclusion to reach on causation; i.e. to conclude that the </p>

Mr. Jorgensen had shown a flexible attitude in January, when it had agreed to extend time (on terms), and again in May, when he agreed to postpone payment of any dividend. Interest had not been paid in 2009, but he did not terminate the facility. The evidence showed that Mr. Jorgensen trusted both Mr. Homann and Mr. Birkeland, relying on them for advice in connection with the sale, and he was also in close contact with Mr. Hildebrandt. If necessary, therefore, the Bank would have given more time, particularly if it had emerged at a late stage that one of the bidders had not been given equal information. </p>

These figures went to the heart of the company’s value and no vendor would have ignored that information and sold to LMS on the existing price regardless.

Mr. Booth submitted that it would be a very strong thing to say that market value should be interfered with. The Court should not be tempted to say that, because of its debts to the Bank and the pressure it was under to achieve some form of repayment, Updata Europe might not have achieved the full market value for its shares. This would result in an arbitrary reduction of the market value by reference to a factor (creditor pressure) which does not affect the market value at all. That was not an appropriate approach to quantum in the case of fraud. </p>

Both causation of loss and proof of loss involved reliance upon the acts of third parties. Relying on the recent decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Assetco v Grant Thornton </span>[2019] EWHC 592, they submitted that the claimant had to establish a real or substantial chance of a third party acting in accordance with a claimant’s causal theory. Where there were multiple third-party acts in the chain of causation, the claimant needs to establish a real or substantial chance in respect of each third party whose hypothetical actions were necessary in the relevant causal chain.

Mr. Choo Choy focused particularly upon the Bank, but also LMS and Mr. Nielsen. Since they were each independent actors, it would be necessary to assess the respective chances of higher bids being received from LMS and Mr. Nielsen, as well as the chance of the Bank allowing an extra period for the sale. The various probabilities would then need to be multiplied together. There were, admittedly, other potential actors: the market was not confined to Mr. Nielsen or LMS. But other potential players could be disregarded, because Mr. Johnsen had previously approached other investors without success. </p>

In that context, the earliest time that any relevant information would have been available was 20 April. But by that time, the two-horse race was already well on the way. Disclosure of relevant information by 20 April or even late May would not, contrary to the Claimants’ submission, have made a huge difference to the process because the structure of the race between LMS and Mr. Nielsen had pretty much been set. Even if there were a chance, at that stage, of Mr. Nielsen and e-Kong improving on their offer, various other questions would arise. These included: what processes would there have been between Mr. Nielsen and his backers in terms of improving his offer; how long would it have taken to get an improved offer; what would the improvement have been; how would LMS have reacted. The Claimants had to posit a credible factual scenario which would lead to the conclusion that they might have been able to either get a higher price for the shares from one of the two potential bidders, or alternatively retain the shares until 2014. In the Defendants’ submission, there was no such scenario. In that context, it was necessary to look carefully at the evidence of Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Jorgensen. Overall, however, the Defendants submitted that Updata Europe would have acted in the same way that they did even if they had been given different information. Furthermore, there was no real or substantial chance of Updata Europe and the Bank obtaining a materially better offer in a timescale that would have been consistent with what the Bank wanted. </p>

The Defendants submitted that the Bank was never going to be persuaded (let alone was there a real and substantial chance of it being persuaded) to let Updata Europe keep its shares until 2014 simply by seeing higher forecasts, the March Weighted Budget, the Tenon Memorandum or anything of the sort. The Bank’s patience was exhausted, it was under its own pressures, and Updata Europe was in default even of the compromise reached on 6 January 2009. The Bank, having seen higher forecasts at the beginning of 2009, still wanted the Updata Europe debt repaid or substantially reduced immediately. To suppose the Bank might have done otherwise (let alone allowed Updata Europe to keep the shares until 2014 to sell to Capita at the same price) is sheer speculation, when all the evidence is to the contrary. </p>

Mr. Jorgensen wanted outstanding interest paid, and he wanted the debt reduced or repaid and he wanted that to happen promptly. The Bank also wanted some control over the process of finding an external investor; because (as Mr. Jorgensen agreed in his evidence) the Bank wanted to make sure that, if there was going to be a capital injection, it would have to be an injection which was sufficiently substantial. The reality therefore was that the sale of Updata UK (whether directly or indirectly through shares in Updata Europe) had to happen by the summer of 2009, given Mr. Jorgensen’s stance. A sale was inevitable, and Mr. Jorgensen wanted to exercise control and scrutiny over the process.

Mr. Hooft had thought that LMS was under competitive pressure at the time of the bidding, since he did not know what bids would come from Mr. Nielsen/ e-Kong. LMS were incentivised to bid competitively, and their bid fairly reflected all the financial information which they had received. That information was the full information; i.e. no information was withheld from LMS. LMS did not bid on the basis of the projected £ 6 million EBITDA, but on the basis of past results.

His difficulties had little or nothing to do with the availability of higher forecasts. They included his insistence on bidding for the shares of Updata Europe (rather than Updata UK); his desire for the Defendants to stay in the business, which they were refusing to do (if he was the buyer); problems of due diligence in Denmark; and his inability to find a backer who was willing to come forward with proof of funds.

A different approach may be required in order to give effect to the general principle that damages should compensate for the loss suffered, and for the generous approach to damages in the case of fraud (in particular as to the recovery of consequential loss) which was stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers)</span> [1969] 2 QB 158 (a decision of the Court of Appeal which was approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith New Court</span>). Accordingly, there were likely to be many cases where the general rule (i.e. assessing damages by reference to the true value on the transaction date) “has to be departed from in order to give adequate compensation for the wrong done to the plaintiff” (see 266F-G).  </p>

Those chances are to be taken account of in the assessment of damages [97]. Where quantification involves a hypothetical exercise, the court does not apply the same balance of probability approach as it would to proof of past facts. Rather it estimates the loss by making the best attempt it can to evaluate the chances, great or small (unless those chances amount to no more than remote speculation) taking all significant factors into account. [102 - 103, citing <span style="font-style:italic">Parabola</span>]. Where the quantification of loss depends upon events which did not happen the judge is left to assess to chances of the alternative scenario he is presented with. This has nothing to do with loss of a chance as such. It is simply the judge making a realistic and reasoned assessment of a variety of circumstances in order to determine what the level of loss has been.

The case establishes that loss of a chance principles are potentially applicable in cases of deceit, as well as their more usual application to cases of negligence by solicitors and others. In that case, loss of chance principles came into play because the claimants contended that they would have purchased T Ltd., and a successful purchase of that company depended upon the acts of a third party; i.e. whether or not the owners of T Ltd. would be willing to sell to the claimants. However, the initial question for David Richards J. was whether, on the assumption that the owners of T Ltd. were willing to sell, the plaintiffs would indeed have purchased that company and could have funded the purchase.

Floyd LJ said (at [109]) that the Claimants “had, first, to prove that its own actions would have been such as to place itself in a position to obtain that work, and it had to do so on the balance of probabilities”. It may well be that the question of whether a party’s actions would have placed itself in a position to obtain a benefit will itself depend, at least to some extent, on the actions of third parties. For example, the opening of an office in New York might well require funding from a bank, the agreement of a landlord to let suitable premises, the agreement of staff to work in the office, the granting of visas by the US authorities, and possibly regulatory approvals. However, I do not consider that the involvement of third parties means that loss of a chance principles need to be, or should be applied, when deciding whether or not the claimant would have opened the office.

At that time (2009), the Bank had not exercised its security rights, and the decision as to whether or not to sell, and if so on what terms, was a decision for the Board of Updata Europe to take. It is of course true that that decision would be shaped by external considerations, including the positions taken by third parties. In order to decide what decision Updata Europe would have made, in the hypothetical world where there had been no deceit, there would be a range of factors which would be relevant to Updata Europe’s decision: whether higher offers had been received from third parties, what pressure there was from the Bank, what pressure there may have been from members of Mr. Johnsen’s family. But whilst these external considerations are highly relevant to what Updata Europe’s ultimate decision would have been, the ultimate question is whether Updata Europe would have sold at the LMS price in any event. This, in my view is and remains a question to be resolved on the balance of probabilities. </p>

The first point was that even if the misrepresentations had not been made, the course of the bidding process would have proceeded as it did, with the result at the end of that process, the LMS bid was the only bid. The second point was that if that were the position, the Bank would have compelled Updata Europe to accept the LMS bid, by making it known that the bid had to be accepted so that repayment of the Bank debt could be made, or ultimately forcing a sale using its powers under its security.  In relation to these arguments on causation, it is necessary to consider what consequences would have likely resulted from a situation in which the representations had not been made. </p>

In either event, it seems to me that the details underlying the headline numbers – for example the extensive detailed workings in the March Weighted Budget – would have been revealed to Updata Europe, and indeed to other potential purchasers. If one assumes that the misrepresentations had not been made, the corollary therefore would be that the true figures would be revealed; not least because there would then have been no point in the Defendants seeking to try to conceal the detail and because the information would need to go to into the Data Room. And in any event, the detail could easily have been flushed out by, for example, Updata Europe’s board asking for the detail, or in response to the questions asked by Mr. Nielsen who throughout was pressing for more information. I also accept Mr. Johnsen’s evidence that if he had been given positive information showing substantial values, “we would have been all over it” in terms of asking for the detail. Mr. Choo Choy was therefore correct to approach the case, in terms of causation, by “assuming against [himself] for the moment that the counterfactual should be equated with positive disclosure of the weighted budget”; i.e. on the basis that the true figures would have been revealed. </p>

Since it is more likely than not that there would have been a better offer on the table in late June, it follows that Updata Europe would not have sold at the LMS price in any event.

They recognised that there was a serious risk of jeopardising the sale to their favoured PE house at the price offered. Updata Europe would then see figures which were highly material to the valuation of Updata Europe, and which would reveal the inadequacy of the LMS original offer based on £ 1.5 million EBITDA, even taking into account the relatively small (18%) increase made by LMS in their May offer.  </p>

But at all events, I have no doubt that he would have taken steps to ensure that Mr. Nielsen, and any other potential bidders, did have the same relevant management information as LMS. Given that the Bank itself, as well as Updata Europe, had a real interest in obtaining the best possible price on the sale, it is not difficult to conclude that, if necessary, the sale timetable could be extended somewhat so as to ensure that all potential purchasers had a fair crack of the whip. </p>

However, in my view it is improbable in the extreme that Updata Europe would have let matters proceed in the same way as they did in fact proceed. At that time, Mr. Nielsen was using a multiple of 5 x EBITDA, and LMS had used 6.1 (albeit applied to historic results). Updata Europe’s Board comprised a number of intelligent people, and it would have been obvious to them that the LMS offer (based on EBITDA of £ 1.5 million) significantly undervalued the company. If this had happened, any discussions between Mr. Johnsen and LMS about the LMS offer of 16 April would have been very different to the discussion which took place on 29 April 2009, and which Mr. Hooft recorded in his note to file of that date. Mr. Hooft’s first key point in that note was that there had been a “Very friendly tone”. He went on to record his impression that “we were potentially not a million miles apart” and that “[o]verall Peter was very positive”.  If the true figures had been revealed, I consider that Mr. Johnsen would have brought home both to LMS and UK management that a deal at the levels proposed by LMS would be unacceptable.  </p>

He was clearly a tough and skilled negotiator, who would have sought to minimise the price paid. But I consider that, if necessary, he would have been prepared to move rather higher. Certainly the figures for maintainable earnings which were produced by one of his team on 29 June 2009 (and which are described in more detail in Section I below) would have justified a significantly higher valuation.  </p>

Even if that were so, however, it is not probable that Updata Europe would have accepted it. Indeed, I would regard it as highly improbable. In my view, Updata Europe would have made efforts to explain to the Bank that the business was worth far more, and that it was now or shortly would be highly cash generative. Mr. Homann, who had the ear of Mr. Jorgensen, would have supported them in that argument. I do not consider it at all probable that the Bank would have forced a sale at an undervalue there and then.

The Bank would have insisted that a sale took place as soon as reasonably possible. At the time when the bids came in June, there was still a certain amount of time to go before September; i.e. the date before which (subject to performance of other conditions) the Bank had agreed not to call in the facilities. I bear in mind that the Bank could have taken the point that there had been a failure to perform the other conditions, and therefore could have called in their loan. But I accept Mr. Jorgensen’s evidence that the Bank had no interest at that time in bankrupting Updata. I have also already noted that Mr. Jorgensen did not act aggressively in the period between January and June. I consider that (on the present unreal hypothesis that the only offer was that which LMS actually made) faced with arguments from Updata Europe, supported by Mr. Homann, the Bank would likely have shown a degree of flexibility so that fair value for the company could be realised. If they had not already done so, the same factors as identified above would then have driven the price towards their true market value.

During that time, he went with Mr. Homann and met Mr. Bennett and Mr. Baldorino at Reigate on 18 March. He received a small folder of materials which included the Financial Overview. His evidence was that it was pretty clear from the meeting that management were not keen on his involvement. He had a feeling that they were going to give him the minimum information possible.

Mr. Medhurst explained that the deal was too small for Macquarie itself, but that Macquarie had interests in a number of other funds who had investments in a similar space. He and Ms. Ojero said that they were looking at either a quoted trade buyer or a number of financial buyers, and that ultimately it was up to Mr. Nielsen to decide on the most preferable. They favoured a group wide approach (which I understand to mean buying the whole group), and they felt that a trade buyer was most likely to want to go cross-border. Mr. Medhurst described, but did not identify, the trade buyer that they had in mind: a telecoms company which was not based in Europe, but which had world-wide interests apart from Europe. An important question was whether the investor would be interested in Denmark or not. But “the UK is not in question here”. In other words, there was no doubt that any buyer would be interested in the UK. Towards the end of </p>

The letter was not a binding offer itself, but outlined the framework for an offer. It referred to the fact that questions raised of the UK management, and requests for documents, remained outstanding and unanswered. It also expressed concern that the UK management had authored a business plan which had not been contained in the due diligence binders provided, and that this had been used in meetings with potential equity providers to gain support for their MBO. The letter then set out a number of conditions for incorporation into any binding agreement, including a more detailed due diligence period. </p>

This was the first time that eKong had been referred to in the correspondence, although it seems clear that this was the investor that Mr. Medhurst had been describing at the 6 May meeting with management. Mr. Nielsen explained in his evidence that e-Kong was a good contact of Mr. Medhurst, who knew them well. In his letter to the Bank, Mr. Nielsen explained that e-Kong was a telecoms holding company, listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and that it had been analysing and preparing “this bid for Updata Europe A/S”.  </p>

They referred to having carried out a fact-finding exercise over the past weeks, trying to learn more about the opportunity and referred to their discussions with, amongst others, Mr. Jorgensen and Mr. Homann. They indicated that in the light of their “ample experience of founding and developing different telecommunication companies”, they could see the market potential of Updata and had “gained interest in applying their expertise and experience again while joining existing shareholders of Updata in building Updata to become another profitable and scalable business”. However, they went on to refer to the fact that they had obtained “very limited information, data or knowledge” regarding Updata Europe and its nonUK subsidiaries, and “only until very recently some financial information on Updata UK”. They were therefore not in a position to submit a formal offer, but expressed an interest in exploring the possibility of a proposal which they set out in Annexure B to that letter.

Prior to submitting his first letter of understanding on 15 May 2009, he was dissatisfied with the amount of information received from the UK management. They had been reluctant to give information at the March meeting and had not answered the questions sent on 5 April. He had raised his concerns in his letter of understanding. At the time of that letter, he was already in discussions with e-Kong as a potential investor. He had also had discussions with Macquarie itself, but e-Kong quickly developed as the main contender. e-Kong were a serious investor with a very professional approach: it was a company used to buying other companies and creating infrastructure. e-Kong wanted to acquire the whole group, but it was most interested in Updata UK. </p>

He also hoped that the involvement of e-Kong, which was a large company, might ensure that the bidding process was conducted fairly. But his hopes were disappointed.  Mr. Iversen had indeed attended the Data Room, and seen and reviewed the relevant materials which included answers to Mr. Nielsen’s questions and the Updated Kelso Presentation. Mr. Iversen’s due diligence report, based on the information made available to him, was “useless”. As Mr. Nielsen explained in his evidence, this was a reflection on the quality of the information in the Data Room, not on Mr. Iversen. Mr. Nielsen said that: </p>

But the valuation of the company based on the information provided was low. Indeed, Mr. Medhurst could not work out why the LMS bid was so high, given the figures. Mr. Nielsen “simply did not have the backing from e-Kong to match that kind of offer; based on the material I had, I could not justify that kind of price”. He then went on to say: </p>

He has no business relationship now with Mr. Johnsen or any member of the family.

Mr. Nielsen spent a considerable amount of time working on the deal over a 6 month period. He sought to take a professional approach, and was assisted by experienced professionals in the corporate finance world. It is clear from the documentary evidence that he was very keen to see the figures for the Updata UK. I accept his evidence that this was the business that was of most interest to him and to any potential investor. As he explained, the Danish companies were ‘distressed’ and operated in a much smaller market than the UK. But it “wasn’t hard to convince that the UK was a substantial investment opportunity”. He recognised the potential of a sale to a strategic trade investor, who could “scale the company much better than … a private equity investment”. “The most important thing was to get the UK numbers in place”. e-Kong’s prime interest was certainly in the UK market, and although they were prepared to look at other markets, they wanted to “grab European foothold and start out with the most interesting market in Europe, being the UK”. The problems that he encountered along the road, and which led to his inability to make a firm bid, were that he “was waiting for information and the answers on key questions”, and ultimately that the figures that he was given were based on poor quality information and did not justify a price higher than that which LMS had offered. As he said: “it’s not the kind of sufficient information you would normally expect in a transaction of this kind”. At the end of his cross-examination, he said that he was very committed, he was very serious; he had a good team with lots of experience “but I did not receive the proper information for the due diligence to come up with a substantial – a substantial or firm offer”. I have no doubt that the Defendants saw Mr. Nielsen as a very real threat, and that this explains why in my view they took steps, by making false representations to Updata Europe, to hobble his bid. </p>

I told him that if he needed a break apart from the usual ones, he should tell me. Mr. Jorgensen had given a relatively short witness statement in Danish, because he was not fluent in English. He explained at the start of his cross-examination, however, that his understanding of English was better than his ability to speak it, and that he would be happy to listen to the question in English and then to give his answer in Danish with the benefit of translation. As the cross-examination proceeded, however, Mr. Jorgensen in fact tried to give his evidence in English. From time to time, however, both the questions and the answers required translation, and this was carried out by an interpreter. It was perhaps unfortunate that the same interpreter was not present throughout his evidence: one interpreter attended on the first afternoon of his evidence, and then another interpreter (who to my mind seemed somewhat less accomplished) on the second day.  </p>

Indeed, some of his answers towards the end of his evidence were treated with some incredulity by Mr. Choo Choy. Mr. Jorgensen thought that the sale to LMS was a sale of Updata Europe, rather than a sale of Updata UK. He said that he did not know that LMS had been working with the UK management and had been discussing the company with them. He said that he did not recall meeting LMS in April 2009 with the UK management, even though the meeting was referred to in his witness statement, and even though he had referred to the meeting in his oral evidence that morning. (“The first meeting we had with LMS to the close I think one month”). He could not remember the LMS offer letter. When asked whether he knew that the UK management were involved in the bidding process, he said that he did not know (prompting Mr. Choo Choy to say that this was “quite extraordinary”). His evidence that the period between the LMS letter to the close (of the sale) was 1 month was not accurate: the period was in fact close to three months (14 April to 9 July). Mr. Jorgensen could not recall many of the documents that he was shown in cross-examination (perhaps unsurprisingly in view of the passage of time). </p>

Mr. Jorgensen clearly had difficulty in recalling the events of the time, and in answering questions which were hypothetical. Indeed, the opening sentence of paragraph 31 of his witness statement stated, very fairly, that he could not say with certainty what he would have done differently if there had been information available to him that “confirmed positive forecasts about Updata UK’s performance”. Similarly, paragraph 36 of his witness statement acknowledges, sensibly in my view, that Mr. Jorgensen would have been less inclined to stop the sale process at a late stage, once LMS had been awarded exclusivity. </p>

Nevertheless, I considered that his evidence had some value in confirming my conclusions as set out above. As far as Mr. Jorgensen was concerned, Mr. Homann’s evidence was in substance that the former was persuadable: “I found it was always possible to persuade Mr. Jorgensen not to accept an offer, so long as we could persuade him that it was not a good offer, and that Updata Europe would continue to service its debt. So long as Updata Europe could show a proper income stream, Mr. Jorgensen might not be happy, but he would be satisfied”. He referred in this connection to the agreement reached in January 2009, which was made on the basis of expected receipt of dividends. To my mind, this evidence was consistent with what occurred. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Defendants’ submission was, in essence, that this was an unrealistic approach in circumstances where there was considerable uncertainty as to whether any increased price could in fact be achieved. They argued for a mathematical approach, which involved assessing separately the chances of LMS increasing its offer, Mr. Nielsen increasing his offer, the Bank agreeing to extend time, and factoring in any other contingencies (such as other purchasers making proposals), and then multiplying each of the resulting probabilities. At most, whether on this approach or any other, any increase would have been no more than 5 or 10% above the price which LMS actually paid. Mr. Choo Choy pointed to various matters, including the uncertainty relating to whether Mr. Nielsen/e-Kong would have made an increased offer, and their difficulties in so doing in light of the management’s unwillingness to work with Mr. Nielsen. There were other factors militating against Updata Europe’s ability to obtain the market price; in particular, the tight timetable, and the fact that any new purchasers would have to carry out due diligence. Any purchaser would also inevitably know about the Bank debt, and would be looking to pay the minimum price possible. It would also be appropriate to take into account the value which LMS gave up by allowing Newwatch to retain its shares and acquire more. Furthermore, any hypothetical outside purchaser would be competing against an incumbent management, which was the worst kind of opposition. All of these matters would have a moderating influence on any possible increased price.  </p>

There was no dispute that a claim for the value of an asset disposed of in consequence of fraud was a recognised head of loss in the context of the tort of deceit, although of course credit needs to be given for the value received. The Claimants have established, on the basis of my findings above, that, if the representations had not been made, they would not have disposed of the asset on the terms which they did, and that the effect of the misrepresentation was that they were presented with a best offer which was lower than would have been the case if the misrepresentations had not been made.  </p>

I do not consider that 2014 date (as contended for by the Claimants in their alternative case) would be a reasonable date to take. The position in 2009, and in particular July 2009, was that the Bank wanted a reduction in the indebtedness, and I have no doubt that it would not have been amenable to suggestions which would have had the effect of significantly postponing a large capital repayment, even if there were some possibility of dividends being paid and also a possibility of future growth in the value of the company. The evidence showed that the Bank had its own pressures and problems in the aftermath of the financial crisis, albeit I was not persuaded that there was any particular pressure by the Danish FSA in relation to the Updata Europe loans. Whilst I have concluded that there might have been some flexibility in terms of extending the timing of a sale, I consider that this is to be measured in terms of weeks or a few months at most, and not in terms of years. If there was a buyer in 2009 willing and able to buy the company, with funds available, the Bank would not have wanted the buyer to walk away, as Mr. Jorgensen’s evidence made clear. </p>

This would also have the benefit of repaying Vald. Nielsen in respect of the monies originally provided by Mr. Johnsen’s grandmother. I do not therefore consider that Updata Europe would, in July 2009 (when the sale took place) or September 2009 (when the extension agreed with the Bank ran out) have attempted to obtain an indefinite postponement of a sale of the shares in Updata UK. Nor do I think, on the evidence, that there would have been a real or substantial chance of obtaining the Bank’s agreement to such a postponement. In the light of Mr. Hildebrandt’s frank evidence, I also do not consider that, in the very difficult banking conditions of late 2008 and 2009, there was any real or substantial chance of Updata Europe finding another Bank willing to refinance. Accordingly, the relevant date for the assessment of loss is July 2009. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">These conclusions also mean that the Claimants’ alternative claim based on the 2014 date – namely a claim based on “loss of a chance” for the lost opportunity of persuading the Bank to postpone a sale – also fails. It is fair to note that Mr. Booth never embraced a claim based on “loss of a chance” with any enthusiasm. His opening submissions contained no reference to loss of a chance, and his primary submission (in a short note produced a few days into the trial, after I had raised the potential applicability of “loss of a chance” principles) was that this was not a loss of a chance case. I consider that Mr. Booth was correct, including in relation to his case for a 2014 date to assess loss. In accordance with the cases which I have already discussed, the issue of whether or not the Claimants would have decided, and would have been in a position, to postpone sale until 2014 is an issue to be resolved on the balance of probabilities: it concerns what the Claimants would have done. If the Claimants were unable to establish these facts, on a balance of probabilities, then the claim based on a 2014 sale should fail. There is in my view no intermediate case based on the lost opportunity to persuade Mr. Jorgensen – who was not a potential purchaser of the shares – to permit the Claimants to retain their shares.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Accordingly, I return to my starting point for the assessment of loss, namely the value of the asset in 2009. The question is whether that is also the finishing point in the assessment of damages. In my view, even though the true value of the asset at the date of loss is the starting point for assessing loss, it is appropriate to consider all the factual circumstances in deciding whether or not it is appropriate to award damages by reference to the true value of the asset. Mr. Booth was inclined to agree that, in some circumstances at least, an award of damages less than the true value may be appropriate. He gave the example of a vendor who was, for some reason or another, not motivated to try to obtain the true value of an asset, because he was very favourably inclined to a particular purchaser.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, I do not think that that is the only case in which the facts may result in an award of damages which is different to the true value. The quantification of damages is, even in a case of fraud, compensatory not punitive. There is no authority which in my view compels the conclusion that, in a case of fraud, the court must assume that the shares could have been sold for their true value. There may be various factors which militate against this conclusion; for example: time-pressures on a vendor to sell, a weak bargaining position, a lack of expertise or professional assistance in relation to selling an asset where there is no instantly available market (such as a stock exchange) for the purchase of such assets. It seems to me that it is appropriate, before awarding damages by reference to the true value of the asset, to consider the chances of the relevant event occurring.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">so. Ultimately, the question of whether a discount is appropriate depends upon the context in which the issue arises. On the facts of the present case as described above, where the relevant asset was in the course of being sold and there is obvious uncertainty as to what price could be achieved, I consider that it is appropriate to consider the chances of the sale achieving the true value of the asset in question, and if appropriate to apply a discount to reflect uncertainty. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, I do not accept that it is appropriate to address this question by considering each particular contingency on which a sale may have depended, and then multiplying the resulting probabilities together. The authorities reviewed by Bryan J. in <span style="font-style:italic">AssetCo</span> indicate that this may be appropriate in some loss of a chance cases. But for reasons already given, I do not consider that this is a loss of a chance case. In any event, neither <span style="font-style:italic">AssetCo</span>, nor the line of authority considered in that case including the seminal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span>, involved the question of how to value the claimant’s loss in circumstances where he was deprived of a valuable asset by fraud. As I have indicated, the starting point in such cases is the true value of the asset, but with the possibility of a discount to reflect the chances of realising the true value of that asset in the particular circumstances of the case. I would also in any event have considered the multiplication approach to be inappropriate in any event. The central question is to consider the prospect of a purchaser, whether it be LMS, some other private equity house, Mr. Nielsen, a trade buyer or otherwise, paying the true value for the shares, and doing so within the timescale of a sale by September 2009 or a few weeks or months thereafter. It would in my view be inappropriate to try to assess the percentage chance of any particular purchaser buying the shares, and then multiply together the various percentages. The reason can be illustrated by a simple example. If there was a single potential purchaser where the chance of paying true value was 75%, the damages would be assessed at 75%. But if there were two such purchasers, the damages would, on the multiplication theory, be calculated on the basis of a lower figure, namely 75% x 75%. The larger the number of potential purchasers at 75%, the smaller the damages on the basis of the Defendants’ multiplication approach. This counter-intuitive result must in my view be wrong. The reason is that each potential purchaser does not constitute a separate contingency that needs to be considered and evaluated and overcome by Updata Europe in order to obtain the benefit of a sale. In order to obtain a sale at true value, there only needed to be one purchaser. If there was one purchaser who was willing to pay 75% of the true value, the existence of other purchasers who were only willing to pay less would not diminish the amount that could be obtained from the purchaser willing to pay more. </p>

Turning now to the facts, I consider that there should be a material discount from the true value of the asset, but I do not consider that there are any factors which lead me to conclude that this should be a very substantial one. Indeed, it seems to me that there are good reasons for awarding something relatively close to true value. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is a case where the evidence is clear that the majority shareholding in Updata UK was an asset which was actually and potentially attractive to a variety of investors. The initial offering by Tenon to the private equity market quickly resulted in interest from a number of houses. It is true that the offers made were at or around what was understood to be the level of the Bank debt, but this was an unsurprising and obvious consequence of the “opportunity” having been presented as one to acquire the shareholding at that level. The AMR Report showed that Updata UK would potentially be of interest to trade buyers; i.e. to companies in the technology sector. This is borne out by the interest shown by e-Kong. The management itself was clearly very confident as to the future of the business, and were highly motivated to remove Update Europe and retain (with private equity investment) control of the business. There was another bidder actually on the scene (Mr. Nielsen), with a potential backer and a capable corporate finance adviser. In the context of causation, I have already indicated that, had the representation not been made, these and other factors would have had the effect of driving the price offered towards the true market value of the business. In addition, the expert accounting evidence served to confirm, in my view, the existence of a market of willing buyers for the asset in question. There was no suggestion, for example, that the asset was so specialised that there was only a very limited potential pool of potential purchasers.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I also consider that this conclusion (i.e. that damages should be close to the true value of the asset) is supported, and reinforced, by a point which Mr. Booth emphasised in the course of argument. This is a case of fraud, where what happened was that the Defendants sought deliberately to divert the course of events from that which they would and should have taken if the 20 April and 3 June e-mails had not contained false information. In the context of an asset for sale, that course of events should ordinarily lead to the vendor receiving the fair value of that asset. In those circumstances, I do not consider that the court should look favourably on arguments to the effect that fair value should not be taken as the measure of loss, because there are too many imponderables to know whether fair value would have been received. There are always imponderables. But the Defendants were sufficiently concerned as to how events would transpire that they found it necessary to misrepresent the position. Again in the present context, their misrepresentations form an evidential weapon which should lead the court to be somewhat sceptical in relation to the Defendants’ submission that the Claimants would not, if there had been no deceit, have received the true value of their asset.  </p>

There was also the pressure arising from the fact that the January 2009 agreement between the Bank and Updata Europe/ Denmark meant the facilities could be terminated in September. But I do not consider that these factors should result in a very substantial reduction from the true value of the asset. The initial misrepresentation was made on 20 April 2009, when no timetable had been imposed on the bidders and there was still a fair amount of time to September. Even on 3 June, there were still some months before September. The evidence indicated to me that the process leading to a sale, including due diligence, can be accomplished relatively quickly if parties set their minds to it.

It is also the case, and an important consideration, that Mr. Johnsen’s efforts to find a purchaser gave the impression of being somewhat amateur. He did not engage professional advisers (the equivalent of Tenon or Mr. Medhurst), but rather seems to have carried out the work on his own, approaching people whom he knew or to whom he was introduced. These efforts had not been successful. Mr. Johnsen explained that, certainly in a number of cases, this was because he was seeking investment at the parent company level, and the structure of the shareholding made this unattractive.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On the other hand, whilst it is true that Mr. Johnsen had not succeeded in finding investors, the position by mid-April 2009 was that the Defendants had succeeded in finding a number of private equity houses who were potentially interested, and the Defendants were themselves highly motivated to carry out an MBO. So whilst Mr. Johnsen had not successfully found potential investors, the Defendants had done so with the assistance of firm of corporate finance advisers (Tenon) with expertise in this area. Similarly, Mr. Nielsen was using the services of Mr. Medhurst, who was looking (albeit with inadequate and false information as to the projected results of Updata UK) at both the trade market and the private equity market. It is wrong, in my view, simply to focus on Mr. Johnsen’s efforts on the “sell” side whilst ignoring the efforts which had been made, and could be made, on the “buy side” as well, where there was strong motivation for a sale and a potential market of buyers had been established. Furthermore, if the misrepresentations had not been made, Mr. Johnsen would have had figures – which had attracted the private equity market – which he could show other potential investors.  </p>

Neither expert suggested that this factor affected the true value of Updata Europe’s shares. However, it does seem to me that it is a factor which is potentially relevant to the price that would have been obtained upon a sale. Mr. Johnsen would in my view have been attracted to proposals which may have fallen short of the true value of Updata Europe’s shares, if they were accompanied by a willingness to allow Newwatch to retain its interest and acquire further shares. </p>

This involved making an earnings-based assessment by which an estimate of Updata UK’s maintainable earnings as at the date of the SPA on 11 July 2009 (such earnings being measured as EBITDA) is first made. A multiplier should then be applied in order to arrive at an estimate of the “Enterprise Value” of the company. That Enterprise Value would then be adjusted, where necessary, for any net debt. Two other adjustments would then be made, so that there were therefore four main components. These were: (i) maintainable earnings, (ii) the multiplier, (iii) a premium for taking control of the company, and (iv) a discount to reflect the fact that the shares were in a private company.  </p>

I considered that it would, on the facts of the present case, be appropriate to include such a premium.

It seems to me that on the facts of the present case, where fraud is alleged, it is essential to address the question:  what would have happened if the fraudulent misrepresentation had not been made? This issue, addressed in detail in Section H above, involves the resolution of factual matters which are for the court to determine, and are not matters for the expert accountants. It is not right to short-circuit the analysis by proceeding (as did Mr. Smethurst) from a starting point - that the sale had characteristics of a forced sale - directly to the conclusion that there was no loss because the best price was obtained. As Mr. Smethurst fairly accepted in cross examination: “If – if there was fraud involved and some people didn’t have – and some people didn’t have information and others did, then I don’t know what would have happened”.</p>

His oral evidence was that, prior to cross-examination, he had not realised that allegations of fraud were being made against the Defendants. Later in his evidence, he accepted that the question of whether or not Updata Europe had suffered a loss would depend upon all the circumstances, including what the effect would have been on the timetable for sale if proper or full information had been provided. He said that if there would have been “some latitude for some other course of action, then that’s where one might explore further”. His concept of a forced sale was very much a concept of the seller having to sell, and having in practice no or little room for manoeuvre. The extent to which there was room for manoeuvre is a factual question which I have addressed in Section H. </p>

If one were to apply Mr. Smethurst’s very broad criteria for “forced sale”, I would conclude that the sale did have some characteristics of such a sale. In one sense it could be said that there was a “compulsion to transact”, and that Updata Europe was not a willing seller. This was because Updata Europe was clearly under pressure to reduce the debt to the Bank, and it would have preferred to have retained its shares if it could. Had there been no significant debt, Updata Europe would not have been selling. However, the sale did not come about because the Bank actually forced Updata Europe to sell against its wishes, and so there was no “compulsion” in that sense. Indeed, when the bidding process concluded, it was Updata Europe’s decision to sell. There was also, again in one sense, a “reduced sale period”: in that a timetable was laid down in May 2009 for the bidding process leading ultimately to a sale. But as described in Section H, the overall timetable for the sale was not unduly compressed. Indeed, the whole process, starting from Mr. Nielsen’s expression of interest in January, took over 6 months, and nearly 3 months passed between the original LMS offer and the conclusion of the sale process.  </p>

I also considered that Mr. Hall was right to say that there was a spectrum of “compulsion”, and that there might be different degrees or a spectrum of compulsion. The concept of a “forced sale” therefore involved, as he said, “shades of grey”. At one end of a scale, a bank may demand immediate repayment of a loan. At another end of the scale, it may give the company, say, 6 months to sell; i.e. enough time for an orderly sale. So “it depends where you are between those extremes”. </p>

However, in assessing the amount of Updata Europe’s loss, and specifically the extent to which Updata Europe would have obtained the fair value of the asset, it is necessary to take into account the pressure from the Bank to sell, and the fact that limitless time to do so was not available. I have sought to reflect these and other factors in my assessment of the loss suffered in the present case by application of a 25% discount from the true value for the reasons given in Section H.  </p>

The price at which they bought should therefore be treated as the market price or the fair value in the real world. The competitive bidding process started at an early stage. LMS was originally selected as the management’s preferred bidder after they had put in a proposal to UK management at the start of April 2009. At that time, LMS knew that they were in competition with other private equity houses. In due course, when LMS made its first offer to Updata Europe in April, its second offer in May, and then repeated that offer in June, LMS was doing so knowing that it was in competition with Mr. Nielsen. Accordingly, whilst the accountants might have their own views as to what was fair value, the best evidence of fair value was the offer which LMS actually made and which was accepted. In this context, the Defendants emphasised </p>

I agree with the Claimants that it is inappropriate to determine fair value by reference to the price that a single bidder was prepared to offer; particularly in view of the expert evidence which indicates that the LMS offer was at a significant undervalue. There may be a variety of reasons for the price offered by a particular bidder, and which do not reflect on the true value of the asset. For example, the bidder may be interested in the asset, but only if he can acquire it cheaply. He may have internal criteria, such as a targeted internal rate of return, which dictate the level of his offer. The level of his bid may have been dictated by a perception that a bank will pressurise a seller to sell in order to pay off a bank debt.  </p>

In the present case, that did not happen. There were a number of private equity houses which expressed interest, to Tenon and LMS, in the acquisition in early April. But these expressions of interest were not made to Updata Europe, but rather as part of a potential negotiation with Updata UK’s management. Furthermore, these expressions of interest were given in the context of the private equity houses having been told, in the Tenon Memorandum, that the opportunity was to acquire the asset at the level of the bank debt. It is therefore not surprising that their proposals were pitched at around that level. </p>

This 2009 valuation to an extent supported the Claimants’ case the company was worth more than LMS paid for it, but also supported the Defendants’ case that the figures put forward by the accountants were too high. I did not, however, consider that I derived any real assistance from this valuation. There was no information as to how this value, used for the purposes of LMS’s annual report, was arrived at, and what criteria were applied.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Both experts took as their starting point a figure for the financial year (“FY”) 20092010 which was contained in a document called “Gross Profit Breakdown v10” which was prepared by Mr. Mantell. This document was last modified on 9 July 2009, shortly before the SPA was signed in the early hours of 11 July 2009, and therefore contains the management’s figures on almost the eve of the sale. The EBITDA shown in this document was £ 7,469,000. However, Mr. Hall had identified that this figure wrongly failed to take into account certain overheads or administrative costs totalling £ 809,000. This meant that the figure of £ 7,469,000 should be reduced to £ 6,691,000 for the FY 2009-2010. This figure was somewhat higher than the equivalent FY 2009/2010 figure in the March Weighted Budget (which was £ 6,071,000), and this reflected Updata UK’s strong performance since the time when that budget had been prepared. It should also be noted that the figure, whether £ 6,691,000 or £ 6,071,000, represented a very significant increase over the results for the FY 2008/2009 which had ended at the end of June. The company’s results for the FY 2008/2009, as set out in due course in restated accounts for that year, were £ 1.869 million. Importantly, however, both experts agreed that the relevant starting point for maintainable earnings was the FY 2009/2010, rather than the “trailing” FY 2008/2009. </p>

He assumed that the company would win 8 new contracts per year in these subsequent years. This compared to 7 new contracts secured in the FY to June 2009, and 14 new contracts secured in the FY to June 2010. His projections for the subsequent years were £ 6.767 million (2011), £ 7.819 million (2012), and £ 9.161 </p>

The weighted average of these figures, applying a greater weighting to the earlier years, was £ 7.200 million. Mr. Hall rounded this down to £ 7 million; a figure which he considered could reasonably have been assumed by the UK management of Updata UK at the date of the SPA to be the maintainable earnings of the company. It was this figure of £ 7,000,000 which is contained in the table set out above.  </p>

But Mr. Smethurst reduced it to a range of £ 4.2 - £ 4.7 million, ultimately a mid-point of £ 4.5 million for maintainable earnings. The reductions from the £ 7.4 million starting point were made for a number of reasons. Mr. Smethurst considered that a willing purchaser would not ascribe any value to contracts which Updata UK had weighted as having a probability of 50% or below. He also reduced the weighting of 90% and 70% probability contracts to 70% and 50% respectively. He also considered a contemporaneous e-mail from Mr. Szpiro of LMS, setting out his views as to maintainable earnings. This e-mail (described in more detail below) showed year-on-year reductions in projected earnings, and Mr. Smethurst applied the same percentage reductions as shown in the LMS e-mail. He also applied a 10-25% reduction in gross profit on rental and installation revenue on the basis of likely public sector cuts. Mr. Smethurst’s figure of £ 4.2 million assumed a 25% reduction, and his figure of £ 4.7 million reflected a 10% reduction. His figures also made allowance for the exclusion of overheads/ administrative expenses. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Each expert supported his approach by reference to various factors. Mr. Hall referred to the fact that Updata UK’s revenue was not derived from one off sales, with no following rental stream. Rather, its revenue and margins were incremental as it added new contracts, each of which would provide a revenue stream for multiple years and with the good prospect of renewal at the end. Although it was relevant to look at the wider economic and commercial environment when considering the value of Updata UK, including the global financial crisis in late 2008, it was also important to look at the report prepared by AMR in July 2009 as part of due diligence for LMS. This showed that, notwithstanding the crisis, AMR considered that Updata UK’s business was likely to prove very successful. AMR reported positively on a revenue forecast of approximately £ 21.4 million for FY 2010, and EBITDA for that year of approximately £ 6.9 million. Mr. Hall drew attention to the forecast of maintainable earnings in the LMS e-mail of 29 June 2009. In his view, this supported a maintainable EBITDA level of approximately £ 7 million at that time. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr. Smethurst referred to, and described in some detail, the wider economic and commercial environment. There was a general lack of available finance/ lending from banks to prospective purchasers. This, and the general economic climate, impacted upon the price that purchasers were prepared to pay in connection with corporate acquisitions. The number of corporate transactions was significantly reduced in 2009. The financial crisis also had an impact on the amount which local authorities were prepared to pay. Potential cuts to local authority spending were a matter of concern to Updata UK and a feature of the commercial landscape. Against this background, a prospective purchaser would not be looking at maintainable earnings of £ 7 million for a company which had never achieved EBITDA of anything approaching that level. The figure of £ 7 million represented a multiple of around 3.75 times the earnings achieved in 2009 (£ 1.869 million). It was not credible that a hypothetical purchaser </p>

Given the economic climate, a purchaser would take a more cautious view of contracts with only a limited chance of coming to fruition.  Mr. Smethurst also drew attention, in addition to the uncertainty and instability caused by the global credit crisis and the threats of cuts in public spending, to question-marks as to the continuity of the existing UK management. Although there were generally positive comments in the AMR report as to Updata UK’s prospects, that report was not considering the amount that might be paid as between a willing buyer and seller, and did not contain a figure for maintainable earnings. </p>

It was a figure which both experts agreed was overstated by around £ 800,000 because of the exclusion of overheads/ administrative expenses. It follows that the other figures for projected EBITDA, which assumed a 5% growth in administrative costs, would have been similarly overstated. After making this deduction, it will be seen that the figures for maintainable earnings in the years 20112014, as estimated by Mr. Szpiro, were between £ 5.7 million and £ 6.1 million. </p>

He explained that Mr. Szpiro was seeking to extrapolate into the future from contracts recently won. When asked whether these were “intended to be realistic conservative assumptions as regards what was expected to happen going into the future”, Mr. Hooft said that he was just “disputing the word “conservative” because we at LMS did not think for example that 7.4 in 2010 was conservative.” </p>

Viewed overall, and bearing in mind the error in relation to overheads, I consider that the LMS e-mail is relevant evidence that a willing purchaser would conservatively assess the company’s maintainable earnings looking into the future, and beyond  FY 2010, as between £ 5.7 million and £ 6.1 million; i.e. a midpoint of £ </p>

It seemed to me that not only Updata UK, but also Tenon, LMS and AMR, considered these probabilities to be reasonable. It is of course true that they were only assessments as to what might happen in the future, and that an assessment of a 10% probability of success by definition meant that there was a 90% chance of failure. However, I thought that a willing purchaser would expect some of the contracts with a 50% or less probability to come to fruition, not least because that is what must have happened historically (since the probabilities were assigned depending upon the stage reached).  </p>

A purchaser might naturally take a cautious view as to whether this would be maintainable. I agree, and this is one reason why I would not accept Mr. Hall’s figure of £ 7 million, and would reduce it to a figure of £ 5.8 million, which is towards the lower end of the range of £ 5.7 – £ 6.1 million to which I have referred. It is true that this is itself a considerable step up on the previous performance of the company, including the performance in FY 2008/9. Nevertheless, it represents a reduction on the figure in the Tenon Memorandum (just over £ 6 million) and a substantial reduction on the FY 2010 figure (correcting for administrative expenses) in the July weighted budget (£ 6.6 million). On the facts of the present case, however, such a step-up is justified. As the AMR report said, the company “took off” in 2008.  And to be fair to Mr. Smethurst, his figure of maintainable earnings of £ 4,500,000 does acknowledge a very considerable step up. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In Mr. Hall’s first report, he expressed the view that a prospective purchaser would pay a premium of between 20% and 50% for control of a company, and that this should  in effect be an additional amount over and above the figure derived by multiplying EBITDA by an appropriate multiple. Mr. Hall chose the midpoint (35%) as being the appropriate premium for control. It was common ground that there should be some addition to reflect the premium for control; because the “multipliers” derived from comparable companies in the market were generally for small parcels of shares, and therefore did not reflect the premium that would be paid for control. </p>

Mr. Smethurst identified the share price on the day before a takeover offer was made, and the share price which was contained in the takeover offer. The average premium was 22.6%, and the median was 19.8%. He therefore applied a 22% uplift for control.  </p>

Mr. Hall therefore looked at data relating to the companies identified by Mr. Smethurst, including in some cases the average share trading price 3 months preceding the date of the initial offer. He considered it reasonable to assume that in at least some of Mr. Smethurst’s examples, the target’s share price had already increased to reflect a proportion of the control premium. Mr. Hall’s approach produced an average control premium of 34.07% and a median of 36.82%. It also resulted in a much narrower range of premiums for control, in contrast to the figures used by Mr. Smethurst which varied from 3% negative to 87% positive. </p>

He therefore looked at the share price one month prior to the offer. He excluded one takeover (Borland Software Corporation) which he described as an “outlier”: in the case of that company, the one-month comparison showed a premium of 188%. Having excluded this outlier, Mr. Smethurst’s figure was an average of 26.04% and a median of 23.11%. The midpoint of those two figures was 24.58% which Mr. Smethurst rounded to 25%. If the Borland transaction were to be included, then (on the basis of Mr. Smethurst’s figures) the average would be 38.54% (i.e. close to Mr. Hall’s figure of 35%) and the median would be 25.13%. </p>

This was some time before one month prior to the offer, and it showed that Mr. Smethurst’s bid premium was understated. In the case of another company (Valtech SA), there was a press article which referred to a premium of 43.1% compared to the average trading price of the shares during the three months preceding the filing of the offer. In the case of Sodifrance, there had been an increase in the company’s share price in December 2008, following the signing of a memorandum of understanding. Mr. Smethurst’s calculation of the bid premium for that company was, in Mr. Hall’s view, understated: since he should have had regard to the share price between 17 November 2008 and 16 December 2008.  In the case of Borland (Mr. Smethurst’s outlier at 188.46%), Mr. Hall relied upon a press release which referred to a premium of approximately 67% over the average thirty day closing price. Accordingly, this “outlier” should not have been excluded. </p>

In Mr. Smethurst’s view, however, these companies were outliers. Excluding those companies, the average was 26.15% and the median was 25.71%. The midpoint of the average and median premia was 25.93%; i.e. just above the 25% which Mr. Smethurst had selected. Mr. Smethurst did not, however, exclude a company (RGI SpA) which appeared to be an “outlier” in terms of the low bid premium (2.39%). </p>

This was done by Mr. Hall on the basis, without detailed analysis, that bid premia usually fall within the range of 20 – 50%. However, it seemed to me that that broad estimate was ultimately proved to be valid. When considering Mr. Smethurst’s final table: of the 13 transactions referred to, 7 fell within this range and one (Carl Lamm) was only just outside it. Furthermore, if all 13 transactions are included, the average was (on Mr. Smethurst’s figures) 35.75%. I was not persuaded that it was appropriate, in what seems to me to be a fairly broad-brush exercise, to omit two of the transactions completely on the basis that they were “outliers”. I think that it is reasonable to look at all of the data, and on any view to include at least a substantial part of the premium paid for those companies.  </p>

If this is done, the average moves to 28.52% and the median to 27.4% on Mr. Smethurst’s figures. Both of these numbers are higher than Mr. Smethurst’s selected figure of 25%. However, the average on Mr. Smethurst’s figures for all companies (35.75%) corresponds very closely with the average as calculated by Mr. Hall (38.75%), and I do not attach great significance to the fact that Mr. Hall has sometimes looked at different date ranges in order to derive his average figures.  </p>

In particular, there was no crossexamination of Mr. Jorgen Johnsen, Mr. Hildebrandt, or Mr. Birkeland on the basis that they had acted deceitfully in relation to the assignment documentation. On 23 April 2019, prior to submission of written closings, the Defendants’ solicitors wrote in connection with the “obvious narrowing of the Defendants case” and identified the factual points that they would be pursuing in their closing argument concerning alleged wrongful behaviour in connection with the assignment.  </p>

In essence, the Defendants’ case is that Mr Bigaard, Mr Homann and Mr Peter Johnsen had actual knowledge that the contracts of assignment were being (and thus intended that they be) backdated to 19 November 2010 for a deceitful purpose – namely, to mislead the Supervisor and/or creditors. Further, and as Mr Rosing confirmed (day18/160/16 – day18/161/3), assuming Mr Homann and Mr Peter Johnsen were acting as agents with authority to negotiate on behalf of Updata Europe and Vald Nielsen (and the other shareholders of Updata Europe named in the Schedule to the contracts of assignment) respectively as their principals (as the Claimants themselves allege), then their principals (namely, the eventual parties to the contracts of assignment) are treated as having the same knowledge and state of mind as Mr Homann and Mr Peter Johnsen.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Nor was I impressed with any of the pleading points that were taken in the Claimants’ closing argument. It seemed to me that the case was sufficiently pleaded, indeed was pleaded in some considerable detail. It is true that the Defendants’ case originally involved allegations of deceit against more individuals on the Vald. Nielsen side than Mr. Johnsen. However, a case was always made against Mr. Johnsen, and I did not consider that the Claimants can reasonably complain that there was no pleaded case that, as a matter of Danish law, Mr. Johnsen’s knowledge was to be attributed to Vald. Nielsen. The pleading contains clear allegations against Mr. Johnsen. Since it was Mr. Johnsen who had carried out the negotiations with Mr. Homann, and was the only person on the Vald. Nielsen side who did so, it would ordinarily follow (certainly if English law were being applied) that Mr. Johnsen’s knowledge would be attributed to Vald. Nielsen. If it were to be suggested that Danish law produced some different result, then it would be for the Claimants to prove that Danish law as to attribution was different to English law. In the event, Mr. Rosing (the Claimants’ Danish law expert) confirmed what might be thought to be the ordinary position in his evidence; namely that where the terms of a contract are negotiated by agents on behalf of their principals, the knowledge of the agent acquired in the course of the negotiation is treated as the knowledge of the principal. He agreed at the conclusion of his evidence that if such agents were to share an intention to deceive a third party through backdating, an agreement negotiated by such an agent would be unenforceable: because the knowledge of the agent would be assumed to be the knowledge of the principal. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Accordingly, I consider that the Defendants’ case should be addressed on the merits and the facts. The critical factual issue which arose on this defence was whether or not the backdating was for a deceitful purpose, namely to mislead the Supervisor of Updata Europe and/or its creditors, and if so who was party to any deceitful purpose. If there was such a deceitful purpose, then issues arose as to what were its consequences, both under Danish law and under the approach now taken to illegality under English law. The Claimants’ case was that there was no deceitful purpose to the backdating, and that in any event no-one on the Claimants’ side (and specifically Mr. Johnsen) was aware of this deceitful purpose. They also contended that even if an intention to deceive the Supervisor or creditors could be demonstrated, the assignment remained valid under English law. </p>

One potential difficulty, however, was that it was Updata Europe that had sold its shares under the SPA, and that company had now been acquired by companies owned by Mr. Bigaard. This led to the idea that there could be an assignment by Updata Europe of its rights to the former owners of Updata Europe who had, on the proposed case, lost out as a result of the conduct which had led to the sale at an alleged undervalue. </p>

These discussions began in October or November, but prior to the meeting on 19 November described below. Mr. Johnsen explained to Mr. Homann that he considered that Updata UK had been sold at an undervalue, and that he wanted to bring a claim against the UK management to reclaim the loss that he and the other shareholders in Updata Europe had suffered. Mr. Homann was by now working closely with Mr. Bigaard in relation to the business of Updata Europe. As Mr. Homann explained in his written statement, after the sale of Updata Europe to Mr. Bigaard, Mr. Homann continued to work with Updata Europe and he had authority to act on its behalf on various matters.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The possibility of an assignment clearly had its attractions to Mr. Homann. Updata Europe had owed monies to KPMG, and as part of his settlement package upon leaving KPMG, Mr. Homann had taken an assignment of the debt. A successful claim against the UK management could produce funds which would enable this debt to be paid, as well as possibly other unpaid debts of Updata Europe. Equally, there was in practical terms no real downside to Updata Europe, or Mr. Bigaard, from assigning the potential claims. Mr. Bigaard had no interest in pursuing such claims himself: as he said in evidence, the Updata Europe group had many problems which occupied him at that time. The pursuit of a claim against the former management would be potentially expensive, and its prospects would have appeared very uncertain, and in practice it could not be pursued without the assistance of the former shareholders in Updata Europe. Mr. Bigaard could also see some positive advantages to an assignment. If the Johnsens recovered monies, that might encourage them to invest again in Updata Europe. In addition, a recovery might enable some of the debts of Updata Europe to be paid. Mr. Bigaard was happy to leave Mr. Homann to carry out the discussions. He described Mr. Homann as very skilled accountant and also an experienced businessman, and “so I trusted him to make the best agreement for him and the group when he was on his way to negotiate with Mr Johnsen”. Mr. Bigaard therefore left things to Mr. Homann and did not follow the detail of the discussions. </p>

Mr. Birkeland then amended the draft on 21 December, which he completed at around 1 pm or 2 pm. This was done prior to the meeting with Mr. Homann that evening. Although they were by that time in final form, the drafts were not given to Mr. Homann at that meeting. They were, however (as described above) sent by Mr. Birkeland to Mr. Johnsen, and then to Mr. Homann, on the following day (22 December).

He also denied knowing about the appointment of Mr. Jepsen at the time. I do not accept this evidence. I have no doubt that Mr. Homann did tell Mr. Johnsen about the appointment of Mr. Jepsen, and that this created a potential problem in relation to the assignment documentation which at that stage had not been signed. There must in my view have then been some discussion about the possibility of backdating the documentation, and Mr. Johnsen in his e-mail was intending to lay the groundwork for backdating; by suggesting that the agreements had been concluded in early October. I also infer that Mr. Homann did not consider this date (2 October 2010) acceptable or justifiable. It may well be that there had been discussions about the possible assignment on or around 2 October, but there was no basis for saying that any agreement had been concluded at that time. So instead it was Mr. Homann who identified the relevant date as 19 November, and this was the date which he inserted at the start of the documents which Mr. Bigaard and others signed. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I also was unpersuaded by Mr. Johnsen’s evidence that he added the date “19.11.10”, to his initials on the final page of the assignments, in order to make it clear that the final signature pages were linked to the assignment documents themselves. This could have been done by simply stapling the signature pages to the rest of the document, and in any event it is difficult to see that there was any room for doubt as to whether the final signature page formed part of the document. I therefore agree with the Defendants that this dating was done as a method of Mr. Johnsen reinforcing the date of 19 November 2010 which appeared at the start of the assignment documentation. Mr. Johnsen’s decision to do this was, in my view, indicative of the fact that he had previously been told by Mr. Homann about the appointment of the Supervisor, and that backdating was necessary in order to avoid potential arguments. </p>

On 22 December, Mr. Birkeland wrote to Mr. Inkester of Nabarro LLP, who was dealing with the proposed deed of rectification on behalf of the new UK company and its shareholders, including the Defendants. Mr. Birkeland said that he had met with Mr. Homann “in relation to some other matters. There may be an opening in relation to UE as well, but it is still too early to tell. I will revert when I have something more concrete in this respect”. Mr. Birkeland did not therefore tell Mr. Inkester that there had been an assignment.

This Deed of Rectification was beneficial to the Defendants, and the new UK company in which they owned shares, because there was a substantial tax saving. The Defendants did not at that stage seek to investigate or take any point on the validity of the assignment documentation, or even to ask to see it. However, the fact that the Defendants willingly signed the Deed of Rectification, thereby acknowledging Vald. Nielsen as assignee, was no doubt one reason why (belatedly) the Defendants abandoned their argument based upon lack of consent to the assignment. </p>

The Defendants also served a short expert report from Mr. Peter Nørtved, a senior legal counsel also with Gorrissen Federspiel.

Ms. Krebs and Mr. Nørtved were also cross-examined, but very briefly indeed. I considered that all the experts sought to assist the court on the Danish law issues, and that there was in truth very little material disagreement between them. Furthermore, the narrowing of the Defendants’ case as to the invalidity of the assignment – and in particular the fact that reliance was no longer placed upon the fact that consent to the assignment had not been sought in advance – meant that some of the issues addressed by the experts are no longer of importance. The expert evidence on the contractual issues also strayed, perhaps inevitably, into questions as to how a Danish court would approach the factual evidence in a case. Neither side, however, placed significant reliance on this aspect of the Danish law expert evidence, and rightly so. The role of the experts was to identify the relevant principles of Danish law. The determination of how that law applies to the facts of the present case is a matter for the English court. The assessment of the strength or otherwise of the evidence in that regard is also a matter for the English court, applying its own approach to the evidence rather than any particular approach that might be taken by a Danish judge. </p>

In the latter half of 2010, a bankruptcy petition against Updata Europe was issued by a company called Krone Kapital A/S. At around the same time, Krone Kapital, Deloitte and acompany called Actelis Networks (Israel) started bankruptcy proceedings against Updata Denmark. A hearing of the petition against Updata Europe took place on 3 January 2011. At that hearing, the Bankruptcy Division of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court decided to postpone the bankruptcy petition which had been filed against Updata Europe.  During the “postponement period”, Mr. Jepsen was appointed as Supervisor. In April 2011, however, the postponement period was lifted, and the company returned to normal operations. </p>

But in the event that the postponement period ceased (as happened in April 2011), and the debtor resumed ordinary business and regained full authority over his assets, the interests of creditors were sufficiently protected by the ordinary rules on management liability. According, in a situation where the debtor has resumed business and there is no bankruptcy, there is no basis for claiming that a prior transaction entered into without consent is (simply because of the lack of consent) invalid. The debtor is therefore bound by the transaction. Accordingly, the lack of consent is inconsequential in the event that the debtor resumed his ordinary course of business, as was the case with Updata Europe.

In his view, it would “suffice if the main terms of the contract were agreed upon at the earlier date”. He illustrated this point by drawing a distinction between terms of the written agreement which fleshed out the earlier oral agreement, and terms of the written agreement which changed it. An example of the former category would be a case where the parties had agreed the main terms orally, but had not given thought to the question of governing law. If the subsequent agreement contained a provision for governing law, Danish law would uphold the backdated agreement (i.e. as taking effect on the backdated date), even though Danish law was not a matter which had featured in the parties’ discussions. An example of the latter category would be a case where the parties had agreed on a consideration of DKK 2 million, and had subsequently changed the agreement so as to provide for a consideration of DKK 1 million. In that situation, a main term would have been changed.  This aspect of Mr. Rosing’s evidence was not substantially disputed by Ms. Gernaa.

Instead, absent an intention to deceive, the agreement would remain a valid agreement; but it would only take effect from the actual date of the agreement, rather than the backdated date. Ms. Gernaa agreed with the proposition that, in this scenario, the agreement would be valid but could only be enforced from the date agreed, rather than the earlier date. Mr. Rosing’s evidence was to the same effect: if there was no intention to deceive, then the contract remained valid but would only take effect from the date when it was actually made. </p>

Hence, C could not establish his claim even though he had subsequently decided to include VAT. Mr. Rosing, rather tentatively, suggested that a court might look at events subsequent to the making of the contract, in order to decide whether or not public policy should prevent enforcement of the contract. Thus, in the present case, Mr. Rosing suggested that the fact that the Supervisor’s appointment had been terminated after 3 months, with Updata Europe resuming full control of its activities, might be relevant. However, I thought that this rather tentative suggestion could not easily be reconciled with the decision in Case U 2014.2434 H and I preferred Ms. Gernaa’s evidence on this point. Accordingly, the question of whether a contract entered into with an intention to deceive third parties is contrary to morality within the meaning of section 5.1.2 is judged as at the date that the contract was entered into, notwithstanding that as a result of subsequent events there ceased to be any need to deceive or that there was no actual deception. </p>

They were agreed that both written and oral agreements are valid and binding under Danish law, and that there are no formal requirements as to how an assignment agreement should be established or what terms it must contain. An oral agreement for an assignment is therefore binding in Danish law. However, if the parties have agreed that there is no agreement until the contract is signed, then the prior oral agreement will obviously not be binding. The experts were also agreed that it was necessary for the parties to have agreed on the main terms of the assignment. The main terms of an assignment would be (i) specification of precisely who the parties to the agreement are and (ii) specification of the assigned rights.  </p>

This evidence showed that the existence and terms of an oral agreement are difficult to prove, and that a Danish court generally requires substantial evidence before recognising and enforcing an oral assignment agreement. If the parties are not able to prove that they have reached an agreement regarding the main terms, a Danish court would be reluctant to give effect to such an agreement. Proving an oral agreement in Denmark is therefore difficult, and the courts would likely to assume as a starting point that a significant agreement would not be binding until reduced to writing. Ms. Gernaa said that in a situation where both parties knew that the agreement would be committed to writing at a later stage, the courts would be “reluctant” to say that there was a binding contract prior to the point where the parties actually signed the contract. </p>

I consider that this, too, must have been the intention of the parties to the assignments; since it is the most obvious and an entirely rational explanation of why these two agreements were exercised. There was no suggestion by the Defendants that this was an impermissible approach either under English law or under Danish law. In view of this rationale, arguments which had featured in the Defendants’ opening as to the uncertainty of what had been agreed, and difficulties in reconciling the two agreements, were not pursued in closing and were in any event in my view illfounded. </p>

The explanation for that agreement was a concern on the part of Vald. Nielsen that it might not want to tell the Defendants the full detail of the terms of the assignment, in case it alerted them to the proposed litigation. Mr. Choo Choy confirmed that he did not rely on the intention to potentially conceal the full terms of the assignment as “an independent basis for non-enforceability’. But he did say that it was relevant, in terms of background, “as to the relevant individuals’ willingness to do what they have to do in order effectively pretend that the assignments were fully valid”. I did not think that even this limited point had any force. It seems that the idea that it might be problematic to show the Defendants the full terms of the assignment, and that therefore there should be a short-form document, had nothing to do with the case that there was an intention to deceive the Supervisor. It was Mr. Birkeland (against whom the pleaded allegation of deceit in relation to backdating was ultimately not pursued) who drafted the short-form assignment. Furthermore, he took advice from counsel in relation to the three assignments, and counsel did not suggest that there was anything improper in relation to the signature of three agreements, albeit that he made it clear that he was not expressing a view as to what might need to be produced to the court in due course. </p>

There is no doubt that the reason that the documents were backdated was because of the appointment of Mr. Jepsen, and therefore a concern to avoid a suggestion that the assignments required his consent. But I did not consider that this fact in itself demonstrated that there was an intention to deceive. I agree with the Claimants that the real question was not whether, applying Danish law, there was a legally binding agreement made on 19 November 2010, but rather whether the parties to the assignments genuinely believed that there had been a binding agreement. If so, there could be no dishonesty in the backdating: if there was a genuine belief that a binding agreement had previously been concluded, the parties’ written agreement would have been giving formal approval to an oral agreement entered into an earlier date. On behalf of the Defendants, Mr. Choo Choy rightly accepted that if everybody genuinely thought the agreement had “absolutely been made on 19 November but for some technical reason, as a matter of Danish law, the agreement would not be treated as being made on 19 November, that it would be difficult then to say that they intended to deceive”. But he submitted that there was no such genuine belief; because the parties to the assignments appreciated that the deal would only be done when the documentation was drawn up and signed. The Defendants’ case in opening was that Mr. Johnsen, and the others on the Vald. Nielsen side, “knew the agreements were <span style="text-decoration:underline">misleadingly</span> backdated – misleading because there was no binding oral agreement on 19 November 2010 in the same terms as the three agreements they were signing.

Indeed, I think it more likely than not that when they looked back on what had happened, they believed that their written agreement was indeed giving effect to an oral agreement made earlier. In that regard, they did not subject the events to the rigorous scrutiny or legal analysis that would have been necessary if, for example, there had been litigation between the participants as to whether or not a binding agreement had been made at an earlier stage.

That is clear from the fact that Mr. Birkeland started his work on the documentation that very Friday evening, and had completed a draft by the Sunday. The meeting was between two people, neither of whom were lawyers, who knew each other well. It was not the first discussion between them. I have no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr. Homann, supported by Mr. Bigaard, that Mr. Homann had been given authority to deal with the matter. The discussion was not a difficult one, because (for reasons already given) it was in the interests of Mr. Johnsen as well as Mr. Homann and Updata Europe for there to be an assignment. It is in my view inherently probable that matters were then settled at that meeting, and that both Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Homann left the meeting thinking that they had a deal. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr. Hildebrandt, Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Bigaard as to what they were told at some point after the meeting, namely that there was a deal. </p>

They were, after all, businessmen rather than lawyers. In my view, they would both have understood that the agreement would have to be documented properly. Hence Mr. Birkeland became involved immediately after the meeting. But there is no reason to think that there was any specific agreement between them that nothing was binding unless and until it was signed and documented. If either of them had been asked after the meeting whether or not their agreement was binding, each would probably said that they had done a deal and that they hoped and expected that the other side would not try to back away from what had been agreed, albeit that it remained to be documented.  </p>

I think that if that argument had come before a Danish court, the party who backed away from the agreement would have had the better of the argument; because proving an oral agreement is difficult, particularly in a situation where it was contemplated that the agreement would be reduced to writing. But it seems to me that this conclusion does not assist, or go very far in assisting, the Defendants’ argument that there was no genuine belief that there had been a binding agreement.

In those circumstances, I do not consider it surprising that the participants took the view that their signature of the documentation was giving effect to their prior agreement. </p>

All the drafting was done by Mr. Birkeland. There was some delay in producing a document to Mr. Homann, but this seems to have been attributable to Mr. Boulton’s absence from London and the need to address the points which Mr. Boulton raised. When the draft document was in due course given to Mr. Homann on 22 December, he raised no queries about it and it was subsequently signed without amendment by Mr. Bigaard and his colleagues. This seems to me to support the case that the agreement signed did indeed fairly reflect what had been agreed at the 19 November meeting.  </p>

Mr. Birkeland supported Mr. Johnsen’s evidence as to how the first draft came to refer to DKK 2 million: this was a figure that had been discussed between Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Johnsen prior to the meeting on 19 November as being the figure which Mr. Homann was looking for and which Mr. Johnsen was in principle agreeable; Mr. Johnsen had agreed a figure of DKK 1 million at the 19 November meeting; but when he spoke to Mr. Birkeland after the meeting, he was travelling with Mr. Homann in the same car, and he did not want to refer to the fact that the figure agreed was less than the DKK 2 million that Mr. Johnsen had been contemplating as the payment. The point was not picked up until 20 December when Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Johnsen went through the documents.  </p>

However, I do not consider that I can reject it as implausible. The fact is that the documentation which was given to Mr. Homann on 22 December did refer to DKK 1 million: he had never been given any document showing DKK 2 million. If the agreement reached on 19 November had been an agreement for DKK 2 million, then it is difficult to see why Mr. Johnsen would subsequently have sought to reduce it, at a time when he was no doubt keen to finalise the documents, and possibly risk an argument with Mr. Homann; an argument about a comparatively small sum of money which was only ever going to be paid if the litigation was successful. Equally, it is difficult to see why Mr. Homann, if he had already agreed DKK 2 million, would have agreed to reduce it to DKK 1 million rather than sticking to what had previously been agreed. The fact that Mr. Homann then obtained signatures on the assignments, without any challenge to the DKK 1 million, again supports the proposition that the agreements reflected the amount (DKK 1 million) which had previously been agreed. </p>

His evidence was that he was told by Mr. Homann at some point in November or December that there was a “done deal”. This happened prior to Mr. Jepsen’s appointment, and therefore it was not something to which Mr. Jepsen needed to give his consent. Mr. Bigaard is a lawyer with over 40 years’ experience. He struck me as a very careful man, and I think that he would have hesitated long and hard before agreeing to backdate documentation for the purpose of deceiving Mr. Jepsen. I do not wholly accept the Claimants’ submission that he had no motive improperly to backdate documents, and no motive to lie to the court about what had happened. In theory, he may have been motivated to backdate the documents because the assignment was beneficial to Mr. Homann, with whom he worked closely, and potentially beneficial to Updata Europe at least in the long-term. In theory, he could then have lied to the court because he had no option but to justify what he had done, in view of the fact that he had backdated the documents. However, whilst there is a theoretical motivation, I did not think that this is what happened, or what is likely to have happened. I regard it as far more probable that Mr. Bigaard backdated the documents because he thought that they reflected a prior “done deal”, and that he considered that it was legitimate to do so. </p>

The idea of backdating to 19 November seems to have been his idea. It is his handwriting at the front of the documents, and I infer that he did not think that it was appropriate to backdate to 2 October (the date referred to in Mr. Johnsen’s e-mail of 5 January). There was a great deal of evidence about Mr. Homann in the course of the case. He seems to have been held in high regard by many people, including Mr. Jorgensen and Mr. Nielsen. He had worked for KPMG for 37 years, where he was a partner. There was nothing in the evidence that suggested that he lacked integrity. Indeed, as I have previously mentioned, the pleadings themselves do not allege deceit against Mr. Homann, and the case against him seems to have developed at a comparatively late stage. But at all events, I am unable to conclude on the evidence that he intended to deceive Mr. Jepsen. Again, I think it far more probable that Mr. Homann believed that backdating was permissible because the written agreement reflected the agreement reached on 19 November. </p>

If they had any concerns, it would have been a very simple matter – once Mr. Jepsen was off the scene in April 2011 – to have executed fresh documentation. The fact that no-one thought that this was necessary is, in my view, an indication that none of these individuals considered that they had acted improperly in backdating the documents. </p>

I am ultimately concerned with the state of mind of Mr. Bigaard, Mr. Homann and Mr. Johnsen, against whom the allegation of intention to deceive is made. It is no longer alleged that Mr. Birkeland was party to any intended deception of the Supervisor. I agree that Mr. Birkeland’s statements during this period are potentially relevant to the question of whether Mr. Johnsen, with whom Mr. Birkeland was in contact, believed that a binding agreement had been made on 19 November 2010. However, there is no indication that this was an issue which was discussed between Mr. Birkeland and Mr. Johnsen at the time, or to which any thought was even given. This is not surprising. In November and December, it was simply not a live issue. Mr. Birkeland was not giving, and did not need to give, any consideration to the question of whether or not, as a matter of law, a binding agreement had been reached at the 19 November meeting. Rather, he was approaching matters on the basis that what was important was for the agreement to be documented. As Mr. Birkeland said, it would be very hard to prove that there was an agreement, or to act upon it, if it was not documented. He therefore said that he “needed to have a document signed by all parties to confirm the terms that had been agreed between Mr. Homann and Mr. Johnsen”. The statements which he made in his e-mails at the time therefore reflected his unsurprising view that it was important to document the assignment, and do not assist in answering the question of whether, when the documents were backdated, Mr. Johnsen (or Mr. Homann or Mr. Bigaard) believed that a binding agreement had previously been made.  </p>

There was discussion of the replacement of an existing loan agreement between Vald. Nielsen and one of Mr. Bigaard’s companies, Bigaard Four Holding. A draft of a new loan agreement was circulated in early 2011, but this was not done until 7 February 2011; i.e. a month after Updata Europe had signed the assignment. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the assignment was conditional upon this loan agreement. There was also discussion of another loan agreement involving Cagain Europe and Change Networks. Mr. Birkeland drafted a loan agreement after the 21 December meeting, but in the end he did not believe that this loan was ever made. Again, therefore, the assignment was not conditional upon this loan agreement. The same can be said about a settlement agreement concluded between Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Nielsen. This was made on 31 January 2011, again some time after Updata Europe had signed. Moreover, Mr. Nielsen was not involved in the discussions concerning the assignment, and does not appear to have known about the details of the assignment until very recently. The documents therefore do not support a case that the assignments were conditional upon the conclusion of other agreements, or that the participants knew that there had been no binding agreement in November 2010 because other documents remained to be negotiated and concluded. </p>

Updata Europe itself was not considering bringing a claim; since the claim had been assigned to Vald. Nielsen. In so far as the passage can be read as suggesting that Updata Europe was considering bringing a claim, and might incur costs, it is puzzling if not misleading. It is possible, however, as the Claimants suggested, that: (i) the language was deliberately phrased in the passive (“… consideration is being given”), because it was the assignee which was giving consideration to the possibility of action; and (ii) the passage was included because there would be some benefit to Updata Europe’s creditors if the action were to succeed.

Prior to signing in January, he sought and received some reassurance from Mr. Birkeland that his economic interest in the claim would be protected. It seems to me that this episode is again of no real assistance in relation to the argument on intention to deceive. I accept that it is unlikely that the 19 November 2010 discussions and agreement between Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Homann had involved the question of whether shareholders such as Mr. Hildebrandt would be party to the agreement. However, Mr. Homann’s witness statement indicates that, unsurprisingly, he understood that the purpose of the assignment would be to benefit the former shareholders of Updata Europe, and this would of course include Mr. Hildebrandt and others. Subsequently, the idea emerged – during the drafting process and as a result of Mr. Boulton’s advice and concerns about champerty – that the former shareholders should be parties to the assignments, and in due course this is what happened (save for Mr. Bremerskov). But I do not think that, at the time, it would have occurred to Mr. Johnsen or Mr. Homann (or Mr. Bigaard, who was in any event distant from the detail) that this development was a material alteration to what had previously been agreed, or meant that it was improper to backdate the assignment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This conclusion means that it is unnecessary to consider in detail the arguments as to the validity of the English law assignment. This is because the Defendants’ case on illegality in relation to the English law agreement was based on the same illegality as was alleged to render the agreement unenforceable under Danish law: i.e. the case that the agreements were executed and back-dated for the purpose of or with the intention of deceiving the Supervisor and/or the general creditors of Updata Europe and avoiding the need to seek the Supervisor’s consent to the assignment. Having rejected the argument based on intention to deceive in the context of Danish law, it follows that the premise of the argument in relation to the English law agreement fails as well. </p>

It was common ground that in relation to illegality under English law, it was appropriate to apply the approach set out in the judgment of Lord Toulson in <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v Mirza </span>[2016] UKSC 42, [2017] A.C.467 at paragraph [120]: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system (or, possibly, certain aspects of public morality, the boundaries of which have never been made entirely clear and which do not arise for consideration in this case). In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary (a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, (b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and (c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate.” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Applying this approach, I first consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim. Here, the underlying purpose of the prohibition transgressed is, as the Defendants rightly submitted, the deterrence of fraudulent conduct, and in particular conduct which is fraudulent towards (i) a person who has been appointed by the court as the equivalent of an administrator and thereby (ii) the creditors of a company. I agree that there is a powerful public interest in protecting the legal system from claims based on fraudulent documents. The purpose of the prohibition would therefore, all other things being equal, be enhanced by denial of the claim. But in the present case all other things are not equal; because an unusual feature of the present case is that the effect of the Defendants’ argument, if successful, would be to produce a result which in practice insulates them from liability for their own fraudulent conduct. Accordingly, the Defendants’ invocation of the importance of deterring fraudulent conduct rings hollow in the circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, I hesitate to say that in the context of the present case, the purpose of the prohibition transgressed would be enhanced by denial of the claim.

The one matter is, again, that there is a public policy in favour of making those responsible for fraudulent conduct liable for the consequences of their actions. Again, however, I proceed for present purposes on the basis that this is matter which is relevant to the question of proportionality, rather than the question of whether there is any other relevant public policy on which denial of the claim may have an impact. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, the Defendants’ case as to intention to deceive rests upon the 19 November 2010 dating of the documents, and upon the argument that the parties to the assignments had not – as at that date – reached a binding agreement. Even if that were the case, however, it seems to me to be very clear on the evidence that the parties did reach a clear agreement for an assignment prior to the appointment of the Supervisor. The factual position is that Mr. Birkeland produced the final draft of the assignment documentation on 21 December 2010, and this was prior to the final meeting in Copenhagen between himself, Mr. Homann and Mr. Johnsen on 21 December 2010. The documents were then sent by e-mail on 22 December, and were signed in that form. There is no evidence of any negotiation after that meeting on 21 December. It is also the case that by 21 December, the documents referred to Mr. Homann receiving DKK 1 million (rather than the DKK 2 million referred to in earlier drafts). Accordingly, even if I had accepted the Defendants’ argument that the original agreement was DKK 2 million, the reduction had been agreed by 21 December.  </p>

This is a case where the parties to the assignment had, prior to the appointment of the Supervisor, reached agreement on all material terms of the proposed assignment. The only problem, if there was a problem, was that the parties had not signed the documentation. True, this opens the way for the Defendants’ argument that the agreement reached was not binding unless and until the documents were signed. But it is difficult to see why, even if this were so, it would be proportionate to deny the claim. </p>

No creditors have ever needed to set aside the assignments. </p>

Nielsen and the other signatories to have executed fresh assignment documentation in April 2011 or at any time thereafter. Had this been done, all of the Defendants’ arguments would have fallen away. The fact that this was not done indicates that none of the relevant individuals against whom the allegation of intention to deceive is made (Mr. Johnsen, Mr. Homann and Mr. Bigaard) had any qualms or concerns as to the backdating. This reinforces my conclusion that those individuals did not intend to deceive: the fact that no-one bothered to re-execute documentation after April 2011 is strongly suggestive of the fact that everyone thought that it had been legitimately executed in the first place. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This leads to a related point. It seems to me that, subsequent to April 2011, the parties to the assignments have conducted themselves on the basis that these were valid and effective. Thus, Mr. Bigaard has clearly been aware of the present proceedings, and indeed has given evidence in support of the Claimants. In these circumstances, the fact that fresh documentation has not been executed, when it could have been, seems rather irrelevant, and is certainly not a reason for denying the claim. All the parties to the assignments therefore treated them as valid and continuing, and could easily have executed fresh documentation if they had wanted to. </p>

They were keen to obtain, for tax reasons, the Deed of Rectification. This was signed by Vald. Nielsen as assignee, and the Defendants were perfectly content with that. It is only now, many years later, and long after the tax benefits have been obtained, that the Defendants have decided to put the assignment under scrutiny. </p>

There were also arguments, albeit to a lesser extent, as to whether or not any such duty was broken, and in particular the extent to which the claims advanced were permissible in the light of the order made by Field J. on the strike-out hearing. That order struck out claims: (i) for breach of fiduciary duty based on non-fraudulent misrepresentation, and (ii) as against Mr. Mantell, for breach of fiduciary duty based on non-fraudulent nondisclosure. There were also arguments as to whether it was appropriate for the court to order an account, particularly in circumstances where the Claimants had not sought to quantify or prove at trial the amounts claimed in consequence of the breach of duty.  </p>

The fiduciary duties owed to the company arise from the legal relationship between the directors and the company directed and controlled by them. The fiduciary duties owed to the shareholders do not arise from that legal relationship. They are dependent on establishing a special factual relationship between the directors and the shareholders in the particular case. Events may take place which bring the directors of the company into direct and close contact with the shareholders in a manner capable of generating fiduciary obligations, such as a duty of disclosure of material facts to the shareholders, or an obligation to use confidential information and valuable commercial and financial opportunities , which have been acquired by the directors in that office, for the benefit of the shareholders, and not to prefer and promote their own interests at the expense of the shareholders. </p>

These duties may arise in special circumstances which replicate the salient features of well established categories of fiduciary relationships. Fiduciary relationships, such as agency, involve duties of trust, confidence and loyalty. Those duties are, in general, attracted by and attached to a person who undertakes, or who, depending on all the circumstances, is treated as having assumed, responsibility to act on behalf of, or for the benefit of, another person. That other person may have entrusted or, depending on all the circumstances, may be treated as having entrusted, the care of his property, affairs, transactions or interests to him. There are, for example, instances of the directors of a company making direct approaches to, and dealing with, the shareholders in relation to a specific transaction and holding themselves out as agents for them in connection with the acquisition or disposal of shares; or making material representations to them; or failing to make material disclosure to them of insider information in the context of negotiations for a take-over of the company's business; or supplying to them specific information and advice on which they have relied. These events are capable of constituting special circumstances and of generating fiduciary obligations, especially in those cases in which the directors, for their own benefit, seek to use their position and special inside knowledge acquired by them to take improper or unfair advantage of the shareholders. </p>

It seems to me to follow that this special relationship must be something over and above the usual relationship that any director of a company has with its shareholders. It is not enough that the director, as a director, has more knowledge of the company's affairs than the shareholders have: since they direct and control the company's affairs this will almost inevitably be the case. Nor is it enough that the actions of the directors will have the potential to affect the shareholders – again this will always, or almost always, be the case. On the decided cases the sort of relationship that has given rise to a fiduciary duty has been where there has been some personal relationship or particular dealing or transaction between them. </p>

		</a>at 18A-F, is<span style="color:#212121"> someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. That is why the distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty: someone who has agreed to act in the interests of another has to put the interests of that other first. But the relationship between directors and shareholders is not in general like that. A director is a fiduciary for his company: by agreeing to act as director, he necessarily agrees to act in the interests of the company. But he does not have, by virtue of his appointment as director, any direct relationship with the shareholders: no doubt the interests of the shareholders and the company are in general aligned but this does not mean that a director has agreed to act for the individual shareholders or has a direct relationship with them – his relationship is with the company. If he is to be held to owe fiduciary duties to the individual shareholders, there must be something unusual in the nature of the relationship which gives rise to it. That no doubt explains why the cases where such a duty has been held to exist mostly concern companies which are small and closely held, where there is often a family or other personal relationship between the parties, and where, in almost all cases, there is a particular transaction involved in which directors are dealing with the shareholders, from which the directors often stand to benefit personally. The imposition of a fiduciary duty in such circumstances reflects the fact that directors who have a close family or other personal relationship with shareholders, and are entering into transactions with them, may be tempted to exploit that relationship to take unfair advantage of the shareholders for their own benefit.” </span></p>

The Defendants were seeking to remove Updata Europe as main shareholder, and were planning an MBO. If there was going to be an MBO, it was particularly vital that as between those with knowledge on the inside and those with shares on the outside, that there was full and proper disclosure so that those who might be selling their shares were not disadvantaged by what happens. The court should impose a duty in that situation. If a director is going to take advantage of his knowledge to benefit himself, vis-a-vis a shareholder, it is not unreasonable to impose a duty to ensure that he is being full and frank about what the position is. If no fiduciary duty existed in the present case, then it is difficult to conceive of a case where it would be held to exist. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The authorities, as discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharp v Blank, </span>show that the reason why the directors of a company owe fiduciary duties to the company is that, by virtue of their appointment as directors, they become agents of the company and stewards of its affairs. By contrast, the directors of a company do not, merely by virtue of their office of director, owe fiduciary duties to the shareholders, whether collectively or individually. This is because a company is legally distinct from its members, and the directors’ direction and control of the affairs and assets of the company cannot be equated with direction or control of the affairs or assets of the members. The general principle that directors do not owe fiduciary duties to shareholders is also supported by well-established policy considerations, as summarised by Nugee J in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharp v Blank</span> at [9(3)].  </p>

This is by way of exception to the general rule. As Nugee J said at [13], there must be something unusual in the nature of the relationship which gives rise to it. In <span style="font-style:italic">Peskin</span>, Mummery LJ (with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) identified the situation in which fiduciary duties arise as depending upon<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the existence of “special circumstances which replicate the salient features of wellestablished categories of fiduciary relationships”. Such fiduciary duties generally attach to “a person who undertakes, or who, depending on all the circumstances, is treated as having assumed, responsibility to act on behalf of, or for the benefit of, another person. That other person may have entrusted, or depending on all the circumstances, may be treated as having entrusted, the care of his property, affairs, transactions or interests to him.” (<span style="font-style:italic">Peskin</span> at [34]). </p>

In that case, the plaintiff and defendant were brothers in law, being married to two sisters. They owned shares in a company, but had fallen out. There was, as the judge said, “no relationship of confidence, and indeed all trust had been broken years before and succeeded by hostility at the worst, wariness at the best”. Their mother-in-law was keen for them to restore harmony, and therefore there were discussions with a view to a buyout and in due course the defendant acquired the shares of the plaintiff. This was done at a significant undervalue, because the defendant did not reveal the existence of a substantial offer from a prospective purchaser of the company.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Neither the judge nor the Court of Appeal considered that the facts were as strong as <span style="font-style:italic">Coleman</span>, but nevertheless a fiduciary duty was held to exist.

The origin of the sale to LMS lay in the approach of Mr. Nielsen in early 2009. This caused the Defendants to react by seeking investors for a possible MBO, leading in due course to the selection of LMS. Mr. Baldorino told Mr. Johnsen in an e-mail of 16 </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">April 2009, referring to a conversation on the previous day, that: “we have embarked on facilitating a substantial proposal from LMS Capital”. There was, therefore, no approach by the Defendants on their own behalf, and Mr. Johnsen was only told of the forthcoming proposal from LMS on the day before it was made. When the offer was made on 16 April 2009, it was made by LMS in writing. It was not made by the Defendants. The offer contemplated that the transaction would be consummated by an acquisition vehicle, the newco,  which would be financed entirely by LMS and selected management members. This is what in due course happened: the SPA was a sale by all the existing shareholders of Updata UK (including the Defendants themselves) to the new company, Updata Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. In the meantime, there were negotiations between Mr. Johnsen and others with LMS: in particular, a telephone call on 29 April 2009 between Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Hooft, another such call on 4 May 2009, and a meeting between Updata Europe board members and representatives of LMS at Mr. Holm’s home on 11 June 2009. The Defendants themselves did not participate in these discussions or negotiations. Accordingly, the ultimate transaction, including the terms on which Newwatch could rollover its shares and acquire further shares, was a consequence of the bidding process and a commercial negotiation between Mr. Johnsen and others and LMS. It was not a consequence of a commercial negotiation between Mr. Johnsen (or others from the EVs) with the Defendants, who had minority interests in the acquiring vehicle. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, a contrast is to be drawn between the circumstances of some of the cases where a fiduciary duty has been held to exist, and the present facts. This is not a case where the EVs had no access to Updata UK’s business information, other than for example audited accounts. Historically, as described in Mr. Hildebrandt’s evidence, both Mr. Johnsen and Mr. Nielsen worked at Updata UK’s offices, as did Mr. Hildebrandt both before and after he became a director of Updata UK. They could and did discuss matters with the UK management. Updata UK did provide financial information to Updata Europe; for example, Mr. Holm did receive regular cash flow statements, and he had a channel of communication to Mr. Mantell if he wanted financial information – albeit that Mr. Mantell would invariably want to check with Mr. Bennett before he provided anything. The present case arises not from the fact that the UK management gave no information to the EVs during the time when Updata UK was in business, or because the EVs had no access to financial information. Rather, it arises from statements made in 2009 when requests for information were made, but false answers were given. </p>

Again, the invocation of the directors’ superior knowledge of the business, compared to that of the shareholders, is not a special circumstance.

But I do not consider that these facts in themselves, or taken in conjunction with the other matters that I have described, establish the existence of a fiduciary duty. Mummery LJ does refer to various events, including the making of material representations by directors to shareholders, as being capable of constituting special circumstances and generating fiduciary obligations. However, this statement is made in the context of the earlier part of [34] of his judgment, where he identifies the hallmarks of a fiduciary relationship. I do not consider that the relevant passage means that whenever a false statement is made, even in the context of a possible share acquisition by a director from a shareholder, a fiduciary duty arises. </p>

Similarly none of the factual circumstances indicated the existence of any such duty on his part. </p>

The fraud involved deliberate and fraudulent concealment of the expected results of Updata UK and specifically of the March Weighted Budget, as well as the fact that the UK management had provided different “factual data” to Tenon and LMS. There can be no doubt that claims for breach of fiduciary duty based on fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent nondisclosure are permissible in the light of the order of Sir Richad Field.  </p>
