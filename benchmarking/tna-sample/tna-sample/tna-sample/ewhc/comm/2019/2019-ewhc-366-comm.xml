They involve two connected actions. The first action concerns a claim by Marme Inversiones 2007 SL (‘Marme’) against NatWest Markets Plc (which was at all relevant times known as RBS plc, and is, therefore, referred to in this judgment as ‘RBS’) and the Second to Fifth Defendants (referred to as the ‘Non-RBS </p>

The second action concerns RBS’s claim against Marme, which mirrors the counterclaims made by the Non-RBS Banks in the first action. These proceedings arise primarily out of interest rate swaps entered into between Marme and each of the Defendants in September 2008, a few days prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It is common ground that the issues raised in both actions are the same. </p>

The context was the purchase of Ciudad Financiera by Marme, which was financed in part by a loan of €1.575 billion to Marme by a syndicate of eight lenders, including the Defendants (the ‘Senior Loan’). The terms of the Senior Loan required Marme to enter into hedging arrangements in relation to the interest payable; the Swaps were entered into to satisfy this requirement. The parties’ respective liabilities under the Swaps were set by reference to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (‘EURIBOR’). </p>

Mr Moryoussef was, in July 2018, convicted of conspiracy to defraud in respect of EURIBOR. Marme contends that Mr Moryoussef was manipulating EURIBOR whilst at RBS and submitted that, as a result of his activities, RBS should be regarded as, as Mr Saini QC put it, a “<span style="font-style:italic">rotten bank</span>”.  </p>

Completion was, therefore, extended a number of times. The first occasion involved an extension to 16 May 2008, agreed on 31 March 2008, which entailed Mr Maud and Mr Quinlan providing, in return, the increased completion guarantee of €75 million. The completion date was, then, extended, successively, to 31 May 2008 (on 18 April 2008), 20 June 2008 (on 23 May 2008), 31 July 2008 (on 27 June 2008) and 28 August 2008 (on 1 August 2008) and, finally, to 12 September 2008 (on 29 August 2008).  </p>

Marme’s original plan was to obtain bond financing through the securitisation of the anticipated rental stream under the lease. However, it became clear in early 2008 that this was not a viable option given the deepening credit crunch. Marme, instead, directed its attention towards traditional (or ‘vanilla’) secured debt financing by way of a syndicated loan. Mr Maud and Mr Quinlan, nonetheless, continued to believe that a bond issue would become viable and would serve as their exit strategy from the deal. </p>

Marme contends that such negotiations would have resulted in one of two alternative structures for the Transaction. The first alternative (the ‘PIK Loan Structure’), Mr Saini QC explained on behalf of Marme, entails Marme not entering into the Swaps at all and, instead, covering the initial shortfall in rental income necessary to cover loan repayments through a ‘payment in kind’ (‘PIK’) loan structure. Marme contends that it would have been better off under this structure by approximately €996 million. The second alternative (the ‘Swap Discount Structure’) entails Marme negotiating a discount of 50 bps over the whole Transaction, including a 10 bps discount on the Swaps. In this second counterfactual, Marme contends that it would have been better off by €29,534,269.  </p>

It is defined by the European Money Markets Institute as an index of “<span style="font-style:italic">the rate at which Euro interbank term deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank within the euro zone</span>”. It is widely used in international money markets. EURIBOR is published daily by the European Money Markets Institute (‘EMMI’) (and formerly by the European Banking Federation). A panel of banks submit daily quotes between 10.45 am and 11 am Brussels time to Thomson Reuters (the calculation agent of the EMMI) of the rate that each believes one prime bank is quoting to another prime bank for interbank term deposits within the Eurozone for each of 15 different maturities. EURIBOR is calculated as the mean of these quotes (to three decimal places) after discarding the top 15% and bottom 15%. In 2008, there were 43 panel banks. EURIBOR is determined daily at 11 am Brussels time (10 am London time) </p>

Two entities (Euribor - ECF and Euribor - ACI) were established, under Belgian law, to supervise the operation of Euribor. The Code was prepared for the purposes of the Euribor setting process; this was replaced in 2008, but in essentially similar terms.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC, on behalf of the Non-RBS Banks, made a number of criticisms of Mr Maud. I consider that there is some force in these various criticisms. Although Mr Maud emphasised during his evidence that he was no longer involved with Marme, it is clear that he was not wholly unpartisan. At the very least, he has a reputation to protect but, more than that, Mr Maud did seem to want to do his best to help Marme’s case, sometimes even going beyond what Marme was contending, when, for example, claiming that Mr Goodwin agreed “<span style="font-style:italic">everything on behalf of the banks</span>”. Mr Maud often seemed to be attempting to work out the impact of certain questions. At times he was evasive, sometimes failing to answer the question which was being put to him and at times giving what appeared to be prepared answers or even speeches in a manner which unfortunately witnesses sometimes now do. Mr Maud also often repeated certain words or phrases that he appeared to consider key to Marme’s case: for example, that he believed that EURIBOR was a “<span style="font-style:italic">true and honest</span>” rate and that RBS “<span style="font-style:italic">did everything</span>” in relation to the Transaction. That said, my overall impression was not that Mr Maud gave misleading evidence, nor that he set out to do so. On the contrary, in my view, he generally tried to assist the Court in the evidence which he gave. </p>

He further submitted that Mr Maud on a number of occasions sought to explain these away in an unconvincing manner. I agree with Mr Howe QC about this. For example, in cross-examination, Mr Maud brought up an email which he had spotted in the trial bundle when preparing for the case and which he said triggered a “<span style="font-style:italic">vivid recollection</span>” that a stepped swap had been suggested by Mr Goodwin to Mr Littlewood in December </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">There is no escaping the fact, nonetheless, that Mr Maud’s evidence evolved during the course of the proceedings in a way, in which, in my view, is unlikely to be entirely accidental. An example of this, highlighted by Mr Howe QC, concerns Mr Maud’s evidence on Marme’s opposition to interest rate swaps. In his first witness statement (dated October 2014 in support of an application for early disclosure), Mr Maud said that Marme:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC highlighted also what they suggested was “<span style="font-style:italic">sharp conduct</span>” on the part of Mr Maud during the negotiations which led to the Transaction being concluded. First, they submitted that Mr Maud tried to negotiate a reduction in the credit spread on the Swaps by telling Mr Goodwin that Propinvest had been working on a figure of 13 bps (including both credit and execution) when Mr Maud knew (Mr Littlewood having told him a few hours prior to the negotiation) that the figure was 15 bps. In crossexamination, Mr Quest QC put to Mr Maud the various calls in which the credit spread was discussed between Propinvest and Mr Goodwin, suggesting that, although he told Mr Goodwin at the time that he believed that the credit spread was to be 13 bps ‘all in’, he understood very well that, in fact, everybody had been proceeding to date on the basis of a 15 bps spread. Ultimately, Mr Maud accepted that he had seen “<span style="font-style:italic">an opportunity of like: well let’s see if we can get one bp off, right, just on the basis that I’ve made a mistake: I know it’s 15, I’m going to go back and I’m going to agree 15, but let’s see if we can just get one bp off on the option, you know”</span>. He explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“that’s just commercial trading between, you know, two parties who were both trying to get the best advantage they can out of any transaction”</span>. In my view, this does not make Mr Maud dishonest. He is an opportunist, a deal-</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The same applies to another instance relied upon by Mr Quest QC concerning an email sent on 22 June 2008 to individuals at the LIA in which he referred to “<span style="font-style:italic">Bayern LB’s credit approved amount of €500m</span>”. Mr Maud accepted in crossexamination that, in fact, Bayern had not credit-approved an amount of €500 million but had approved a somewhat lesser amount - just €150 million. When asked why he said what he did to the LIA, he replied “<span style="font-style:italic">I don’t know, actually … I don’t know why I said that</span>.” He stated that Propinvest believed at that time that Bayern was going to get to €500 million as Mr Worley (of Bayern) was saying that they would but he did not know why he used the words “<span style="font-style:italic">credit approved</span>” and he accepted that he “<span style="font-style:italic">must have known</span>” that Bayern had not credit approved an amount of €500 million. Mr Quest QC put to Mr Maud that, in the circumstances, he must have known that what he had written was not true and that the reason why he told the LIA what he did was because he wanted to get a letter from them to Santander saying that, subject to financing, they would participate in the equity and other financing. Mr Quest QC submitted in closing that this cannot be dismissed as “<span style="font-style:italic">inadvertence or careless drafting, particularly when Mr Maud admitted that it was hard to raise equity without having senior lending in place</span>”. Mr Quest QC pointed out that, in an email on 11 June 2008 (ten days before the email to the LIA), Mr Maud had written to Mr Quinlan setting out the current position as to the banks’ commitments. He put Bayern’s figure at “<span style="font-style:italic">€150m (!)</span>” (and so the correct amount) and went on to state this: “<span style="font-style:italic">I must say, however, that the fact that Bayern only currently have approval for €150m is a bit of a shock</span>.” Mr Quest QC suggested that this showed that Bayern’s actual level of commitment must have been present to Mr Maud’s mind and, therefore, it cannot have been a mistake when he told the LIA what he did. Again, although a further illustration of Mr Maud’s willingness to exaggerate in order to achieve a deal, this does not lead me to conclude that Mr Maud was willing, when giving evidence before the Court, to give evidence which he knew to be misleading. Indeed, it should be noted in this respect that, when it was also pointed out in cross-examination that Mr Maud made certain representations in an email to Santander on 23 June 2008 about the LIA’s position in terms of financing that the LIA did not wish him to make, Mr Maud accepted that this was a mistake and apologised to the LIA about this in a later email.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Overall, therefore, although there were inconsistencies in Mr Maud’s evidence, in particular where he tried to put a better light on events or to put Marme’s case at its strongest, it would be a mistake to conclude that he gave evidence to the Court which was knowingly misleading. The inconsistencies have caused me to be cautious not to accept everything which Mr Maud had to say in evidence at face value but that is a different matter. </p>

Mr Samhan gave evidence as to Caixa’s involvement in the Transaction, its communications with other parties and Marme’s alleged counterfactuals. Mr Samhan gave evidence that he only had passing contact with the Transaction, as his colleague, Ms Isabel Abad, was the main person in the Caixa swaps team working on the contact but was due to go on holiday in September 2008, with the result that Mr Samhan was brought into the Transaction at the end of August 2008. Mr Saini QC suggested that Mr Samhan’s oral evidence demonstrated that he had a poor understanding of what had happened surrounding the execution of the Transaction. Although Mr Samhan did his best to assist the Court, Mr Saini QC’s criticism was not misplaced. Mr Samhan’s evidence was not always easy to understand. </p>

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses’ motives, and to the overall probabilities, can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth.

In closing, Mr Saini QC submitted that whether the EURIBOR Representations were made depended upon whether “<span style="font-style:italic">a reasonable Swap counterparty in 2008 would have assumed that the position was as set out in the EURIBOR Representations, and that they would be told if it were not so</span>”. Mr Quest QC submitted, however, that this is to conflate the test for implied representations, which requires clear words or conduct, and the test for implied terms, for which an assumption may be sufficient. I consider that Mr Quest QC must be right about this. I bear in mind in this regard that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span> emphasised that clear words or clear conduct are required for the implication of a representation, reflecting the principle that there is no general duty to disclose. Furthermore, as Christopher Clarke J put it in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Raiffeisen</span> at [84], “<span style="font-style:italic">Silence by itself cannot found a claim in misrepresentation</span>”. Indeed, I did not understand Mr Saini QC, on analysis, to be contending that silence would suffice for the implication of the EURIBOR Representations since his submission was, rather, that a reasonable swap counterparty would have naturally assumed from RBS’s <span style="font-style:italic">conduct</span> that the EURIBOR Representations were being made. In these circumstances, the difference between the parties is probably better seen as not being one of principle but as to the application of the applicable principle, Mr Saini QC having clearly (and correctly) accepted in opening that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>emphasised that clear words or conduct are required for the implication of a representation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">means. This differs from the case of an express representation, where the first question is whether the words were written or spoken as a question of fact and the second question is what they mean. Mr Quest QC submitted that the Court will not (or is very unlikely to) imply a representation from conduct in terms which are vague, uncertain, imprecise or elastic. Again, in my view, Mr Quest QC was right about this. Mr Quest QC relied, for these purposes, first, on <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Raiffeisen</span>, in which Christopher Clarke J rejected the implication of one of the alleged representations, namely “<span style="font-style:italic">that RBS’s equity in RBSFT was ‘at risk’, in that there was no support for the returns thereon and the repayment of the capital other than as identified in the transactional materials</span>”.

If, as RZB contends, it means that there was no support of any kind it is extremely wide. The representation would be falsified if RBS had any arrangement with anyone which would or might provide it with any compensation if the value of the shares fell or was not realised or any particular rate of return was not achieved. If the scope of the implied representation is to be narrowed the ambit of the reduction is not clear. ‘No support’ could signify no contractual undertaking or something different. If it means the former, which would be consistent with the sense in which RBS used the expression ‘support’ in relation to the Sutton Bridge transaction …, there would have been no misrepresentation. This elasticity of possible meaning is a factor against regarding the representation that there was ‘no support’ as necessarily implied</span>.” </p>

I should deal, first, however with a point made by Mr Quest QC which is that Marme has changed its case as to what implied representations it alleges on three occasions, yet without changing the conduct upon which it relies for the implication of the representations. There is a strong suspicion, in these circumstances, that the EURIBOR Representations are the result of a reverseengineering exercise inspired by the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span> rather than the facts of the present case. In this respect, the position is similar to the position at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG </span>itself ([2016] EWHC 3342 (Ch)) in which Asplin J noted at [419] that “<span style="font-style:italic">It was accepted the form of the implied representations had been ‘borrowed’ from the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Graiseley </span><span style="font-style:italic">case and it seems to me that the pleading was not led by the evidence</span>” before going on to conclude that PAG had given no thought to the representations in the form pleaded and had not relied upon them.

At the time of issue of the Claim Form in September 2014, Marme pleaded four implied representations. The Particulars of Claim (in May 2015) contained 11 implied representations. In August 2017 (after the first instance decision of Asplin J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span>), four further implied representations were pleaded.

As such, it will almost always, for practical purposes, be the lawyer’s task to put the conduct relied upon into words. That will involve the lawyer analysing the evidence and taking into account decided cases. The key question in every case will be whether the evidence justifies the conclusion that the implied representation was made. If that is the position, then, the fact that a lawyer has helped construct the implied representation case is unobjectionable. It is only if the evidence does not support the implied representation case that there is a difficulty. </p>

The agreements required the claimant to enter into four interest rate swap agreements with RBS which were referenced to three-month sterling LIBOR. Following the global financial crisis, LIBOR fell significantly with the result that the claimants were liable to pay rates of interest under the swaps that far exceeded what they received. The claimants subsequently terminated the swaps, incurring break costs of over £8 million and entered into a new facility agreement. The Financial Services Authority (the ‘FSA’) subsequently found that RBS had manipulated Japanese yen and Swiss franc LIBOR between 2006 and 2012.

The third and fourth representations are also unnecessarily complex and during the argument, the court endeavoured to reduce their complexity to something simpler. The most feasible formulation seems to us to be that RBS was representing that, at the date of the swaps, RBS was not itself seeking to manipulate LIBOR and did not intend to do so in the future. With some justification Mr Handyside complained that no such representation had been pleaded in terms.

Outside the insurance context, there is no obligation in general to bring difficulties and defects to the attention of a contract partner or prospective contract partner. Caveat emptor reflects a basic facet of English commercial law (the growth of consumer law has been moving in a different direction). Nor is there any general notion, as there is in the civil law, of a duty of good faith in commercial affairs, however much individual concepts of English common law, such as that of the reasonable man, and of waiver and estoppel itself, may be said to reflect such a notion. In such circumstances, silence is golden, for where there is no obligation to speak, silence gives no hostages to fortune. If, however, the contractor speaks, then he may have to live up to what he says; so also where what is unsaid is sufficiently closely connected with what he has said to render what has been left unsaid misleading. In general, however, there is no duty of disclosure. … For the same reason it is not possible to set up an estoppel on the basis of an omission to disclose unless a duty to disclose can be established in the particular circumstances of the case. Tacit acquiescence in another’s self-deception does not itself amount to misrepresentation, provided that it has not previously been caused by a positive misrepresentation.” </span>Rix LJ went on at [93] to add this: </p>

In Republic of India v India Steamship Co Ltd (The Indian Endurance and The Indian Grace) (No 2) [1998] AC 878, 914 Lord Steyn approved Lord Wilberforce’s observation as “helpful as indicating the general principle underlying estoppel by acquiescence”.

I am not persuaded, however, that <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ING</span> provides any assistance in the present context, given that Rix LJ was alone in referring to implied representation (as opposed to estoppel by convention) and in making the observations which he did. Indeed, it should be noted that in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span>, at [407], despite recording her acceptance that a term would be implied into the swaps that the parties would conduct themselves honestly when performing the swap contracts, Asplin J, nonetheless, did not accept that this meant that the implied representations contended for in that case should be implied – and nor did the Court of Appeal apparently think differently. It needs to be remembered that the case which Marme advances is not a non-disclosure case but is an implied representation case. This is for good reason: the circumstances in which a ‘duty to speak’ arises under English law are limited, and this is not such a case. </p>

Of the examples given by Mr Quest QC, there is, in particular, a lack of certainty in EURIBOR Representations 3 and 4, with their references to undermining integrity.

In closing, Mr Saini QC confined matters of conduct undermining the integrity of EURIBOR to conduct likely to lead submitting banks not to submit in accordance with the EURIBOR Code. However, the very fact that such clarification was required on Mr Saini QC’s part, if anything, supports Mr Quest QC’s submission that there is the lack of certainty which he highlighted.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It was Mr Saini QC’s submission that this evidence provides significant support for Marme’s implication case. That cannot, however, be right since, although it may be helpful to consider what may have been naturally assumed at the time (on the basis of the “<span style="font-style:italic">helpful test</span>” set out by Colman J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Geest</span>), it is nonetheless important to heed the warning of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span> that doing this must not be allowed to “<span style="font-style:italic">water down</span>” the requirement for specific conduct if the representations are to be implied.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Furthermore and seventhly, there is a related further difficulty. This is that the EURIBOR Representations are not (or are no longer) concerned with the truth and honesty of EURIBOR but are, instead, concerned with the conduct, intention and knowledge of RBS employees. This is no accident since Marme did previously plead representations about the truth of EURIBOR (for example that <span style="font-style:italic">“EURIBOR was a benchmark rate which had been, was, and would be, a reliable reflection on the cost of interbank lending denominated in Euros”</span>) only to abandon that case in May 2018.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The point goes further, however, and so beyond a matter of mere pleading. This is because, were Marme to try and make good a case that EURIBOR was not a reliable or truthful rate, Marme would have had to have proved that Mr Moryoussef had not merely attempted to influence EURIBOR but that he had succeeded in doing so and, furthermore, that those false submissions had actually affected the EURIBOR rate.  </p>

Mr Saini QC, Mr Tomson and Mr Rose made the same point in their written closing submissions. This, quite understandably given what would have been involved, is not something which Marme sought at trial to do. I agree with Mr Quest QC that, in such circumstances, it follows that, even if it were to be accepted that a reasonable person might have inferred from RBS’s conduct that EURIBOR was a true and honest rate, that does not help Marme. </p>

On the contrary, I am quite clear that it was Marme’s idea that the interest rate under the Swaps and the Senior Loan should be calculated by reference to EURIBOR and that what RBS, in effect, did was to accept a proposal by Marme to join the Syndicate on terms chosen by Marme and which had already been agreed in principle by the other Syndicate members.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Thus, in January 2008, Propinvest and Mr Owen Kelly (on behalf of Mr Quinlan) approached several banks with Marme’s proposals for funding the Transaction via the ‘vanilla’ bank financing route and provided cashflow models which all expressly referred to the use of an interest rate swap. The first reference to a stepped swap appeared in Mr Maud’s email to Lloyds TSB on 15 January 2008 in which he stated that Propinvest “<span style="font-style:italic">would seek to import a stepped swap during the early part of the term</span>”. On 18 March 2008, following initial discussions, Marme circulated a proposal called Indicative Terms and Conditions to Bayern, HSH and RBS. Mr Maud accepted in cross-examination that these had probably been prepared by Propinvest. The covering email circulating the indicative terms and conditions described Marme as intending “<span style="font-style:italic">to hedge interest rates for a minimum term 15 years</span>” whilst the proposed terms themselves provided for interest on the Senior Loan to relate to EURIBOR. On its appointment as MLA on 15 April 2008, Bayern accepted, with some amendments, the terms proposed by Marme and the terms remained substantially unchanged until the date of the Transaction. RBS had originally declined to participate in the Senior Loan. Its involvement was necessary only because Bayern had been unable to raise all of the finance. Mr Maud accepted in cross-examination that, had Bayern been able to raise the finance, Marme would have been content to go ahead with the syndicate that Bayern had put together, and which did not involve RBS, but would have included a 15-year interest rate swap. Other than some relatively minor modifications introduced by RBS (including a reduction in length of the loan and the introduction of an LTV covenant), RBS accepted the terms of Marme’s proposal, which included the Swap linked to EURIBOR, which terms were not changed or discussed. The only points on which there was any real negotiation after RBS joined the Syndicate were as to the credit and execution spreads payable under the Swap and the underwriting fee on the Senior Loan. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It is, furthermore, clear that Marme itself wanted a swap since otherwise it would have had difficulty in funding the interest rate payments under the Senior Loan purely from the rental income in the early years of the lease until the above-inflation rental increases took effect. This is a matter to which I shall return in the context of Marme’s damages case but Mr Maud accepted, indeed, that the financing models provided for interest rate swaps from the very start, albeit that he suggested that this was because Bayern had made the point that the hedge would be a requirement for many banks, as the means by which Marme could guarantee to meet the ICR required under the Senior Loan, which might otherwise exceed the rental income under the lease. He observed that Marme was “<span style="font-style:italic">very much opposed</span>” to having an interest rate swap, as it believed at the time that the pressure on interest rates over the short to medium term was downwards, but that Marme accepted the idea as “<span style="font-style:italic">a necessary evil</span>”. Mr Maud maintained that, during Bayern’s period as sole MLA, he sought to persuade it (and, through it, the other banks in the Syndicate) that an interest rate swap was not necessary and, furthermore, that Bayern reported to him that a number of banks were willing to proceed without an interest rate swap and that Bayern itself had an open mind. By contrast, Mr Maud stated, “<span style="font-style:italic">with RBS there had been no room for any conversation. It required an IRS</span>.” So it was, he insisted, that, in finalising the heads of terms for RBS’s participation in the syndicate, in July 2008, Marme included in the suggested terms an interest rate swap because this was RBS’s requirement. Mr Maud’s evidence, indeed, was that Mr Bates told him that some of the other syndicate banks were also at that stage insistent on having an interest rate swap, with the result that he had “<span style="font-style:italic">little choice but to accept the position as stated by RBS</span>”. The result was that RBS and the Non-RBS Banks required the Swaps whilst the other three syndicate banks proceeded without swaps, a fact which Mr Maud suggested “<span style="font-style:italic">demonstrates that Marme only agreed to an IRS where it was imposed on us as a requirement by a participating bank</span>.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In cross-examination, Mr Maud maintained that the RBS Swap was a nonnegotiable condition of RBS’s participation and that, even if a swap was contained in Marme’s own proposal document, this was because negotiations had demonstrated that this would be the only acceptable term to the banks. Mr Maud also suggested, in cross-examination, that Mr Goodwin had suggested the use of a stepped swap to Mr Littlewood in an email on 19 December 2007 and that Propinvest had never previously undertaken a stepped swap. This was a reference to an email from Mr McDonald of RBS to Mr Frohnsdorff (of Propinvest). Mr Maud highlighted, in particular, how that email entailed Mr McDonald saying “<span style="font-style:italic">Although you have commenced discussions with my colleagues Mark and Sean regarding a potential structured swap solution </span>…”. Mr Maud suggested that this referred to Mr Goodwin’s suggestion of a stepped swap. It is clear, however, that this was a suggestion which was prompted not by any genuine recollection on Mr Maud’s part. Mr Goodwin, for his part, gave evidence that the stepped swap was Mr Littlewood’s idea, and it is the case that Mr Littlewood was experienced in derivatives and financial structuring. I cannot, in the circumstances, accept what Mr Maud had to say on this issue.

Again, this is a matter to which I shall return when dealing with damages, but essentially Marme wanted a swap to have interest rate protection and enable it to meet the Senior Loan repayments, and the Banks wanted a swap also for interest rate protection and to make money. Mr Saini QC submitted, in the circumstances and somewhat modifying his primary submission, that this is sufficient for Marme’s purposes since it does not matter who proposed the Swaps since all that matters is that whoever put forward the idea of using swaps did so on the basis (which was not corrected by RBS) that EURIBOR is an honest rate. As Mr Saini QC put it, it cannot “<span style="font-style:italic">make any difference that the customer has knocked on RBS’s door, it doesn’t give RBS a free pass from the law of misrepresentation</span>”. He gave the example of going into a bank and asking to have a mortgage at that bank’s fixed variable rate. As far as the customer is concerned, he must take it that the fixed variable rate is an honest rate and it cannot make a difference as to who initiates the transaction: both parties must be proceeding on the understanding that the rate is honest.  </p>

Put differently, whilst it may be that some representations are legitimately to be implied, it is less obvious that intricate and broad representations such as the EURIBOR Representations should be implied from passive (and necessarily somewhat limited) conduct. In the present case, there is no basis on which it can sensibly be concluded that the EURIBOR Representations were implied.

Although I do not consider that any of the EURIBOR Representations as pleaded can be implied in this case, nonetheless I do consider that RBS’s conduct in going along with the Swaps was sufficient for the implication of a much narrower representation, namely that RBS was not itself manipulating, and did not intend to manipulate or attempt to manipulate, EURIBOR. That is not, however, an implied representation for which Marme contends – in all probability because Marme recognises that it is in no position to establish falsity. </p>

This is because Mr Saini QC complained that the communications which were available to Marme at trial did not represent the totality of the communications which related to Mr Moryoussef’s time at RBS and, specifically, as it was put in Marme’s written opening, that RBS had been <span style="font-style:italic">“astute to manage its exposure – both financial and reputational – to the Euribor scandal as far as possible”</span>.  </p>

However, I cannot agree given the very substantial amount of disclosure which has been provided by RBS. I was told, indeed, that the disclosure exercise in this case entailed over a million documents being collected on the part of RBS, nearly 625,000 being reviewed following the application of search terms and the production of nearly 225,000 documents amounting, in all, to approximately 1.4 million pages. In particular, RBS made available to Marme all relevant Bloomberg instant messages and emails to or from Mr Moryoussef. Furthermore, Mr Quest QC pointed out that various disclosure applications were made by Marme in the context of these proceedings, including an application which resulted in the making of a Consent Order on 4 October 2017, in which Blair J ordered that RBS should provide the following further disclosure: </p>

Mr Saini QC speculated in this connection that the reason why most communications ceased after June 2008 was because, by that time, LIBOR was under scrutiny and that this would have caused Mr Moryoussef to be more secretive from this point, stopping using ‘chats’, professional emails and bank telephone lines.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">This is, however, as I say, merely speculation. There is nothing which establishes the position one way or the other. Mr Saini QC might be right but, equally, he might be wrong. It should be borne in mind, however, that, as Mr Quest QC pointed out, SJ Berwin LLP (acting on RBS’s behalf in the context of the regulatory investigation) reviewed 452 of Mr Moryoussef’s telephone calls. It follows that a very substantial number of telephone calls have been considered. In addition, on 24 April 2018 Males J approved a Consent Order requiring RBS to disclose a log identifying the date and duration of calls between Mr Moryoussef and either Mr Bittar or Mr Esper during the period of his employment at RBS. Mr Quest QC pointed out that further disclosure of telephone records was sought at the PTR, and it was agreed and ordered that RBS would conduct a further search for call records between Mr Moryoussef and Mr Bittar and Mr Moryoussef and Mr Esper - as recorded in an order which I made on 18 May 2018. The searches included searches in relation to documents for senior executive custodians other than Mr Moryoussef. Mr Quest QC explained that another 31 telephone transcripts were produced as a result of this yet none was regarded as significant (or relevant) enough to merit inclusion in the trial bundle which Marme put before the Court containing the direct evidence upon which it sought to rely. Mr Quest QC submitted, justifiably in my view, that, as a result, there is no reason to suppose that there is any relevant contemporaneous material either in the form of emails, ‘chat’ records or telephone records, relating to the period when Mr Moryoussef was employed by RBS, which has not been made available to Marme by way of disclosure.  </p>

This is evidenced by conversations between Mr Moryoussef and others, including traders at a number of banks and Barclays rate setters (Ms Bohart and Mr Bermingham) in which they discuss influencing the rates to be submitted by Barclays. It is hardly surprising, in the circumstances, even leaving out of account the fact of Mr Moryoussef’s conviction, that RBS has accepted that such communications establish that Mr Moryoussef was engaged in the conduct alleged and, in particular, the conduct which is the subject of EURIBOR Representations 2 and 4. It is convenient to refer to some examples of the relevant exchanges and to do so by referring to the examples which Mr Saini QC highlighted when opening Marme’s case at trial since they are somewhat striking.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">These communications are deeply incriminating. They show Mr Moryoussef participating in a conspiracy with other traders to influence the setting of EURIBOR whilst he was employed at Barclays. They show Mr Moryoussef boasting about the profits to be made, strongly suggesting that he was willing to attempt to manipulate the rates on future IMM dates. It is obvious, in the circumstances, that, if EURIBOR Representations 2 and 4 were made, then, Mr Moryoussef’s conduct at Barclays means that those implied representations were each false since Mr Moryoussef (an RBS employee at the time that the Transaction was entered into) not merely <span style="font-style:italic">“had reason to believe”</span> that <span style="font-style:italic">“other banks”</span> had in the preceding 2-year period <span style="font-style:italic">“engaged in conduct intended to lead to a higher or lower Euribor rate”</span>. Mr Quest QC acknowledged this, albeit observing that this has the “<span style="font-style:italic">surprising consequence</span>”, as he put it, that, when RBS employed Mr Moryoussef, RBS became “<span style="font-style:italic">infected</span>” by the knowledge which Mr Moryoussef had acquired whilst previously employed at Barclays. That, Mr Quest QC pointed out, would be the case even if Mr Moryoussef had behaved wholly properly, as </p>

If that is the correct conclusion, then, the Barclays communications (whether viewed independently or alongside the other direct evidence, including the more limited RBS communications which I shall come on to consider) support not only Marme’s case on falsity as regards EURIBOR Representations 2 and 4 but also its falsity case in relation to EURIBOR Representations 1, 3 and 5.  </p>

Equally, however, I do not accept that Mr Quest QC can be right when he submitted, in effect, that the Barclays communications can be left out of account when deciding whether EURIBOR Representations 1, 3 and 5 are false or not. It seems to me, on analysis, that it is a matter of degree. The Barclays communications ought not to be treated as though they make it inevitable, or even particularly likely, that Mr Moryoussef continued at RBS as he had at Barclays. It is appropriate, nonetheless, that they be taken into account when the RBS communications are looked at and an assessment is made as to the falsity of EURIBOR Representations 1, 3 and 5, the representations which are concerned with the conduct of RBS employees (specifically and, in fact if not in theory, exclusively, Mr Moryoussef).  </p>

First, as I have explained, I am satisfied that there have in this case been no disclosure shortcomings as regards the disclosure which RBS has provided. On the contrary, it is clear that the disclosure has been very considerable and wide-ranging. As a result, it is right to conclude that, had Mr Moryoussef continued to behave as he had done at Barclays when he joined RBS, this would be apparent from the documents which have been disclosed. Instead, although there are a few RBS communications which hint at Mr Moryoussef’s conduct continuing at RBS, the nature and scale of such continued conduct is of a wholly different order to that revealed from his time when working for Barclays.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Secondly, there is a material difference between Mr Moryoussef’s situations at Barclays and RBS in that, whereas Barclays was a panel bank where Mr Moryoussef knew the setters (Ms Bohart and Mr Bermingham) well and would have been in frequent (if not constant) conversation with them, RBS was not a panel bank. From August 2007 to October 2007, no bank within the RBS group was a panel bank. Even after October 2007, when part of the RBS group acquired ABN AMRO, the submissions were made out of the Netherlands and there is no evidence that Mr Moryoussef was ever in contact with anybody involved there in the setting process.  </p>

He submitted, quite simply, that, Mr Moryoussef was no longer in a position to continue his earlier misconduct given that, as I have just mentioned, by the time that Mr Moryoussef changed employment RBS was (unlike Barclays) not a panel bank, and so the opportunity which previously existed no longer did.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The RBS communications relied upon by Mr Saini QC fall into various categories. First, they relate to the time from when Mr Moryoussef joined RBS in August 2007 until the first quarter of 2008, during which, Mr Saini QC submitted, Mr Moryoussef can be seen to have been continuing to conduct himself as he had done at Barclays. Secondly, there are communications which Mr Saini QC suggested evidence the improper sharing of information and data which might distort the EIRD market and impact on the EURIBOR rates. These are contained within Schedule 1B of Marme’s Re-Re-ReAmended Particulars of Claim. Thirdly, there are communications from April 2008 to June 2008 which Mr Saini QC submitted show Mr Moryoussef and traders at other banks attempting to manipulate EURIBOR by a different method, namely enlisting their treasuries to work in concert to take positions in the market that would move the EURIBOR rate. Marme refers to this as the “<span style="font-style:italic">arbitrage conspiracy</span>”. Lastly, there are certain post-Transaction communications and, in particular, a document post-dating the Transaction which is also listed in Schedule 1A of the Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim as a document evidencing the attempted manipulation of EURIBOR. </p>

It is pretty obvious that this was Mr Moryoussef telling his contact at Barclays that, as he had a short position, he should ask Ms Bohart to put the rate up. Both this email and, indeed, the conversation which took place the day before were before the setting of EURIBOR for the day, something which would have been done at 11 am, making it all the more likely that what Mr Moryoussef was doing was suggesting that Mr Modhvadia seek a higher rate to benefit his (Mr Modhvadia’s) position. </p>

Mr Moryoussef went on to say “<span style="font-style:italic">I count on who u know to maintain it high</span>” albeit that, in my view, Mr Quest QC may well have been right when he submitted that Mr Moryoussef was in that context talking about EONIA or the dollar rate rather than EURIBOR since Mr Moryoussef’s remark followed references to these. It does not matter, however, since Mr Quest QC accepted in relation to the earlier exchanges that Mr Moryoussef was self-evidently communicating with these traders regarding favourable settings for their trading positions, and that the Barclays traders agreed to Mr Moryoussef’s request and also shared their intended submissions in other ‘tenors’. The reference to a “<span style="font-style:italic">push</span>” seems, in particular, to be a suggestion by Mr Moryoussef that Mr Modhvadia and Mr Palombo should ask the Barclays rate setters to submit high, and so involves Mr Moryoussef seeking to manipulate EURIBOR.

In any event, in the light of the view which I have formed in relation to the other exchanges (indeed, Mr Quest QC’s acceptance that those exchanges entailed Mr Moryoussef engaged in conduct <span style="font-style:italic">“intended to lead to a higher or lower Euribor rate”</span>), it does not, perhaps, matter whether the exchanges on 28 February 2008 also evidence such conduct on Mr Moryoussef’s part. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I should add that Mr Quest QC was at pains to point out that the various exchanges are unlikely to have resulted in EURIBOR rates being affected. Specifically, Mr Quest QC took the Court to certain records showing the EURIBOR submissions which were made on the dates of the various communications relied upon by Marme which had been compiled by RBS’s expert, Mr Kasapis. These showed that Barclays made a submission of 4.77 on 27 September 2007, that Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale were towards the bottom of the panel banks on 28 September 2007 (at 4.78, 4.80 and 4.72 respectively), well below the alleged “<span style="font-style:italic">target</span>” of 4.82 and that, despite the communication on 4 October 2007, the Barclays submission on that day was 4.79 and, as such, in the middle of the range. Mr Quest QC submitted, furthermore, that it would be very hard for any individual bank, or even for three or four banks, to change the rate significantly in circumstances where it was common ground as between the parties that the highest six and lowest six submissions are discounted when setting the EURIBOR rate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Quest QC was probably right in what he had to say about this since, although Mr Saini QC sought to demonstrate in closing, based on what Marme’s expert, Mr Zjalic, had to say in his report (neither expert having been required to give evidence at trial), that a false submission even by a single bank is, in principle, capable of making a 1 bp difference to the EURIBOR rate, it is not easy to see how, in practice, that can be right. However, even assuming in RBS’s favour on that point, this does not detract from the fact that, as shown by the communications to which I have referred, Mr Moryoussef and the other traders with whom he was in contact were seeking to manipulate EURIBOR by affecting their own (or each other’s) EURIBOR submissions. Assuming that EURIBOR Representations 1, 3 and 5 were made, it must follow that there was, in these circumstances, the falsity which Marme has alleged. It cannot matter whether there was success in the sense that EURIBOR rates were actually affected since that is not what the EURIBOR Representations (specifically EURIBOR Representations 1 and 2) have as their focus, as demonstrated by the <span style="font-style:italic">“even if that submission did not lead to a material increase or decrease in the Euribor rate”</span> wording in their ‘unwrapped’ form.      </p>

These are communications which evidence anti-competitive practices of sharing of price-sensitive information. Mr Quest QC accepted as much. They are, therefore, incriminatory in that sense. However, they do not amount to evidence that the EURIBOR Representations are false, and Mr Saini QC did not seek to demonstrate that they did since, unsurprisingly given that he did not refer to them, he did not explain the connection between the sharing of information and any attempted manipulation of EURIBOR.  </p>

It was Mr Saini QC’s submission that the seventeen documents in this category (although not all of the documents were addressed in Marme’s submissions) evidence a plan by Mr Bittar, Mr Esper, Mr Moryoussef and Mr Modhvadia to benefit their trading positions by simultaneously asking their treasuries to take positions in the market that would allow the traders to make greater profits by moving EURIBOR rates so as to reverse a “<span style="font-style:italic">market dislocation</span>” between 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR. Mr Saini QC submitted that, as such, the documents show that, well into his time working at RBS, Mr Moryoussef was still actively engaged in plans with the same individuals with whom he had conspired whilst at Barclays to try to manipulate EURIBOR rates. Mr Saini QC submitted that, accordingly, the <span style="font-style:italic">“arbitrage conspiracy”</span> documents demonstrate that <span style="font-style:italic">“the leopard”</span> (Mr Moryoussef) had not changed his spots and that the Court should conclude that he <span style="font-style:italic">“had (at most) changed his fraudulent strategy opportunistically to take advantage of an evolving financial environment with another method of manipulation”</span>.  </p>

Mr Moryoussef responded “<span style="font-style:italic">yes pls</span>”. Mr Saini QC submitted that this exchange shows Mr Moryoussef’s knowledge, whilst at RBS, that 6- to 12-month EURIBOR was subject to actual or attempted manipulation. Mr Quest QC submitted that the exchange does no such thing and that all that it constitutes is Mr Modhvadia and Mr Moryoussef complaining about Barclays’ cash desk not borrowing 6-month cash.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">These exchanges are quite clear in demonstrating that there were discussions concerning the exploitation of what was regarded, putting the matter neutrally, as an arbitrage opportunity. Mr Quest QC himself acknowledged that this must be the case. He recognised that the possibility was being discussed of enabling or incentivising cash desks to borrow 6-month money at a below-market rate which it was thought could then lead to higher 6-month rates and higher 6month EURIBOR fixings. The strategy was that the cash desks would borrow more 6-month money in the market and use internal swaps to reduce the cash desks’ costs of such borrowing. Plainly, again as acknowledged by Mr Quest QC, the intention was to benefit the cash desks and, for that matter, the EURIBOR traders. The question, however, is whether there was anything wrong about this – whether it was, as Mr Saini QC characterised it, an <span style="font-style:italic">“arbitrage conspiracy”</span> or whether, as Mr Quest QC put it, the communications amount to no more than legitimate discussions as to what might be done. This is not a question which was properly addressed at trial. As Mr Quest QC rightly observed in closing, if Marme’s case is that the discussions represented some sort of unlawful conspiracy, it was incumbent upon Marme to make good that case. It is not sufficient for Mr Saini QC merely to assert that that is the position and, in doing so, to refer to the fact that Mr Kasapis, RBS’s expert, used the term <span style="font-style:italic">“cartel banks”</span> in his report. Neither Mr Kasapis nor Mr Zjalic, Marme’s expert, were called to give evidence. Moreover, the evidence which these experts in the field of derivatives and money market trading gave in their reports was in relation to the issue of the technical meaning of certain derivatives trading jargon. They did not give evidence as to the legitimacy of the arbitrage discussions (nor as to the viability of what was discussed) and, in those circumstances, it is not appropriate to base any falsity finding on the so-called <span style="font-style:italic">“arbitrage conspiracy”</span> since to do so would entail an acceptance of Marme’s case without adequate evidence being before the Court.  </p>

Why did you put it low, seriously</span>? <span style="font-style:italic">The biggest [?] of my life is there nobody who will clean my stub? I would prefer to get out</span>”. Mr Bittar replied by saying “<span style="font-style:italic">nobody will do anything mate</span>”. Mr Saini QC submitted that this is evidence of Mr Moryoussef and Mr Bittar sharing knowledge of rates being artificially low, with Mr Bittar explaining, in effect, that Deutsche Bank had put the lowest EURIBOR panel submission in <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> Mr Bittar was “<span style="font-style:italic">very long in the stub</span>”. He also submitted that the mere fact that Mr Moryoussef asked Mr Bittar suggested that he was aware that Mr Bittar would know of the reasons for the Deutsche Bank submission and that he had special contact with the submitters. In truth, however, what the exchange was about is unclear. Mr Saini QC may be right to suggest that it shows Mr Moryoussef continuing to be involved in attempted manipulation by others. However, given that it postdates the Transaction, the communication does not fall within the period of time material to the EURIBOR Representations and is, instead, relevant only to Marme’s breach of contract case. For that reason, it has no bearing on the falsity issue. In the circumstances, I say no more about it not least because of the conclusions which I have reached as to falsity based on other material.  </p>

Mr Quest QC cited in support of this submission <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Avon Insurance v Swire Fraser Ltd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2000] Lloyd’s Rep IR 535, in which Rix J (as he then was), when considering the application of section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 in the insurance context (together with section 20 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906), observed at [17] that “<span style="font-style:italic">a representation may be true without being entirely correct, provided it is substantially correct and the difference between what is represented and what is actually correct would not have been likely to induce a reasonable person in the position of the claimants to enter into the contracts</span>.” Mr Quest QC submitted that the early RBS communications represented no more than a<span style="font-style:italic"> “few improper comments … nearly a year before the Marme transaction completed” </span>and that, in the circumstances, <span style="font-style:italic">“no reasonable person in Marme’s position would have regarded that as material”</span>. The difficulty with this, however, is twofold. First, since falsity is being considered on the assumption that the EURIBOR Representations were made, it follows that the “<span style="font-style:italic">time material to the Transaction</span>” as defined by Marme, which encompassed the two years prior to the execution of the Transaction, is a period which needs to be taken into account in assessing if there are communications evidencing falsity. Secondly, I fail to see how the fact that there were only a limited number of communications evidencing what Mr Moryoussef was doing can justify a conclusion that the EURIBOR Representations were “<span style="font-style:italic">substantially</span>” correct and so that any falsity is immaterial. Either Mr Moryoussef was doing what he was by way of manipulation or attempted manipulation, in which case there is falsity, or he was not and there is not such falsity.  </p>

After he joined RBS, Mr Moryoussef was not in a position similar to the RBS trader in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PAG</span>, Mr Thomasson. RBS itself was no longer a panel bank and, accordingly, Mr Moryoussef was in no position to manipulate EURIBOR rates.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Saini QC’s position was that the point made by Mr Quest QC does not matter since, under section 11(2)(b), the indictment is admissible “<span style="font-style:italic">for the purpose of identifying the facts on which the conviction was based</span>”, and it is sufficient that Mr Moryoussef was alleged in the indictment to have been engaged in the conspiracy in the period identified, including the time after he had joined RBS and covering the entirety of his period of employment with RBS from August 2007 until September 2009. I consider that Mr Saini QC was wrong about this, however, for the reason which I have previously given, namely that, whatever the indictment might say concerning the time period which it covered, the indictment was explicit in its identification of Mr Moryoussef as an “<span style="font-style:italic">employee of Barclays Bank</span>”. Put shortly, insofar as the indictment related to Mr Moryoussef (and it should obviously be borne in mind that the indictment did not deal exclusively with him), in my view, it was concerned only with the period when he was at Barclays since, were the position otherwise, then, the reference to Mr Moryoussef being a Barclays employee would make little sense since, if the position were otherwise, it would be expected that Mr Moryoussef would have been identified not only as an employee of Barclays but also an employee of RBS. The explanation for the time period described in the indictment extending beyond Mr Moryoussef’s time at Barclays is the fact that the indictment was concerned not only with him but also with others.  </p>

Accepting that the certificate of conviction alone could not establish that it was the plaintiff’s money that had been in issue under section 11(2)(b), the plaintiff sought to rely upon parts of the judge’s summing-up at the criminal trials in order to identify the facts on which C’s conviction was based. Rimer J (as he then was) took into account that the summing up is not a judgment and also took into account the defendant’s submission that “<span style="font-style:italic">the judge’s usually somewhat selective reference to the evidence in his summing up can at most amount to a materially abbreviated, second-hand, summary of the evidence and that it can be of no relevance to consider such summary in the context of an inquiry at a subsequent civil trial as the facts on which a conviction was based</span>”.

The purpose of a summing up is not to repeat the evidence, which the jury has already heard direct from the witnesses. It is to sum up the respective cases of the prosecution and the defence so that the jury will understand as best they can the factual issues they have to decide in order to arrive at their verdict. The summing up will include directions to the jury as to the relevant law. It will ordinarily include references to, or summaries of, parts of the evidence which has been given. It will or may include statements of what the parties have agreed or admitted in the course of the trial. It will or may identify with a clarity which might not otherwise appear from a mere consideration of transcripts of the evidence what the defences are: for example, they may depend on matters to be inferred from the evidence, or on whether the defendant had the knowledge required for a conviction. It will or may include specific directions to the jury as to the particular facts on which they have to be certain before they can arrive at a verdict of guilty. These factors suggest to me that a consideration of the transcript of a judge's summing up at the end of a criminal trial is likely to be of relevance in identifying the factual basis on which a defendant was convicted of the offence with which he was charged.</span>”</p>

Mr Saini QC, furthermore, (again, perhaps, not altogether permissibly) highlighted an extract from the cross-examination of Mr Bermingham in relation to one of his communications with Mr Moryoussef on 29 May 2008, and so after Mr Moryoussef had moved to RBS. Mr Saini QC submitted that this demonstrates that the criminal trial was not restricted to Mr Moryoussef’s activities whilst he was at Barclays. In truth, however, these were isolated references which, as such, provide only scant support for the proposition that the criminal case against Mr Moryoussef included his time when employed by RBS. </p>

Mr Quest QC made the legitimate point, however, that what HHJ Gledhill QC had to say here could not be quite right since there is no evidence that Mr Bittar made a request as described to Mr Moryoussef once he had moved to RBS; indeed, it would have been surprising had he done so since RBS was not a panel bank. The likely explanation for this is that the judge was using somewhat loose language, which is, of course, quite understandable in the circumstances. It is clear, when analysing what HHJ Gledhill QC had to say in his sentencing remarks more generally, that his real focus, at least as far as Mr Moryoussef was concerned, was on his time at Barclays. Thus, his sentencing remarks began by referring to the fact that:  </p>

The only reference made by the judge to RBS when sentencing Mr Moryoussef was when he explained that when Barclays refused to pay him a percentage of the profits he made for the bank, “<span style="font-style:italic">he resigned and went to work for the Royal Bank of Scotland</span>”. Moreover, as Mr Quest QC pointed out, the sentencing remarks followed submissions from the prosecution which described Mr Moryoussef’s activity as covering “<span style="font-style:italic">principally – well, it relates to his time at Barclays, which is May 2005August 2007</span>”, Mr Waddington also submitting in relation to Mr Bittar that “<span style="font-style:italic">The relevant period is March 2005 to the beginning of 2009, in Mr Bittar’s case, however the bulk of the activity on which the Crown rely, took place between March 2005-August 2007</span>”.  </p>

As such, it was Mr Quest QC’s submission (and RBS’s case) that the EU Commission Decision establishes only that RBS engaged in anti-competitive conduct in the relevant period, and not that RBS was involved in EURIBOR manipulation in the sense alleged by Marme. Mr Quest QC highlighted, in particular, how the EU Commission Decision at no point refers to “<span style="font-style:italic">the manipulation and/or attempted manipulation of Euribor</span>” despite the fact that Marme relied upon the EU Commission Decision as evidence of that conduct. He submitted that nothing in the EU Commission Decision relates to this, and that this is demonstrated by looking at the legal basis of the EU Commission Decision which shows that the subject-matter of the proceedings was not EURIBOR manipulation in the sense of subversion of the rate-setting process but, instead, anticompetitive practices. That this is the case is shown by the fact that the proceedings were brought under Article 101 TFEU (and Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement which is modelled on Article 101(1) TFEU), which prohibits practices which may affect trade and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market (and, in particular, those which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices). Mr Quest QC relied also upon the press release which was issued on 4 December 2013, specifically the fact that it was headed “<span style="font-style:italic">Commission fines banks €1.49 billion for participating in cartels in the interest rate derivatives industry</span>” and the fact that it recorded the EU Commission’s Vice President as saying this:  </p>

I accept that the conduct described in Recital (32)(a) comes close to Marme’s case of attempted manipulation, but the fact is that it does not go that far since its focus is merely on the sharing of information. In short, it is not possible (as shown by Recital (34)) to read the EU Commission Decision as showing RBS accepting that it engaged in attempted manipulation, as opposed to improper sharing of information. Nor is it appropriate to approach the EU Commission Decision as necessarily showing that RBS accepted that it behaved dishonestly in what it did.  </p>

RBS became a Contributor Panel Bank for EURIBOR in October 2007 by virtue of its acquisition of ABN AMRO Bank.

When seeking to identify the person who is to count as the company for the purposes of a substantive rule of law it is necessary to consider the nature and policy of that rule. The essence of fraudulent misrepresentation, so far as is relevant for this case, is making a statement that is known to be untrue intending that the person to whom it is made will rely on it. Liability therefore depends on the conjunction of a false statement and a dishonest state of mind. In a case where it is said that a company has made a fraudulent misrepresentation the first step must be to see whether a false statement has been made by someone who is authorised to speak on the company’s behalf. Once that has been established the starting point in deciding whether the company acted dishonestly must be to enquire into the state of mind of the person who made the statement. However, if that person was unaware that the statement was false, it may be necessary to enquire into the state of mind of other persons who directed him to make it or who allowed it to be made.</span>” </p>

Is the principal to be liable to a third party where (for instance) the agent made a representation innocently, believing it to be true, and the principal knew of the untruth of the statement but did not know that it was being made? In such case no individual is guilty of personal fraud: there is an ‘innocent division of ingredients’. But are the acts and minds of principal and agent to be regarded as so far one that, by taking the agent’s statement and the principal’s knowledge together, the principal can be held liable to the third party in deceit?

If we had concluded that the implied representation was false it would be necessary to decide how the normal rule, that, for a finding of fraud, the representor must have intended to make a representation that he knew to be false (see Akerhielm v De Mare [1959] AC 789, 804, per Lord Jenkins, Gross v Lewis Hillman Ltd [1970] Ch 445, per Cross LJ and the Raiffeisen v RBS case [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 123, paras 338—340, per Christopher Clarke J) can apply to an implied representation when the implication is not present to the representor’s mind. It may be the case that an implied representation of this kind can never (or quite rarely) be fraudulent; on the other hand recent decisions about dishonesty, such as Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd [2006] 1 WLR 1476 and Ivey v Genting Casinos UK Ltd (trading as Crockfords Club) [2017] 3 WLR 1212, may be relevant.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I agree with Mr Saini QC about this. Whilst I acknowledge that, as a general proposition, it is necessary for there to be both knowledge and intention in one person, and that it certainly ought never to be possible to aggregate as between two innocent agents to arrive at a finding that there has been fraud, it nonetheless does seem to me to be appropriate that, if one agent (or employee) knows that a representation is being made, or should be treated as knowing that a representation is being made even if the agent does not actually know this to be the case, and knows that that representation is false but does nothing to make that known, then the principal (or employer) is liable in fraud.

UBS submits that (as I have accepted) nobody in UBS apart from Mr Bracy and Mr Maron knew about the ‘letter for K’ episode; that their knowledge is not to be regarded as the knowledge of UBS; that by the time of the Depfa transaction, Mr Bracy was effectively no longer involved, and played no part in the decision to approach Depfa, in any provision of information to Depfa, or in any discussion or negotiation with Depfa; and that he was therefore not responsible for the making of any representation to Depfa. It is simply a case, according to UBS, of one agent or representative of UBS making a statement believing it to be true, even though another agent or representative not responsible for the representation and not being aware of its being made knows facts making it untrue.” </span></p>

Where a false representation has been made innocently by an agent acting within his authority, the mere fact that the principal knows the facts which render the representation false will not make the latter liable if he has not expressly authorised the representation or deliberately concealed facts from the agent with a view to the claimant being misled. So in Armstrong v Strain [1952] 1 KB 232 estate agents with general authority to make representations about a house on their books innocently told a purchaser that it was sound when, as the owner knew, it was not.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Quest QC submitted that, the more complex or obscure the implied representation, the less appropriate it would be to conclude that the agent/employee who has not made the implied representation but knows of its untruth should be regarded as having intended that the representee should rely on that implied representation. In this case, Mr Quest QC submitted, the EURIBOR Representations fall into this category, and so it would not be right to attribute to Mr Moryoussef the requisite intention. The difficulty with this submission, however, is that, as Christopher Clarke J made clear, what the representor is taken as having intended is the <span style="font-style:italic">“objective meaning”</span> of whatever representation has been made. If, therefore, objectively, certain implied representations are to be treated as having been made, then, there is no legitimate scope to argue that the agent/employee who has not made the representation is to be regarded as not having intended those implied representations to have been made. Of course, at this stage of the analysis, I am assuming (contrary to what I have decided) that the EURIBOR Representations were made and that they had the meaning which has been alleged by Marme. Given this, it seems to me that I must assume in Marme’s favour that Mr Moryoussef intended that Marme should rely upon the EURIBOR Representations with that meaning attributed to them. Put differently, although I accept that it may be harder to show that a complex or unusual representation should be implied, since the fraud question is being considered on the assumption that EURIBOR Representations were implied and so on the assumption that a reasonable person in Marme’s position would have understood them to have been made, as long as Mr Moryoussef was aware of the conduct underlying them, the complexity or unusual nature of the representation are irrelevant. It follows that, making the assumptions which I do, Mr Quest QC’s objection falls away.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The real question, in the circumstances, is not as to this but as to whether Mr Moryoussef knew that any representations (as it happens, the EURIBOR Representations) were being made by others at RBS or should be treated as knowing that such representations were being made even if he did not actually know this to be the case. If he did or if he is to be treated as doing so, then, the requirements identified by Jackson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Ludsin </span>at [77(ii)] and [77(iii)] are satisfied; if not, then, the fraud case (inasmuch as it depends on Mr Moryoussef being fraudulent) must fail. As Mr Quest QC put it, if the EURIBOR Representations were false, then, necessarily, Mr Moryoussef knew the facts which made them false, but Marme must still prove that Mr Moryoussef intended Marme to rely on the representations and it is not enough merely to do as was suggested by Mr Saini QC, Mr Tomson and Mr Rose in their written opening submissions which was to infer that this was Mr Moryoussef’s intention because <span style="font-style:italic">“the natural and probable result of Mr Moryoussef and others failing to share their knowledge with the world—and hence what they are taken to have intended—was that parties, such as Marme, would continue to rely on the EURIBOR Representations”</span>. As Mr Quest QC explained, to make such an inference skips a stage in the reasoning in a case such as the present where the person said to have the requisite intention is not the person who made the representation. It is for this reason that the prior question necessarily arises.

I tend to agree with Mr Saini QC about this. I consider that, whether or not Mr Moryoussef was sitting next to Mr Goodwin or other members of the deal team which undertook the Transaction, he should be taken to have known, at a minimum, that there were people within RBS like Mr Goodwin who were entering into swap transactions referenced to EURIBOR. To the extent, therefore, that any representations can be implied from the fact of RBS entering into swaps referenced to EURIBOR, I consider that Mr Moryoussef should be regarded, without more, as having had sufficient awareness and knowledge.  </p>

Mr Saini QC referred in this regard to Mr Goodwin having agreed in cross-examination that it was<span style="font-style:italic"> “very likely”</span> that the Euro swaps trading team positioned directly next to Mr Moryoussef’s team in the RBS structure chart which was produced at trial was the team with which he had liaised before the Transaction was completed. He confirmed, indeed, that a member of that team, most probably Simon Wilson, had been the trader on the execution call with Marme as regards the Transaction. It was Mr Saini QC’s submission that there is no reason to believe that there was any ‘Chinese wall’ between these teams and that, given his other involvement in EURIBOR trading, there is every prospect that Mr Moryoussef would have known about the Transaction itself – the more so, given that it was at that stage the largest real estate transaction in Europe. Although I have taken these further submissions into account, I do not feel able to accept them since they require inferences to be made which, in my view, go somewhat too far. That is the case even though I acknowledge Mr Saini QC’s associated submission that it would have been open to RBS to adduce evidence from Mr Moryoussef’s superiors, Mr Liddy and Mr Nygaard, as to what Mr Moryoussef did or did not know about the Transaction. It is, in any event, unnecessary that I should base my decision on this further point in view of my earlier conclusion as to what Mr Moryoussef should be taken to have known. </p>

In consequence, it is not strictly necessary to go on and consider Marme’s further case that the Court should conclude that there were others at RBS (besides Mr Moryoussef) who were fraudulent. Mr Saini QC’s position was that, whilst it was right to point out, as Mr Quest QC did, that Mr Moryoussef is the only identified person alleged by Marme to have been fraudulent, this was only because Marme was not in a position to name any other individual but that did not mean that it is not open to Marme to put forward a fraud case which extended beyond Mr Moryoussef. Although I am not altogether convinced that it is open to Marme to adopt so unspecific an approach since there is a clear and longstanding requirement to allege fraud in clear and specific terms (a requirement which would typically entail identifying any alleged fraudster), nonetheless, in the particular circumstances of the present case and since, as will appear, my ultimate conclusion is that Marme has not established fraud on the part of any other individual, I propose to address the substance of Marme’s case at trial rather than to treat Marme as somehow precluded from advancing the wider fraud claim.    </p>

This point cannot arise under the present procedure, and it may be that in some respects the old doctrine was rather technical. The substance of it, however, remains and is as forcible now as ever, and it is applicable not merely in prize cases, but to almost all kinds of disputes. If anyone by a deliberate act destroys a document which, according to what its contents may have been, would have told strongly either for him or against him, the strongest possible presumption arises that if it had been produced it would have told against him; and even if the document is destroyed by his own act, but under circumstances in which the intention to destroy evidence may fairly be considered rebutted, still he has to suffer. He is in the position that he is without the corroboration which might have been expected in his case</span>. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">In the present case there are two separate destructions of documents—one the throwing overboard of documents when the vessel was about to be searched, the other the destruction of the accounts relating to the stock and the consumption of signal lights. As to the first, the Attorney-General admits that the destruction of the code book to prevent it getting into enemy hands is at least excusable. It is, indeed, so obvious that that must at any rate be done that complaint could not be made of it. But Captain Pfeiffer naively admitted that, when throwing overboard documents to avoid their getting into enemy hands, he acted on the principle of throwing overboard too many rather than too few, and adds that the Morse signal book contained absolutely innocent messages, which could be read by any one. That probably was so, but it may also have contained some which were not so innocent; and it is pretty obvious that when he threw it overboard he either knew it did or was not sure that it did not.  </span>

As pointed out, a wireless signal log might have been kept in such a way as not to disclose the code or give any key to it. The destruction of the stock book of signal lights cannot be excused by any fear of disclosing a secret code. It is suggested that it was innocent because the guard on the ship was told it was being done, and that British officers had already examined it. British officers would not in the first instance examine minutely documents of that kind, but would assume that if wanted they could be looked over afterwards. Pfeiffer and the paymaster doubtless knew what the signal lights really were for, and hoped that the British, who up to that time had made no point about it, would not find it out, so they destroyed the book. Nothing that can be called a reason was given for doing so. Even if the books had become waste paper, why destroy them?  </span>

Where there is no legal duty to retain documents because the litigation has not commenced and no deliberate intent, the court will need to examine the basis for the drawing of inferences. But there should be circumstances, where the court considers the duty to retain documents, even prior to litigation, was sufficiently obvious that it considers it entitled to draw adverse inferences. Litigation must surely be in reasonable prospect before the principle can apply. An example might be where in pre-action correspondence the lawyers for one party asked the other to retain particular classes of documents, and the documents are subsequently destroyed albeit not deliberately. There seems no reason why the court should not draw adverse inferences where a party has destroyed documents in breach of Practice Direction 31B, treating that as the relevant duty.

I cannot agree with Mr Saini QC about this, however, since the fact of the matter is that the evidence before the Court is that the destruction was inadvertent. That is not challenged by Marme, and nor realistically could it be. As such, whilst there may not be a good reason why the file was destroyed, nor is there a bad reason in the sense that a positive decision was made to destroy when plainly the file should not have been destroyed. In addition, Marme did not challenge the evidence given by Mr Craig Berry (RBS’s Head of Litigation and Investigations) that no disciplinary investigation was carried out into Mr Moryoussef’s activities before he left RBS in September 2009. It is distinctly unlikely, in the circumstances, that the personnel file would have contained material showing that RBS staff had any material awareness as to any misconduct on Mr Moryoussef’s part. It would, for these two reasons, therefore, be inappropriate to draw the adverse inference which Mr Saini QC suggested. </p>

Mr Saini QC submitted that, given RBS’s engagement with the various regulatory authorities to which I have previously referred, it is highly likely that there would be RBS witnesses at a senior or even Board level who would have been able to give evidence as to what was known.

The critical question in the present case was whether manipulation of GBP LIBOR had taken place. The critical witness for that purpose was Mr Thomasson. If he was believed, there was nothing relevant for senior management to know; if he was not, RBS’s case collapsed anyway. The judge did say (para 461) that RBS’s decision not to call Mr Cummins (and a Mr Nielsen) in connection with the allegations of lowballing did not reflect well on RBS and repeated this in her decision on whether RBS had been fraudulent (para 485).

It follows, that an infringement of Article 101(1) of the Treaty may result not only from an isolated act but also from a series of acts or from a continuous conduct. That interpretation cannot be challenged on the ground that one or several elements of that series of acts or continuous conduct could also constitute, in themselves and taken in isolation, an infringement of Article 101(1) of the Treaty. When the different actions form part of an overall plan, because their identical object distorts competition within the internal market, the Commission is entitled to impute responsibility for those actions on the basis of participation in the infringement considered as a whole.” </span></p>

If the claim is for rescission of a contract, the inquiry is as to the causal link between the statement and the claimant’s entry into the contract. The language used in the different remedies, and the legal tests employed for them, will vary, but generally the issue is similar: it is an issue of the claimant’s reliance on the statement, and whether the statement caused the harm in issue. A false statement, even one made fraudulently, will not be actionable as a misrepresentation by the person to whom it was addressed if it had no impact on his actions, nor otherwise caused him loss. This means that the statement must have been present to the claimant’s mind at the time when he took the action on which he bases his claim, but the claimant need not prove that he believed that the statement was true: it is sufficient that, as a matter of fact, he was influenced by the misrepresentation. … .” </span>

If the position were otherwise, then, I agree with Mr Howe QC that the consequence would be that there would be a substantial watering down of the reliance requirement.

As Mr Howe QC submitted, if Mr Saini QC were right, then, the reliance requirement would largely no longer apply in the case of implied representations, and that simply cannot be right. Furthermore, I agree with Mr Howe QC when he submitted that Mr Saini QC’s submissions, in effect, remove the distinction between actionable non-disclosure (where there is no requirement to show that the claimant understood or was aware of any representation at the time, only that the defendant failed to correct a mistaken assumption) and misrepresentation (where there is such a requirement).

In the case of misrepresentation, he alleges that it was the defendant’s misrepresentation that caused him to make the mistake: the defendant’s words or conduct communicated information on which the claimant relied in deciding to enter into the contract.

As previously explained, however, Mr Maud agreed that it would not have occurred to him in 2008 that any bank might put in a false quote into the EURIBOR process. He agreed also that he would not have spent any time in 2008 thinking about the process by which EURIBOR was set, and that he did not start thinking about how EURIBOR might have been manipulated until many years later. This is evidence which makes it abundantly clear that, even as regards EURIBOR being a “<span style="font-style:italic">true and honest</span>” rate, the most that can be said is that Mr Maud <span style="font-style:italic">assumed</span> this to be the position – indeed, as he put it in his second witness statement, he had no reason to think that the position was other than that. An assumption, however, is insufficient for the reasons which I have given. Accordingly, even in relation to the EURIBOR rate being “<span style="font-style:italic">true and honest</span>”, since Mr Maud did not give conscious thought to the point, he cannot have had the necessary awareness to mean that reliance has been made out in this case. In truth, Mr Maud simply did not turn his mind to the point at the time. That point is not, however, the point which is made in these proceedings - at least not any longer – since any case concerning the honesty of the EURIBOR rate has not been pursued. </p>

Mr Russell accepted in evidence that at the relevant time he knew nothing of the BBA Definition or the way in which submissions were made by Panel Banks, whether RBS was a panel bank or how LIBOR was calculated and that it had never occurred to him that it was capable of manipulation. He was able to say however, that he had ‘complete trust and faith that RBS were setting correct and qualified rates...’ In Mr Wyse’s case, he could not recall any of the LIBOR Representations without seeing them and also accepted that it had not crossed his mind that submissions could be manipulated. He added in cross- examination that he knew that LIBOR was an average and that ‘the High Street banks’ were involved in making submissions. He stated, however, that he had assumed that LIBOR was the true and correct rate.”  </span>Asplin J went on in the next paragraph ([418]) to say this: </p>

Mr Wyse said that it was something which never occurred to him and that he had no reason to believe that the rates quoted were other than genuine. Mr Russell also agreed that in the email Mr Jones was saying that LIBOR better reflected RBS's cost of funding than base rate and that if PAG’s loans were kept on base rate, there would be additional costs for the bank related to its capital requirements and the bank would therefore have to increase the margin charged over base rate to reflect that.” </span>She concluded at [419] as follows:  </p>

On that basis, in my judgment, they could not have understood the implied representations to have been made and therefore, did not rely upon them. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether it is appropriate to ask what they would have done if told the alleged truth as against if nothing had been said. It was accepted the form of the implied representations had been ‘borrowed’ from the Graiseley case and it seems to me that the pleading was not led by the evidence. At best, it seems to me that both Mr Russell and Mr Wyse assumed that LIBOR, which they understood to be a commercial rate of interest, would be set in a straightforward and proper manner.

However, I should mention that Mr Saini QC, Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC were all agreed that, if the representation in question is material (in the sense that it would likely play a part in the decision of a reasonable person to enter into a contract), then, there is a rebuttable presumption (essentially an inference of fact bearing in mind that, as Lord Toulson made clear in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Zurich Insurance v Hayward</span> [2016] UKSC 48 at [68], the question of reliance is a question of fact) that the representation, in fact, induced the representee.

Reliance was also placed on the presumption of inducement or ‘fair inference of fact’ which arises where a false statement is made which is likely to induce a contract and where the representee enters the contract. The inference which arises is that the representee was influenced by the statement: see Zurich Insurance Co. plc v Hayward [2017] AC 142 at paragraph 34 per Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony. Where the misrepresentation was made fraudulently the inference is ‘particularly strong’. The inference or presumption of inducement can be rebutted but that is ‘very difficult’; see paragraphs 34-37 per Lord Clarke. In Raiffeisen Christopher Clarke J suggested that Barton v Armstrong may be regarded as establishing that in a case of fraudulent misrepresentation ‘the presumption of inducement is not rebutted if all that can be said is that the representee might well have contracted without the [fraudulent misrepresentation]’.”</span> He went on at [104] to say this: </p>

The evidential burden therefore lies on NIVE to rebut that presumption or inference. That is ‘very difficult’ to do (per Lord Clarke). It is not rebutted (per Christopher Clarke J.) if all that can be said is that the representee might have entered the contract had there been no representation.

First the presumption is one of fact and capable, like any other such presumption, of being rebutted. It would be dangerous in connection with any issue of fact to suggest that it may only be proved in certain specified ways. Similarly it would be wrong to suggest that as a matter of law the presumption can only be rebutted by proof of certain specified matters. But given that the presumption is that the representation did induce the act or omission in question it is hard to imagine facts sufficient to rebut it which do not fall within any of the categories to which counsel for the Guarantors referred. But my inability to imagine them is no ground for limiting the facts sufficient to rebut the presumption.

It is convenient to take an example. P buys a house from V. He had been considering several houses. He is minded to buy the one which he eventually buys because of its size, shape and character. Shortly before he makes his final decision V’s agent tells him that a particular celebrity has the house next door, a circumstance which he regards as advantageous. It is one of the matters he takes into account in deciding to purchase. He had not previously addressed his mind to the characteristics of his potential neighbour. In fact, as it turns out, there is no celebrity next door. Moreover the next door neighbour - Z - whom the agent knows to be the neighbour is one of the few persons, or types of persons, of whom P would never willingly be a neighbour. If he had never been told that there was a celebrity next door, or, having been so told, was then told that there had been a mistake and the celebrity in question did not live there, he would still have bought the house.

His essential complaint must be that he entered into the contract on the terms on which he did as a result of what he was told, i.e. that, had he not been told what he was told, he would not have done so.

In Downs v Chappell [1997] 1 WLR 426 the trial judge accepted Mr Downs’ evidence that he would not have contracted to buy the business if he had not received verification of certain profit figures which were fraudulently misrepresented to him. This conclusion was not surprising since an earlier set of figures had shown insufficient profits to persuade him to buy. So inducement had been established. That being so, it was not then material to consider what he would have done if he had been given the true profit figures - a situation which had never arisen and to which he would not have given thought (except in the context of the subsequent litigation).” </span>

That distinction is explained in <span style="font-style:italic">MacDonald Eggers, Vitiation of Contractual Consent</span> (1st Ed., 2016) at pp. 646-7 in this way:  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“There are in fact two separate issues of causation. The first is one of inducement. The second is the cause of the damage. It is easy to conflate the two causal requirements, but they should be kept separate, namely whether the contract or course of conduct was induced by the misrepresentation and whether the contract or course of conduct gave rise to the damage sustained. The distinction between these two questions is highlighted in BHP Billiton Ltd v Dalmine. SpA, where the defendant fraudulently misrepresented the carbon equivalent value of the steel used in pipes supplied to the claimant for the purpose of being incorporated into the construction of a sub-sea gas reinjection pipeline. It was common ground between the parties that the claimant relied on the representation by using the pipes in the pipeline, such that if it had known the truth (or, presumably, if the representation had not been made) the steel pipes would have been rejected. The factual issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the pipeline would have failed even if the steel pipes had not been incorporated into the pipeline. Much of the argument concerned which of the parties bore the burden of proof. The claimant demonstrated that the pipeline failed where the non-compliant steel pipe had been installed. The Court held that the defendant had to prove that a hypothetical pipeline that did not include the non-compliant pipe would have failed in any event. The defendant accepted it could not discharge that onus. </span>

In the same case, the Court held that the ‘but for’ test of causation was a starting point designed to eliminate irrelevant causes. There does not have to be a direct link between the misrepresentation and the resultant damage. There is plainly a continuous line (or chain or net or web) of causation between the misrepresentation and the resulting damage; the dislocation lies in the fact that the damage may have been a wholly unforeseen consequence of the misrepresentation (which is no bar to recovery in a claim for damages for deceit). Accordingly, the two questions are whether or not the representee relied on the misrepresentation and whether or not the course of conduct so induced resulted in damage to the claimant.” </span>

On the other hand, as the judge observed at J(1) 549, if it could be affirmatively shown that DGI definitely would have entered into the option agreement even if it had known of Jack and Helga’s involvement in Charlton, then it would be very difficult for DGI to argue that it was induced to enter into the option agreement in reliance upon the intermediary representation.

However, the issue in that case was whether it was necessary to establish that the representee had believed the misrepresentation to be true. It was held, in particular by Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony (as he had become) that, whilst the representee’s belief might be relevant to the issue of inducement, it was not necessary to establish such belief. There was no discussion of what had to be established to show inducement and neither Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group nor Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich v Royal Bank of Scotland were cited to or by the Supreme Court. In those circumstances I am unable to accept counsel’s oral submission that the propositions established by those cases as to the need for the ‘but for’ test to be satisfied must no longer be regarded as good law.

(who was not dealing with a fraudulent misrepresentation) rejected the weaker ‘but for the misrepresentation he might have acted differently’ test; see para.195. He referred to Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104 a Privy Council case on appeal from New South Wales which concerned an agreement entered into as a result of duress. Lord Cross (who gave the majority judgment in the Privy Council) said that the ‘but for’ test did not need to be satisfied by analogy with agreements entered into on account of fraud. Lord Cross said that if the duress was ‘a’ reason for entering the contract it did not matter that the claimant might well have entered the contract even if there had been no duress. Christopher Clarke J. distinguished that case on the grounds that the case before him did not involve a fraudulent misrepresentation. That is no doubt why Hamblen J. observed that Christopher Clarke J. had ‘concluded’ that in such cases there was a weaker “but for the misrepresentation he might have acted differently” test.” </span>He went on at [99]:  </p>

However, in circumstances where both Christopher Clarke J. and Hamblen J. have recognised the weaker test (although in neither case was it the subject of an actual decision) I consider that I should proceed on the basis that the suggested weaker test applies in the case of fraudulent misrepresentation.

At the very least the representation was a matter which ‘supported or encouraged’ him in reaching his decision. But that is not enough, as was held by Christopher Clarke J in Raiffeisen at paragraph 153 following Dadourian v Simms [2009] EWCA Civ 169 at paragraphs 99 and 100, itself a case of fraudulent misrepresentation. The representation must be a matter but for which Mr. Rettig would not have reached the decision he did or, since this is a case of a fraudulent misrepresentation, but for which Mr. Rettig might have acted differently. That is not saying that the representation must be the only reason for his decision; for as Christopher Clarke J. accepted in Raiffeisen there can be more than one ‘but for’ cause; see paragraphs 170171</span>.”</p>

As Downs v Chappell shows, the fact that the claimant might have acted differently had he not been induced by the misrepresentation is not relevant to question (1), but it is relevant to question (2) (as, indeed, Mr Barker pointed out in the course of his submissions). For present purposes, however, it is the analogy with question (1) which is of importance. Expressed purely in terms of misrepresentation, the issue in the instant case is whether Mrs Williams was induced by the misrepresentation to execute the UCB charge. In that context it matters not, in my judgment, whether, had she not been so induced, she would nevertheless have done so</span>.”</p>

He highlighted, specifically, the reference in the last sentence to the word “<span style="font-style:italic">would</span>”. Again, however, Mr Saini QC’s submission is misplaced. <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UCB</span> was a fraud case and so is of only limited assistance to Mr Saini QC’s submission as to whether <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> is required in non-fraud cases. In addition, however, it is quite clear that Jonathan Parker LJ was not dealing with the question of inducement at all. He was, instead, addressing the separate question of causation in the context of damages since that was what was in issue in that case, the trial judge having found in Mrs Williams’ favour that she executed the charge because she had been induced to do so by her husband’s undue influence and misrepresentations. That is made clear from Jonathan Parker LJ’s summary of the trial judge’s findings at [80] to [85]. In short, as in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Downs v Chappell</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UCB</span> the question of inducement had already been determined. It follows, further, that there is no conflict between <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UCB</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ARIG</span> since the two cases were dealing with different issues.

I do not agree with Mr Saini QC about this either, however, since I do not read Bowen LJ’s judgment in that case as suggesting that he was considering this issue at all. He was, instead, considering the issue of whether it is sufficient that a cause is one of many causes. It was in this context that he observed at p. 482 that “<span style="font-style:italic">you must shew that the statement was either the sole cause of the plaintiff’s act, or materially contributed to his so acting</span>” and at p. 483 that “<span style="font-style:italic">the real question is, what was the state of the Plaintiff’s mind, and if his mind was disturbed by the misstatement of the Defendants, and such a disturbance was in part the cause of what he did, the mere fact of his also making a mistake himself could make no difference</span>”. He did not apparently address his mind to the <span style="font-style:italic">might/would</span> distinction but to a different question, his conclusion on that different question being that it is not necessary for the misrepresentation to be the sole inducement or even the predominant or decisive cause as long as it plays a real and substantial part in the representee’s decision.  </p>

It must be shown that the defendant made a materially false representation which was intended to, and did, induce the representee to act to its detriment. To my mind it is not necessary, as a matter of law, to prove that the representee believed that the representation was true. In my opinion there is no clear authority to the contrary. However, that is not to say that the representee’s state of mind may not be relevant to the issue of inducement. Indeed, it may be very relevant. For example, if the representee does not believe that the representation is true, he may have serious difficulty in establishing that he was induced to enter into the contract or that he has suffered loss as a result. The judge makes this point clearly and accurately in the third sentence of para 2.5 of his admirable judgment.” </span></p>

The evidence may, however, show that he would or might well still have entered into the contract, even if the misrepresentation had not been made. In such a case one might argue that the representation did not cause him to enter the contract, because ‘but for’ the misrepresentation he would still have entered into the same contract, or suffered the same loss. On the other hand, it is still true to say that the misrepresentation, if present to his mind and acting as one of the factors he took into account in making his decision, did in fact cause the representee to enter the contract, and that he should still be permitted to base his claim to rescind upon the representation. At least in relation to fraudulent representations the courts have indicated that they will not deny the representee the right to rescind on this ground.” </span>

Whilst no one likes a fraudster successfully to have deceived an innocent, it is difficult to see why the Court should allow a cause of action to exist, the mark of which is the suffering of damage, where in truth no damage has been sustained by reason of the misrepresentation. How can it seriously be suggested that a representee has suffered damage when that representee would have concluded the contract or pursued the line of conduct alleged to have been induced in any event (and consequently suffered the same loss) even if no misrepresentation had been made? It is understandable that the Courts, explicitly fuelled by moral considerations, might be prone to punish fraud even if no damage resulted from the wrong. Unlike the making of fraudulent claims in the context of insurance contracts, where no inducement need be proved; damage resulting from the wrong remains an essential requirement of the cause of action in deceit. If, for policy reasons such as apply with particular force to insurance contracts, the law wished to remove the element of damage (i.e. iniuria) from the cause of action, the Courts should say so</span>.” </p>

I have addressed this matter already, and so need say no more about it. The short point is that Mr Maud did not suggest that he gave any thought to any of the EURIBOR Representations at the time that the Transaction was entered into. The most that he did, at least possibly, was to assume that EURIBOR was a “<span style="font-style:italic">true and honest</span>” rate. If this is all that Mr Maud did, it is inconceivable (indeed, impossible) to conclude that he relied upon the EURIBOR Representations.  </p>

It is striking, indeed, that Mr Saini QC made no attempt in closing (whether in his written or in his oral submissions) to point to evidence from Mr Maud where he described how he <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> have </p>

This was for, no doubt, good reason since it is perfectly obvious, in the circumstances, based on Mr Maud’s own evidence, that the EURIBOR Representations were not <span style="font-style:italic">“actively present to the mind”</span> and cannot have played any role in his (or Marme’s) decision-making.

On the contrary, it is clear that, had Marme known the truth, it would have acted in precisely the same way as it, in the event, did.

On this basis, Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC submitted, rescission of the Swaps alone ought not to be ordered in this case, given that they form part of the (overall) Transaction along with the Senior Loan (which was entered into not just between Marme and the Banks but also with Postbank and RZB, non-parties to the present proceedings), the Junior Loan and certain equity funding (which concerned Ramblas and Mr Maud and Mr Quinlan personally). To permit the Swaps alone to be rescinded, Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC submitted, would entail the rewriting of the bargain into which not only Marme and the Banks entered but also other parties which are not before the Court.  </p>

As such, there is no obstacle to rescission because it would not involve merely partial rescission. Alternatively, he submitted that, even if the Swaps and the Senior Loan are interdependent, rescission is still appropriate in this case because Marme had made it clear that it would not oppose an order which provides that rescission of the Swaps is conditional on repayment of the Senior Loan.

In that case, the claimants sought to rescind certain share distribution agreements on account of allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations made by the first defendant. The defendants applied for the rescission claim to be struck out on the ground that the share distribution agreements could not be rescinded because they were inseparable parts of a larger transaction. The transaction also contained a master agreement and a share buyback agreement. Pursuant to the share buyback agreement, the company would first buy back its own shares from some of the existing shareholders. It would, then, distribute those shares to new shareholders via the share distribution agreements. The claimants accepted that the master agreement and share buyback agreement could not be rescinded but maintained their case that rescission should be awarded in relation to the share distribution agreements. After considering, at [6.1]-[6.3], the authorities supporting the general principle that “<span style="font-style:italic">a misrepresentee is permitted to rescind the whole of a contract but not part of it</span>”, Colman J went on to say this at [6.4]: </p>

Thus in A H McDonald &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Wells (1931) 45 CLR 507 the High Court of Australia held that where a contract had been entered into and then replaced some months later by a second contract - both having been induced by innocent misrepresentation - the remedy of rescission could be available only if the entire transaction, including the earlier contract, were rescinded and the question whether restitutio in integrum could be substantially achieved had to be tested by reference to restoration of the position before the earlier contract had been made. That was not possible because it would have involved treating the representor as if he had had the benefit of exploiting the patents in question for a period of three years during which the representee was entitled to that benefit. No relief could be moulded ‘which will accomplish an approximate restoration that will be just’ … .</span>” </p>

Unless and until the House of Lords overrules the analysis by Lord Browne- Wilkinson in Barclays Bank v O’Brien and its particular application in TSB Bank v Camfield the principles binding on this court are well-settled. The scope of the equitable discretion in a rescission claim is confined to adjustments to achieve substantial restitution to accommodate events that have occurred after the contract has come into force and does not extend to the general reconstruction of the bargain to achieve an objectively overall fair result.”  </span>He concluded at [6.9]: </p>

On this point there is little or no help in the authorities, but application of general principles strongly suggests the necessary criteria. If a representee is induced to enter into separate contracts A &amp; B by the same misrepresentation, it may be that performance of contract B depends on the prior performance of contract A. In that case one cannot rescind contract A without also rescinding contract B. To permit the survival of contract B would be inconsistent with the principles of restitutio in integrum. But there may be cases where although both contracts were induced by the same misrepresentation either can be performed without performance of the other. In that case the representee may rescind unless the contract not sought to be rescinded would never have been entered into by the parties without also entering into the other. Thus, for example, in a case where the transaction is divided into different contracts simultaneously negotiated, it may be that the consideration for the whole bargain is written into one contract, leaving only nominal consideration in the other contract. In that event it would not be open to the representee to leave open the contract that gave him the main consideration while rescinding the other under which his primary performance obligation lay. Again, to do otherwise would not effect restitutio in integrum. Or there may be cases where it is clear from the terms of the contracts and the matrix evidence that the subject matter of the contracts is so interrelated that, although it would be theoretically possible to perform each separately, one would never have been entered into without that contract sought to be rescinded. However, in the absence of structural interdependence between separate contracts, the most usual determinant of inseparability is likely to be the distribution of consideration for the whole bargain between the separate contracts</span>.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I cannot accept these submissions as they seem to me to ignore the commercial reality that the Syndicate banks would not have advanced funds under the Senior Loans without the Swaps (or equivalent interest rate hedging) being entered into at the same time. More specifically, the Swaps and Senior Loan are structurally interdependent in that Marme was required by Clause 8.3 of the Senior Loan to maintain Hedging Arrangements in a notional principal amount not less than the amount of the loan. Furthermore, without the Swaps, Marme could not have fulfilled this obligation since Marme was required by Clause 19.6 of the Senior Loan to ensure an ICR of at least 105% and, without the embedded loan created by the stepped nature of the payments under the Swaps, Marme could not have maintained this. The fact that the Senior Loan could have been structured differently, without the Swaps, is no answer to this point since that would, in effect, entail a rewriting of the parties’ bargain (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">De Molestina</span> at [6.2]). Although it may not strictly be the case that performance of one agreement depends on performance of the other since Clause 8.3 provides that satisfactory hedging arrangements must be maintained rather than providing specifically for the Swaps in their exact form and, similarly, Clause 19.6 provides that “<span style="font-style:italic">The Company must ensure that Interest Cover is, at all times, at least 105 per cent</span>” without envisaging the Swaps specifically, nonetheless, Colman J plainly had in mind that contracts can still be interdependent if the contracts would never have been entered into without also entering into the other.  </p>

Moreover, the reality is that they would never have been entered into other than as part of a single transaction since it is clear that the Banks would never, in fact, have permitted Marme to take the Senior Loan without having the Swaps as a hedge against interest rate risk. The Swaps made the Transaction realistic by enabling the parties to ensure that Marme would be able to cover payments under the Senior Loan even if interest rates were to rise. That the Non-RBS Banks would not have entered into the Senior Loan in the absence of the Swaps was, indeed, confirmed by the evidence of Mr Goodwin for RBS, Mr Feenstra for ING, Mr Grey for HSH and Mr Greenland for Bayern.

However, it should be noted in this context that Mr Greenland of Bayern also gave evidence that Postbank and RZB, who took part in the Senior Loan but not the Swaps, would not have entered into the loan without the comfort of interest rate swaps so as to ensure that Marme would be able to service the Senior Loan. There was also evidence from Mr Greenland that the assignment of the benefit of the hedging formed part of the security package required by the Senior Lenders, even though Clause 2.2 of the Security Agreement did not specifically stipulate the Swaps but merely provided that “<span style="font-style:italic">The Chargor assigns absolutely, subject to a proviso for re-assignment on redemption, all of its rights under any Hedging Arrangements</span>”.  </p>

Mr Feenstra gave evidence that taking part of the Swaps was an important part of the deal for ING and the other banks given the additional revenue involved. Mr Maud gave evidence in cross-examination that he understood that the Swaps were a principal element of the Banks’ profit from the transaction and that they were a condition for entering into the deal. Indeed, as will appear later, Marme’s own case as regards its second ‘counterfactual’ is premised on Marme being able to achieve a discount of 50 bps across both the Swaps and Senior Loan, which presumes that the consideration was considered as being for the Transaction as a whole, rather than allocated to each constituent part. </p>

Mr Saini QC submitted, accordingly, that the partial rescission rule is, as he put it, directed at <span style="font-style:italic">“preventing unjust enrichment, and not some abstract concern about rewriting bargains</span>”. It is for this reason, he suggested, that, if there is no unjust enrichment, the rule against partial rescission has no application. It follows, he went on to submit, that the partial rescission rule does not apply in the present case, Marme having agreed to repay the Senior Loan in return for rescission being ordered. </p>

Further, that requirement is the conceptual consequence of the basic nature of the remedy of rescission which is to discharge all the parties from the bargain into which the misrepresentor has induced them to enter. It is not and never has had the function of providing compensation for the misrepresentation or some hybrid solution to reflect what would be fair between the parties having regard to the nature of the representation and the extent to which one party has been misled by another. Consistently with that, the court has no power to create a new bargain for the parties. What has been induced is the original bargain and it is the purpose of the remedy to return the parties to their position before that particular bargain was made. There is therefore no room for any form of equitable engineering directed to re-constructing the fabric of the original contract.</span>” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It follows that what Marme proposes in an effort to sidestep the partial rescission rule cannot work as a matter of principle. Nor, however, on analysis, would it work in practice since what it would entail is Marme being permitted to rescind the Swaps whilst at the same time performing the Senior Loan contract by repaying it ostensibly in accordance with its terms despite the fact that the Swaps themselves formed part of the consideration for the Transaction. It follows that, if Marme were to rescind the Swaps whilst nonetheless performing the Senior Loan, Marme would receive the use of the money lent under the Senior Loan for less than the anticipated consideration. Even if Mr Saini QC were right, therefore, as to the rationale for the partial rescission rule, what Marme proposes would not avoid its being unjustly enriched were rescission of the Swaps to be permitted. To allow this to happen would mean, in effect, not only that there were a rewriting of the parties’ bargain, but also one which involves a reduction in the level of agreed consideration.  </p>

The defendant accepted that it would only be permitted to rescind on condition that it repaid the loan. The Court of Appeal decided that it could order the defendant to make an interim payment of that amount before trial or make its defence conditional upon making that payment: see [53]. This was not a case of interdependent contracts, however, and the amount payable on rescission was distinguished from the amount payable on performance of the loan agreement.  </p>

The court must fix its eyes on the goal of doing ‘what is practically just’. How that goal may be reached must depend on the circumstances of the case. But the Court will be more drastic in exercising its discretionary powers in a case of fraud than in a case of innocent misrepresentation. This is clearly recognised by Lindley, L.J., in the Lagunas case. There is no doubt good reason for the distinction. A case of innocent misrepresentation may be regarded rather as one of misfortune than as one of moral obliquity. There is no deceit or intention to defraud. The Court will be less ready to pull a transaction to pieces where the defendant is innocent, whereas in the case of fraud the Court will exercise its jurisdiction to the full in order, if possible, to prevent the defendant from enjoying the benefit of his fraud at the expense of the innocent plaintiff. Restoration, however, is essential to the idea of restitution. To take the simplest case, if a plaintiff who has been defrauded seeks to have the contract annulled and his money or property restored to him, it would be inequitable if he did not also restore what he had got under the contract from the defendant. Though the defendant has been fraudulent, he must not be robbed, nor must the plaintiff be enriched, as he would be if he both got back what he had parted with and kept what he had received in return. The purpose of the relief is not punishment, but compensation. The rule is stated as requiring the restoration of both parties to the </span>status quo ante<span style="font-style:italic">, but it is generally the defendant who complains that restitution is impossible. The plaintiff who seeks to set aside the contract will generally be reasonable in the standard of restitution which he requires</span>.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Erlanger</span> the issue was whether it is possible to permit rescission notwithstanding that <span style="font-style:italic">restitutio in integrum </span>is impossible but where substantial restitution can nonetheless be made by the claimant giving compensation for, as in that case, deterioration. The answer given in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Erlanger</span> was that this is possible, the Court’s task in such a situation being to approximate the parties’ <span style="font-style:italic">pre-contractual </span>position. In the present case, however, the position is not the same at all for two reasons. First, it is not the position in the present case that <span style="font-style:italic">restitutio in integrum</span> is practically impossible. On the contrary, the reason that Marme does not seek to rescind the Senior Loan is merely because Marme <span style="font-style:italic">chooses</span> not to do so. The fact that, as Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC observed, Marme might not be able to do so because that would involve prejudicing third parties, namely Deutsche Postbank and RZB (lenders under the Senior Loan but not counterparties to the Swaps), does not change the fact that, as between Marme and the Banks, Marme has <span style="font-style:italic">chosen</span> to treat the Senior Loan as remaining on foot. Secondly and in any event, whereas in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Erlanger</span> the Court sought to achieve an outcome which returned the parties substantially to the position they had been in <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the contract was entered into, the position contended for by Marme in the present case would put Marme partly in the position which it was in before the Transaction (including the Swaps) was entered into (by rescinding the Swaps) and partly in the position in which Marme would be in had the Transaction been performed (through the performance of the Senior Loan and other financing arrangements).

That damages claim, it was submitted, would equate to the value of any sums repayable under the Swaps which would create a circularity of action. In this respect, Mr Howe QC drew an analogy with what was said about partial rescission in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Al Nehayan</span>. That was a case which concerned a scheme to restructure some companies and provide for payment of part of the capital contribution which Sheikh Tahnoon had made to the business, which had been paid by Mr Kent. Two agreements were made between Sheikh Tahnoon and Mr Kent. The first agreement was a Framework Agreement which provided for demerger of the business. The second was a promissory note by which Mr Kent agreed to pay the relevant sum to Sheikh Tahnoon. At [220], Leggatt J (as he then was) stated as follows: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“In closing submissions Mr Rees QC on behalf of Sheikh Tahnoon argued that Mr Kent cannot on any view rescind the promissory note alone. Mr Rees cited Molestina v Ponton [2001] CLC 1412 for the proposition that a contract which forms an inseparable part of a larger transaction cannot be separately rescinded. In the face of this authority, Mr Kent abandoned his claim to rescind the promissory note. I think it was plain that he was right to do so. The promissory note was not a freestanding agreement but was an inseparable part of the overall transaction by which the interests of Mr Kent and Sheikh Tahnoon in the Aquis and YouTravel companies were demerged pursuant to the Framework Agreement. Its ancillary nature is demonstrated by the fact that clause 5.2 of the Framework Agreement provided for the issue of the promissory note. It seems to me impossible to separate the benefits which Mr Kent received in return for entering into the promissory note from the totality of the benefits that he received under the Framework Agreement, which included the transfer to him of the shares held by Sheikh Tahnoon in Aquis UK and Stelow. Mr Kent could not restore those benefits without rescinding the Framework Agreement. In any event, even if it were possible to rescind the promissory note without rescinding the Framework Agreement, doing so would not free Mr Kent from liability, as it would leave clause 5.2 of the Framework Agreement in effect and would simply place Mr Kent in breach of that clause, giving rise to a liability in damages equivalent to the value of the promissory note.” </span>

As a result, he submitted, Clause 8.3 does not require Marme to agree to whatever hedging arrangements the Banks might demand, and so it does not follow that there would necessarily be a Clause 8.3 breach as Mr Howe QC suggested.

But I feel able to judge it on balance of probabilities. I have no doubt that Mr Gwyer wanted his company ... to become the exclusive distributor of [Sovereign’s] products in France. I have no doubt that he wanted to buy those products at prices which meant that [Sovereign’s] customers in the UK could not buy its products in the UK and take them to France to undersell [the plaintiffs] ... In my judgment it is distinctly more probable than not that, if Mr Dent had not made the false misrepresentations which he did, the ... discussion about [Sovereign’s] prices would have revealed the existence of prices to large customers, as in the bulk price lists, and probably the bulk price lists themselves. In my judgment Mr Gwyer would have wished to negotiate a discount from the prices in the bulk price list ... There was no reason why Mr Dent should not have agreed such a discount. The bulk price list ... provided for an agreed salesman’s commission of 10% payable on the prices in the list. What [Sovereign] sold to [the plaintiffs] would not carry salesman’s commission ... Moreover, [Sovereign] were selling to some customers at prices well below those on the bulk price list, although salesman’s commission was generally much less on such sales. Although some such sales appear to have been at prices as much as 25% below bulk price list, no doubt due to particular market pressures, I do not believe that Mr Gwyer would have negotiated a commission or discount as great as that as part of a long term, exclusive distribution agreement. I judge that he would have achieved a discount on bulk price lists prices of somewhere between the May 1978 salesman's commission of 10% and the discount of 25% ... which he achieved on the minimum standard rate price list prices. I can do no better than take the mid-way point of 17-5% as the discount which Mr Gwyer would probably have achieved on the bulk price list prices and agreed as the pricing mechanism in the 1979 agreements which would have followed, if the false and fraudulent misrepresentations, the deceit, had not taken place ... The agreements would have had a price clause with the same provisos as clause 5(1) of the actual agreements, relating to price increases only, but related to prices appearing in [Sovereign’s] bulk price lists</span>.” </p>

Mr Tomson contrasted this with Mr Quest and Mr Howe QC’s suggestion as to what the inquiry should be whether the truth would have been discovered. He also cited what Ward LJ went on to say at page 512G-H: </p>

I think the answer is to follow Lord Steyn’s approach to its logical conclusion because if one is truly to compare the position of the plaintiff as it was before the fraudulent statement was made to him with his position as it became as a result of his reliance on the fraudulent statement, then just before the fraudulent statement was made the plaintiff was battling in what he believed to be honest negotiations to ascertain the defendant’s bottom line and he was denied finding it because of the lies that were told to him. … .</span>” </p>

On analysis, however, it seems to me that what Ward LJ was really doing was highlighting the very distinction identified in the submissions which were made by Mr Quest QC and Mr Howe QC whilst, nonetheless, making the point that in the case before him the plaintiff would have ascertained the truth had the misrepresentations not been made given that the plaintiff had been “<span style="font-style:italic">battling … to ascertain the defendant’s bottom line” </span>(and so was actually investigating that bottom line)<span style="font-style:italic"> “and he was denied finding it because of the lies that were told to him</span>”.

That said, as Mr Quest QC went on to explain, given that this case is concerned with implied representations, it is difficult, in practice, to approach the question of damages other than by reference to the truth.

Mr. Nicholson has argued that on the evidence of Mr. Knowles, an experienced accountant, the judge could have arrived at the same or an equivalent figure on that basis. I do not agree. The judge left out of account the fact that the second plaintiff was moving into an entirely different area and one in which she was, comparatively speaking, a stranger. Secondly, that she was going to deal with a different clientele. Thirdly, that there were almost certainly in that area of Bournemouth other smart hairdressing salons which represented competition and which, in any event, if the first defendant had, as he had represented, gone to open a salon on the Continent, could have attracted the custom of his former clients.” </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The judge, as Mr. Nicholson has pointed out, had two clear starting points. First, that any person investing £20,000 in a business would expect a greater return than if the sum was left safely in the bank or in a building society earning interest, and a reasonable figure for that at the rates then prevailing would have been at least £6,000. Secondly, that the salary of a hairdresser's assistant in the usual kind of establishment was at this time £40 per week and that the assistant could expect tips in addition. That would produce a figure of over £7,000, but the proprietor of a salon would clearly expect to earn more, having risked his money in the business. It seems to me that those are valid points from which to start to consider what would be a reasonable sum to award for loss of profits of a business of this kind. As was pointed out by Winn L.J., in Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd. [1969] 2 Q.B. 158, 169, this is not a question which can be considered on a mathematical basis. It has to be considered essentially, in the round, making what he described as a ‘jury assessment’.” </span>

I am unconvinced, however, that <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">East v Maurer</span> provides too much assistance when considering the somewhat more complex counterfactuals put forward by Marme in this case. Marme’s case is very specific. It would be quite wrong, in the circumstances, to adopt the type of approach advocated by Mr Tomson. The more so, given that Mr Maud accepted in cross-examination that he would not have walked away from completing the Transaction under any circumstances. Nor, indeed, is it any part of Marme’s case that it would have withdrawn from the Senior Loan since, if it had done that, then, it could not have completed the acquisition of the Ciudad Financiera and so would have forfeited its €75 million deposit (the funds for which were provided by Mr Maud and Mr Quinlan) and given up the opportunity of making a very large profit. The claim is, in that sense and for that reason, as Mr Quest QC put it in closing, an <span style="font-style:italic">“all or nothing claim”</span>: either the counterfactuals advanced by Marme are viable or they are not; there is no halfway house.    </p>

These included the fact that there was a high-level relationship between Santander and RBS, Santander being likely, as a result, to exert pressure on RBS to complete, as well as the fact that RBS had commercial incentives to complete the Transaction, separate and apart from any profit which it might make on the Swaps, because it was taking a 5% fee for its contribution to the Senior Loan, interest of 1.6% on its share of the Senior Loan, and providing a Junior Loan of €200 million (with a 1% margin) which was tied to a lucrative so-called ‘Upside Fee Agreement’ which granted it a valuable additional fee of €92 million.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">As to the former, Mr Tomson submitted that RBS had reached a deal at the highest levels pursuant to which it agreed to control, co-ordinate and deliver the Transaction in return for Santander assisting RBS by taking over certain other Propinvest debt, thereby improving RBS’s balance sheet at a time when RBS was in severe financial difficulties having had to raise £12 billion of capital by way of a rights issue 3 months previously. Mr Tomson suggested that Santander would have used this relationship to put pressure on RBS to complete the Transaction as Santander needed the deal to happen for its Tier 1 capital requirements. It was important, Mr Tomson suggested, for RBS to maintain this relationship due to the arrangement which RBS had made with Santander. Reference was made in this respect to certain documents which it was suggested make this clear. These include an email from Mr Sutherland to his colleagues at HSH on 1 August 2008 in which he stated that “<span style="font-style:italic">RBS (through their close contacts with Santander) have been brought in to fill the gap and to run the syndication</span>”.

The same point was made in minutes relied upon by Mr Tomson relating to a meeting of RBS’s Structured Property Finance Group held on 4 August 2008 as they referred to the “<span style="font-style:italic">relationship element of the deal</span>” and to Santander’s CFO and Mr Cameron being in negotiations.  </p>

Rather, Mr Quest QC submitted, it was as a <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo </span>for RBS’s involvement that RBS asked Santander to take on some of Propinvest’s doubtful debt as part of the reciprocal trade. He suggested that this shows that it was Marme and Santander which were the parties under pressure, not RBS. That, he went on to submit, is what was under discussion in the 4 August 2008 minutes, as demonstrated by the fact that, under the heading “<span style="font-style:italic">Structure</span>”, the minutes recorded the following: </p>

I agree with Mr Quest QC about this. I consider also, more generally, that Mr Maud’s insistence in evidence that RBS (in the shape of Mr Cameron, in particular) would have intervened in Marme’s favour amounts, in truth, to little more than conjecture.  </p>

Although it was suggested on Marme’s behalf that adverse inferences should be drawn from the fact that RBS did not adduce evidence from people such as Mr Eighteen, Mr Cameron or, indeed, the then Sir Fred Goodwin to address this issue, that would not be appropriate in circumstances where, as Mr Quest QC pointed out, it had been made clear on Marme’s behalf at an earlier stage of proceedings that this was not a case which was going to be addressed at trial. That is borne out by Mr Quest QC’s reference to a letter from Simmons &amp; Simmons LLP dated 8 April 2016 which raised the point that certain “<span style="font-style:italic">commercial interest allegations</span>” which had been made in the (then) Amended Particulars of Claim should not attract disclosure obligations, and by Kobre &amp; Kim (UK) LLP’s letter in reply dated 3 May 2016 in which it was stated that those allegations were not <span style="font-style:italic">“matters to be determined at trial”</span>. RBS cannot sensibly be criticised, in the circumstances, for not calling these people as witnesses. It follows that no adverse inference should be drawn.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In any event, dealing more directly with the counterfactual case which is put forward by Marme, as Mr Howe QC observed, no attempt has been made on Marme’s behalf to explain why the revelations as to RBS’s conduct regarding EURIBOR (if that they be) would have made intervention by Santander more likely than in the events as they actually occurred. As Mr Howe QC rightly pointed out, this is critical since the influence which Marme has suggested that Santander had did not arise from any such (counterfactual) revelations. On the contrary, if Mr Tomson is right and Santander’s involvement was as important as he described it, then, that was the position in any event and nothing in the counterfactual scenario would have made it any more so. In short, if Marme could rely on Santander to exert pressure on RBS to complete the deal, then, it would clearly have been open to Marme to exploit this fact in what Mr Howe QC described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the real world”</span>. Instead of doing that, however, Marme chose to accept RBS’s terms, including its substantial fee, and also gave up on its negotiations to reduce the credit spread and then demanding a credit rebate. The reason why is not difficult to discern: it is because, whatever Mr Maud might now say and whatever might now be suggested on Marme’s behalf, any Santander pressure would not have achieved what is envisaged in either of Marme’s counterfactuals. </p>

The truth is that there is no evidence that Santander or Marme could have compelled RBS to do the deal on different terms. This, after all, was a deal which RBS had previously turned down. In July 2008, when RBS got involved, it was Marme and Santander who were under pressure to complete the deal quickly and, although Mr Maud suggested otherwise, the evidence suggests that RBS was the only realistic option left to plug Marme’s gap in financing, Bayern having already approached 24 banks and Mr Maud </p>

The answer, I am clear, is not what Mr Tomson suggested, namely that RBS would have been prevailed upon by Marme to go down one of the two counterfactual routes now identified by Mr Tomson, since I agree with Mr Quest QC when he observed in his oral submissions that RBS’s likely response would have been to agree with Mr Maud that <span style="font-style:italic">“this is very shocking, but that has no connection with your deal and it doesn’t entitle you to some special treatment”</span>. As insistent and dogged as Mr Maud might have been in the face of such a response, I am clear that RBS’s response would have stayed the same: that the deal terms were as they had been agreed not only as between Marme and RBS but also with the Non-RBS Banks. The fact that Mr Eighteen, Mr Cameron and Sir Fred Goodwin were not called as witnesses to say this, in terms, is unimportant since, ultimately, it is for the Court to weigh up the probabilities and arrive at a conclusion.

He confirmed in cross-examination that the PIK structure would not have solved the issue of interest rate risk to the lender, and he also gave evidence that in 2008 it would not have been usual for Bayern to have lent money without interest rate hedging because it was part of Bayern’s <span style="font-style:italic">“basic business plan” </span>to insist on full hedging. He described the possibility of interest rate rises as <span style="font-style:italic">“a huge risk to the lenders”</span> and, when asked what his reaction would have been if he had been asked to underwrite this particular transaction without interest rate hedging he stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“It wouldn’t have been entertained”.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Mr Saini QC submitted, nonetheless, that, at least in the case of Caixa and ING, Santander could have applied significant pressure to make them accept an alternative financial structure. He pointed in this regard to Mr Maud’s evidence that Santander’s Chairman, Senor Botin, had personally convinced ING to proceed with financing the Transaction when it had appeared to be wavering, as well as to Mr Feenstra’s evidence that ING’s relationship with Santander was “<span style="font-style:italic">the only reason why we ended up in this transaction at the end</span>”, that the Transaction was “<span style="font-style:italic">not a commercially attractive deal</span>” but that “<span style="font-style:italic">at a very high level, ING learned from Santander that they would very much appreciate us to come into the deal … My board wanted to do them a favour … Santander was a very appreciated client of ING”.</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>He also relied upon Mr Maud’s evidence that, when Caixa indicated that it would not be able to complete by 12 September 2008, Senor Yanes threatened that, if it did not complete by then, Santander would cut off its credit lines. He submitted that “<span style="font-style:italic">Whatever was in fact said plainly had the desired effect, as La Caixa came back into line and was ready on time for completion</span>”. Mr Saini QC submitted, more generally, that both Santander and RBS were substantially larger and more powerful than the other lending banks except for ING. Nonetheless, I cannot accept that, viewed in the round, the evidence is sufficient to justify a conclusion that Santander would have gained any additional leverage over the Non-RBS Banks in this scenario. It was not, after all, the Non-RBS Banks which had done anything at all wrong. Given this, it is hard to see why they would have been willing to agree to any variation to the arrangements which were, in fact, agreed.  </p>

In short, Marme says that it would not have entered into the Swaps at all or, indeed, any other type of swap, and that the initial shortfall in rental income necessary to cover repayments under the Senior Loan (solved in the current structure by the stepped nature of the Swaps) would have been made up by way of a PIK loan structure, which would have replaced the use of stepped swaps.  </p>

This is that, far from protecting Marme against EURIBOR manipulation, removing the Swaps from the Transaction would have meant that Marme had no protection against such manipulation. This is because, even if the Swaps were removed, Marme was still exposed to EURIBOR manipulation through the Senior Loan since its obligations under the Senior Loan entailed Marme paying a floating rate which was itself linked to EURIBOR – and to the full extent since <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> manipulation of the published rate would be reflected in the amount thereby payable. Indeed, the whole point of having the Swaps was to hedge the Senior Loan, and so to remove any exposure to EURIBOR as regards Marme’s cashflows: although Marme <span style="font-style:italic">paid</span> floating EURIBOR under the Senior Loan, it <span style="font-style:italic">received</span> floating EURIBOR under the Swaps, the two essentially cancelling each other out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">I would add, in this context, that, as I explained when dealing with Mr Maud’s evidence more generally earlier in this judgment, I do not accept that Mr Maud was ever opposed to the use of interest rate hedging. On the contrary, despite stating in his first witness statement that Marme “<span style="font-style:italic">was very much opposed to the idea of having an IRS as we believed at the time that the pressure on interest rates over the short to medium term was downwards”</span>, there is no evidence that Marme had ever objected to having a swap – something which was included in its proposals from the beginning. Indeed, in his second witness statement, far from suggesting that efforts were made to persuade Bayern not to hedge, Mr Maud described swaps as having been “<span style="font-style:italic">expected</span>”. Indeed, despite his insistence when giving evidence that he was opposed to the idea of an interest rate swap, it is clear, therefore, that such opposition cannot have been too pronounced since, as he himself put it when he was asked about the fact that there is no email or other document in which the opposition is expressed, it was <span style="font-style:italic">“pointless me trying to push it in writing when I knew from my conversations with the banks that all the banks we were dealing with – were insisting on an IRS”</span>. Mr Maud, therefore, recognised that interest rate hedging was essential to the deal and he was prepared to proceed on that basis since he knew that the Transaction would not have got ‘over the line’ without it.

As Mr Quest QC put it, whatever Mr Maud may have believed in 2008 about the future direction of interest rates, Marme was established to acquire a real estate asset and not to speculate on EURIBOR. A structure which involved Marme’s outgoing cashflow being linked to EURIBOR (through the Senior Loan) but not its incoming cashflow would have created a clear and obvious risk and was never proposed.  </p>

As Mr Howe QC observed, although a PIK loan would have been affordable in the sense that it would have bridged the inevitable gap which would have been brought about by the fact that the rent would have been insufficient to meet interest payments in the early stages of the Senior Loan (essentially a matter of cashflow), it does nothing at all to address the main reason why the Swaps were used, namely to protect against the risk of interest rate rises. Mr Feenstra was clear about this since, when asked by Mr Saini QC in cross-examination, having made the point referred to above (namely that the effect of the Swaps was that Marme was not exposed to any manipulation risk), Mr Feenstra went on to say that a PIK loan involves it being said, in effect, that <span style="font-style:italic">“I can’t afford paying you the interest, so can I have it capitalised?

Marme’s original case was that it would have negotiated a 0.5% discount on the Swaps, claiming losses of €125 million. Marme’s case now, however, is that it would have negotiated a reduction in the fixed payments under the Swaps in the region of 10 bps amounting only to around €29,534,269, of which about two thirds (€19,435,000) represented a reduction in the break costs which the Banks seek in these proceedings. The practical result on this case is that the credit spread on the Swaps would have been thereby reduced from 15 bps to 5 bps. Mr Tomson submitted that, given the overall economics available to RBS in the Transaction (both directly and indirectly in terms of the benefits to it from its deal with Santander) such a modest reduction in the credit spread fees earned under the Swaps was something realistically achievable for Marme in a hypothetical negotiation.

My view of the reasonable market rate for spreads on swaps of this nature was in the range of 5 to 8 basis points, and that is what I would have tried to obtain for Marme.

Whatever the rights and wrongs of that explanation, what matters for present purposes is that the case as ultimately put forward at trial, after Mr Saini QC had in opening clarified the position, was not based on a contention that a 50 bps reduction in the overall interest rate across the Senior Loan and the Swaps would have been realistically achieved through negotiations with the Banks but that a 10 bps reduction (from 15 bps to 5 bps) in the Swap rates would have been achieved (the other 40 bps reduction being in respect of the Senior Loan margin). Marme’s case (at least at trial and despite not being entirely consistent with what Mr Maud had to say even in his most recent witness statement) was, therefore, in effect, that, whereas a 50 bps reduction in respect of the Swaps would have been unrealistic as it would have meant that the Swaps were loss-making at the outset, a 10 bps reduction would merely have reduced the profit taken by the Banks on the credit spread (and a 40 bps reduction in the Senior Loan would merely have reduced Marme’s payment of interest but not required the Banks to make payments to Marme).  </p>

In response to a query from Mr Littlewood, who thought that it would be closer to 8-10 bps, Mr Williams clarified that the credit spread referable to the embedded loan was 9 bps and the extra 5 bps was referable to the so-called ‘vanilla’ element (the risk, inherent in any swap, that the market rate might move against the counterparty after execution, leaving the banks exposed to a credit risk in respect of future net periodic payments or break costs due from the counterparty). It is also consistent with the fact that, in internal discussions, Mr Goodwin had suggested to Mr Bates that there was a 4-5 bps spread for the vanilla element and another 8 bps for the embedded element, which he suggested should in reality be greater.  </p>

Mr Tomson submitted, nonetheless, that, if necessary, in other words if the Non-RBS Banks had refused to countenance any reduction in their own spreads, RBS could have subsidised them. He suggested that, even after a 10 bps reduction in the credit spread, the Non-RBS Banks together would have had a credit spread of €3,278,400, representing a reduction of €10.92 million, and that RBS “<span style="font-style:italic">could and would easily have compensated them for, if necessary, out of its overall direct and indirect deal economics</span>”. However, as Mr Quest QC pointed out, RBS’s effective spread on the Swaps was 17.9 bps. It was, therefore, in fact, higher than 15 bps because RBS retained more than its proportionate share of the 2 bps execution spread given that RBS was the bank responsible for market execution. It follows that, if RBS was going to compensate the NonRBS Banks, RBS’s effective spread on its own Swap would have reduced by 31.6 bps overall to below zero, specifically minus 13.7 bps. RBS’s loss would, therefore, on this basis, have been very significant indeed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Although in his oral closing submissions Mr Tomson drew attention to the UFA, specifically various provisions indicating that RBS would receive payment in the event that Marme refinanced in stipulated time periods (specifically €20 million within 3-6 months and €45 million within 6-12 months), suggesting that these are monies which needed also to be factored into the “<span style="font-style:italic">overall economics</span>”, I remain unswayed by Mr Tomson’s submissions on this aspect. In my view, it is simply unrealistic to suppose that RBS would have agreed to so substantial a reduction by undertaking to compensate the Non-RBS Banks. Indeed, as Mr Quest QC pointed out, were RBS to have compensated the Non-RBS Banks, the reduction involved would have been so substantial as to mean that it was approaching the 50 bps which Mr Maud and Marme themselves now accept would have been commercially unacceptable.   </p>

An agent in the strict sense of the word holds a power to affect the legal relations of his principal. This power is conferred by the law in the implementation of the supposed intentions of the parties; but it is not surprising that the law also imposes controls on the way in which the holder of such a strong power may behave towards the person who conferred it. This is not a situation like the more usual one regulated by the law in which the parties are in an adverse commercial relationship, for example a simple hire of services. Agency services are services of a special kind. Even when no such power to affect legal relations was conferred, as in the ‘incomplete agency’ case of the canvassing agent, the relationship of the parties still imports an undertaking by one to act in the interests of the other rather than his own, and this likewise, though to a lesser extent, justifies the law’s intervention</span>.” Also of note, he suggested, is paragraph 6-037:  </p>

This can be criticised on the basis that not every person who can be described by the word ‘agent’ is subject to fiduciary duties; and that a person who certainly is so to be described may owe such duties in some respects and not in others. Hence it is said that there may be a ‘non-fiduciary agent’, and that in some functions an acknowledged agent may not act as fiduciary at all. Rather than talk of a ‘non-fiduciary agent’ it seems better to say that where an agent does not act in a fiduciary capacity (e.g. because he simply carries out specific instructions), this is a reflection of the scope of his duties and the boundaries of the equitable rules. </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The first is that the word ‘agent’ can be used in varying senses, and not all persons to whom the word is applied are agents in the full (or sometimes, any) legal sense. A canvassing, or introducing agent, for instance, may do no more than bring two parties together and thus may in many situations do little involving the incidence of fiduciary responsibilities at all; though equally he can, as has been stated above, in some circumstances become liable for breach of such duties, as when he conceals from his principal the existence of further offers. Further, even canvassing agents usually have authority to make and receive communications on behalf of their principals, and can be expected to act loyally in exercising those powers. A distributor or franchisee, though sometimes called an agent, is in most respects in a position commercially adverse, rather than fiduciary, to the person whose goods he distributes: he buys and resells. But again it is conceivable that circumstances might give him knowledge of and power over his principal’s affairs which could justify the imposition of some fiduciary duties; and this is quite apart from the possibility that he may also in some circumstances exercise true agency functions, for example as regards complaints concerning the goods, and be subject to fiduciary duties in that respect. </span>

Article 1(4) seeks to achieve completeness by taking in a well-established type of intermediary who makes no contracts and disposes of no property, but is simply hired, whether as an employee or independent contractor, to introduce parties desirous of contracting and leaves them to contract between themselves. In effecting such introductions he is remunerated by commission, which he may sometimes take from both parties. Such a person is a common figure in most western legal systems and may well be referred to as an agent. The most obvious example of such an intermediary in the English cases is the estate agent, who introduces purchasers to vendors and tenants to lessors of houses, and vice versa. Such persons are sometimes also referred to as brokers, and indeed in some English-speaking countries the estate agent is referred to as a ‘real estate broker’: but this may be misleading since the current practice, at any rate in England, is to use the term ‘broker’ for persons who go beyond introductions and certainly do make contracts for their principals, e.g. commodity brokers, insurance brokers and stockbrokers. Canvassing agents are on the fringe of the central agency principles used by the common law, since their powers to alter their principals’ legal relations are at best extremely limited. They often, however, have authority to receive and communicate information on their principals’ behalf, and in so doing have the capacity to alter their principals’ legal position. They also usually act in a capacity which may involve the repose of trust and confidence, and hence may be subject in some respects to the fiduciary duties of agents towards their principals. They are also subject of typical rules, largely developed in estate agent cases, as to entitlement to commission, which are normally regarded as part of agency law and are relied on also by agents who have greater powers to bind their principals. They may sometimes hold money (e.g. deposits) for their principals. The rules applicable to the internal relationship between principal and agent will therefore apply as appropriate, and for this reason such persons should certainly be treated in a work on agency even though they lack the external powers of the agent. It is an advantage of the formulation of basic agency principle in Article 1, which selects the internal relationship between principal and agent as a distinguishing feature of agency, that it can be taken to cover such persons. Canvassing agents are persons to whom the internal parts of agency law may apply, but who, because of the limited nature of their external powers to affect their principals’ legal positions, are not agents in the full sense of the word. They may therefore be said to provide an example of ‘incomplete agency’.” </span></p>

Not every independent contractor performing a task for, or for the benefit of, a party will be an agent, and so identified as it, or as representing it, and its interests. Agency is a consensual relationship, generally (if not always) bearing a fiduciary character, in which by its terms A acts on behalf of (and in the interests of) P and with a necessary degree of control requisite for the purpose of the role. … In McKenzie v McDonald [1927] VLR 134 at 144 Dixon AJ, in saying that not every agent stands as a fiduciary, was recognising that the word ‘agent’ is used in many senses and is apt to mislead, citing Kennedy v De Trafford at 188. That is, however, no more than to say that the word ‘agent’ has a potentially wide and varying meaning in life and business and that, on some occasions, the business description will be given to someone who is not a fiduciary. … It is sufficient to recognise that the essential characteristic is that one party (A) acts on the other’s (P’s) behalf, and that this will generally be in circumstances of a requirement or duty not to act otherwise than in the interests of P in the performance of the consensual arrangement. Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency, the Restatement and Seavey op cit at 863 include in the conception of agency the characteristic of fiduciary duty. The duty will, of course, conform with the extent and scope of the agency and thus be of potentially varied content, recognising that context (in particular, perhaps, a market or commercial context) may attenuate the rigour or content of the fiduciary duty … . The necessary good faith implicit in a fiduciary character in the relationship reflects the character of identity or representation that the relationship essentially carries</span>.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">It is worth mentioning at this juncture two further points in relation to fiduciary duties. The first concerns the circumstances in which such duties arise, as to which Leggatt LJ had this to say in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Al Nehayan</span> at [159]: </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:-0.01in">“<span style="font-style:italic">Thus, fiduciary duties typically arise where one person undertakes and is entrusted with authority to manage the property or affairs of another and to make discretionary decisions on behalf of that person. (Such duties may also arise where the responsibility undertaken does not directly involve making decisions but involves the giving of advice in a context, for example that of solicitor and client, where the adviser has a substantial degree of power over the other party’s decision-making: see Lionel Smith, ‘Fiduciary relationships: ensuring the loyal exercise of judgement on behalf of another’ (2014) 130 LQR 608.) The essential idea is that a person in such a position is not permitted to use their position for their own private advantage but is required to act unselfishly in what they perceive to be the best interests of their principal. This is the core of the obligation of loyalty which Millett LJ in the Mothew case [1998] Ch 1 at 18, described as the ‘distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary’. Loyalty in this context means being guided solely by the interests of the principal and not by any consideration of the fiduciary’s own interests. To promote such decision-making, fiduciaries are required to act openly and honestly and must not (without the informed consent of their principal) place themselves in a position where their own interests or their duty to another party may conflict with their duty to pursue the interests of their principal. They are also liable to account for any profit obtained for themselves as a result of their position.</span>” </p>

This reasoning takes effect in the doctrine of apparent authority. This applies both where the supposed agent is not authorised to act at all, and also where he appears to have a greater authority than was actually conferred on him. It is said in the English cases that this reasoning depends on estoppel. But it is suggested below that this is a very weak form of estoppel, and to be distinguished from other agency-related situations where the principles of estoppel as normally stated more obviously apply.

To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself.

The commonest form of representation by a principal creating an ‘apparent’ authority of an agent is by conduct, namely, by permitting the agent to act in the management or conduct of the principal’s business. Thus, if in the case of a company the board of directors who have ‘actual’ authority under the memorandum and articles of association to manage the company’s business permit the agent to act in the management or conduct of the company’s business, they thereby represent to all persons dealing with such agent that he has authority to enter on behalf of the corporation into contracts of a kind which an agent authorised to do acts of the kind which he is in fact permitted to do usually enters into in the ordinary course of such business</span>.” </p>

However, where, as here, it is suggested that it was within the agent's ostensible authority to communicate to the third party the principal's approval of the agent entering into a transaction which would otherwise not be within the agent’s authority, the only representation of the principal which can give rise to such ostensible authority is a representation to the effect that the third party can rely upon the agent’s communication of the principal’s approval. It is possible to construct a theoretical case in which such a representation is expressly made by a principal, where he states to the third party that he should look to the agent for the necessary approval, and that he can rely upon the agent's statement whether such approval has been given. But I can see no basis for concluding, on the facts of the present case, that the defendants ever made any such representation regarding Mr. Magelssen. No doubt, by appointing Mr. Magelssen to his position and allowing him to act as such, they did represent that he had authority to bind his principals to those contracts which an agent in his position ordinarily has authority to make; and no doubt that ostensible authority would embrace the making of such representations concerning the subject matter of any such contract as might reasonably be understood to fall within such usual authority. But that does not, in my judgment, embrace authority by Mr. Magelssen to communicate approval by his superiors to his making contracts which, to the knowledge of the third party, he had no authority to enter into without such approval, with the effect that the defendants would be bound by such communication.”  </span>

It results in an extraordinary distinction between (1) a case where an agent, having no ostensible authority to enter into the relevant contract, wrongly asserts that he is invested with actual authority to do so, in which event the principal is not bound; and (2) a case where an agent, having no ostensible authority, wrongly asserts after negotiations that he has gone back to his principal and obtained actual authority, in which event the principal is bound.

In the commonly encountered case, the ostensible authority is general in character, arising when the principal has placed the agent in a position which in the outside world is generally regarded as carrying authority to enter into transactions of the kind in question. Ostensible general authority may also arise where the agent has had a course of dealing with a particular contractor and the principal has acquiesced in this course of dealing and honoured transactions arising out of it. Ostensible general authority can, however, never arise where the contractor knows that the agent’s authority is limited so as to exclude entering into transactions of the type in question, and so cannot have relied on any contrary representation by the principal … .  </span></p>

Ex hypothesi the contractor knows that the agent has no general authority to enter into the transaction, as was the position here. The principal might conceivably inform the contractor that, in relation to a transaction which to the contractor’s knowledge required the specific approval of the principal, he could rely on the agent to enter into the transaction only if such approval had been given. In such a situation, if the agent entered into the transaction without approval, the principal might be estopped from denying that it had been given.

Further orders were subsequently given by the claimant to the clerk, who did not pass them to the defendants and who, instead, misappropriated the cheques, giving the claimant forged notes purporting to show the share purchases.

WorldCom was also to be a party to the contract. The terms of the contract were negotiated by a Ms McKibbin, a lawyer employed by MCI WorldCom. An issue raised was whether certain representations allegedly made by Ms McKibbin were arguably (it was a summary judgment case) within the scope of her ostensible authority as agent for WorldCom. MCI WorldCom was, on the face of it, acting as agent of WorldCom in negotiating the contract. At first instance, Colman J took the view, at [34] and [35] ([2003] EWHC 2182 (Comm)), that it was <span style="font-style:italic">“completely unreal”</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> “completely fanciful”</span> to suppose that <span style="font-style:italic">“an employee in the legal department of the UK subsidiary of a United States corporation would have authority to give answers to be relied upon by the opposite party to negotiations as to the existing or future financial viability of the parent company”</span>. The Court of Appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 957) reached a different conclusion in ordering that the matter should go to trial. It is clear that the Court of Appeal did not quibble with it being necessary to ask whether the specific representations alleged fell within the scope of Ms McKibbin’s apparent authority. On the contrary, it is clear that this was precisely what Mance LJ envisaged would be explored at trial since Mance LJ explained at [23] that <span style="font-style:italic">“it will in practice be easier for a judge who has seen the witnesses to form a view as to the likelihood of the words used having been understood to have the meaning or significance, or being relied on in the way, which Primus asserts”</span>. </p>

There must, in short, be reliance by the third party and that reliance by the third party must be reasonable. It is not right only to ask how things would have appeared to a reasonable person in the shoes of the third party since that is the second part of the question which only arises if the third party establishes reliance by him. That this is what the law requires is illustrated by<span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Egyptian International Foreign Trade v Soplex Whole Supplies Ltd (The ‘Raffaella’)</span> [1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 36.<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>In that case,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Egyptian International Foreign Trade Co. had entered into a contract with the first defendants, Soplex, for the purchase of a cargo of cement. Soplex obtained a letter of guarantee from the second defendant, Refson, undertaking to guarantee the payment due. Refson denied liability, contending that the documentary credit manager who had signed the undertaking, a Mr Booth, had no authority to provide any guarantee without obtaining the express consent of a director who would have needed to countersign the document. The issue was whether the undertaking was within the apparent authority of Mr Booth. The Court of Appeal decided that Refson held out Mr Booth as being a manager of the kind who dealt with his client’s affairs generally and who could reasonably be expected to have general authority, and that the evidence was sufficient to have entitled the trial judge to conclude that Mr Booth had been held out by Refson as having apparent authority to sign the undertaking.<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>BrowneWilkinson LJ (as he then was) explained, wholly unexceptionally, at p. 41 that since <span style="font-style:italic">“the doctrine of holding out is a form of estoppel”</span> so “<span style="font-style:italic">the starting point is that the principal must be shown to have made a representation, which the third party could and did reasonably rely on, that the agent had the necessary authority”</span>. It follows, no less obviously, that, if an apparent authority case is to succeed, the representee must be aware of the holding out. That, indeed, is illustrated by the discussion in which Kerr LJ engaged in the same case at pp. 44-45 involving the consideration of a number of hypothetical factual scenarios of holding-out.

It is plain that if the third party does not know of the existence of any principal, there cannot be apparent authority, as when the agent purports to deal as principal. A representation that does not come to the notice of the third party is no representation. The mere fact that the principal enables the agent to commit fraud by putting him in a position where he can do so is not, without more, decisive. The common law has avoided, so far at least, a concept of estoppel by negligence. The mere possession of another’s goods or documents (including those of title) creates no representation of entitlement to deal with them, since there can be any number of reasons why a bailment of them subsists. The doctrine does not apply even if the principal represents that the agent is the owner of goods or of a business where the third party was unaware of the representation, though in many such cases the related doctrine of apparent ownership may apply, or there may be evidence that permits an inference of a grant of actual authority by the undisclosed principal.”  </span></p>

This concerns a submission which was made by Mr Saini QC in opening and maintained in closing, namely that there is no requirement on the part of a representee to show that the agent made the relevant representations within the scope of his apparent authority and that it is sufficient to show in the present case, therefore, merely that at some point in the negotiations the EURIBOR Representations were made even if at the time that they were made RBS was not then acting as the Non-RBS Banks’ agent. As Mr Saini QC put it in his oral closing submissions, if the EURIBOR Representations are to be treated as having been made at an earlier stage when RBS was not acting as an agent, that is sufficient since, although <span style="font-style:italic">“they may start very early on”</span>, they are to be regarded <span style="font-style:italic">“as continuing from the time that RBS are being held out as agent”</span>.

In the present case, by contrast, Marme has disavowed any case that the Non-RBS Banks contracted with Marme through RBS acting as agent. Furthermore, despite the unqualified terms in which the principle is expressed, it is apparent from the commentary in paragraph 8-097 that the position is not quite so clear-cut. That commentary reads as follows:</p>

If the relevant contract was entirely negotiated by the agent, the principal may find it difficult to deny the agent’s apparent authority to make the statements that induced it if he wishes to enforce the contract. In such circumstances, it is unlikely to matter that at the time the misrepresentation was made the agent had not yet been appointed, so long as the representation can be regarded as continuing after the appointment. Obviously, the third party will be in a weaker position where the misrepresenting agent had a lesser role to play in the process.” </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">The commentary, then, continues by referring to certain authorities relied upon by Mr Saini QC (including <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The New Brunswick and Canada Railway and Land Company v Conybeare</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(1862) 9 HLC), as follows: </p>

In New Brunswick Railway v Conybeare, both Lord Westbury and Lord Chelmsford adverted to the possibility of a contract procured by the fraud of an agent being rescindable even though no action for damages would lie against the principal (actual or apparent authority normally being required before tortious liability for an agent’s misstatements arises) There are other dicta, although it is difficult to find a case which has in fact turned on this point. The principle being advocated appears to be an example of the idea that a principal should not be permitted to approbate and reprobate. Although the cases relied upon involve fraud, it is not clear why the principle, if it exists, should be confined to fraud. On the other hand, where the agent had no actual or apparent authority to make the statement, and neither the principal nor any agent whose approval was needed for the making of the contract knew of the misrepresentation, it seems likely that rescission would be permitted only where the principal could adequately be put back in his pre-contractual position</span>.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">First, Mr Saini QC made the point that in cases of apparent authority, as in all cases of agency, it is not necessary that the agent should be performing the role of agent at all times. On the contrary, Mr Saini QC suggested, the agent <span style="font-style:italic">“can be stepping in and out, doing particular tasks, but in other tasks not be an agent”</span>. Mr Saini QC made this submission in the context of his explaining that <span style="font-style:italic">“even if one might be able to say that, for example, negotiating aspects of the Senior Loan, it looks like RBS was not the agent of the other banks, it doesn’t follow from that for the purposes of representations being made relating to the swap transactions, they couldn’t be the agent”</span>. As a general proposition, Mr Saini QC may well be right about this. It does not mean however, that the Court should assume that an agency role is being performed at any given point in time since that risks the type of forced conclusion which was reached at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UBS v KWL</span>. As Lord Briggs and Hamblen LJ indicated in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UBS v KWL</span> at [92], the Court <span style="font-style:italic">“should not impose an agency analysis upon a relationship which may better be analysed in other terms, in particular where the intermediary … has its own interest in the transaction as a principal”</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">There is, in addition, the further point which was made by Mr Howe QC in closing, namely that in this case RBS, the alleged agent, was, on any view, acting as principal and so for its own benefit and in its own right even if it was also acting as the Non-RBS Banks’ agent. The question in the present case is not, therefore, whether an agent was authorised to do a particular thing by the principal for which the agent was purporting to act. The question is, instead, whether a party which is itself acting as a principal is also to be treated in a particular respect as acting as an agent. It follows that, whilst Mr Saini QC’s point needs to be borne in mind, the Court should not assume too readily that RBS was acting as the Non-RBS Banks’ agent as opposed to as principal (and only as principal).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Secondly, as I have mentioned, Marme’s case has undergone a certain amount of change during the course of the proceedings. Whilst some natural evolution or refinement might be expected in the ordinary course, the change in this case has been more than merely that. This is somewhat surprising given that the apparent authority case necessarily entails consideration of the contemporaneous understanding which was held by Marme (in truth, Mr Maud) and not, at least primarily or fundamentally, consideration of communications or matters about which Marme/Mr Maud had no awareness at the time. Despite this, as Mr Howe QC rightly highlighted in closing, Marme’s approach in these proceedings has throughout been to seek to craft a case out of documents which it has received through disclosure instead of focusing on what it alleges was its (or Mr Maud’s) relevant contemporaneous understanding.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">A particular example of this approach given by Mr Howe QC is instructive as it entails an application which was made at an early stage and which saw Marme seeking documents described by Hamblen J in his ruling on the application as <span style="font-style:italic">“communications between RBS and the other Defendants, in respect of (i) RBS’s appointment as joint lead arranger of the Senior Loan syndicate; and (ii) its negotiation of the IRSs”</span>. That application was refused on the basis that, as Hamblen J explained at [51] ([2015] EWHC 173 (Comm)), the apparent authority (and, in fact, the issue concerning<span style="font-style:italic"> “the making of the alleged representation”</span>) would not be <span style="font-style:italic">“affected by the proposed disclosure”</span>. As Mr Howe QC went on to observe, the same approach was adopted even at trial, during which a substantial amount of Marme’s focus was directed at matters about which neither Marme nor Mr Maud would have been aware and so which were unlikely to be supportive of the apparent authority case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Various other preliminary points were raised both by Mr Saini QC and by Mr Howe QC in closing. These need not all be addressed. However, it is worth highlighting two particular matters. The first follows on from the fact, as previously mentioned, that it is no part of Marme’s case that RBS entered into the Swaps as the Non-RBS Banks’ agent. In other words, not only did RBS enter into the RBS Swap as principal, but so did each of the Non-RBS Banks when they entered into their respective Swaps. The significance of this is that, </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">since the conduct relied upon by Marme as giving rise to the alleged EURIBOR Representations amounts to no more than a willingness to enter into a EURIBOR-linked instrument, if any alleged EURIBOR Representations were made, then, as a matter of analysis, they would each have to be regarded as having been made by each of the Banks (not only RBS but also each of the Non-RBS Banks) as regards each of the Swaps. In other words, again as Mr Howe QC submitted, taking the Swap entered into by Bayern as an example, if RBS is to be treated as making the alleged EURIBOR Representations concerning its conduct and knowledge in respect of the RBS Swap, so also should Bayern be treated as making those representations in respect of its Swap and its involvement in EURIBOR manipulation or attempted manipulation. If that is right, then, once again as Mr Howe QC submitted, it is difficult to see why RBS should be treated as making any of the EURIBOR Representations on behalf of the Non-RBS Banks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">The second matter to mention is that, in putting forward Marme’s case, Mr Saini QC drew no distinction between a holding out of RBS by the Non-RBS Banks which is general and broad enough to cover the making of the EURIBOR Representations, on the one hand, and a holding out which is specific in relation to the making of the EURIBOR Representations on the Non-RBS Banks’ behalf, on the other. Instead, Mr Saini QC simply proceeded on the basis that it is sufficient that Marme should demonstrate that RBS was involved in negotiations on the Non-RBS Banks’ behalf. In truth, as Mr Howe QC submitted, in circumstances where it has never been suggested by Marme that there was any specific holding out, unsurprisingly given that it has never been suggested (and nor was it in cross-examination of the Non-RBS Banks’ witnesses) that the making of the EURIBOR Representations ever occurred to the Non-RBS Banks, the second scenario would obviously never have been viable. If the apparent authority case is to succeed, therefore, it is incumbent upon Marme to establish that RBS had some level of general authority which would justify the conclusion that RBS thereby had apparent authority to make the EURIBOR Representations. The difficulty with this, however, besides the fact that Mr Saini QC disavowed such a case, is that it is accepted by Marme that RBS was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> held out as having authority to <span style="font-style:italic">enter into</span> the Swaps on the Non-RBS Banks’ behalf and it is unclear how any other type of authority enjoyed by RBS (even assuming that there was such other authority) would warrant the conclusion which is required if the apparent authority case is to succeed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">This is all the more the case given that it is very hard to see why the <span style="font-style:italic">Non-RBS Banks</span> (as opposed to RBS) should be taken as having held out RBS to make representations on their behalf concerning something about which they themselves had no knowledge, namely <span style="font-style:italic">RBS’s</span> own knowledge of, or involvement in, EURIBOR misconduct. As Mr Howe QC put it in closing, having heard Mr Saini QC explain in closing that the EURIBOR Representations should be treated as having been made by RBS on behalf of the Non-RBS Banks because <span style="font-style:italic">“the central issue or one of the central financial reference rates in the transaction is going to EURIBOR” </span>and the Banks <span style="font-style:italic">“have to take the rough with the smooth”</span> given that the agent (RBS) which they <span style="font-style:italic">“put in to bat for them had some particular knowledge”</span>, this entails <span style="font-style:italic">“a huge and unjustified leap”</span>. In short, even if Marme were able to establish a holding out of RBS by the Non-RBS Banks, I do not consider, in any event, that Marme would be able to establish that the EURIBOR Representations were thereby made by RBS on the Non-RBS Banks’ behalf.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">These are more than matters of mere detail. On the contrary, they have direct significance for the apparent authority case which has been advanced on Marme’s behalf. That case, after all, requires it to be established that there was a relevant holding out. Without this, there can be no apparent authority and so no question of agency being established. Standing back, however, and looking at matters more broadly with the approach adopted in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UBS v KWL</span> in mind, it is significant in the present case that it was common ground that RBS did not have power to bind any of the Non-RBS Banks in contract. In addition, I am clear that the case that RBS owed fiduciary duties to the Non-RBS Banks is unsustainable. Indeed, although Mr Saini QC, Mr Tomson and Mr Rose sought to suggest otherwise, it is to be noted that their primary position, as demonstrated by the earlier discussion concerning <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UBS v KWL</span>, was that the absence of fiduciary duties is not a prerequisite to agency being established. As they acknowledged, in a number of significant respects RBS was acting in its own (not the Non-RBS Banks’) commercial interests in a manner, indeed, which conflicted with the Non-RBS Banks’ interests. An example cited by Mr Howe QC in closing, and addressed later when considering Marme’s execution case, saw RBS seek to secure the role of undertaking sole market execution, and enlisting Marme to assist in achieving this, to the exclusion of the Non-RBS Banks, on Marme’s case RBS’s principals. The suggestion by Mr Saini QC, Mr Tomson and Mr Rose in their written closing submissions that RBS’s conduct is <span style="font-style:italic">“strongly indicative of fiduciary duties”</span> is not a suggestion which I can accept. The present case is far removed from that described by Leggatt LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Al Nehayan</span> at [159]:   </p>

Not even Mr Saini QC, ultimately at least, suggested otherwise. Nor, realistically, could he given that Mr Feenstra, Mr Greenland, Mr Grey and Mr Bates each gave (unchallenged) evidence that, in their experience, a party performing the MLA role does not act on behalf of the other banks but, instead, acts merely as a conduit for the relaying of information.  </p>

The solution to this oddity of the shifting boss is that the arranger is the agent of nobody.

The mandate or permission may be a result of competitive bidding or successful discussions with the borrower. With the borrower’s mandate, the arranger starts assembling the syndicate. This consists of promoting the loan and obtaining commitments from other banks to advance money to the borrower. The initial step is to solicit other banks for indications of interest in the loan. There is no standard procedure for doing this, although it is easiest to send facsimile or email messages to potential participants. The more prudent method, however, is to target those likely to be interested and send them facsimiles or e-mails that are essentially ‘term sheets’. These contain brief but important information about the proposed credit facility, the borrower, and the relevant fees. The banks which express an interest later receive an information memorandum, sometimes also called a placement memorandum. This document discloses wide-ranging information pertinent to the proposed credit, including the borrower's financial condition as well as other economic and political factors that are relevant to the ability to repay the loan. It thus expands on the information previously circulated in the initial facsimile or email. At the same time as the arranger assembles the syndicate, it is also discussing the documents, and in particular negotiates the terms of the loan agreement with the borrower with the intention that there should be a draft agreement for consideration by the participants as soon as they are identified. When the syndicate members have been identified and the agreement is drafted to all parties' satisfaction, the deal is completed-which means that the borrower and the lenders execute the loan agreement. At this point in time, the duties of the arranger end. Further coordination between the lenders and the borrower is done by an agent bank that is specifically chosen for that purpose. It is common practice for the lead arranger to be nominated as the agent bank as well.</span>”</p>

On the other hand, in negotiating the terms of the overall transaction and the documentation that will encapsulate it, the arranger has in mind the interests of the banks (which almost inevitably will include itself as a member of the syndicate), but the arranger will also have made clear to the banks that it does not purport to accept any responsibility towards them in relation to making any credit assessment, the truth or accuracy of any information that has been provided or for the scope or effectiveness of the documentation. One way of analysing the situation would be to say that the arranger was really no-one’s agent and so was acting more in the capacity of an independent go-between. Another approach might be to say that the arranger acts in a limited way as the borrower’s agent but that this fades away once the documentation stage has been reached in the progress of the transaction, after which it is not acting on anyone’s behalf</span>.” </p>

The Non-RBS Banks accept that this included RBS being the primary point of contact between them and Marme, and co-ordination by RBS of the final stages of the negotiation of the Senior Loan documentation (in conjunction with A&amp;O on behalf of the Banks, and BLP on behalf of Marme). Mr Saini QC highlighted in this respect how, for instance, Mr Samhan’s evidence was that Caixa would always go to RBS with any questions (albeit that he would have spoken to Propinvest directly had it been necessary to do that) and how there was very little by way of documentary exchanges between the Non-RBS Banks and Marme. There is, however, an insurmountable difficulty in relation to this as far as Marme is concerned. This is that what Marme relies upon is consistent with, and explained by, RBS’s role as the MLA since that role would have embraced the very activities cited by Mr Saini QC as entailing RBS ‘running the show’. The more so in the present case given that the Senior Loan had already essentially been agreed before July 2008 when RBS became involved – in particular, the fact that there would be hedging, the fact that this would be done through the use of a stepped IRS, the fact that the relevant duration would be 15 years and the fact that there would be a 105% ICR as set out in an information memorandum which had already been prepared by Bayern. </p>

In view of my rejection of Marme’s case focused on RBS’s role more generally, this means that until very shortly before completion all parties should be regarded as having dealt with each other on a principal-to-principal basis. This means, in turn, as Mr Howe QC observed, that it is inherently implausible that a general holding out of ostensible authority on the part of RBS, sufficiently broad in scope to encompass the alleged EURIBOR Representations, would have suddenly arisen at the very last moment.  </p>

That said, as Mr Saini QC pointed out, it is clear that by 10 September 2008, Mr Goodwin had held discussions with the Non-RBS Banks concerning the credit spread since in an email that day at 4.32 pm, sent only to his colleagues at RBS, Mr Goodwin explained that he intended to resist Marme’s calls for a tighter spread and added that he knew what credit spread the Non-RBS Banks were expecting to charge telling his colleagues that he knew for a fact that <span style="font-style:italic">“the other banks are all around the same spread and will be strongly against coming any lower”</span>.

He was a point of contact certainly. He was a conduit certainly. However, it does not follow that he was negotiating on behalf of the Non-RBS Banks. Indeed, if that were what Mr Goodwin was doing, then, it is somewhat curious that, as Mr Howe QC pointed out in oral closing, nowhere in this call or in his subsequent calls with Mr Maud, did Mr Goodwin try to negotiate for a higher credit spread than that which RBS had itself thought was appropriate. On the contrary, as made clear in the last part of the passage quoted above, Mr Goodwin saw his task as going back to the Non-RBS Banks and trying to <span style="font-style:italic">“get them right down”. </span>It is unnecessary to go so far as to decide that Mr Goodwin was acting as agent for Propinvest/Marme, and I do not so decide. I am clear, rather, that he was performing the co-ordination type of role described by Mr Feenstra and by the various textbook writers to which I have referred, collating responses from the Non-RBS Banks. He was, as such, acting, again, as a middleman. If he was doing anything more than that, then, it was to proffer Mr Littlewood advice on how to go about achieving an outcome which would be acceptable to Marme (and Propinvest), as demonstrated by his telling Mr Littlewood <span style="font-style:italic">“the way to play it”</span>. It should also be noted that Mr Littlewood’s position was that, if necessary, Mr Maud would speak directly to the Non-RBS Banks, rather suggesting that it was appreciated by Mr Littlewood (and so Propinvest/Marme) that Mr Goodwin and RBS were not acting on behalf of the Non-RBS Banks in the negotiations concerning credit spread. </p>

It was Mr Saini QC’s submission that by the time that this call ended, and so in advance of then speaking to Mr Maud at 11.05 am, Mr Goodwin had confirmed with each of the Non-RBS Banks that he could agree with Marme a credit spread of at least 13 bps, with RBS taking an additional 2 bps for the execution risk it would take on for executing the hedge in the market. A range, Mr Saini QC submitted, would be presented to Marme as the product of the banks independently pricing the credit spread, but this would be on the understanding that Mr Goodwin was authorised to agree a spread of 13 bps for </p>

I do not agree. As Mr Howe QC observed, the words in brackets would suggest that, far from thinking at the time that in the 11.11 am call Mr Goodwin already had authority from the Non-RBS Banks to agree the credit spread, Mr Maud had no such knowledge. Mr Saini QC, Mr Tomson and Mr Rose went on, however, to highlight how, in answer to a question from me, Mr Maud confirmed that he <span style="font-style:italic">“took it as a bluff when [Mr Goodwin] said he had to go back to the other banks”</span> because he (Mr Maud) <span style="font-style:italic">“thought he didn’t”</span>.

The difficulty with this, however, is that, if Mr Maud really did think <span style="font-style:italic">at the time</span> that Mr Goodwin was bluffing and, in fact, already had such authority, then, it is most curious that Mr Maud did not say this to Mr Goodwin. It would have been a simple thing for Mr Maud to have told Mr Goodwin that, as far as he was concerned, he already had authority from the Non-RBS Banks to agree the credit spread. The fact that he did not do this significantly undermines Marme’s case. The more so, given that Mr Maud had every opportunity to challenge Mr Goodwin given that Mr Goodwin told him on no fewer than three occasions that he needed to obtain approval.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In the third call between Mr Goodwin and Mr Maud, just a few minutes later at 11.16 am, Mr Goodwin told Mr Maud that he could not contact the NonRBS Banks, despite the fact that he almost certainly did not even try to do so. Mr Maud’s response was to say “<span style="font-style:italic">I can’t just go; I got to know if it’s 15</span>”, to which Mr Goodwin replied saying “<span style="font-style:italic">Mate it’s 15</span>” and agreeing to confirm this in an email. It was Mr Saini QC’s submission that this demonstrates that Mr Goodwin did not need to go back to the other banks as he had already agreed the 15 bps with them and was in a position, as their agent, to agree that with Mr Maud/Propinvest. As Mr Howe QC submitted, however, the reality is that nothing had changed since the call just a few minutes earlier. Specifically, Mr Goodwin made it clear that he had not spoken to the other banks. It follows that he had no more authority than he had done before, and that Mr Maud and anybody else in his position could not have thought otherwise. It would not be right, in such circumstances, especially having regard to the approach described in<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> UBS v KWL</span>, simply to assume that Mr Goodwin (and RBS) must have had authority from the Non-RBS Banks. A more likely explanation, as suggested by Mr Howe QC, is that, under intense pressure from Mr Maud and without having spoken to the other banks, Mr Goodwin confirmed to Mr Maud that the credit spread would be 15 bps not because he was in a position to agree this on the Non-RBS Banks’ behalf but because he knew, based on his exchanges with the Non-RBS Banks, that in all probability they would be willing to agree a 15 bps credit spread with Marme and so there would be no difficulty as far as RBS is concerned, but that, if one of the Non-RBS Banks did not, in the event, agree, then, RBS would do what he told Mr Maud in the </p>

Mr Goodwin, then, emailed the Non-RBS Banks at 11.18 am saying that he had “<span style="font-style:italic">nailed confirmation of agreement on the IRS spreads from Propinvest/Marme. All-in spread from mid of 15bp made up of execution 2bp &amp; credit 13bp. Can you please confirm your agreement</span>.” Confirmations of their respective agreements to 15 bps swiftly followed from each of the Non-RBS Banks – although not quite as swiftly as Mr Saini QC suggested since, allowing for time differences, it is apparent that the first of the various confirmations came through about an hour after the 11.16 am call. That this is the case is demonstrated by the fact that Mr Goodwin spoke to Mr Littlewood in a call recorded as being at 12.11 pm, telling him that he had spoken to Mr Maud but that “<span style="font-style:italic">I haven’t got other banks to agree yet</span>”. This is, of course, consistent with the Non-RBS Banks’ case. So, too, is the fact that Mr Littlewood’s response was not to express any surprise at what Mr Goodwin was saying but, on the contrary, merely to say <span style="font-style:italic">“Yeah, well, no no we’ll sort it out”</span>, to which Mr Goodwin replied <span style="font-style:italic">“Nah, I’ll sort them out.

Indeed, as Mr Howe QC pointed out, Mr Maud confirmed in crossexamination more than once that, until shortly before execution, his understanding was that all three MLAs would jointly execute the market risk, and that he and Marme had no difficulty with that.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Fourthly and following on from the last point, Mr Maud plainly understood that sole execution of the market risk was something which RBS could not simply decide to do itself. As he put it when he was shown a document indicating that HSH wanted to be involved on execution, <span style="font-style:italic">“we were reluctant participants in persuading the other banks”</span> that RBS should undertake sole execution. His position and that of Marme was that: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“If RBS could persuade the banks, we were quite happy with that and, as I say, we had no objection; indeed, we probably thought it was preferable to have single execution.  But it wasn't something that we were fixated about.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">It follows that sole execution required the specific approval and agreement of the Non-RBS Banks. It further follows that, as Mr Howe QC put it, far from supporting some general holding out of RBS by the Non-RBS Banks as able to act on their behalf, RBS needed to obtain specific authorisation from the NonRBS Banks to perform the sole execution role. This makes it very difficult to see how it can be suggested on Marme’s behalf that by allowing RBS to do what it did in relation to execution the Non-RBS Banks should be treated as holding RBS out to make the EURIBOR Representations. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Fifthly and similarly following on from this, there is the fundamental point that, as Mr Howe QC submitted, nothing that RBS did on execution was done as agent for the Non-RBS Banks since none of the three steps identified in Mr Maud’s second witness statement entailed any such agency role. Thus, as for the first stage, the execution of the market risk, this was a step which RBS undertook as principal and facing not Marme but the market. As for the second step, entry by RBS into a series of back-to-back swaps with each of the NonRBS Banks by which RBS, in effect, provided those banks with their hedge, this involved exclusively principal-to-principal transactions in which Marme had no role. Similarly, as regards the third step, this entailed each of the Banks entering into the Swaps with Marme, each of which was a bilateral principalto-principal swap.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Sixthly and, perhaps, most importantly of all, Mr Saini QC was quite wrong to suggest, as at least by implication he did, that the execution call had significant (or even <span style="font-style:italic">“very significant”</span>) financial implications for the NonRBS Banks. This is for a straightforward reason: the Non-RBS Banks were insulated from what was determined during the execution call concerning the ‘mid-market’ price because RBS, then, provided them each with a hedge. It is for this reason that they did not need to be in attendance – in contrast to Marme, Santander and RBS which all had direct interests in attending.  </p>

Nor am I persuaded that, even if those terms were implied, Marme has shown that the terms were breached. Nor, in any event, was Marme entitled to bring the RBS Swap to an end on the grounds of repudiatory breach. Furthermore, even if there were such an entitlement, it was an entitlement either which was lost since Marme is to be regarded as having affirmed the RBS Swap or which was not exercised by the time that RBS came to serve its Termination Notice (and so does not avail Marme). It follows, Mr Saini QC having abandoned in closing a further defence that the same conduct relied upon in relation to the repudiatory breach case amounted to an Event of Default under the Swaps, that Marme has no defence to RBS’s declaration claim either.  </p>

If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting.  </span>

The reference to RBS seeking to manipulate, in particular, seems to contemplate something more than actual manipulation or attempted manipulation, yet it is not altogether clear what conduct would be covered. It is similarly not altogether clear what is meant by acting to “<span style="font-style:italic">undermine the integrity of the EURIBOR rate</span>”. These are, of course, matters which I have previously considered in the context of the implied representation case, my conclusion in that context being that what was alleged by Marme was neither clear nor obvious. The same applies at this stage of the analysis when implied terms (as opposed to implied representations) are under consideration. The more so, given that, as Miss John pointed out, the alleged implied term apparently extends to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> conduct intended to influence EURIBOR regardless of whether it actually had that effect and, indeed, even if it did not lead to the making of any false submissions. It appears also to extend to the conduct of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> RBS employee, including somebody, at least on the face of things, who has nothing to do with the EURIBOR-setting process.  </p>

This is because not only is that not the implied term which Marme has alleged but also (and this is, no doubt, why Marme has not alleged it) there is no evidence that such a term has been breached.

It is not a term which is so obvious that it goes without saying. The range of conduct which it seems to cover is not clear; it would seem, indeed, to cover conduct which could have no impact upon Marme’s position under the RBS Swap. I consider that it goes well beyond what would be necessary to give business efficacy or commercial coherence to the RBS Swap. Had the term been framed more narrowly to target conduct that would cause loss to Marme, I might have been more minded to accept that such term would be implied. However, no such term has been put forward by Marme – probably because, had it been, the term would likely resemble the modified version of EURIBOR Implied Term 2 which RBS has accepted but in relation to which Marme would be unable to establish breach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0.00in">Tomson and Mr Rose’s written closing submissions. The first is the Bloomberg ‘chat’ on 16 October 2008 between Mr Moryoussef and Mr Bittar to which I have previously referred when dealing with the question of falsity in the implied representations context. It will be recalled that this starts at 11.03 am, a few minutes after the EURIBOR fixing was published that day, and that Mr Moryoussef asked Mr Bittar “<span style="font-style:italic">how is it that you are the lowest on the panel? Properly screwed</span>”. Mr Bittar replied saying “<span style="font-style:italic">very long in the stub</span>” to which Mr Moryoussef responded: “<span style="font-style:italic">I’m going to break. That makes me want to puke. Why did you put it low, seriously</span>? <span style="font-style:italic">The biggest [?] of my life is there nobody who will clean my stub? I would prefer to get out</span>”. Mr Bittar replied “<span style="font-style:italic">nobody will do anything mate</span>”. Mr Saini QC submitted that this is evidence of Mr Moryoussef and Mr Bittar sharing knowledge of rates being artificially low, with Mr Bittar explaining, in effect, that Deutsche Bank had put the lowest EURIBOR panel submission in <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> Mr Bittar was “<span style="font-style:italic">very long in the stub</span>”. He also submitted that the fact that Mr Moryoussef asked Mr Bittar at all suggests that he was aware that Mr Bittar would know of the reasons for the Deutsche Bank submission and that he had special contact with the submitters. Mr Saini QC submitted that this is evidence that Mr Moryoussef remained involved in Mr Bittar’s efforts to align Deutsche Bank’s submissions with his trading position. As I have previously observed, however, in truth, what the exchange was about is unclear. Even if Mr Saini QC were right to suggest that it shows Mr Moryoussef continuing to be involved in attempted manipulation by Mr Bittar, this does not mean that there would thereby be a breach of the EURIBOR Implied Terms since the exchange does not evidence wrongdoing on <span style="font-style:italic">Mr Moryoussef’s</span> (and so <span style="font-style:italic">RBS’s</span>) part. More specifically, there is nothing in the exchange which shows Mr Moryoussef manipulating the setting of the EURIBOR rate for that day or doing anything else to cause the rate to be anything other than genuine. Indeed, as Miss John pointed out in her oral closing submissions, Marme has advanced no positive case that any tenor of EURIBOR was not, in fact, a genuine estimate, whether for 16 October 2008 or, indeed, at all. What Mr Moryoussef is shown in this exchange to be doing is simply expressing dissatisfaction with the Deutsche Bank submission and asking if anybody will ‘clean his stub’ – something which, in and of itself, is unobjectionable. He was complaining but that hardly amounts to a breach. It would be wrong, in the circumstances, to conclude on the basis of these exchanges, and without more, that Mr Moryoussef was seeking to manipulate EURIBOR or acting to undermine the integrity of the EURIBOR rate (EURIBOR Implied Term 2) or that he was acting dishonestly in relation to the setting of EURIBOR (EURIBOR Implied Term 3).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Secondly, Mr Saini QC invited the Court to draw “<span style="font-style:italic">common sense inferences</span>” concerning Mr Moryoussef’s conduct. Specifically, it was suggested that the Court should draw such inferences based on what Mr Saini QC described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“well-evidenced wrongdoing”</span> by Mr Moryoussef up to and after the making of the Swaps. Mr Saini QC submitted that the Court should assume, in the circumstances, that Mr Moryoussef continued in his unlawful activities concerning EURIBOR manipulation until he left RBS in September 2009 and so after the RBS Swap had been entered into. As Mr Saini QC put it, there is no reason for the Court to infer that <span style="font-style:italic">“a thoroughly dishonest person suddenly saw the light”</span>. Again, however, I cannot agree with Mr Saini QC. Whilst it is obviously the case that Mr Moryoussef did act dishonestly whilst he was employed by Barclays, the evidence as to his conduct after leaving Barclays and joining RBS is of a different hue. This is evidence which I have already considered in some depth. However, in summary, aside from some limited exchanges in September/October 2007 (about a year before the RBS Swap was entered into) which do show Mr Moryoussef continuing to behave as he had done before, there is no evidence of any conduct on his part which would justify a conclusion that the EURIBOR Implied Terms (were they to be found to exist) were breached. In such circumstances, there can be no justification for the inference which Mr Saini QC urged the Court to draw since it would be an inference which would be inconsistent with the positive evidence which was before the Court at trial and which does not support a conclusion that Mr Moryoussef continued at RBS to act as he had done before when employed by Barclays.

RBS’s case, rather, is that, when Mr Moryoussef moved to RBS, he was no longer in a position to continue behaving in the way that he had done at Barclays because he had no influence over the ABN AMRO submitters in the Netherlands. It was for this reason, Miss John submitted, that Mr Moryoussef ceased to do what he had done before, not because he underwent any Damascene-type conversion. I agree with Miss John about this. I see no justification for drawing the inference suggested by Mr Saini QC given the evidence which was before the Court, as a result of the extensive disclosure exercise carried out by RBS, which provides no support for Marme’s case that Mr Moryoussef continued as he had acted at Barclays post-entry into the RBS Swap.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">This leaves the third matter relied upon by Mr Saini QC, namely Mr Moryoussef’s conviction. The submission made, as before, was that the Court should proceed on the basis that Mr Moryoussef has been convicted not only in relation to his activities whilst employed by Barclays but also in relation to his time at RBS and so after the RBS Swap had been entered into. For reasons which I have previously given, however, I cannot accept this submission. It follows from this, and my rejection of Mr Saini QC’s other submissions concerning breach, that breach has not been established in this case – even assuming that the EURIBOR Implied Terms are, in any event, relevant. It follows, further, that there can be no question of there having been any repudiatory breach. As a result, Marme’s case on repudiatory breach cannot succeed. However, even if there were a repudiatory breach, still that case would fail for other reasons. First, consistent with my earlier decision in relation to affirmation, Marme affirmed the contract by paying the amounts due under the RBS Swap in February 2014, having full knowledge of the matters which it alleges amount to RBS’s repudiatory breach. Secondly, even if there was a repudiatory breach which was not affirmed, it is clear that this was a repudiatory breach which Marme never accepted. Specifically, although Mr Saini QC submitted that Marme should be treated as having accepted in September 2014 when Marme issued its Claim Form, I do not agree with him about this since that Claim Form made no reference to any contractual claim at all until it was amended in August 2017 and by that time RBS had already terminated the RBS Swap by serving its Termination Notice on 11 November 2014.  </p>

This is the point that the termination provisions within the ISDA Master Agreement provide a comprehensive code for termination, namely the Event of Default regime, and so it would not have been open to Marme to have sought to bring the RBS Swap to an end by acceptance of any repudiatory breach on RBS’s part.

It is difficult to believe that this would be the parties’ intention, as the Second Method is designed to impose an obligation on the Non-defaulting Party to account for such a gain. This is an obligation that it would not have following a common law termination. If it were able to choose between a contractual and a common law termination, this obligation could easily be circumvented and the objective of the close-out provisions defeated … </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“What remains unclear, however, is whether a common law right to terminate for an anticipatory breach of contract exists alongside the express contractual provisions and, if it does, what remedies follow from the exercise of such a right. Under the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, none of the Events of Default cover anticipatory breach. It is therefore arguable that the innocent party’s common law remedies in this respect are preserved, especially in view of the fact that, in construing a contract ‘one starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law, and clear express words must be used in order to rebut this presumption’. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">On that basis, if a party disables itself from performing, or makes it clear that it intends not to perform, the Agreement in a fundamental respect, the other party would have an immediate right to terminate. At least on a strict reading of the Agreement, the methodology prescribed for calculating the amount due on a contractual termination would then be inapplicable, as it is triggered by the designation or occurrence of an ‘Early Termination Date’, which depends on the existence of an Event Default or a Termination Event. This would mean that, even if the parties had selected the ‘Second Method’ (so that a payment would normally be due to the Defending Party where the Non-defaulting Party makes a gain from a termination), the innocent party would not have to account for any gain it makes, as there is no obligation to do so at common law. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">It cannot, however, be right to say that, while contractual methodology must be used where a party fails to perform its obligations, if that party merely states that is will not perform, a completely different set of remedies applies. It would also be curious if the making of such statement gave rise to an immediate right to terminate while an actual failure to perform requires notice to be given and a grace period to elapse before such a right arises. The better view, therefore, is that a right to terminate for anticipatory breach is not available. Although the Agreement states that, ‘except as and not exclusive of those provided by law, this is probably intended to preserve rights set-off, remedies such as specific performance and similar matters, rather than preserving an additional right to terminate on ground falling outside the express terms of the Agreement. Termination for this Agreement’, so that it is implicitly excluded by the fact that the Agreement contains a detailed code governing the circumstances in which termination is permissible, as well as its consequences.” </span>

The contract gave the claimant the right to terminate it if (amongst other things) the company was in material breach of its payment obligations, and prescribed the termination payment that became due in these circumstances. The claimant therefore served a notice of termination, which was held to be a valid exercise of the express termination rights. Christopher Clarke J went on to say, however, that, if the breach had amounted to a repudiation of the contract, the claimant would also have been able to terminate the contract at common law, in which case damages would be assessed at common law rather than in accordance with the contractual termination provisions. The existence of the express termination rights did not exclude the claimant’s common law remedies, even though the contract provided that the termination consequences prescribed by it represented “the full extent of the parties’ rights and remedies arising out of any termination”. This simply meant that they represented the full extent of the rights and remedies where termination took place pursuant to the express terms of the contract. The fact that the consequences of a common law termination would have been radically different from those prescribed by the contract was not regarded as an obstacle to this conclusion. </span>

In this case, a company entered into a contract for the construction of certain vessels. The contract provided that, if the vessels were not delivered on time or the seller failed to proceed with their construction, the contract could be terminated by the buyer. The buyer would then be entitled to the return of any instalments that had been paid, but not to the liquidated damages provided by the contract for delayed delivery. When the seller failed to commence construction, the purchaser terminated the contract and claimed damages for loss of bargain. The seller argued that existence of the contractual termination provisions was inconsistent with a right to terminate at common law and, in any event, the contract excluded any claim for damages.  </span>

The contractual termination provision, which identified situations that went to the root of the contract, did not oust the common law mechanism but embodied it within the express terms of the contract. In this instance, the contractual right to terminate and the right to terminate for a repudiatory breach were one and the same. The exercise of the right to terminate gave rise to the normal common law remedies since, as a matter of construction, they had not been effectively excluded. It was not credible that the parties had intended the seller’s remedies to be limited to the return of any instalments paid: the liquidated damages exclusion simply made it clear that this provision had no further effect once the contract had been terminated.” </span>

In Lockland Builders Ltd v Rickwood a building contract contained a clause which provided that the contract could be terminated by one of the parties following certain types of breach by the other, but only after an independent architect or surveyor had upheld the complaint and the defaulting party had failed to remedy the defects. This clause was held implicitly to exclude the innocent party’s right to terminate for repudiatory breach, on the facts of the case, because it provided a machinery for the determination of the very type of dispute that arose. The position in relation to a dispute that did not fall within the scope of the clause (such as the builder walking off the site when the works were still substantially incomplete) may have been different.  </span>

Sometimes, as in Lockland Builders v Rickwood, the parties will have intended to give a remedy of a limited nature for breaches of a certain kind; in other cases the terms of the contract may reflect an intention to treat the breach as going to the root of the contract with the usual consequences, however important or unimportant it might otherwise appear to be.’” Firth</span>, then, adds:  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“In BNP Paribas v Wockhardt EU Operations (Swiss) AG, Christopher Clarke J considered these issues in the context of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement. He held that the parties’ obligations to make the prescribed payments and deliveries are conditions of the contract, given that a failure to perform that is not remedied by the end of the first business day after notice of the failure has been given entitles the Non-defaulting Party to terminate the contract. The Events of Default that are triggered by non-performance therefore embody within the express terms of the contract the common law right to terminate for a repudiatory breach based on non-performance. At the same time, the contract implicitly varies the remedies that are available where that right is exercised because, by prescribing the method of calculation of the sum to be paid on a termination, the parties have ‘spelt out the consequences which result from a breach of condition’. This reasoning would apply equally to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, and to breaches of the Agreement that do not involve payment or delivery obligations.  </span>

As was pointed out in the BNP Paribas case, the parties have specified the consequences that follow from such a breach, ‘both as to entitlement to terminate and measure of recovery’. Whereas at common law, the innocent party can terminate on notice, under the ISDA Master Agreement notice of termination can be given only if the Defaulting Party has been notified of the default and the default is continuing after the period prescribed by the Agreement has elapsed. There should therefore be no room for an argument that a failure to perform that goes to the root of the contract entitles the innocent party to terminate at common law immediately, with the normal common law remedies applying in such an event</span>.” </p>

If I am right about this, and it is to be noted that RBS accepts, indeed, that a breach of agreement may amount to an Event of Default under Clause 5(a)(ii), then, in order to terminate, Marme would have to give appropriate contractual notice and allow for the agreed grace period.
