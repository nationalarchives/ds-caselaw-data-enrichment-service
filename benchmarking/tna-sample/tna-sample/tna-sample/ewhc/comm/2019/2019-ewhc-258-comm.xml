They have been prompted by what I might describe, at least on the Company’s case, as a previous state of insurrection within its board of directors.  Although the Company says that the unrest and the uncertainty caused by it were resolved, properly and effectively, by steps taken in the summer of 2018 to remove Mr Tinkler from the board, he maintains that his struggle for a presence on the board is not over.  His counterclaim in these proceedings extends to an order for his reinstatement to it. </p>

More often than not the relevant events are interconnected and, by the summer of 2018, can be regarded as involving thrust and counter-thrust between the rival camps.  I set out the material ones in Section 3(b) below.  Reduced to basics, the essential questions stem from what became a confrontation between the majority on the company’s main board, on the one hand, and, on the other, a dissenting director who has generated support from shareholders which is (or certainly was at the relevant time, as crystallised by the commencement of proceedings) sufficient, by simple majority vote, to influence the composition of the board.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether that support was secured or encouraged by fair means or foul is a matter to be determined by the court as the answer could influence the steps that the majority on the board might properly have taken in response and, perhaps, the nature of the relief the court is prepared to grant even if it concludes their own actions are not beyond reproach.  The fact that Mr Tinkler not only owed duties to the company as a director but also as an employee under his Service Contract with the Company (as represented and spoken for by the majority) also has a significant bearing upon this aspect of the case. </p>

The imminence of the Company’s AGM (at which those shareholders backing the minority director and indeed all shareholders with voting rights might express their views upon the composition of the board) and one particular market announcement made by the Company before that meeting (which focussed upon certain actions of Mr Tinkler) are other very significant facts.   </p>

Against that, the majority say that this ignores what they say was Mr Tinkler’s earlier decision in principle to stand down from the board and that, from his discussions with key shareholders which they understood would be about his orderly departure, he undertook a volte-face that carried with it a plot for a boardroom coup. </p>

Mr Tinkler is one of the Company’s larger shareholders.  He would have been entitled to yet further shares on 22 June 2018 under an employees’ incentive plan but for his recent dismissal from employment referred to below.

That is a new corporate vehicle which was incorporated on 10 May 2017. It is not part of the Group and operates, or at least operated for a while, independently of it.  Stobart Capital was established with the intention that it would generate entrepreneurial ideas and investment opportunities for consideration by the Board. Mr Ian Soanes (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Mr Soanes</span>”) is the other shareholder in Stobart Capital, holding 49.9% to Mr Tinkler’s 51.1%.   The Company holds class C shares in Stobart Capital but these do not carry any voting, income or dividend rights but, through circumscribed rights to convert into A shares (the class held by Mr Tinkler) or class B (those held by Mr Soanes), may provide some economic protection to the Company in the event of Stobart Capital being sold.  </p>

Or, if not on that date, then later, on 7 July 2018, when, in the light of a majority of members having voted at the Company’s AGM the previous day to elect (or, on his case, re-elect) Mr Tinker to the Board, the other four directors purported to remove him from the Board by a request signed by all of them.  The Company says the majority took that valid and effective step in accordance with a provision in its Articles enabling them to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue as to whether or not Mr Tinkler has ceased to be a director is appendant to the question as to whether or not he remains an employee of the Company.  This is highlighted by the fact that it was on the same day in June 2018 as his purported dismissal as an employee, for alleged gross misconduct, that the Committee (by reference to that dismissal and relying upon a provision in his Service Agreement) also first acted to secure his removal as a director. Mr Tinkler argues that the provision relied upon (clause 17.4 under the Agreement, as novated by the Company in 2015) does not apply to his directorship of the Company which is not a “Group Company” within the meaning of the clause.  He also disputes that grounds for his summary dismissal from employment existed.  </p>

The Company’s case that the other directors validly invoked Article 89(5) on 7 July 2018, after the shareholders’ vote at the AGM, rests heavily upon their power having been properly exercised by reference to the matters which, it says, had justified Mr Tinkler’s summary dismissal as an employee on 14 June.  In short, the Company says that the matters which prompted that earlier action had not gone away simply because certain shareholders supported his directorship.  Against that, Mr Tinkler says his grounds of challenge to his dismissal from employment also infect this later purported removal.  In addition, he argues strongly that it was not for the majority on the Board to usurp the will of shareholders expressed only the day before. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Indeed, he maintains that the grounds for impugning the actions of the majority on the Board are strengthened by a further challenged act, namely their decision, shortly before the AGM, to cause shares to be transferred from the Company’s treasury (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Treasury</span>”) to the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (“<span style="font-weight:bold">EBT</span>”).  The result was that the transferred shares could then be voted by the Trustee at the meeting (as opposed to the employees, including Mr Tinker, for whose benefit they would have been destined but for his dismissal).  The Trustee’s vote did not prejudice his own position (he was appointed with majority shareholder support so that the other directors were faced again with the decision to remove him) but its exercise did mean that the incumbent Chairman, Mr Ferguson, was re-elected against the wishes of Mr Tinkler and his supporters.  Mr Tinkler says that the earlier actions of the other directors only serve to show that their decision to transfer shares to the EBT was not made for a proper purpose but was instead made to entrench their own position in the existing dispute of which those actions formed part (Mr Coombs and Mr Wood having by the date of the AGM indicated they would step down if Mr Ferguson was not re-elected).  This in turn is disputed by the majority as they maintain that there was proper justification for the transfer to the EBT (in the form of both immediate and short-term employee share entitlements).  They also say that the Trustee’s vote was a truly independent one.    </p>

Those interests are said to have included an increase to his remuneration (including a retrospective one) and his appointment as CEO or as Executive Chairman.

That chronology begins in late 2017 and the events which, with a heavy dose of hindsight, can be said to have marked the genesis of the present dispute. What would have been the problem of how best to address the detail of the expenses claim has now disappeared; and with its disappearance Mr Tinkler is entitled to observe that the expenses allegation had no proper place within the alleged grounds for his summary dismissal or his removal from office, nor in these proceedings.  In the light of the abandonment of the expenses claim, it can fairly be said that the pursuit of that claim reflected only afterthought by the Company and there is no reason why the court should not endorse Mr Tinkler’s closing submission that “<span style="font-style:italic">the allegations should never have been made and have been almost entirely abandoned by the [majority of the Board] in evidence</span>”. </p>

Ordinarily, it will not attempt to second-guess the actions of a company’s present directorship, acting either unanimously or by an effective majority.  Whether or not the company’s affairs are being conducted in a way that might cause the majority of shareholders to undertake a review of the board’s composition at the next opportunity to do so (including at an EGM requisitioned by a qualifying shareholding) is another matter.  As for any complaint by a minority shareholder for whom such self-help redress is not available, and who (either alone or with allies) is confronted by the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>, the court’s preparedness to grant either interim or final corrective relief will usually be tempered by its respect for the constitutional divide between the company’s executive and its membership, certainly so far as acts by the former in the exercise of matters of commercial judgment are concerned.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The wariness with which the court steps forward in such matters is underpinned by the substance of the duties which each director owes to the Company (and for this Guernsey company they are the well-known fiduciary or common law duties rather than the general duties applied to English companies by sections 170-177 of the Companies Act 2006).  Those are duties owed by them to the Company and not to its shareholders, and certainly not just some of them who may be dissatisfied with their exercise of executive powers conferred by the Articles.  Companies are run by those to whom the members have, for the time being, appointed to the board of directors for that purpose, and not by the courts.  More often than not directors may act by a majority (and in the event of them being equally divided the incumbent Chairman has a casting vote) and that is the position under the Company’s constitution. </p>

Whether he had in fact sufficiently communicated a dissenting view and then attempted to justify it to his fellow directors was, more often than not, itself a matter of dispute but, putting that question to one side, a determination of who was commercially “right” or “wrong” on such matters is not within the remit of the court.  That is so even where it could be shown that Mr Tinkler’s own position (assuming it had previously been made clear as a dissentient one) was later vindicated by the decision ultimately taken by the Board exercising its combined business acumen.  In circumstances where the members of a public company, at least, can be assumed to have appointed each director by reference to their appreciation of his professional or business acumen or entrepreneurial flair, the court is instead interested to know whether the Board and each member of it has acted constitutionally, as opposed to wisely, and done so in accordance with the fiduciary duties addressed below.   </p>

On the other side of the line are the Company’s shareholders and employees who have every interest in the outcome of such decisions but no (or no direct) responsibility for them.  These same facts highlight the potential harm for the company when one member of the collective not only forms an independent view upon the matter, as is his right, but then seeks involve shareholders and employees in matters of corporate strategy that are not within their direct or immediate remit.  </p>

The breaches of fiduciary duty which the Company says were perpetrated by him doing so form (alongside concomitant breaches of his Service Agreement) the alleged unlawful means for the purposes of its claim in conspiracy.

It is clear from the way that the evidence and argument developed at trial that whether or not Mr Tinkler aired his suggested concerns about the management of the Company to his fellow directors, before any discussion about them between himself and certain shareholders, is a key area of dispute and one which is relevant to the analysis of a director’s duty.  If he did not, but instead went straight to shareholders who were loyal to him, then that is likely to inform the decision on Issue 3.  My addition to the terms of Issue 1 is consistent with the inclusion within the Company’s closing submissions of a section addressing the extent to which Mr Tinkler raised any suggested concerns with the Board.  The Company submitted that “<span style="font-style:italic">a director plainly cannot abrogate his duties to the Board as a whole, through a series of ad hoc piecemeal conversations with the Chairman</span>”, particularly when there is no evidence that Mr Ferguson told Mr Tinkler that he would pass on his concerns. </p>

Mr Tinkler gave evidence during 3 days of the trial in what amounted to approximately 2 days’ worth of court sitting.  Clearly, I need to address in some detail below his evidence upon matters where the happening of an event or conversation is disputed or where the seriousness or implications of it is challenged.  By way of general remarks at this stage, I note that some of Mr Tinkler’s answers in the witness box did not sit easily with the terms in which he had expressed himself in the contemporaneous documents.  Further, it is clear that his position over the last year or so, on what I loosely describe as “management issues”, was clearly influenced in large part by what he regarded as a risk to his shareholding in the Company (which at one point he referred to as his family’s inheritance).  He told me that when he stepped down as CEO his shareholding was worth about £90 million but that it was probably worth about £50 million at the time of trial (allowing, I assume, for his sale of some shares in May 2018).  It is also clear that, by the end of 2017, Mr Tinkler had developed a real grumble about what he felt had been his serious under-remuneration – whether in cash or shares – for his time, efforts and results when he had been CEO. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also already introduced Mr Brady.  He is an executive director and the CEO of the Company, having taken over that position from Mr Tinkler in July 2017.  Before joining the Company, Mr Brady had been Chief Operating Officer of easyJet and (not just through that company) he had acquired considerable experience in the aviation sector.  Mr Brady was a member of the Committee established by the majority at the Board meeting, by telephone on 28 May 2018, whose function I address below. He gave evidence on behalf of the Company.   I found him to be a straightforward and impressive witness.  That said, his evidence in relation to the expenses claim was found wanting, as the Company has itself recognised by not pressing the point to judgment, and there were the other aspects on which he did not yield to a suggestion put to him by Mr Taylor QC when he probably should have. The steeliness of his position on such matters no doubt partly reflected the leadership quality and degree of hard-edged business experience that the Company had, I presume, looked for when recruiting him.  Mr Brady had only been in post as CEO for some 9 months before he had to confront what he regarded as the destabilising actions of Mr Tinkler and his attempt to reassert control over the Company and his evidence related to the steps taken by him and others in response.  The general theme of Mr Brady’s evidence upon the events leading up to these proceedings was one which reflected his point that the Company could not be run by two people (in the sense of final decision-makers) and that, necessarily and as must have surely been contemplated when he was recruited, his management style and aims would in all likelihood be different from those of his predecessor. </p>

Mr Butcher gave evidence for Mr Tinkler. It was clear from his evidence that Mr Butcher is a strong supporter of Mr Tinkler and what he has done for the Company over the years and some email exchanges between them during late 2017 and 2018 indicate that Mr Butcher was not wholly content with the approach of the new CEO.  Although I do not think it dented his loyalty to Mr Tinkler, there were points during Mr Butcher’s testimony where I felt he probably recognised that the actions of others within the Company’s management did not, when viewed objectively, provide much cause for grievance.  Mr Butcher was present at and gave evidence upon the meeting on 10 January 2018 about which I make findings below. </p>

His testimony gave me cause to be concerned that he was not being entirely frank in his account of dealings with Mr Tinkler in the period leading up to the AGM, in that certain contemporaneous emails (one of which was from Mr Day and which, he recognised in the witness box, may have “<span style="font-style:italic">overplayed</span>” his independence from Mr Tinkler) indicated a closer involvement in Mr Tinkler’s aims than he was prepared to let on. The Company alleges that Mr Day was part of a conspiracy with Mr Tinkler. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ferguson is a non-executive director and Chairman of the Company.  He was appointed as such in October 2013.  On 9 July 2018, having just been re-elected at the Company’s AGM, it was announced that Mr Ferguson would be stepping down after a suitable replacement had been found.  Mr Ferguson gave evidence that, with the process of recruiting a successor underway, he envisaged stepping down from the Board at the Company’s next AGM in June 2019.  Mr Ferguson gave evidence for the Company.  I found him to be an honest and straightforward witness, though his evidence at certain points did seems a little defensive.  It was clear to me that there was an undercurrent of real frustration on Mr Ferguson’s part over what he regarded as the very serious misconduct of Mr Tinkler, in his capacity as director, by writing to shareholders and employees in connection with boardroom issues, and by what he described as a very difficult time over the last 9 months.  These were events that Mr Ferguson said he very much regretted. His observation that he did not feel that, by the end of May 2018 and before Mr Tinkler took the step of writing to shareholders and employees, the Board had reached a “tipping point” with Mr Tinkler, for whom he clearly had previously had a great deal of respect, struck me as a genuine reflection of his view at the time. Mr Ferguson said that, in the course of the events of 2018, he had tried to be guided by doing the right thing for the Company and its shareholders as a whole.  In relation to the transfer of shares to the EBT and the manner in which he chose to exercise proxy votes at the AGM, he clearly relied upon legal advice which he believed supported his position.  Whether or not good faith on the part of a director and a belief that he is acting in the best interests of the company are by themselves sufficient to put the relevant action beyond the scrutiny of the court is a legal question to be explored further, but it </p>

His evidence upon the developing events of 2018 must be viewed in the light of the point upon which he remained adamant: that it was Mr Tinkler who by early January 2018 was clearly raising the prospect of him (Mr Tinkler) standing down from the Board.      </p>

He had also been unwilling in February 2018 to sign an Article 89(5) resolution for the removal of Mr Tinkler from office.

Mr Hodges gave evidence for Mr Tinkler.  He said it was his reaction to the Company’s announcement through the London Stock Exchange on 29 May 2018 that caused Cenkos to resign as broker the next day.  In the period building up to that event Mr Hodges had greater involvement with Mr Tinkler, and his other backers, than he did with the rest of the Board and he made no secret of the point that by May 2018 he was backing Mr Tinkler’s position, not theirs, so far as choice of Chairman was concerned. As with two of Mr Tinkler’s other allies (Mr Jenkinson and Mr Whawell, whose loyalty was also built upon them having been involved alongside Mr Tinkler in business operations over the years) Mr Hodges’ allegiance seemed to rest upon recognition of Mr Tinkler’s past achievements in building up the value of the Company and confidence in his ongoing entrepreneurial drive.  Whatever implications there might have been for Cenkos in this allegiance – before the AGM Mr Ferguson had indicated the relationship might have to be reviewed and it seems most unlikely, in the light of what has come out at trial, that Cenkos would still be the Company’s broker had it not resigned – I found Mr Hodges’ testimony to be frank and straightforward.

He therefore sits on the Stobart Group Management Board (formerly the “EMB”). Mr Whawell joined ESL in 2004 following its purchase by the company owned by Mr Tinkler and William Stobart. He had worked with Mr Tinkler for several years previously. Mr Whawell is a former CFO of the Company (a position then filled by Mr Laycock) and in that capacity sat on the main Board between March 2008 and July 2016.  He then stepped down from the Board.  Mr Whawell gave evidence for Mr Tinkler of whom he is a strong supporter.  It was clear from the tenor of Mr Whawell’s evidence, and from the terms of the contemporaneous communications between him and Mr Tinkler, that he hankered for the times when Mr Tinkler had more influence within the Company.  On that general level, Mr Whawell’s position upon the events under scrutiny ran up against one incontrovertible fact: that Mr Tinkler had agreed to step down as CEO in favour of Mr Brady with the prospect, if not indeed the intended result, that the latter’s new broom would lead to a markedly different approach to the management of the Company’s business.  What further points may be read into Mr Whawell’s general desire to turn back the clock is a matter for further analysis below.  When it came to answering questions directly pertinent to that allegation he appeared to become uncomfortable.  I recognise that due allowance must be made for the particular stress, even for a non-party, in giving testimony in response to accusatory questions about his own actions.  However, his somewhat reticent answers in this area are to be contrasted with the more effusive ones he gave in relation to what, he felt, had been going wrong with the management of the Company and how it had been wrong for the majority on the Board to cause shares to be transferred to the EBT.  He was coy when it came to considering communications which had involved him and Mr Tinkler but not other members of the Board.  One thing is clear about Mr Whawell’s position so far as those communications are concerned, which is that, unlike each of Messrs Hodges, Day, and Woodford (Mr Jenkinson having now been removed from the list) he is not alleged to have been part of the unlawful means conspiracy with Mr Tinkler.

I should say at once that Mr Woodford would challenge my inclusion of him within the category of main participants in this dispute.  His evidence is that he simply attended a number of meetings (some of them with both Mr Brady and Mr Tinkler present at which a proposal for the acquisition of the Flybe airline was discussed). However, he is alleged by the Company to have been party to a conspiracy with Mr Tinkler. He gave evidence for Mr Tinkler.  It was clear that Mr Woodford’s recollection of events was patchy but, as he observed, his position is such that he receives hundreds of investment proposals from third parties.  I record, as Mr Taylor QC noted at the conclusion of Mr Woodford’s cross-examination, that the allegation that Mr Woodford had been party to an unlawful means conspiracy with Mr Tinkler (and possibly others) was not directly put to Mr Woodford in the witness box.  That is an allegation which Mr Woodford was shocked to read and which he had firmly denied in his witness statement.  My general impression of Mr Woodford, supported by the contemporaneous evidence, is that from the outset he was too wedded to seeing matters from Mr Tinkler’s perspective.  The result was that he failed to get the balanced understanding of matters that he claimed to have. </p>

The perceived advantages for the Company lay in the ability to route more flights through LSA, to raise the value of the airport and “monetise” the Company’s airline business (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Stobart Air</span>”) so that the Company might dispose of a share of it.   </p>

On 15 June 2017, before Mr Brady became CEO, they both flew out to visit Mr Day at his residence in Alicante to discuss whether he would be interested in the Flybe deal (the discussions in fact took place aboard Mr Day’s boat).  Then, on 27 June 2017, Mr Brady and Mr Tinkler met Mr Woodford (and his colleague Mr Lamacraft) on behalf of WIM and Mr Hodges to discuss the same potential investment opportunity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The reason why third party investment was contemplated was because it was an important part of the thinking of Messrs Tinkler and Brady that Stobart Air (into which any acquisition of Flybe would otherwise be wholly absorbed) needed to be taken off the Group’s accounts.  The seasonality of Stobart Air’s business and the sizeable loss predicted for the winter of 2017/18 meant that such de-consolidation held its attractions from the perspective of the Company’s accounts and share price.  That could be achieved by reducing the Company’s holding in Stobart Air to a minority one and doing so would therefore leave it open to private investors to acquire a majority stake in any expanded airline business. </p>

Step 2 on the spreadsheet envisaged that a public company (the “NEX”) would be listed on the independent stock exchange NEX Growth Market.  At that stage, the listed company would acquire Propius (another company within the Group’s air division which owned 3 aeroplanes) and its assets valued at £45m.  Together with further anticipated monies to be raised from investors including the Company and the three original investors (the percentage share for “NW” being 29.39% now there was a public vehicle in which to invest) the market capitalisation of that company would be £115m.  Step 3 on the spreadsheet involved the listed company buying 49% of Stobart Air (by then owned 40/60 by the Company and the three investors) on the basis that it was valued at 40m.  </p>

The return of their investment would still leave them with their combined initial 60% stake in Stobart Air (owning 51% of the business excluding Propius) and – subject to their further injection of cash within Step 2 – a majority shareholding in the NEX (owning the other 49% and all of Propius). </p>

In addition to the brief mention in his witness statement to the work which the consortium would undertake to enhance value by “<span style="font-style:italic">increasing the length of franchises and entering into other commercial contracts</span>”, Mr Tinkler mentioned more generally the “synergies” that would flow from the implementation of his steps.  He gave the example of what, in hindsight, had happened to the value of ESL when he bought the company for less than £1m and <span style="font-style:italic">“[T]hree years later took it to the market and sold it for £138m, making a million pound a week</span>”.  What Mr Tinkler was unable to explain satisfactorily, in relation to his spreadsheet on Project Wright, is why the Company should not have been credited, as seller of the 60% interest at Step 1, with some if perhaps not all of what he was identifying as the foreseeable (or at least hopedfor) increase in value in the immediate future.  The benefits from Mr Tinkler’s “synergies” were in the main longer term ones (including post-Step 3) and appear to have been reflected in the spreadsheet’s forecasted reduction in overheads and increase in management fee.  By the end of his evidence on this aspect, I got the impression that Mr Tinkler’s justification for the immediate (though purely notional) personal gain for himself and the other two investors really rested upon him questioning whether Stobart Air was even worth £20m for the purposes of the price to be paid by them at Step 1.  He did say: “<span style="font-style:italic">This is me trying to get Mr Day on the hook to invest in this investment, alongside Mr Woodford</span>.”  And, of course, Mr Tinkler was able to say with greater conviction that his spreadsheet merely represented a <span style="font-style:italic">proposal</span>, intended to create value both for the Company and the consortium, which the Company was not forced to accept. </p>

Mr Ferguson gleaned this from conversations with Mr Tinkler rather than email communications.  He said Mr Tinkler was quite direct in voicing his complaints.  They were not particularly specific, but instead more general ones about Mr Brady’s management style, though Mr Ferguson did recognise that Mr Tinkler said the need for him to spend more time than previously anticipated on the Company’s operational issues meant that he had limited time for Stobart Capital.

Mr Tinkler says it included a discussion of his remuneration and his role in the Company, as his communications with Messrs Whawell and Butcher on 30 and 31 December 2017 had intimated.  Mr Ferguson agrees that Mr Tinkler raised the question of his remuneration, producing a version of his spreadsheet, and that shares then held by the EBT were mentioned. Mr Ferguson says (but Mr Tinkler disputes) that he asked for a retrospective payment of £30m to bring him on to the level of Ms Palmer-Baunack.  Both are agreed that it was recognised that Mr Tinkler would need to speak to the major shareholders.  But, whereas Mr Tinkler says it was discuss what they wanted from him going forward with the Company and to explain his history rewards and concerns about the direction of the Company, Mr Ferguson says any such discussion with them would be about Mr Tinkler’s personal future and should not extend to any criticism of the Company.   </p>

In the witness box he indicated that what he had in mind was passing on some of the shares transferred to him to other employees who had supported him over the years, including those who might not be directly eligible, having joined since the EBT was established in 2007.  He said “<span style="font-style:italic">when it comes down to it you’d always look after the people underneath you and that’s all I’ve ever done</span>.”  But the terms of Mr Tinkler’s spreadsheet and his representations in January 2018 suggest this was all about a personal reward for him.  Not knowing whether Mr Tinkler had in fact indulged in such largesse in the past, I also pointed out to him the obvious point that what he was now suggesting would seem him bearing the tax burden of any employees benefited through him.  Indicating that this was an additional benefit he was prepared to pass on, Mr Tinkler said “<span style="font-style:italic">I would be paying tax on it anyway</span>.” </p>

In the witness box he was anxious to make it clear that he only made these remarks about management and strategy in response to being asked questions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties are agreed that there was a discussion of proposed share buybacks by the Company in circumstances where its share price had plummeted in recent weeks.  That appears to have been the result of fund managers shorting stocks in which Mr Woodford’s WIM held a significant stake, including the Company’s. There was also a discussion about Mr Tinkler’s concerns in relation to Project Wright and Project Fort and about his conversations with shareholders in relation to management concerns and remuneration.  The topic of remuneration extended to a discussion of the EBT.  Mr Ferguson and Mr Brady say that Mr Tinkler suggested that all the shares then held by the EBT be issued to him (about 3 million shares which were worth around £8m) which was rejected on the spot.  Mr Tinkler said that, having been raised by him at the meeting on 10 January (as an idea of remunerating senior executives including himself) the EBT shares were only touched upon and not pressed in this later meeting.  Although he had no clear recollection, Mr Tinkler thought it might have been Mr Ferguson who made reference at the meeting to the previous month’s request. Mr Hodges’ evidence in relation to the 7 February meeting was that Mr Tinkler mentioned the possibility of using the shares sitting in the EBT to remunerate executives but made no demands. Whether Mr Tinkler might sell at least some of his existing shares in the Company, when the share price improved, was also raised a matter discussed at the meeting. </p>

On 5 February he bought £250,000 worth (at 247.78 pence per share) and on 8 February he bought a further £100,000 worth (at 238.8 pence).  Mr Tinkler’s evidence was that this was an attempt by him to support the Company’s share price.  The Company also proceeded with share buy-backs over the following month in a total sum of about £17.5m.  RNS’s issued by the Company in respect of the transactions in its own shares referred to the purchased shares being held in Treasury to meet the obligations under employee share award schemes. The share price which had been 227 pence at the meeting on 7 February rose to 255 pence by 22 February. </p>

On 5 February, Mr Brady had forwarded to Mr Soanes the email by which Mr Brown had recommended Mr Foster, and referred to Article 89(5), under the rubric “LPPIAOL” (Legal Professional Privilege in Anticipation of Litigation).  Then, on 10 February, Mr Brady emailed Mr Soanes, proposing to “<span style="font-style:italic">agree an outcome for Group and Capital and see if we can do it together</span>”.   </p>

That was in contrast to the objection he took to it having been issued at a Board meeting on 28 May (and the objection to it in the ELT letter referred to below). The published RNS reported that Mr Tinkler would be voting against the re-election of Mr Ferguson and that he held 7.7% of the voting rights and that there were two other shareholders, together holding 25.5%, who would also be voting against him. It stated that all of the other directors standing for re-election (Mr Garbutt was therefore excepted and said not to have participated in the Board’s recent deliberations) confirmed that they had full confidence in Mr Ferguson, as a director and Chairman, and would be recommending a vote in his favour.

However, in his evidence, Mr Whawell said his statement at the meeting had not been prepared.  The gist of what Mr Whawell quoted on 22 June was that the statements made in the May RNS’s had been made to promote self-interest, rather than the interests of the Company or those in the room, and that if he had still been on the Board they would not have been released.   </p>

I fear there will not be much left if the current regime are left for too long …</span>.” and “<span style="font-style:italic">I will resign if you don’t win and return to the business and I am sure there are many others who feel the same</span>.” His loyalty to Mr Tinkler stems from their shared interest in jets and enthusiasm for the Southend Jet Centre. In his witness statement, Mr Grimes said Mr Brady told those assembled at the ELT event that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">untenable for </span></p>

Mr Conlon made a witness statement in these proceedings but no challenge was made to it and he was not cross-examined upon it.  Mr Conlon explained that he had been present at the ELT event, heard Mr Whawell’s statement, during the Q&amp;A session, criticising the way in which the Board was dealing publicly with its dispute with Mr Tinkler.  He had a conversation with Mr Whawell who said he would like to speak to the airline executives about the public announcements at the end of May.  Mr Whawell then telephoned Mr Conlon on 6 June saying there was a letter for the ELT to sign and hoping the airline executives would sign it.  Mr Whawell sent through a draft letter that afternoon.  Mr Conlon said that the Stobart Air team did not want to be party to the letter as it stood and that remained their position, as communicated to Mr Whawell in two or three further telephone conversations, despite them discussing possible changes to it. Mr Conlon said it was on 7 June that Mr Tinkler called him about the ELT letter and the conversations with Mr Whawell.  His evidence was that Mr Tinkler said <span style="font-style:italic">“something like he understood if we were reluctant to show our hand given it was too early to tell which way the cards would fall</span>” and that this was “<span style="font-style:italic">a genuine attempt by Mr Tinkler to reassure me there was no pressure from him if we did not want to be seen to endorse Mr Day.</span>”  Mr Tinkler told Mr Conlon that he would forward Mr Day’s biography and duly did so. </p>

His letter urged shareholders to vote against Mr Ferguson and in favour of Mr Day and concluded by saying “<span style="font-style:italic">a change of Chairman would help to uphold the agreed company strategy, to stabilise operational management and to deliver the best returns for shareholders</span>.” Mr Whawell’s suggestion found reflection in a reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">a critical point in early 2018 when I became aware that Mr Ferguson, without any discussion or consultation with shareholders, was attempting to remove me from the Board</span>.” Mr Tinkler criticised the establishment and composition of the Committee and the process and the contents of the 29 May RNS, noting that it was in his view defamatory.  He referred to his own track record, the fact that the share price of 296 pence when he had ceased to be CEO had since fallen 28% to 214 pence per share.

That strategy is best executed and underpinned by strong corporate governance, which has been sadly lacking of late, and that is why, in my view and that of a number of other significant shareholders, it is in the best interests of the Company that Mr Ferguson should not be re-elected as a director, and that Mr Day should be appointed as a director and should take Mr Ferguson’s place as Chairman of the Company</span>.” </p>

Mr Tinkler’s actions were considered to be “<span style="font-style:italic">a very significant threat to that corporate governance which in turn would be likely to lead to instability of the Company.</span>”  The Committee unanimously resolved, on the basis it was in the best interests of the Company, to summarily terminate Mr Tinkler’s employment and directorship. </p>

The purpose of the transfers from Treasury was questioned (“… <span style="font-style:italic">appears to be to provide additional votes which can be cast in support of the re-election of the current chairman</span> ….”) and the suggestion was made that Jupiter might be in breach of trust in exercising the vote, either way, “<span style="font-style:italic">attaching to any of the shares that you hold</span>”.  That suggestion was made by reference to the potential damage to the EBT’s assets and to the support of over 80% of the ELT (“<span style="font-style:italic">who are all potential beneficiaries of the Trust</span>”) for Mr Day over Mr Ferguson. The solicitors set a deadline of 5pm on 2 July (the next working day) for that confirmation, failing which Mr Tinkler reserved “<span style="font-style:italic">the right to commence legal proceedings against you to prevent you joining in this attempt to manipulate the result</span>” of the resolution to be put to shareholders at the AGM. </p>

Article 4(2) provides that the Company may purchase its own shares and hold the purchased shares as “treasury shares”.  For the purposes of the pre-emption rights conferred by Article 7(2), references to the “issue of equity securities” includes the “sale” of treasury shares (though as the holder of them the Company obviously does not enjoy a right of first refusal).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a potentially important point in the present case.  The Company says, in relation to the Board’s decision to remove Mr Tinkler from office the day after he had been elected at the AGM, that it is clear that directors can take decisions against the wishes of the majority of shareholders.  The Company relies upon what Lord Wilberforce said in <span style="font-style:italic">Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd</span> [1974] AC 821, at 837, about considerations of management being within “the proper sphere of the directors” (I return to this decision below in the context of the proper purposes rule operating so that the directors may not act so as to undermine the existence of such a majority).  It also points to the observation of Greer LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw</span> [1935] 2 K.B. 113, that where management powers are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The manner in which the shareholders can control the exercise of powers vested by the articles in the directors is, the Company says, “by altering their articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove” (per Greer LJ at 134).  However, given the importance placed by Mr Tinkler upon the members’ vote the previous day, it is right to note that Greer LJ went on to say: “They [the shareholders] cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.”</p>

Consistent with the general point that the court will not, speaking hypothetically, step too eagerly into the confines of the boardroom, it is unlikely that the court will doubt the director’s honesty and professed support for the company’s bests interests unless substantial detriment to the company has resulted from his act or omission: see <span style="font-style:italic">Regentcrest Plc (In Liquidation) v Cohen</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>[2001] BCC 494, at [120], per Jonathan Parker J.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie Brothers</span> (1854) 17D (HL) 20 the House of Lords provided the definitive statement that this “rule of universal application” in relation to trustees extended to directors in the light of the fiduciary duties they owe to the company.  In that case the rule was applied so as to invalidate a contract between the company and its supplier of iron railway chairs where Mr Blaikie was both chairman of the company’s board and a member of the supplying firm.  It is clear from the way that the House expressed the rule, so that “no investigation could be allowed as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract”, that it is concerned with avoiding a potential as well as any actual conflict of interests.</p>

In the present case, the Company contends that Mr Tinkler was acting in breach of duty in proposing a transaction, within Project Wright, which it says would have been detrimental to its own interests.  Against that, Mr Tinkler says that this ignores the point that the strictness of the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie </span>is mitigated by the inclusion within the Company’s Articles (at Article 85) of a familiar provision which expressly contemplates that there may be put to the Board or any committee formed by it “a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal” in which a director has a material interest provided that the director discloses his interest to the Board and does not vote upon it.  Even a trustee may be relieved of the consequences of the “no conflict” or “no profit” rules with the fully informed consent of the beneficiaries. Mr Tinkler’s counsel submit that no conflict of interest arises in merely proposing a transaction but only where the Company is deciding whether or not to enter into it.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the inclusion of that provision within the Company’s Articles reinforces the Company’s point that a conflict of interest may exist in the context of a mere proposal.  It is on that basis that Article 85(1) requires, in relation to a proposed contract, that the director shall disclose the nature of his interest to the Board “at the meeting of the Board at which the question of entering into the contract or arrangement is first taken into consideration”.  However, I believe the same provision undermines its further point that the essence of the breach lies in the director effectively shifting his personal fiduciary responsibilities on to the Company.  That is precisely what Article 85 contemplates should happen, with the Company - acting by the Board or relevant committee from whose vote and quorum the self-interested director is to be excluded – then proceeding to consider the proposal.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the authorities cited to me by each side support the unsurprising proposition that the duty to exercise independent judgment is one that operates upon each director in the context of him operating as a member of the board of directors.  This obligation comes with the office of director and does not carry with it some kind of entitlement or licence for an individual director to go off and do his own thing, independently of the board, in relation to matters that fall within the sphere of management of the company’s business.  It is only as a member of the board that the director has been entrusted within information about management matters in the first place. Therefore, any discussion by him of those matters with shareholders should either be in the presence of the rest of the board or with the prior approval of the board.  If the latter, I would think it generally unlikely that the board would delegate to him the task of speaking on such matters only to some shareholders, but not all, or do so without agreeing the terms of his message to them.  As it is difficult to see a case for discriminating between shareholders, the former scenario will usually involve the board presenting its views in a general meeting or in a circular to all shareholders.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The individual director should therefore (as appropriate) raise, debate, reflect upon and then decide upon his own position on such matters at the level of the board, either as part of the majority or as a dissenting voice.  Only by doing so will he facilitate his fellow directors’ compliance with their own duties to exercise an independent judgment and to act in the best interests of the company.  The duty upon each director to exercise an independent judgment exists in order to support <span style="font-style:italic">the board’s</span> management of the company’s business in an efficient and competent manner.  By invoking it to justify what might be, or border upon, freelance activity on his part, a director is likely to hinder rather than contribute to the board’s management of the business. </p>

Article 91 of the Company’s Articles requires decisions to be made by a majority of the Board and does not aspire to unanimity and complete harmony (which might require a constantly changing body of “yes” men according to the business presently under consideration).  But where a dissenting director does feel sufficiently strongly about a proposed course of action to justify his resignation, having sought unsuccessfully to dissuade the majority from pursuing it, then by that action he will have relieved himself of both the obligation and any notion of entitlement which the duty to exercise an independent mind supports.   For so long as a person occupies the office of director, I do not see how the duty to exercise an independent mind can carry with it any entitlement to speak or act as if he were not a member of the board without responsibilities to that collective decision-making body. </p>

Likewise, their definition of the “Board” and “Director” show that the director really has no voice otherwise than as a member of the Board.  I have already mentioned Articles 81 and 91 above in connection with the delegation of the management of the Company’s business to the Board.  Even where the Board forms a committee of only one director (as Article 96 contemplates might be done) that director is still acting on behalf of the Board.  </p>

But, on the assumption that the issue under consideration was considered by the board to be sufficiently important to justify the views of shareholders being sought, the appropriate venue would be a meeting of members where the rival views within the Board could be expressed (and, ideally, where all shareholders will have already have a précis of them in the papers circulated for the meeting).   </p>

The risk of a resulting imbalance of information amongst shareholders, especially if communicated orally at private meetings with only some of them, becomes obvious if that course is adopted.  That risk carries with it a real danger that the director will fall foul of his duty to act in the best interests of <span style="font-style:italic">the company</span> (i.e. for the benefit of its members as a whole) and, at least in terms of the expression of what is in his mind, his duty to <span style="font-style:italic">the company</span> to exercise an independent mind. That would be so even if the director’s views have been properly aired by him at board level, without them making a sufficient impression on his colleagues.  Obviously, something has gone very seriously wrong if the director seeks to short-circuit the board by taking his “issues” over management direct to just some of the shareholders. A director who does that will have forgotten that the company (again, the members as a whole) has delegated management matters to the board of which he forms part.    </p>

As to that, a decision could be said to be substantially motivated by a purpose without it being the primary one, but Lord Wilberforce (using the definite article) clearly referred to “the substantial or primary purpose” on the basis that “substantial” and “primary” were alternative expressions amounting to the same thing, which is a purpose more significant than any other lesser or (as he put it) relatively “insubstantial” one.   The passage from his judgment quoted above shows that the court is required to identify “the substantial purpose for which [the power] was exercised”. </p>

To do so involves the directors failing to respect the different domains of decision-making by the executive and membership as reflected in the company’s constitution (as illustrated, for the purposes of the present case, by Article 76).  If that is shown to have been the substantial purpose behind the exercise of the power, it is not for the court to investigate the suggested merits for the Board having done so in what they consider to have been the best interests of the Company.

However, in my judgment, the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Byng</span> is not really to the point.  That case concerned a challenge to a chairman’s decision to adjourn a general meeting on the ground that there had been no valid meeting (to support his power to adjourn under the articles) and that any implied or inherent power to adjourn the “meeting” had not been properly exercised when he adjourned it to the afternoon, at a time when he knew many members who had been present in the morning would be disenfranchised through not being able to attend in the afternoon or to submit a proxy in time.  I do not see how the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> test to that situation has any bearing upon the task of the court, when applying the proper purposes rule, to conduct an objective assessment of the evidence in order to ascertain the purpose or (in a mixed motive case) the substantial purpose of the directors (and each of them) when exercising their fiduciary power.

In circumstances where it was understood that the investor would then “flip up” his controlling interest in the club for an equivalent controlling interest in the holding company (with no hindrance through the pre-emption provisions on such a non-cash purchase) this was alleged by the petitioners to be unfairly prejudicial to their interests.   For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Hart J made findings to support the conclusion that the issue of shares in the holding company would have been “for the entirely proper purpose of raising capital” and that the only obstacle to the achievement to that proper purpose was the requirement to get rid of the pre-emption rights by special resolution.

Mr Leiper submitted that the observations of Dillion LJ in that case, particularly at 634F, show that the crucial question to be asked, when applying the proper purposes rule, is whether or not the directors are exercising the powers to discriminate between the majority and the minority and, he further submitted, what needs to be asked is “<span style="font-style:italic">whether the purpose was self-interest [and] the majority keeping themselves in control for the sake of being in control” or “as we suggest it was …. to defeat the machinations of a recalcitrant director who had in fact turned his back on the board, his back on governance by the board, in favour of campaigning with the group of what he perceived to be supporting shareholders</span>”.    </p>

Although compliance or non-compliance with either duty will invariably be tested in the light of the actual consequences of any steps taken by the directors, the first will prompt an objective assessment of the motivation (or purpose(s)) behind their action.  The second will involve a review of their own prior, subjective assessment of its likely consequences.  Transgression of the first duty may lead to their act being held to be invalid (I say more about the “may” below) whereas the result of any infringement of the second is likely to mean that it was effective but harmful to the company and that they are potentially accountable for its consequences.  </p>

Their Lordships have not been referred to any reported case directly in point.  The decision of Farwell J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Bodega Co. Ltd.</span> [1904] 1 Ch 276 provides the nearest analogy, but it is only of limited assistance.

In order to give business sense to article 73(d), it is necessary to construe the article strictly in accordance with its terms without any qualification, and to treat the office of director as vacated if the specified event occurs.  If this were not the case, and the expelled director challenged the bona fides of all or any of his co-directors, the management of the company’s business might be at a standstill pending the resolution of the dispute by one means or another, in consequence of the doubt whether the expelled director ought or ought not properly to be treated as a member of the board.” </p>

I refer to it here because it chimes, even if rather faintly, with what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Lee v Chou</span> about the difficulty of a director maintaining a personal claim for reinstatement to the board.  The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bentley-Stevens v Jones </span>reveals the likely futility in granting such relief if that which had been done improperly in connection with his disputed removal could be done once again, properly observing any constitutional or statutory requirements governing the process, second time round.   </p>

Another way of distinguishing that case might be to say that it concerned a matter going to the proper exercise of the ultimate authority of the shareholders rather than a delegated fiduciary power of the directors.  Nevertheless, and as I also remarked in the course of opening submissions, Mr Tinkler’s claim for injunctive relief to prevent those who now constitute the “remainder” of the Board from exercising the Article 89(5) power, indefinitely, does instinctively strike me as a matter which is better left to the Company’s shareholders.  In principle, they can decide, by whatever majority vote is appropriate for the task, either to remove the power from those directors or to remove them, or some of them, from the power.  </p>

As Mr Taylor highlighted, Lord Sumption said (at [15]) the proper purposes rule is not concerned with whether or not the impugned action falls within the scope of power, as a matter of construction of the instrument creating it or perhaps by implication, but it instead focuses upon the propriety of the reasons or motives of those plainly acting within its scope. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Taylor also relied upon the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Criterion Properties v Stratford UK Properties</span> [2004] 1 WLR 1846, [28]-[31], where Lord Scott, recognising the “authority issue” was a matter for trial, discussed the likely difficulty in the way of a party to a contract being able to rely upon the actual or apparent authority of the directors of the counterparty, to commit their company to that contract, if there had been reason to believe they were acting in breach of their duty to the company. Mr Taylor submitted that, although it was plainly within the general power of the board to commit the company to contractual terms, any improper use of that power would mean the directors in fact lacked authority to do so.  Mr Leiper QC responded by saying that this decision has no bearing on the question of whether an act taken through improper use of the power was void or voidable and, if anything, it was supportive of his position.  As he submitted, the reasoning of Lord Scott (at [31]) is based upon the concept of apparent authority in the law of agency and assists his argument.  I agree.  Although Hart J had granted summary judgment against the company’s counterparty on the basis that it was on notice of the improper use of the power to contract, so as to preclude any reliance upon the board’s apparent authority, Lord Scott was speaking (and doing so in deliberately tentative terms given the nature and outcome of the appeal) in more general terms about a “breach of duty” and a “transaction contrary to the commercial interests” of the company. Moreover, even if he did intend to equate such notions with a breach of the proper purposes rule, his contemplation that the company’s counterparty might nevertheless plead ignorance of the breach and rely upon the board’s apparent authority suggests to me that he did not regard the board’s act as <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> invalid.  </p>

When the House of Lords referred to directors acting otherwise than in good faith (and therefore in breach of the first fiduciary duty addressed above) and having no authority to do so, I cannot think they meant that their act was wholly ineffective.  If that was the case, the scope for directors possibly being held to be financially accountable for a breach of that duty would be severely limited.  The implicit recognition that someone not fixed with the knowledge or grounds for believing that the directors were acting in breach of duty might be able to rely upon their apparent authority (when it would be “very difficult” for someone with such knowledge or belief to do so) is a clear indication that their act might well be legally effective in some circumstances.  </p>

In that case, the power which had been exercised on the back of a secret arrangement between appointor and appointee was an equitable one (not capable of passing the legal interest in the property which was still held in reversion but instead a “mandate to the trustees”) and its fraudulent exercise meant the appointment was void, as there was no transfer to be set aside or cancelled.  However, the Court of Appeal held that “an appointment under a common law power, or a power operating under the Statute of Uses by which the legal estate has passed, is voidable only, and a purchaser for value with the legal estate and without notice is not affected by the fraudulent execution of the power.”  The reference to a common law power in this context must be a reference to one by which the person holding the power (or his or its agent for the purpose) can convey the legal estate, in contrast to the fiduciary power – the discretionary dispositive power – which a trustee has under a power of appointment.

The power under Article 89(5) – that article being the first in a section headed “Disqualification and Removal of Directors” when the previous section is headed “Other Powers and Duties of the Board” – is capable of being regarded as relating purely to matters that are internal to the Board, as opposed to being dispositive in nature.  It is a specific power conferred upon the “co-directors” to do something against one of their number. Adopting the language used by Buckley J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hogg v Cramphorn</span>, it is in my view more difficult to think in terms of the Article 89(5) power being exercised in a manner that is ultra vires the directors (i.e. the Board) but intra vires the Company.   </p>

As to that, although Mr Tinkler’s counterclaim in relation to the first decision is for declaratory relief that he has remained a director throughout (his primary case being that it was “void and no effect” with “invalidity” expressed as the alternative) I cannot see why, as a matter of principle, he could not instead have treated the decision as legally effective but relied upon it as part of a claim that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment.

In my judgment, there must be circumstances in which the court, applying equitable principles, would be entitled to refuse to set aside a decision reached through a breach of the rule.

The Company did not take the point that Mr Tinkler lacked standing to pursue it and the court is able to consider the Company’s interests in the context of his challenge to exercise of the Article 89(5) power.  In this litigation, neither side has thought to consider the potential implications of any provision of Guernsey law governing the commencement and pursuit of a derivative claim (as I believe would probably apply, as the law of the Company’s incorporation, over this court’s procedural provisions in CPR 19.9 and Practice Direction 19C). In those circumstances, the fact that the Company, at the direction of the present Board, resists the challenge is clearly a relevant consideration, though Mr Tinkler would argue that it should count for nought when the exercise of the Article 89(5) power, by the then Board, was directly at odds with the will of the majority of the Company’s members expressed at the AGM the previous day. </p>

Having since reflected upon it by a reference to a dim and distant memory, I believe the balance of authority indicates that it is not necessary for a director to plead the relieving provision of what is now, in relation to English companies, section 1174 of the Companies Act 2006 and that the provision may be invoked by reference to the facts established at trial see: <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kirby’s Coaches Ltd</span> [1991] BCLC 414.

Now that the Company has abandoned its expenses claim and the most obvious (though not necessarily only) remaining ground for Mr Tinkler’s “liability” to pay the Company is the conspiracy claim, it is not clear to me that section 522 (or section 1174) has much of a place in these proceedings.  However, that is a question best left for any trial over quantum.  For the purposes of the present trial, I certainly cannot see how it would enable the court to overlook some wrongdoing on his part (even if perpetrated honestly and reasonably) which otherwise stands in the way of him securing relief on his own counterclaim when that is predicated not upon his own liability but liability on the part of the Company.              </p>

Although each is a flexible concept, so far as the types of conduct that may fall within either are concerned, it is clear that they each have in mind misconduct which is either serious or sustained, in the sense of perpetrated wilfully in the face of a prior warning against it, or possibly both.  I put it like that because “gross misconduct” is by its very essence repudiatory in nature.  I can see there might be greater potential for argument as to whether the individual’s conduct has in fact risked himself or his employer being brought into disrepute (though perhaps less so where the employer is a publicly listed company which should be expected to be governed in a manner partly addressed above) but, again, by definition it would need to be quite serious, when viewed objectively, to carry with it the risk of reputational damage.  </p>

The modern expression of the question is to ask whether the employee has abandoned and altogether refused to perform the employment contract.  Any statement by the other party of his willingness to perform the contract will be a relevant matter for consideration but the essential question is whether all the circumstances support the conclusion that the contract breaker has, by conducting himself in a manner that is no longer consistent with continued employment, clearly shown an intention to abandon it and the performance of his obligations under it.   </p>

In other words, to read the “<span style="font-style:italic">hereunder</span>” as not referring exclusively to the 12 months’ notice contemplated by clause 3.1 (and to the period under which the terms of clause 3.4 are most obviously directed) but to a notice of termination given under any provision of the Service Agreement, even if the notice under clause 17.1, from the perspective of the “<span style="font-style:italic">period</span>” contemplated by clause 3.4, might have required Mr Tinkler to leave the Company within a matter of hours.  However, Mr Leiper did not greet my suggestion with much enthusiasm and I think he was probably right not to do so, not least when the clause 17.4 begins with language that draws a distinction between “<span style="font-style:italic">termination</span>” and the exercise or rights under clause 3.4 and also where the Committee’s letter of 14 June 2018 made reference only to clause 17.4 and gave notice of “immediate” termination. </p>

Looking at the introductory words of clause 17.4 the context is one where the parties expressly recognised that, if notice of termination had been given under clause 3.4, the Company could remove Mr Tinkler from his directorship of the Company.  But because clause 17.4 only refers to “<span style="font-style:italic">Group Company</span>”, on a strict literal approach, that could only be done in reliance upon clause 3.4 and its reference to the Company alongside “<span style="font-style:italic">any other company in the Group.</span>”  The fact that clause 17.4 expressly makes reference to clause</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point to note in relation to ambiguity is that clause 17.4 provides that, upon removal from his office in any “Group Company”, Mr Tinkler will transfer to the Company or at its direction “<span style="font-style:italic">any qualifying shares held by him as nominee for the Company</span>”.  On his argument, he would have to do so, following his removal from office of any other Group Company, even though he remained a director of the Company unless and until removed at an EGM or under Article 89(5).  As far as I can see, his Service Agreement does not otherwise appear to address the question of qualifying shares and I have not been taken to any provisions of the Company’s Articles, as they were in 2007 at the date of the Service Agreement, indicating that a director of his then employer, Stobart Holdings Limited, needed to hold a qualifying shareholding in that company.  Article 77 of the Company’s current Articles, adopted on 29 June 2017, states that a director need not be a member of the Company.  Nevertheless, the stipulation in clause 17.4 that Mr Tinkler was obliged to transfer to the Company any qualifying shares held by him as nominee for the Company, following a request to resign, is in my view a further clear indication that the parties contemplated that the resignation request could extend to the Company itself.  So too is the provision in clause 17.4 that any such requested resignation should not prejudice any claim which he might have against “<span style="font-style:italic">the Company or any Group Company</span>” arising out of the termination of his employment.  These further express references to the Company are only consistent with his directorship of the Company being the subject of a resignation request. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Once it is recognised there is ambiguity within clause 17.4 then, in my judgment, business common sense requires it to be given the same scope as clause 3.4.  To conclude otherwise, so that the Company cannot request the resignation of its director whose conduct as employee has been considered worthy of summary dismissal, would confound business common sense.  The notion that, in such circumstances, the Company could only remove him from ancillary directorships that the Company has required him as an employee to take up (see clause 4.2 of the Service Agreement) but not from its own boardroom, so that the expelled employee would still be entitled to attend directors’ meetings (including any that might wish to address any consequential employment claim by him) strikes me as absurd.  As for Mr Tinkler’s other points, I cannot see why his consequential removal from office of director in the employing company should be the preserve of members in general meeting or the directors exercising their power under Article 89(5).  On the contrary, one would expect such removal to be covered by the terms of employment, especially when those terms address his removal from office in companies that do not employ him. </p>

It might be one thing for the court to be persuaded to declare that his employment contract was not validly terminated (with whatever financial consequences in terms of pay in lieu of notice, or accrued share or bonus entitlement, might follow from that) but quite another to say that he therefore continues to have the right to provide continued personal service under that contract which, being bound by the declaration, the Company would be obliged to accept.  From the Company’s perspective, the latter declaration would in substance amount to the grant of specific performance.  That is an entirely different discretionary remedy and the court’s power to grant damages in lieu of that relief is conferred by section 50 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.  The difficulties in the way of obtaining specific performance of a contract involving personal service are well-known to lawyers.  One of the reasons the court is reluctant to order it is because of the future supervision of due performance that would be likely to be required in circumstances where employer and employee have fallen out.   </p>

The point was crucial in that case because the claimant employee’s financial rewards for past performance were very much greater if the period of his employment survived a matter of weeks beyond the employer’s purported dismissal of him. The judgment of Lord Wilson with whom the majority agreed confirmed, at [93], that just as for any other contract, repudiation cannot determine a contract of service while there exists a reason and opportunity for the innocent party to affirm the contract.

She referred to the legal advice received being “inconsistent with an intention to cause harm to Britel”.  I also note that in summarising the intention required for the conspiracy claim, at paragraph [90], Arden LJ (again referring to <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span> which, as she expressly recognised, did not concern the tort of conspiracy) referred to the requisite “intention to cause loss by unlawful means” but did not say there had to be knowledge of such unlawfulness.  To the extent there may be any conceptual difference between the two (I think analysis of the justification defence to the tort of inducing a breach of contract indicates there is one) her emphasis at [146] was not upon a need to establish positive knowledge on the part of the conspirators that what they were doing was wrongful but, instead, that they believed they had a right to act as they did.  It is the latter that Toulson LJ considered should be a “defence” to a claim in unlawful means conspiracy though his reference, in that regard, to paragraph [127] of Arden LJ’s judgment was to a passage dealing not with conspiracy but with the tort of inducing a breach of contract.  For the inducement tort, there is a recognised defence of justification in reliance upon an equal or superior legal right.  In addressing the claim for unlawful means conspiracy (at [146]) Arden LJ spoke in terms of an absence of intention to cause harm and she certainly did not pronounce, in clear terms, the proposition for which Mr Tinkler contends. </p>

And, given that it is paragraph [127] of the judgment of Arden LJ which appears to provide the springboard for their remarks, the overall flavour of this exculpatory factor is one of “justification” as that defence is known in the inducement tort. </p>

As I noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer Birch </span>at [224], the two torts clearly differ as to what may qualify as a relevant “unlawful” act. If Arden LJ and Toulson LJ had in mind (or more in mind) the defendant’s belief of a legal entitlement to act as he did thereby operating to obviate an intention to injure the claimant then I am not sure that the second does necessarily follow, particularly when such intention may be fixed by reference to it being the inevitable flip-side of the defendant’s intended gain. If theirs is the language of “justification”, then another point of distinction between the inducement tort and the tort of unlawful means conspiracy is that the former does not require any intention to cause damage.  For the inducement tort, the defence of justification operates in the absence of any such requisite intention and, in relation to the intention to procure a breach of contract (which is the only intention required to establish liability) it is clearly a defence for the defendant to show that he acted to protect his equal or superior right – i.e. the defence of justification, which is not really a question of intention (nor of mistaken belief of legal entitlement) - or that he honestly, even if mistakenly, believed that the outcome sought by him would not involve a breach of contract: <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span>, at [193] and [202] per Lord Nicholls (his second proposition being relied upon to dismiss the appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Mainstream Properties v Young</span>). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">To go arguably further than what the Lords Justices had in mind in <span style="font-style:italic">Meretz</span>, and add knowledge of unlawfulness to the third element of an unlawful means conspiracy, would also appear to detract from the fundamental point that it is in the fact of the conspiracy (with the requisite intent to injure) that the unlawfulness resides.  It is that fact (conspiracy being reprehensible in any context) that distinguishes this tort from the tort of unlawful interference.  That is the point I sought to make in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer Birch</span> (at [183]-[193] and [234]) when ruling that the defence of justification had no place in a claim based on an unlawful means conspiracy.  Although any such suggested defence of justification would involve analysis of only one particular facet of any wider legal knowledge the alleged conspirators might possess (namely their knowledge or awareness of what is said to be an equal or superior right in at least one of the conspirators that justified their actions) I cannot see that an inquiry into their knowledge of “the law” has any proper place in the context of this tort.  Still less so when, as here, the lawyers in the case might not even agree that application of the relevant legal principles to the alleged conspirators’ actions leads to the conclusion that they were unlawful ones.  To add knowledge of unlawfulness to the requirement of the intention to harm would raise a whole host of unanswered questions such as the standard of knowledge (or suspicion) required, the scope for reliance upon patently unrealistic (and possibly self-serving) legal advice and (if it goes to a “defence” as Lord Justice Toulson contemplated) the legal burden of proof. </p>

Although the relevant unlawfulness might be more obvious and indisputable in other cases, so that even those with no appetite for legal research or legal advice may have difficulty in feigning ignorance of it, it seems a very odd notion to contemplate that legal principles might have to be put to alleged conspirators, during their cross-examination, in order to establish their familiarity with them.  </p>

Rather, the issue was as to the scope of the indemnity that a trustee might justifiably seek in relation to its redemption of bonds where the issuing company had advised the trustee that a notice of early redemption would be invalid and cause substantial losses.  One of the contemplated bases of liability, upon which the trustee relied in seeking a more extensive indemnity from bondholders, was that it might be found to be liable for conspiring with bondholders to cause the company injury by unlawful means.  Lord Scott said that the correct approach was to ask whether it was reasonably arguable that the cause of action might lie.  He noted that the anticipated liability for conspiracy had not been raised at first instance or in the Court of Appeal. </p>

It is true that he did say it was unarguable to suggest that the trustee could be liable in conspiracy notwithstanding its honest belief that the notice of redemption was valid.  That belief was fully justified by the court’s declaration that the trustee could certify that a redemption event had occurred.  That was also the reason why no intention to cause injury could be established.  But his emphasis was upon questioning how there could be said to be an unlawful means at all (given the court’s declaration) and his reasoning against exposure to a conspiracy claim being even arguable was based upon a party “without more” unilaterally serving a legal notice in the belief it is valid only for it later to be established that it was in fact and law invalid.  Lord Scott did not address the point that a conspiracy between more than one person, to cause injury by means later shown to be unlawful, would or arguably might be actionable. </p>

I recognise that what Toulson LJ said was stated clearly when he said “a defendant should not be liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means if he believes that he has a lawful right to do what he is doing.” However, the statement was obiter and was in fact directly addressing what Arden LJ had in fact said (at [127]) about the tort of inducing a breach of contract, not conspiracy.  I assume that it is the first tort that Toulson LJ had in mind when he referred separately to “the tort of conspiracy to induce a breach of contract” and, in that context, went on to mention the defendant’s belief that the outcome sought by him will not involve a breach of contract.  Clearly the defendant must intend a breach of contract to result if he is to be liable for the inducement tort: see <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span> at [8].  Similarly, as I have noted, the inducement tort (being a tort of secondary liability) admits of a justification defence which is also the language of Toulson LJ (“if he believes he has a lawful right to do what he is doing”) when, for the reasons I gave in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer Birch</span>, I do not believe the conspiracy tort does.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>But, most important of all and again echoing <span style="font-style:italic">Belmont Finance</span>, the justification for relieving a defendant from liability for damage by reference to his honest but mistaken view of the law, when all other boxes in respect of the components for liability identified in paragraph 543 above are ticked against him and any ill-founded belief of a legal right to justify the harm does not mean the intention to injure is not present, is not at all obvious to me.

The fact that the conspirator did not know that his actions were unlawful is no defence to liability.  In order for him to be liable, it is enough to show that he had sufficient knowledge of the essential facts, that acts which were unlawful were to be carried out so as to implicate him in liability for them.  The submission for Mr Tinkler is that the sting of an allegation of conspiracy should only attach to those who have a realisation of the impropriety of their behaviour.  In my judgment, when coupled with an intention to injure the claimant, such knowledge of the facts should enable them to have that appreciation regardless of any knowledge or suspicion they may have about the characterisation of them in law. </p>

By that time his own proposal in relation to Project Wright had appeared to be getting nowhere and certainly did not provide an urgent incentive for him to step aside from the Company.

This conversation was of course 3 months later but, although Mr Tinkler had written to Mr Ferguson on 5 May indicating that he would respect the shareholders’ choice (as he saw it) as to which of them should remain on the Board, the other communications from Mr Tinkler that month were really to the effect that it was Mr Ferguson, not himself, who had to go.  In circumstances where Mr Tinkler was, in May 2018, giving no outward indication that he was willing to leave the Company, I was therefore anxious to establish when it was that, as he accepted, he had “offered to resign” in discussions with “shareholders”.  </p>

To put it another way, if it was clear as a matter of documentary record (perhaps even in the shape of formally minuted objections taken by him at Board meetings) that Mr Tinkler had formed and then raised with the Board his dissenting view on matters of corporate significance then one would have expected less time to be spent with witnesses in cross-examination in identifying the dates and subject matter of such expressions of concern.

For example, in relation to what he regarded as the disproportionate amount of time Mr Brady spent in London, away from the Group’s operational centres, he could not remember when the two or three conversations which he says he had with Mr Ferguson on the point took place.  Mr Ferguson had no recollection of Mr Tinkler raising this point.  Nor could Mr Tinkler recall when he challenged the process by which big operational decisions went to the Board (which he said had not gone down well with Mr Ferguson or Mr Brady).  He said it <span style="font-style:italic">“[M]ight have been different discussions with both at different times but I can’t actually put a date on it</span>” and that there may also have been discussion of it at Board meetings, albeit not minuted. </p>

Mr Coombs had addressed the exception in Listing Rule 9.4.2 and was cross-examined upon it.  For the purposes of addressing the present issue it is enough for me to note that, in December 2016, Mr Tinkler was copied into email exchanges between the Company’s then Chief Financial Officer (Mark Adams) and its remuneration consultants, then known as Mercer, which made it clear that, on an interpretation supported by the lawyers Hill Dickinson, the Company proposed to rely upon the exception in the hoped-for recruitment of Mr Brady.  </p>

One can read the hesitation on his part in the written transcript of the video.  He said in evidence: “<span style="font-style:italic">I was trying basically to avoid – I wanted to be very sensitive to the fact it was a highly commercial contract and airlines, especially Ryanair and easyJet, are extremely sensitive about the terms</span>.”  In terms of correcting the answer he gave during the interview, Mr Brady said: “<span style="font-style:italic">I am not sure what there is to do. …… To say it’s commercially sensitive, we could do that, We’ll consider doing that.

In one answer, he said: “<span style="font-style:italic">Again, in my view this was a general standard structure, and Ryanair were obviously also part of that RNS and they were part of producing it because they also don’t want to draw anything to their commercial terms which is why we use that language and that was the basis we were using that language</span>.” </p>

It is true that paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence asserts that Mr Tinkler’s dismissal from employment was in part a response to him raising concerns about the Ryanair contract.  But I have found that the only occasion when he addressed his mind to the deal, 7 June 2018, was not one on which he expressed anything like the type of concern which might support the inference of retaliatory action by the Four Directors.   As to the detail of the Ryanair contact (unexplored in this judgment but by reference to which Mr Brady was taken to task by Mr Taylor QC) these were not matters raised by Mr Tinkler with the Board before he was dismissed. So much is obvious from the language of the said paragraph 16 addressing its terms (again, using the language “<span style="font-style:italic">It now transpires ….</span>”) and from the fact that reliance upon the YouTube video first emerged in Mr Tinkler’s witness statement of 14 October 2018.  I accept the Company’s position that any concerns which Mr Tinkler may have had about the Ryanair contract were not ones which the Four Directors were either aware of, or acted upon at the time of his dismissal. </p>

Broadly, the true position, so far as the court is able to piece it together between the two individuals, is that Mr Tinkler relied heavily on Mr Jenkinson in testing his ideas about enhanced remuneration and stepping down from the Company.  Mr Tinkler’s own evidence confirms that he regarded Mr Jenkinson’s views, as a shareholder, as probably being more influential than any other.   </p>

In hindsight, I can see why the Company applied, unsuccessfully, to bring his involvement within the embrace of its conspiracy allegation.  If these proceedings had not been expedited, and the Company’s application made at an earlier stage than the PTR, I suspect that its case about Mr Whawell’s contribution to the first component of an unlawful means conspiracy (see paragraph 543 above) coupled with invocation of the court’s ability to draw inferences in the light of the evidence at trial, but with no claim for relief being sought against him, might have led to a different outcome on that application.  </p>

But, like Mr Jenkinson, he was and clearly remains “a Tinkler man” (Mr Whawell had worked with Mr Tinkler since 2001) and he seems to have been content to adopt the general line that if Mr Tinkler wished for something then it should be so.  Mr Coombs considered Mr Whawell to have been a “ringleader” and that was no doubt based upon his intervention at the June ELT event in Manchester.  My impression of Mr Whawell is that he was more of a willing stoker of Mr Tinkler’s aims and ambitions and, from a position of personal loyalty built up over many years, was content to support him without much thought, if any, as to what Mr Tinkler might have been saying to the Board, nor whether his influence was becoming a malign one from the Company’s perspective.   </p>

That is a clear indication that Mr Tinkler had not shared with Mr Whawell (as he did with Mr Jenkinson) his earlier idea of stepping down as director.  It seems that, although he had found in Mr Whawell an unconditional supporter for his grievance over the level of past remuneration, as indicated by their exchanges during Christmas 2017, Mr Tinkler had not given him any indication that he had been proposing to leave the Company.  On 27 March 2018, Mr Tinkler had sent Mr Whawell the link to the Business Law Donut website information about shareholder and boardroom disputes, though Mr Whawell told me that he could not remember whether or not he opened it. </p>

As I say, Mr Tinkler does not seem to have told him that in early 2018 he had raised with Mr Ferguson the idea that he would be stepping aside after 10 years’ hard work.  The most Mr Whawell appears to have known, and which he accepted by reference to an email exchange with Mr Tinkler in September 2017 - in which he, Mr Whawell had said <span style="font-style:italic">“Let me know when you’ve had enough.  I’ll walk away with you.”</span>- was that Mr Tinkler was unsettled after stepping down as CEO.   At that time, September 2017, Mr Tinkler’s plans for Project Wright, which formed a significant part of his later idea of leaving the Company, had yet to be formulated.  By 5 May 2018, Mr Whawell was indicating to Mr Tinkler (in response to him having been sent a document about directors’ duties and corporate governance in Guernsey) that the “<span style="font-style:italic">solution </span>[was] <span style="font-style:italic">clear</span>”, though in his evidence Mr Whawell was unable to recall what he may then have had in mind: <span style="font-style:italic">“The solution could have been that the chairman was to be replaced.

Mr Whawell told me that he had not wanted Mr Tinkler involved in it but the chronology of events and the later release of the ELT letter and the Letter to Shareholders within minutes of each other shows that Mr Tinkler’s fingerprints were all over it.  Following discussion with Mr Whawell, he gave Ms Moran a list of email addresses for those who had attended the ELT event <span style="font-style:italic">“for the letter”</span>.  So too, Mr Whawell’s evidence about him putting Mr Tinkler in touch with Mr Conlon, who was unwilling to subscribe to the letter, did not ring true.  I do not accept Mr Whawell’s account that this was simply so that Mr Conlon might find out more about Mr Day.

I should also repeat my general observation that I found Mr Hodges to be a straightforward witness.  In essence, he was unapologetic about his separate communications with Mr Tinkler over matters which involved a divergence between Mr Tinkler and the Board.  Recognising those matters, it nevertheless appears to me that Mr Hodges got too close to Mr Tinkler (in his developing differences with the Board) than he should have.  There is an indication in the documents both that Ms Moran reminded Mr Hodges in mid-May of the need for Cenkos to be independent and that, by the end of that month and before Cenkos took the step of resigning, Mr Ferguson had it in mind to review the Company’s relationship with the brokers.  Cenkos were the independent brokers to the Company but I think Mr Hodges was guilty of a degree of ill-informed partiality towards Mr Tinkler over other members of the Board.   </p>

That said, it is right that I should record that Mr Hodges’ view of the actions of the majority was that <span style="font-style:italic">“having heard their testimony in this court that view hasn’t changed</span>.” </p>

He said that part of the reason for him not recalling was because he did not want to spend too much time thinking about a deal that was not financeable by WIM so long as the investment vehicle was a private one.  I have already addressed Mr Woodford’s testimony in relation to Project Wright in the context of my summary of the relevant events. His evidence shed no light, therefore, as to why Mr Tinkler encouraged Mr Day to think that he, Mr Woodford, liked the deal but would need a listed vehicle to invest or why the Plan showed “NW” (or, perhaps more accurately, WIM) acquiring a relatively modest 2.5% stake, for £0.5m, in the private vehicle rising to an investment of just under 30% in the publicly listed NEX. </p>

Mr Woodford explained that from around May 2018 he had a number of conversations with Mr Hodges, with Mr Hodges updating him about once or twice a fortnight.  Mr Woodford said that these reflected his obvious interest in the developing situation and its potential impact on the share price.  He said he did not have any further conversations with Mr Tinkler until 27 May 2018, following the 25 May RNS, when the telephone call which also included Mr Hodges, Mr Day and Ms Moran took place.  Once it became apparent to Mr Woodford that it was not going to be possible for Mr Tinkler and Mr Ferguson to co-exist on the Board, there was in Mr Woodford’s view <span style="font-style:italic">“really no grey area”</span> in that Mr Tinkler’s achievements in creating value for the Company meant that he would support Mr Tinkler.   </p>

His assistant’s message asking (in generally discouraging terms) whether Mr Ferguson still wanted a meeting, which Mr Woodford might still be able to fit in, had said Mr Woodford was “<span style="font-style:italic">aware of the situation at Stobart</span>” and wanted Mr Ferguson to know that he was “<span style="font-style:italic">very strongly supportive of Andrew Tinkler</span>.” </p>

Mr Woodford’s public announcement on 18 June 2018 that, once he became aware of the Company’s governance issues, he undertook “<span style="font-style:italic">extensive due diligence</span>” to establish the cause of the instability certainly seems questionable in the light of his reaction to the overtures of Messrs Ferguson and Wood.  But, in relation to the Objective, the only things for which Mr Woodford was responsible were writing the letter of 22 May, arranging and participating in the telephone call on 27 May which involved Mr Day, giving Mr Tinkler further encouragement by reacting warmly (“<span style="font-style:italic">Great Letter Andrew</span>”) to the Letter to Shareholders, and causing WIM to vote at the AGM against Mr Ferguson and in favour of Mr Tinkler.   These were all steps that Mr Woodford, representing a significant shareholder in the Company, was entitled to take (and it must be noted that the first and second steps respectively involved Mr Fox, his firm’s general counsel, and Ms Moran of K&amp;L Gates).  In my judgment, these steps cannot properly be categorised as reflecting his personal part in any conspiracy.   </p>

During his evidence Mr Woodford made repeated references to his investment judgment reflecting his view that Mr Tinkler was the value creator who was essential to the Company’s business.  In my judgment, no sensible answer can be given to the rhetorical question raised by Mr Woodford in his witness statement as to why, as the fund manager of a substantial shareholder in the Company, he would act with the intention of harming the Company.

This leads me to conclude that Mr Day was from around mid-May 2018 instead content to play his part in Mr Tinkler’s plan to reassert influence over the direction of the Company by offering himself up as a stalking horse.  He did so without having held any genuine intention of becoming Chairman, or certainly not one that could be said to be the product of consideration by him of the Company’s interests independently from the exhortations of Mr Tinkler.  In putting it like that, I bear in mind that, by late May 2018, Mr Day was also being encouraged to consider the Chairman’s role by Mr Woodford (whose own understanding of the wider picture was impaired as I have explained) but, for the reasons given below, I believe Mr Day had agreed to play his part for Mr Tinkler before Mr Woodford added his weight to the cause. </p>

And in his testimony Mr Day indicated that it was from Mr Herring (not Mr Tinkler as indicated in Mr Day’s witness statement) that he first became aware that there were some difficulties in the Company’s management and it was that which prompted him to ask Mr Tinkler about them.   The answer Mr Day gave about not having read the private and confidential document in relation to Project Park, which Mr Tinkler sent him on 15 May 2018, when his email in response clearly indicated he had - Mr Day said “<span style="font-style:italic">It wasn’t a lie, it was basically being courteous</span>” –inevitably leaves me in doubt as to what to believe on that point.

I believe that, by the time of the telephone call on 27 May, Mr Tinkler had told Mr Day more about his dissatisfaction with the management of the Company than Mr Day was prepared to admit.  His answer that he did not know what Mr Tinkler meant when he said in his email of 18 May 2018 that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">D-Day</span>” for Mr Ferguson was unconvincing.

They will have their own respective thoughts about that but, viewed objectively, my conclusion is that Mr Tinkler had probably not enlightened Mr Day about his grievance over remuneration which was really the spark for Mr Tinkler going on the offensive in pressing for change within the boardroom.  Instead, he appears to have piqued Mr Day’s interest in the Company with discussion about certain aspects of the Company’s business (specifically Duranta) and in relation to Stobart Capital (which had prepared the document on Project Park).  </p>

There is also what I regard to have been Mr Tinkler’s fanciful suggestion in the witness box that his thoughts in January 2018 about a possible transfer of shares from the EBT, as a reward for past performance, were not just about him but other employees as well.  I believe that also shows he is prepared to give others an impression which masks his true intent.   Further, although I have said that Mr Tinkler and Mr Day each underplayed their relationship and alliance, I am not persuaded that it was sufficiently close that Mr Day can be taken to have known what was in Mr Tinkler’s mind, as a closer friend in more regular contact might have known.  On my assessment of the relationships, Mr Day was clearly not as close to Mr Tinkler as each of Mr Jenkinson and Mr Whawell were. </p>

Mr Day would have known this and would have been anxious to assist his friend who no doubt also gave him the impression he was being forced out of the Company.  I have reflected, in particular, upon Mr Day’s discourteous treatment of Mr Ferguson’s requests, in June 2018, for the basic information that would have enabled his name to be put forward for the Chairman’s role. That might be an indication of greater awareness on the part of Mr Day of Mr Tinkler’s plans and ambitions (to which I turn below) but, on balance, I conclude that it reflected a willingness to assist that was motivated by a much vaguer understanding on his part as to what Mr Tinkler was really up to.   </p>

The chronology of events relevant to Mr Day indicates to me that the most obvious candidates for categorisation as unlawful acts (on the part of Mr Tinkler) were not done by agreement with Mr Day but, instead, were committed in the course of getting Mr Day on side in the first place, so that Mr Day would then do his bit in support of Mr Tinkler’s and his contest with the rest of the Board.  I refer to Mr Tinkler’s providing Mr Day with the Project Park document on 15 May and with the Duranta budget on 17 May 2018.   </p>

That might be enough to implicate Mr Day with sufficient awareness that, with his support, Mr Tinkler was continuing to act in breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty and in a manner that the court would categorise as unlawful. The Company invites me to infer that the plan was all about getting Mr Tinkler into a position where his expectations of proper reward, as he would have it, for the Company’s past performance might then be satisfied.  </p>

The lack of clarity as to how that control would manifest itself beyond securing Mr Tinkler’s place on the Board and getting the nonexecutive Mr Ferguson off it  - Mr Jenkinson’s New Year message of <span style="font-style:italic">“let’s pull it all back”</span> comes to mind – is not clear to me even now.   </p>

At times, I have had to remind myself that I am concerned with the affairs of a substantial listed company rather than a small private one, or a partnership, where behind-the-scenes agitation of the type Mr Tinkler was prepared to in engage in could have been most effective in disposing of tension within its management.   </p>

Mr Ferguson said in evidence that his own view was that Mr Tinkler saw the ousting of the Chairman as “<span style="font-style:italic">part of a process</span>” to take control of the whole Board and Mr Brady referred to having “<span style="font-style:italic">effectively a board coup</span>.”  Mr Grimes, giving evidence for Mr Tinkler, said that he perceived the AGM as Mr Tinkler “<span style="font-style:italic">taking back control of the Company</span>.” </p>

That email and the exchanges between them (and Mr Butcher) between Christmas and the New Year indicate that Mr Tinkler was happy to encourage such complaints about Mr Brady’s management style, which echoed in part what he had said to Mr Ferguson at the end of the year about there being “<span style="font-style:italic">too much paperwork and too much process</span>” under Mr Brady’s direction.   Given that Mr Tinkler had led Mr Brady to think he was doing a good job during their conversation on 22 February 2018 (and that the complaint he then voiced was directed to the lack of a proper executive management board) he was being disingenuous in his discussions with Mr Brady. </p>

I also suspect that, consistent with the nature of the corporate information Mr Tinkler shared with Mr Day in May 2018 (Duranta being within Mr Whawell’s domain of the energy business) that Mr Tinkler wanted to get to a position where the management spheres of influence matched what Mr Butcher had said in his mail of 27 December 2017 should be the areas of executive responsibility.  Mr Day’s email to Mr Tinkler of 18 May 2018, written in its familiar terms mentioned above, indicates that he had offered his views upon certain aspects of the Company’s energy business during the site visit two days earlier: “<span style="font-style:italic">All the points I have discussed with you about what no to do they are doing.</span>” But, again, this is really nothing more than surmise on my part as to where Mr Tinkler saw his plans ending up. </p>

However, it is not at all clear to me that Remco could have re-visited his reward for past years, within the scope of its discretion, and, even if I am wrong about that and Remco had felt bold enough to do so without putting it to shareholders, I do not see how Mr Tinkler’s aims can sensibly be said to have involved him somehow commandeering the Remco process.  For example, the draft Report referred to 2013 Regulations in the context of the revised Remuneration Policy being presented for approval at the 2017 AGM and, in my view, it is nonsensical to think that the Company’s checks and balances on such matters would have gone out of the window.   </p>

As I have just said above in relation to intention, I believe Mr Tinkler thought he was acting in the best interests of the Company, at least when viewed in the longer-term.

I have addressed the salient aspects of it in the narrative within Section 3(b) above.  I can deal with it quite shortly because Mr Tinkler’s proposal (embodied in his “Investor Working Step Plan”) did not in my judgment constitute or evidence any breach of fiduciary duty on his part.  It was only that, a proposal, and the potential for Mr Tinkler to derive personal benefit from its implementation was reasonably plain for all to see when he presented it to the meeting on 8 November 2017.  By the end of that month Mr Soanes had highlighted the potential for conflict (with perhaps £12m proposed to be gained by the private consortium at the Company’s expense).  Mr Brady’s response was essentially to treat Mr Tinkler’s proposal as the weaker runner in a race to the finish against his own proposal backed by Cyrus Capital.  Of course, neither got to the end.

Had Mr Tinkler’s proposal for Project Wright borne fruit then all the indications are that he would have resigned from the Board before the transaction was decided upon, with the Board being fully aware of the circumstances of him doing so.  In that same section I also indicated that, although his proposal led nowhere, the making of it might be relevant to a wider allegation that he breached his duty to act in good faith and in the Company’s best interests.  Having considered his proposal in the context of the evidence generally, I am satisfied that the making of it has no bearing upon the other breaches of duty alleged against Mr Tinkler.  As my summary of key events in Section 3 above indicates, Mr Tinkler’s proposal within Project Wright provides nothing more than context for what came later.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the only real significance of Mr Tinkler’s proposal in relation to Project Wright is that, in particular, it provides the context for the clear indications that he gave in late 2017 and early 2018 that he intended to step down from the Company.  Mr Tinkler would have known that the only basis on which he could implement his proposal, and benefit under it with the informed agreement of the Company, was one where he had stood down from the Board and was no longer under his fiduciary obligations to the Company.  It must be remembered that, when promoting Project Wright, Mr Tinkler (together with Mr Soanes) was really doing so on behalf of Stobart Capital.  Until things turned sour between him and Mr Soanes, part of Mr Tinkler’s thinking was that he might concentrate on Stobart Capital.  The fact that Mr Soanes thought that the nature of Mr Tinkler’s proposal to the Company caused regulatory issues for Stobart Capital is not a matter I need to explore further.  </p>

Further, although it can fairly be said to have been a disreputable piece of writing, I do not believe that it can be said to have triggered the ground identified in clause 17.1(c) either. Although not sent from a private email address, it was a personal email sent by Mr Tinkler to his friend Mr Jenkinson.  Ms Palmer-Baunack and Mr Jenkinson were not fellow employees.  In the ordinary way of things, and the continuation of Mr Tinkler’s employment, it would probably never have come to light. As his counsel correctly point out, it was not copied to anyone else, or forwarded on, and Mr Jenkinson was not offended by it.   </p>

That clause is concerned with conduct which is repudiatory in nature, as I have explained in Section 4(b)(i) above, and the same applies to the “context-specific” analysis of the implied duty of trust and confidence.  As for fiduciary duties, I do not regard any of those relied upon as having any relevance and the Company did not suggest otherwise. </p>

He used the opportunity which Mr Ferguson had given to him, to discuss the timing of his departure from the Company with major shareholders, to instead do something that Mr Ferguson would not have countenanced and that was to foment shareholder dissatisfaction over the direction of the Company. I accept Mr Brady’s evidence that this is what he discovered when he spoke to each of Mr Barnett and Mr Dobell on 1 February and Mr Williams on 2 February 2018.  Mr Tinkler had not raised with any of them the idea of him resigning and they were surprised to hear of it from Mr Brady.  Instead, Mr Tinkler had expressed concerns about the Chairman, the Board and the strategy of the Company. </p>

Mr Tinkler’s explanation in the witness box that he was only responding to the shareholders’ questions which, once asked, he could not refuse to answer rang entirely hollow.  In any event, even if I had been persuaded that it was the shareholders who somehow changed the agenda for the discussions from that of his intended resignation, Mr Tinkler should have curtailed the discussion rather than taking it upon himself to offer his own dissenting views.  I also accept the evidence of Mr Ferguson and Mr Brady, supported by Mr Hodges, that Mr Tinkler recognised his actions had been unacceptable at their meeting (with Mr Hodges present) on 7 February 2018.  </p>

When, shortly after midnight on the morning of 9 June, Mr Tinkler sent the Board a copy of the Letter to Shareholders his email said that he had sent it “today” to Company’s major shareholders.  He said “<span style="font-style:italic">it is my intention to send it to all shareholders once I have received a copy of the company’s register of members.  I will leave it to the company secretary to decide whether she should arrange for the despatch of copies to all shareholders immediately, so as to ensure equality of information to shareholders.</span>”  It is quite likely that the terms of that email reflected the benefit of the advice which Mr Tinkler was clearly receiving from K&amp;L Gates at the time.  Whether or not that is so, I note that this appears to be the first occasion when Mr Tinkler recognised the need for all shareholders, big or small and whether allied to his cause or not, to be equally well informed of any matters considered by him to be properly put within their domain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the selective communications which Mr Tinkler had with chosen shareholders prior to that date were all about himself and his personal aim of getting rid of Mr Ferguson.  That aim became transparent after the heated meeting on 23 April 2018 but it is clear from Mr Day’s evidence and from what Mr Williams told Mr Ferguson on 9 February 2018 that Mr Tinkler was thinking about a new Chairman before that date.  His reason for doing so is because he was prepared to attempt to convince others (Mr Woodford and Mr Whawell and probably Mr Day too), and possibly even himself, that Mr Ferguson had been trying to get rid of him when in fact all Mr Ferguson had done was to take at face value Mr Tinkler’s indication that he was stepping aside.   </p>

In order to do that, he says, it was obviously necessary to exchange relevant financial information. He argues that he was doing his job, not breaching the Company’s confidence. </p>

That campaign de-stabilised the Company and this particular step within it damaged the Company’s relationship with its joint venture partner Perscitus.  In those circumstances, and even if he is able to assert he acted in good faith despite being in breach of his Service Agreement,  Mr Tinkler cannot be heard to say that he was acting in the Company’s best interests.  It was an abuse of his stewardship of the Company’s property, committed behind the back of the Board.  Nor did Mr Tinkler disclose to the Board that he had done so. </p>

That was the message, following on from their private chat after the meeting on 1 May 2018 when Mr Tinkler informed Mr Ferguson of his view that they could not work together, in which he referred to his discovery of the contemplated use of the Article 89(5) procedure in February 2018.  True it is that Mr Tinkler made that discovery by chance when going through Mr Soanes’ Stobart Capital email account but it plainly did suit his purposes to recognise why it might be the case that that most of his fellow directors were then considering that step.  Having been talked out of his expressed idea of resigning (most likely by Mr Jenkinson) he then spoke to shareholders at the end of January 2018 in terms which he recognised at the meeting on 7 February were inappropriate (once Mr Brady had made his independent discovery of what he had been saying to them).  None of that found reflection in the terms of the text message of 5 May, nor in the Letter to Shareholders.  Both portray Mr Tinkler as the victim of some boardroom wrangle over the direction of the Company when the truth is that he was sniping at the Board from the outside. </p>

He was clearly whipped up by Mr Whawell into adding that particular professed concern to the terms of the letter.

That campaign had little if anything to do with genuine concerns over corporate strategy and direction.  Such concerns had not been adequately raised by him (as I have found under Issue 1) and, in any event, any resulting grievance that they had somehow not been addressed would have been one better aimed at Mr Brady, as CEO.   </p>

However, as the Company pointed out, it is likely that most employees would have been unaware of the RNS.  Mr Grimes had seen it but that is because Mr Tinkler had sent it to him.  Mr Grimes said that Mr Tinkler had telephoned him to make him aware that he “<span style="font-style:italic">very much wanted to change the Chairman</span>” and also that the general “<span style="font-style:italic">tittle-tattle</span>” about a rift within the Board had unsettled Mr Grimes.  As to Mr Brady’s message to employees, which I have quoted in Section 3 above, this was neutral in its terms and did not impliedly claim to reflect the right side of an argument on some significant disagreement on one or more points fully within the Board.

My reasons for doing so are set out under Issue 2 above in addressing the role of Mr Whawell in the context of the conspiracy allegation (on which, I repeat, the Company was not permitted to amend its case to allege he was a conspirator).  As I have already said by reference to those reasons, Mr Tinkler’s fingerprints were all over the ELT letter.

He did so without even properly airing with any of his co-directors such concerns as he may have had, beyond that of his personal under-remuneration, and which might have been germane to the question of whether or not Mr Ferguson should remain in office.  Once he had been talked out of his earlier idea of stepping down from the Board, most obviously by Mr Jenkinson, he appears to have been more willing to discuss any strategic plans he might have had for the Company with one or more of Messrs Jenkinson, Whawell, Woodford and Day, rather than his co-directors on the Board.   </p>

I also repeat that, given that his challenge to Mr Ferguson can therefore be said to have come largely out of the blue, I regard it as no coincidence that Mr Tinkler had identified Mr Ferguson in the AP-B email as the person who (alongside Ms PalmerBaunack when she had been at the Company) had tried to “<span style="font-style:italic">shaft</span>” the senior executives by introducing the current LTIP scheme.  </p>

Unlike Issue 10 (which focuses only upon the duty to act for proper purposes in relation to the implementation of Article 89(5) on 7 July 2018) the present issue is framed in terms wide enough to contemplate that it might have been a breach of one of the other fiduciary duties addressed above.

Although they signed the Article 89(5) notice on 26 February, Mr Garbutt would not do so.  It do not believe that the proper purposes rule (which is essentially concerned with acts that are effective but tainted by a primary improper purpose that may lead to them being set aside) can have any sensible application to this “attempt”.  The notice was not complete, in terms of the necessary signatories, and neither was it served.  Had Mr Garbutt signed it, then not only would his willingness to sign be of some significance to the allegation of improper purposes on the part of the Four Directors but I think it is also a fair inference to conclude that the directors would have paused to consider further whether or not to serve Mr Tinkler with it.  The evidence of the Four Directors was that the “tipping point” had not by then been reached. The idea of serving such a notice had been raised by Mr Brown who had put them in touch with Mr Foster, so some final legal advice on the decision to serve it would have been likely.   </p>

I have no reason to doubt that, when he did so, each had formed a genuine belief that it was in the best interests of the Company that Mr Tinkler should be removed.  Although further serious breaches of duty on his part were to emerge after 26 February 2018, as I have found under Issue 3 above, they had by that stage discovered that he had been briefing shareholders against the Board.  That was enough to justify their belief and there is no basis for the court to conclude that no reasonable director could have come to the conclusion they had.  Nor is there any evidence to suggest that any of them acted out of conflict of interest (by that stage Mr Tinkler had not sought to make it a clear choice between himself and Mr Ferguson though they had discovered from Mr Williams on 8 February that Mr Tinkler had told him that he wanted Mr Ferguson removed) or that any of them failed to exercise an independent mind on the point. </p>

Having had to consider those at very great length for the purposes of this judgment I can see that it would not have been a straightforward task to summarise them in a circular.  But such a summary could certainly have set out the majority’s view as to the manner in which Mr Tinkler had gone about securing the shareholder support mentioned in the 25 May RNS and possibly also mentioned his recent claims for additional remuneration, his disappointment on which really seems to have marked the start of him confiding more in his loyal shareholders than in the Board (one of the bullet point “challenges” in the 29 May RNS referred to his proposal for the <span style="font-style:italic">ex gratia</span> distribution of shares from the EBT).  The shape of a document that might have been appropriate in the circumstances can be envisaged by contemplating what the Board might wished to have said to counter the impression created by Mr Tinkler’s later Letter to Shareholders (that his position stemmed from genuine and considered disagreement within the Board on matters of corporate direction). </p>

For example, the last bullet referred to his proposal within Project Wright (“<span style="font-style:italic">a proposed related party transaction associated with the recent aborted airline transaction</span>”) which, I have decided, involved no wrongdoing on his part.  And the first bullet (“<span style="font-style:italic">settlement of contractual issues arising from a previous related party transaction when Mr Tinkler was CEO</span>”) related to a contractual claim brought by the Company against Mr Tinkler in respect of a tax indemnity.  The Company had brought that claim in 2017 and that it did not relate to something “<span style="font-style:italic">in the recent past</span>” is illustrated by the fact that, on 16 November 2018 and while the trial before me was proceeding, Mr Justice Phillips struck it out, I understand, on limitation grounds (although I gather that limited permission to appeal has since been granted).  All that said, Mr Tinkler accepted in evidence that other parts of the RNS (addressing the “<span style="font-style:italic">Management’s achievements</span>”) could fairly be read as reflecting favourably upon his time as CEO. </p>

Where it applies, that duty requires the provision of sufficient information but cannot really be sensibly applied so as to prohibit the provision of too much of it.  If too much information is provided by the directors, to the detriment of the Company, then (leaving to one side the law of defamation for any actionable untruths within it) that is a matter best addressed by reference to what Arden LJ described in <span style="font-style:italic">Item Software  v Fassihi </span>as the strong and flexible duty of loyalty. </p>

The first is that I find that each of them thought that it was in the best interests of the Company to publish the RNS.  I have already referred to Mr Coombs’ view about the need for the 29 May RNS in addressing, on the question of an intention to injure within Issue 2, what he perceived to be Mr Tinkler’s aims.  All four of them considered that his challenge to Mr Ferguson (with its repercussions in respect of Messrs Wood and Coombs) was destabilising the Company.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason is that the terms of the RNS, though inappropriate in the respects mentioned above, do not justify the conclusion (by way of an objective check upon their subjective thoughts) that no reasonable director would have agreed to it.  This second reason is reinforced by the advice the Four Directors received at the time and by the absence of any evidence that it damaged the Company.  In addition to saying it damaged him personally, Mr Tinkler argued, by reference to Mr Grimes’ evidence and the “<span style="font-style:italic">surprise and regret</span>” at the RNS expressed in a letter from three executives in the Aviation Division, that it did damage the Company.  Mr Grimes referred to unsettlement amongst employees and questions from brokers and customers of the Jet Centre. Mr Tinkler also points to the evidence of Mr Whawell in relation to the general disquiet expressed at the ELT event in Manchester on 5 and 6 June 2018.   </p>

That earlier RNS would have told anyone who read it about the potential for upheaval within the Board and that Mr Tinkler was opposed to Mr Ferguson. It must be remembered that the gravamen of Mr Tinkler’s challenge to the 29 May RNS is that it was an unnecessary attack upon, and damaging to him personally. </p>

The Company is right to say that Mr Day’s failure to engage constructively with Mr Ferguson’s chasing messages (his email of 25 June had said that the papers for the AGM had already been sent to the printers and it is in those that the proposed resolution would have been the subject of any recommendation by the Board) meant that his candidacy could not even be voted upon at the AGM under </p>

The first concerns the possible wrongfulness of the Committee’s dismissal of Mr Tinkler from his employment on 14 June 2018.  This issue is raised full square within Issues 5 and 6, the latter raising the question of whether or not it involved a breach of duty by the Four Directors acting for an improper purpose or in disregard of a conflict of interest.  However, as with the question over their use of Article 89(5) on 7 July, the present question is framed in more general terms which might admit of a finding that they acted in breach of some other fiduciary duty. </p>

It was the Committee who dismissed him and although a complaint is made about his presence at its meetings (see Issue 6 below) Mr Ferguson was not a member of it.  In my judgment, there is no basis for concluding that the members of the Committee, Messrs Wood, Coombs and Brady, acted in breach of that duty.  I have already concluded the Four Directors were not (or would not) have been in breach of that duty when contemplating the use of Article 89(5) in February 2018.  By 14 June (and therefore after the 29 May RNS in relation to which I have reached the same conclusion by reference to their beliefs as to the Company’s best interests) they were confronting the fact and implications of Mr Tinkler’s Letter to Shareholders and Communication to Employees.   </p>

He says the Four Directors decided to transfer them to the EBT only for the purpose of securing a favourable vote from Jupiter.  He points to the fact that shares which are “warehoused” in Treasury, pending transfer to those entitled, do not carry any dividend rights against the Company (as well as being temporarily disenfranchised) whereas dividends become payable once the shares are in the custody of the trustee.  The Rules for the 2014 LTIP (the 2015 Plan was not in evidence but was presumed to be the same) permitted share transfers to be made to award holders either direct from Treasury or from the EBT, and Mr Tinkler. </p>

In relation to the shares vesting on 22 June 2018, separate transfers to the employees from the EBT and Treasury would, as Mr Coombs said, have required two separate processes and complication or duplication over the tax calculations and any “stop levels” stipulated by the employees in relation to sale price.

(It is not necessary to dwell upon the concept of dilution, and the parties did not do so, but I understand it to have been a reference to a percentage cap - incorporated into the LTIP rules by reference to Insurance Association guidance - upon the issuance of new shares.  In circumstances where the acquisition of shares from Treasury was treated by the LTIP rules as an “issue” of new shares for these purposes, the risk that substantial LTIP share entitlements might cause the cap to come into play was one that the consultants had in mind).   </p>

By an email to Mr Foster on 18 June, Ms Brace pointed out that the advice was based on the dilution position for all outstanding share awards and not just the immediate vesting required for the 2015 awards but went on to say “<span style="font-style:italic">Would appreciate if we can agree still fine to issue the 1.2m shares which we are in the process of doing now AND for the balance of Treasury shares to be transferred to the EBT</span>.”   </p>

In my judgment it is not undermined by the other contemporaneous evidence as to the Four Directors’ awareness, prior to it being made on 19 June, of the voting implications of such a transfer, which I address further below in connection with the further transfer of 5.3m shares.  A transfer was required to meet the immediate 2015 LTIP obligation and the EBT was the proper transferee.  That was the purpose identified in the (corrective) RNS published on 25 June 2018 even though the number of 1,715,000 was, on Ms Brace’s calculations, in excess of that immediately required.

This is exemplified by Mr Ferguson’s answer referred to above, which talked about the decision in relation to the first tranche being in respect of “the 2015 shares”. If the imminent need for the Company to make good on its LTIP obligation establishes the reason for the transfer of most of that total number then that reason, which motivated the single decision made in relation to the whole amount, cannot be diluted (let alone displaced as the primary reason) by reference to an argument that, in the event, the decision caught too many shares.  On the present facts in relation to the decision to transfer the 1.7m, I do not see how the motivation and purpose behind the decision on 7 June can somehow be apportioned and then undermined by looking at the precise number of shares to which it related.  The proper purposes rule is concerned with motivation rather than effect.  Obviously, I recognise that there may be cases where the scope and impact of the decision will influence the court’s conclusion as to what motivated it in the first place but, in my judgment, this is not one of them so far as the decision in relation to the 1.7m is concerned. </p>

The first purpose was at least equal to any other.  Further, I do not believe the evidence supports the conclusion that, when deciding upon the transfer on 7 June 2018, the majority either knew or could be confident that Jupiter would vote at the AGM as they wished.  The fact that the Company later thought fit to make its voting recommendation in the letter dated 20 June is evidence that they did not.  So too are the terms of Ms Brace’s email of 11 June (referred to below) which, though written before the transfer actually took place, was the first indication that the trustee would vote in accordance with a Chairman’s recommendation. </p>

Again, this is illustrated by the evidence of the Four Directors about their awareness of further LTIP entitlements arising within the next year or so.  As the immediate deficit in relation to 2015 awards had been met by the earlier transfer, and the later one was the subject of a separate decision, the purpose behind it requires separate consideration.   </p>

To the extent that “purpose” is to be discerned by reference to outcome – speaking generally “purpose” can be said to be a pull from the future whereas “motive” is a push from the past – there is more to the court’s analysis than simply looking at how Jupiter came to vote the EBT shares.  </p>

It is the case that the Company’s letter was expressed as an “offer” to Jupiter to acquire the 5.3m shares and required Jupiter to execute the enclosed “Acquisition Letter”.  The Acquisition Letter, duly completed by the trustee, did constitute an application for the shares “<span style="font-style:italic">to be held in accordance with the terms of the Trust </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">and the terms of the recommendation letter </span><span style="font-style:italic">from the Company (the “Acquisition Price)</span>” (my emphasis).

The terms of the letter of 20 June proceeded on the basis that the Trust Deed contained (at clause 12) express provision for the Chairman to make a voting recommendation to the trustee in accordance with what was considered to be the Company’s best interests.  In my judgment, that is what the letter was doing, and no more, and that is supported by the fact that the 1.7m had already been transferred, the general structure and tenor of the 20 June letter (addressing acquisition and voting recommendation separately) and the Board’s recognition of Jupiter’s independence (the letter mentioned the trustee’s complete discretion three times). By making the recommendation and asking for Jupiter’s countersignature of the letter (in the event of it deciding in the exercise of its discretion to accept it), by way of confirmation “<span style="font-style:italic">as soon as possible</span>”, the Board plainly wished to know how Jupiter intended to vote at the AGM.  Although it was quite quick to do so, Jupiter did not provide that confirmation until 21 June 2018. I think the Company can say that (as with the 1.7m shares) the decision to transfer the 5.3m shares had in principle been made by then. </p>

Once the need to replenish the EBT to satisfy LTIP awards is stripped away as a reason for them making the decision, as I think the fact of the earlier, separate decision over the 1.7m fully justifies, then their desire to secure that vote can fairly be said to be the predominant reason why they made it at that time.   </p>

I accept Mr Wood’s evidence that when he said in that email that it might be a “<span style="font-style:italic">silly idea</span>” he meant that he did not know whether it could be done, rather than it signifying some awareness on his part that it would not be right to do so.  Nevertheless, in that email of limited circulation, the emphasis was upon the ability to vote the shares.  It must be noted that the shares which had been bought back in the market in February 2018 had not soon thereafter been transferred from Treasury to the EBT as the proper receptacle for meeting the LTIP awards that had driven the buy-backs (no doubt for good, dividend-related reasons).  </p>

As with Mr Wood’s email, Mr Brady appears to have been operating on the assumption that a Chairman’s recommendation (of the kind which the Trust Deed appears to have contemplated) would be persuasive, if not decisive.  Whilst highlighting the risk of attempting to force the trustee’s hand, Mr Foster’s email of 11 June had raised the notion of conditionality in the terms of transfer to Jupiter.   </p>

There is nothing in this allegation when Mr Tinkler’s election to the Board (on the footing he had been removed from office on 14 June 2018) had been put to the meeting and passed under Resolution No. 14.  I have already explained in Section 3 above that the Royal Court of Guernsey was not asked to second guess Mr Tinkler’s removal from employment and office on 14 June when it refused his application for injunctive relief over Resolution No. 4.

The pleaded allegation is that it was a deliberate breach of the duty owed by Mr Ferguson, as Chairman, to vote those shares in the manner which he best understood to be the wishes of the appointor. Of course, Mr Tinkler would presumably have liked to argue that the almost identical subject matter of invalid Resolution No. 4 and substitute Resolution No. 14 should mean that Mr Ferguson in fact had no discretion in relation to the latter resolution, arising under “AOB”, but that would have been an unsustainable argument. </p>

This included the advice that he would be entitled to exercise his discretion, acting in good faith and for what he considered to be the best interests of the appointing shareholder, on the basis that the shareholder had not provided any indication as to how to vote on Mr Tinkler’s election.  This was because the abstention on the invalid re-election resolution might indicate neutrality or because (following the recommendation in the ISS report) an abstention reflected the point that “<span style="font-style:italic">this resolution is void</span>”.  I see no basis for criticising Mr Ferguson’s decision to exercise his discretion to vote against Mr Tinkler.

For present purposes, the most relevant fiduciary duty is the duty to act in good faith in what the director believes to be the best interests of the Company.  I have addressed the implications of this duty in Section 3(a)(iv) above.  In the light of my findings on Issues 1, 3 and 5 to 8, and what I have said about the justification for their actions on 14 June 2018, I see no basis for impugning their decision.   </p>

It is true that at the AGM the previous day the shareholder support, which they understood Mr Tinkler had procured, found expression but many of the matters upon which the Committee had relied in dismissing him from employment were relevant to their concerns as to just what it was he had been saying to those shareholders.  Taking, for example, WIM’s vote of approximately 19.5% in favour of Mr Tinkler, the Four Directors had no reason to think that this reflected a considered or balanced view on the <span style="font-style:italic">“serious governance matter”</span>, with its risks to shareholder value, which Mr Wood had tried unsuccessfully to discuss with Mr Woodford.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the deletion of the words referring to Mr Tinkler’s future within the Company cannot be read as meaning that the Committee lacked the power to address it.  Mr Wood’s evidence was that Mr Foster of Travers Smith had raised the idea of a Committee on 28 May 2018 so that it might have full Board authority to run matters without the interested Board members who he identified as Mr Ferguson and Mr Tinkler.  Within the words that remained in the Committee’s terms of reference were that “<span style="font-style:italic">the remit of the Committee includes authority to exercise all powers of the Board (without limitation)</span>”.  That clearly gave the Committee the delegated power to act on behalf of the Board (and therefore the Company) in connection with Mr Tinkler’s employment status.  It is important to note that the advice of Travers Smith on 5 June 2018 was that “<span style="font-style:italic">if considered necessary</span>” the Committee’s terms of reference could be amended after the AGM to include specific reference to Mr Tinkler’s removal.  In the light of the general delegation of power to the Committee, by the words quoted above, I do not see why that was necessary when (before the AGM) the Letter to Shareholders and Communication to Employees gave the Committee cause to consider Mr Tinkler’s summary dismissal.  I also note (having regard to the circumstances in which the Committee was formed) that the three members of the Committee would in any event have been able to carry a full Board resolution for his removal, either with the support of Mr Ferguson if was permitted to vote or without him if both he and Mr Tinkler were precluded from voting under Article 85 by reason of their self-interest in the decision.  </p>

As appears from my findings under Issue 4, the only element of improper purpose on their part which I have found to be established relates to the decision in relation to the transfer of the 5.3m shares to the EBT, made on 19 and 20 June 2018 and therefore after his dismissal.  My findings under Issue 2 show that, by 14 June 2018, Mr Tinkler had given them cause to consider his dismissal.  I have already mentioned Mr Brady’s belief that Mr Tinkler’s actions in early June were “<span style="font-style:italic">the tipping point</span>” so far as the destabilising effect of his actions was concerned.  Mr Brady’s WhatsApp exchange with Mr Dilworth on 9 June (“<span style="font-style:italic">Starting an employee revolution is what he is trying to do</span>”) records his view at the time.  Mr Coombs said that the events of early June were “<span style="font-style:italic">the cumulative effect of a number of things that he had done, and the last straw, though it was somewhat bigger than a straw, to break the camel’s back was what happened that weekend</span>.” </p>

Not only I am unpersuaded that Mr Tinkler’s status as an employee would have been thought by most shareholders to be material to the prospects of any of the Four Directors being re-elected at the AGM (a point which Mr Ferguson made in his evidence) but, in any event, it is Mr Tinkler who, by his actions, had precipitated the consideration of his dismissal.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the wider conflict of interest which Mr Tinkler says Mr Brady, Mr Coombs and Mr Wood each faced, and which caused them to support Mr Ferguson, in my judgment this lacks any proper basis.  It is inevitable that individual directors will have their own individual views upon matters which call for a choice to be made and the duty to exercise independent judgment requires that they should.  Mr Coombs and Mr Wood (though not Mr Brady) had made their choice clear by indicating in the 25 May RNS that they would stand down if Mr Ferguson was not re-elected.   However, provided each of the three, having exercised his independent judgment, acted genuinely in what he believed to be the best interests of the Company, I cannot see how his decision can be said to tainted by some “self-interest” simply because it is consistent with the decision-maker continuing in the office of director. That office is as much a burden as a benefit, but any benefits which flow from remaining in position cannot be the basis for an argument that any decision which might be said to be consistent with that end is somehow infected by a conflict of interest or an improper purpose.  On that approach, and as the Company submitted, business at the Board level would become impossible.  Mr Tinkler’s point appears to come close to saying that the desire to remain in office, or to support a co-director in doing so, in fact precludes the person from being able to do so lawfully and effectively by making decisions which support or are consistent with that aim, regardless of the independent business case for making them.  </p>

However, I am satisfied that this did not feature in the Committee’s thought process when deciding to dismiss him.  There is no evidence that it did. Quite apart from anything else, he had indicated at the Board meeting on 7 June 2018 that he would not be exercising his award at that time because of the two year holding period.  Even if this had been a consideration in the minds of the Committee members it would still not have supported the conclusion that they had been substantially motivated by it.  Such an argument would only begin to gain traction if the grounds on which they purported to act were established to be spurious.  As I explain next, that is not the position, so Mr Tinkler’s loss of his 2015 LTIP entitlement can be safely pigeonholed as an “effect” rather than a “cause”. </p>

Indeed, the breaches constituted by his Letter to Shareholders and Communication to Employees were, in my view, each repudiatory breaches.  By writing in those terms, Mr Tinkler had brought his campaign against the Board, his employer’s representative body, out into the open.  Those most recent breaches did not land in an empty scale and, by his actions between late January and early June 2018 and the Company was entitled to conclude that Mr Tinkler had abandoned his responsibilities as Executive Director.

That the decision, in those circumstances, was a properly  motivated one is almost too obvious a point to justify, but that can be done by simply referring to the fact that Mr Tinkler agreed and recognised that a resignation request might follow when he signed up to the terms of clause 17.4 (as I have construed it).  </p>

That conclusion might follow if an infringement of the rule resulted in the transfer being wholly void but that, in my judgment, is not the position and I have already noted in Section 4 above that Mr Tinkler (admittedly focussing upon the shares which were the subject of the first transfer and were used to satisfy awards exercised on 22 June) did not suggest it to be.  </p>

It did so having given the Company a good receipt for those shares (in the sense of acquiring legal title to them for the benefit of the trust) and, moreover, having quite clearly exercised its independent judgment as to how to vote them. I have already explained under Issue 4 how the Company’s letter dated 20 June 2018 did not attempt to fetter the trustee’s voting discretion and it is clear that Jupiter did not think it had. The evidence shows how, on 3 July, Jupiter indicated that it intended to abstain from voting only then to later change its mind, on 5 July, in the light of the ISS and Glass Lewis Reports.  It was the change of mind that prompted Collas Crill into action on behalf of Mr Tinkler and Mr Whawell. </p>

In many cases (including the leading authorities on share issues considered in Section 4(a)(vii)) the motive behind the transfer may be established by considering what was known to be its inevitable effect, or purpose.  In this case, however, despite my finding that the Four Directors were primarily motivated by a wish to secure Jupiter’s favourable vote and had done their best to secure it, the casting of that vote was not an inevitable or foregone conclusion.  The vacillation on the part of Jupiter, after the transfer, demonstrates as much. </p>

The fact that a bare majority of shareholders might have been persuaded otherwise does not mean the majority should have been.  As at 7 July 2018, the Four Directors would have had no cause to think that either Mr Jenkinson or WIM had applied their minds impartially to the implications of Mr Tinkler’s actions (when they were amongst those with whom he had been having private discussions and they had not benefited from the majority’s viewpoint).  </p>

It really amounts to saying that the Board cannot properly decide something which is contrary to what has been decided by the shareholders in general meeting.  My general observations which attempt to set the context at the beginning of Section 3 above will indicate why that strikes me as a questionable submission.

One cannot read into that power a limitation that it will not be exercised, or, perhaps, not exercised too soon against a newly appointed director, or that it will only be exercised against him on “new” grounds arising after his appointment (though it is clear that the majority thought the threat posed by Mr Tinkler to the stability of the Company was a continuing one). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with the “golden thread” argument, therefore, is that Mr Tinkler seeks to apply it in a way from which only he benefits. This is illustrated by his counterclaim for “<span style="font-style:italic">an injunction restraining the Board from purporting to remove Mr Tinkler as a director of the Company pursuant to Article 89(5)</span>”. As the Company has questioned, why should Mr Tinkler (on the assumption he is back on the Board) benefit from such special protection against the exercise of a power that the members have agreed to confer upon the Board (and not revoke)?  Of course, Mr Tinkler is forced to seek that relief to protect himself against the remainder of the Board (now differently constituted but with the Four Directors still on it) doing again that which was done on 7 July 2018.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Yet the decision of members at the AGM was to appoint the whole Board, including the Four Directors who chose to exercise the Article 89(5) power available to them. If the golden thread runs, it runs for the benefit of all directors whose appointment reflects the shareholders wishes. As Mr Coombs made the point in evidence, when making the point that the outcome at the AGM had not really resolved the problem when the other directors felt unable to work with Mr Tinkler: </p>
