It says that these claims are analytically distinct, in that GT committed separate breaches of duty in each year. However, AssetCo’s primary case is that the entirety of its (alleged) loss is attributable to GT’s breaches of duty in relation to the 2009 Audit. Mr Templeman QC for AssetCo explained that he advanced a separate claim in respect of the 2010 Audit only to guard against the possibility that it might be argued that GT’s breaches in respect of the 2010 Audit were an intervening act, breaking the chain of causation between the breaches in respect of the 2009 Audit and (some or all of) the loss suffered by AssetCo plc. Thus, if I were to dismiss the 2009 claims, AssetCo could still succeed on the 2010 claims. There is, though, an obvious overlap between the claims, not least because (i) the same acts of negligence in respect of the 2009 Audit were broadly repeated in respect of the 2010 Audit, and (ii) the events which AssetCo says would have occurred in either the 2009 or the 2010 counterfactuals following a non-negligent audit are largely the events that in fact occurred upon the initial discovery of the company’s financial problems and mismanagement in 2011.  </p>

GT’s case is that the Counterfactual is unreal; and that if AssetCo had known and, therefore, been obliged to disclose to the market, the true position in summer 2009 (or summer 2010), it could not have avoided insolvent liquidation.

Certain levels of management may be in a position to override control procedures designed to prevent similar frauds by other employees, for example, by directing subordinates to record transactions incorrectly or to conceal them. Given its position of authority within an entity, management has the ability to either direct employees to do something or solicit their help to assist in carrying out a fraud, with or without the employees' knowledge.  </p>

An impairment analysis should compare discounted future cash flows with the stated value of fixed assets, to ensure that the stated value is not excessive. For example, if assets are valued at £5m but a discounted cash flow analysis shows they will only generate £3m in revenue, then the assets are overvalued by £2m and an impairment in that amount must be taken. GT admits that it failed (i) to apply appropriate professional scepticism and care to the treatment of the impairment of assets by erroneously concluding that no impairment existed and (ii) to obtain sufficient audit evidence to support management’s treatment of impairment of assets. It further admits that had it not breached its duties in this respect, it would have concluded that AssetCo plc’s goodwill should have been impaired by between £43.8m and £61.6m in FY09 and between £36.5m and £56.2m in FY10, and that its investment in subsidiaries should have been impaired by between £20.5m and £33.5m in FY09 and between £11.9m and £25.4m in FY10. It would also have concluded that AssetCo’s management was dishonestly fabricating the cash flow projections, or aspects of it, in order to inflate the company’s asset position. </p>

In FY09, AssetCo’s financial statements failed to reflect that the PSA required monies to be retained within AADL, so that £9.715m of the cash held by AssetCo was held for a restricted purpose. It is common ground that GT should have required the management of AssetCo to amend the financial statements to refer to the restricted cash and that it was in breach in relation thereto as regards both the 2009 and 2010 Audits. Mr Templeman QC submitted in his oral opening that GT had not dealt in its written Opening Submissions with the full extent of AssetCo’s allegation on breach in this regard, specifically in relation to FY10. However in light of the parties’ agreement in the Agreed Issues Document that none of the issues on which they disagree in this regard have any material impact on what I am asked to decide, it is not necessary to dwell any further on this.  </p>

The former include factors that AssetCo plc alleges should have suggested to GT that Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn had a vested interest in the company’s survival such that enhanced care was appropriate in checking their input into the accounts. The latter include false statements made by AssetCo’s management during the course of the Audits.

GT also questions AssetCo plc’s reliance on concepts/terms such as “Risk Factors” and “Trigger Factors” which it says are not found in auditing standards. In response AssetCo notes that the expert auditors agree that GT failed to act as a competent auditor would have done during the planning of the audits. AssetCo submits that this agreement is predicated on the fact that a competent auditor would have exercised due care and skill in the planning of the audit, and that whether this constitutes a discrete duty or merely part of GT’s general duty of care is immaterial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Shannon’s personal interest in the success of the business was heightened by the fact that he had pledged 8.4 million of his 27 million shares in AssetCo to an Icelandic bank, Kaupthing, as security for a personal loan of £2.7 million. By January 2009, he was coming under what he described in an email of 14 January 2009 as <span style="font-style:italic">“increased pressure from Kaupthing to improve their security position or refinance [his] facility”</span>. He wrote on 23 January 2009 that he believed the bank would call on its security over the shares. Mr Shannon came under particularly heavy pressure from Kaupthing in April 2009. In particular, on 5 April 2009, a Kaupthing employee told Mr Shannon that the value of its security (i.e. AssetCo’s shares) had been falling, and, after an exchange of emails, that Mr Shannon would receive a formal demand for repayment of the loan and thereafter a statutory demand. This period of intense pressure from Kaupthing coincided with the start of GT’s fieldwork for the 2009 audit, during which (as is common ground) Mr Shannon made a series of unreasonable and dishonest statements to GT, the effect of which was to enable AssetCo to continue trading as though it were a going concern, and therefore to prop up the price of Mr Shannon’s shares in AssetCo, which were the subject of the charge held by Kaupthing. In August 2010, Mr Shannon informed Kaupthing that he had been servicing what he could of the loan through dividend payments from his shareholding in AssetCo. His personal situation was therefore closely connected to the fate of AssetCo. </p>

The rationale for ringfencing cash in the subsidiary – i.e., what would become AADL – was twofold. First, both sides understood that any Abu Dhabi contracting party would require proof that AADL held substantial funds. Second, NAV regarded the ring-fencing of its money within AADL, rather than it being mixed in with AssetCo’s general working capital, as limiting its risk. </p>

The fabricated revenue related to modifications to fire engines carried out by AssetCo. AssetCo’s management asserted (falsely and dishonestly) that the modifications had resulted in an additional monthly unitary payment of £46,975.68, and persuaded GT on the basis of evidence that was less than compelling, including in particular an Excel spreadsheet containing a figure of £46,975.28 in the <span style="font-style:italic">“UP for month”</span> column (which was </p>

The proposal was to raise £5-7.5 million by way of a share placing, ostensibly (at least so far as potential investors were concerned) to fund AssetCo’s new “EFCC” (Emergency Fire Crew Capability) contract, entered into by AssetCo London with the London Fire Brigade on 9 July 2009, for the training of reserve firefighters.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On 15 August 2008 AssetCo was told by Mr Chatila in an email that it was <span style="font-style:italic">“likely to be awarded a small contract for airport firefighting equipment”</span>. In an email of 23 September 2008 Mr Shannon asked Mr Mills to seek an update from his contacts in Abu Dhabi because he believed AssetCo was <span style="font-style:italic">“very close”</span> to winning two projects. Mr Mills’ evidence is that by December 2008 NAV – which was at this time considering its investment into the proposed Abu Dhabi business, i.e. investment through the PSA into AADL – anticipated that AssetCo would win four contracts in Abu Dhabi. The extent of Mr Mills’ confidence in the Abu Dhabi venture is relevant to the Counterfactual and is addressed in due course below. </p>

It refers to a memo written by Mr White (Managing Director of AssetCo UAE) to Mr Shannon in August 2008.  As regards his dealings with the Abu Dhabi Police, Mr White reported that there was <span style="font-style:italic">“[c]lear competition against AssetCo at every conceivable step in the process”</span> but that there was <span style="font-style:italic">“definitely business in Abu Dhabi of a long term nature”</span>. </p>

This advice was, again, sought in the context of NAV’s proposed investment in AADL. Two options were identified: a limited liability company, as a joint venture, with UAE nationals owning at least 51% of the business; or AssetCo establishing a branch office. </p>

Branch offices are generally preferred by the foreign companies in order to avoid any sharing in the ownership and in the profits of the business. Branch office of a foreign company will require a UAE national as a local service agent against certain amount of fee payable on monthly or annual basis. There is no minimum or maximum fee prescribed by the law. The local agent will have a limited role and shall be only required to support the branch in submitting applications to the governmental offices. However, it should also be noted that the parent company of the branch office will be required to provide a financial undertaking and will remain responsible for its branch. Furthermore, we also mentioned that some foreign entities prefer to structure their business in a way that could provide them certain tax benefits. Such as incorporating an offshore company and then opening a branch office of that offshore company in the UAE. Generally, the UAE Ministry of Economy requires two years’ financial statement in order to register a branch office but we have experienced on some occasions where such requirements are waived by the Ministry’s sole discretion.” </p>

However it appears that on 29 July 2010 AssetCo plc signed a shareholder agreement with a subsidiary of Emirates Advanced Investments for the formation of a joint venture company, AssetCo Emirates Response Services LLC (“ERS”). In the event however it would appear – and indeed this was the conclusion of PwC’s preliminary audit findings in March 2012 and legal advice provided in October 2011 – that AssetCo did not execute the agreement and ultimately had no formal investment or contractual interest in ERS. A contract was then awarded to ERS for the delivery of services to the UAE Air Force, and AssetCo announced to the market on 21 February 2011 that its joint venture company had been awarded the contract.

The remaining directors disagreed that there had been a material adverse change. Later that evening, Mr Shannon emailed Mr Wightman suggesting that there were only two alternatives available to address the position other than administration: (1) reengagement with Arcapita if a suitable offer was received; or (2) seeking to increase the amount of funding raised in the placing, but having made disclosure of the working capital position (i.e. the alleged material adverse change). </p>

The court has to determine on the balance of probability whether the defendant's act, for example the careless driving, caused the plaintiff's loss consisting of his broken leg. Once established on balance of probability, that fact is taken as true and the plaintiff recovers his damage in full.

As the court there explained, in the context of causation, some hypothetical questions (“what would have happened if … ”) do fall to be decided on the balance of probabilities. Thus (see Stuart-Smith LJ at page 1610 D-H) where the breach of a duty consists of an omission, for example to provide safety equipment, and the question is what the claimant himself would have done had the breach of duty not occurred – a question of causation — the claimant has to prove the matter on the balance of probabilities.

In those cases the court does not demand that the claimant establish his case of causation on the balance of probabilities: see <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span> at 1611 A-C. All the claimant has to show in such cases is that the chance is a real or substantial one.

The appellant's breach of covenant had made the operation of the restaurant a legal impossibility. As a result, it did not trade. There was therefore no doubt at all that the breach had caused the loss subject only to the quantification of that loss. The issues raised about the respondent's competence and the restaurant's prospects of success were not matters that went to causation at all. They were relevant at most to the assessment of how profitable (or not) the restaurant would have been had it been able to operate. If it would have been a commercial failure Mr Vasiliou could have received no more than nominal damages for the breach. </p>

It argued that even if it was liable to the seller, its damages should be reduced by a factor to reflect the chance that the lessee would not have returned the engines in time for them to be delivered to the buyer.

In the present type of case the court has to assess what a banker would have concluded as to the valuation of certain shares.

The seller resold at a reduced price and claimed damages. The (counterclaiming) buyer claimed that the seller may not have been in a position to supply the contractually agreed engines in any event, given prior leasing commitments into which it had entered with third parties. The buyer argued that even if it was liable to the seller, its damages should be reduced by a factor to reflect the chance that the lessee would not have returned the engines in time for them to be delivered to the buyer.

That the loss of a chance doctrine may thus benefit a claimant is apparent (and indeed underlies the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span>).

Mr. Harrison's evidence covered the ground; there was no need to go beyond it. The rationale of the loss of a chance doctrine is to permit recovery to a claimant who, by reason of uncertainty, would otherwise be unable to prove causation to the standard of a balance of probabilities; it is not to deny full recovery to a claimant who successfully meets that burden. Underlying the loss of a chance doctrine, are, as it seems to me considerations of policy and good sense. But where a claimant can establish causation on a balance of probabilities, such considerations do not oblige the court and the parties nonetheless to evaluate the chances involved. There is no relevant uncertainty as to causation and, as Mr. Shah put it, no need to reduce the damages on the basis of a loss of chance. The claimant, as in any other case, should be entitled to full recovery, subject only to the contingencies affecting quantification of damage — inapplicable here, save in one respect to which I shall return in a moment.  </p>

Whilst it allows a claim to pass the causation stage in circumstances where it would potentially have failed had the conduct of the third party been required to be proved on balance of probabilities (and to that extent is “permissive” and provides an “alternative” outcome, based on policy considerations) to what would otherwise be the outcome, it applies whatever the probability at the causation stage (be that above or below 51%) with the evaluation of the chance being part of the process of the quantification of the damages.  The loss of a chance principle is accordingly mandatory in the sense that where the claimant’s loss depends on the hypothetical action of a third party then the claimant must prove as a matter of causation that he has a real or substantial chance of the third party taking that action, and if that is shown then the evaluation of the chance is part of the assessment of the quantum of damage.  </p>

Such an opportunity is a valuable right in itself, and what the claimant proves (on the balance of probabilities) is that he has lost that right; the assessment of the value of the right then depends on the chances of success. As Patten LJ says in <span style="font-style:italic">Vasiliou</span> at [21] this is because what has been lost is by definition the loss of a chance. It would obviously be wrong to value the right to take part in a competition at the value of the prize that might be won as the claimant never had a right to the prize, only the right to enter the competition. It would also be wrong to value the right to bring litigation as if it were bound to succeed, if, as is almost inevitably the case, the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. A claim with a prospect of success has a value, but until judgment has been obtained (and indeed it is clear that it can be successfully enforced) that value is not the same as the amount which would be awarded were it to succeed.  </p>

In such a case the claimant is not required to prove that the third party would have acted in that way, only that there was a real and substantial chance that he would. This is still a question of causation, not of quantification (see <span style="font-style:italic">Vasiliou</span> at [22], and also F<span style="font-style:italic">irst Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold &amp; Co </span>[1996] CLC 174 at 182 per Ward LJ, cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Vasiliou</span> at [43]); but if the claimant does establish that there was such a real and substantial chance, then when it comes to quantification, his damages will be assessed not at 100% of the value of the benefit he would have obtained, but at the appropriate percentage having regard to the chances of his obtaining it. <span style="text-decoration:underline">I only add the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">obvious point that in some cases, where the chance is found to be say</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">30%, the requirement that the claimant only need show that he has lost a</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">real and substantial chance is beneficial to him (as if he had to prove how</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the third party would have acted on the balance of probabilities, he would</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">recover nothing); but in other cases, where the chance is assessed at say</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">70%, it has the effect of only enabling him to recover 70% of the damages</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">he otherwise would.

It is not entirely clear if this is part of the question of causation and a separate exercise from quantification; or whether it is to be regarded as part of the quantification exercise. Toulson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Parabola</span> at [23] fairly clearly treats the finding of Flaux J that “on a balance of probability Tangent would have traded profitably…” as part of the question of causation as he deals with it in the context of the claimant having first to establish an actionable head of loss, and coming before the “next task” which is “to quantify the loss”. On the other hand Patten LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Vasiliou</span> at [23] seems to have regarded the question as part of the exercise of quantification: see his reference to there being “no doubt at all that the breach had caused the loss subject only to the quantification of that loss”, and to Mr Vasiliou's competence and the restaurant's prospects of success not being matters that went to causation at all but being relevant at most to the assessment of how profitable the restaurant would have been.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.50in">On either view this is clearly a different type of exercise from that undertaken in an <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples </span>case. It does not require the Court to find that there was a real and substantial chance of a third party acting in a particular way; but to reach a conclusion whether trading would have been profitable or not. However the exercise is characterised, I think it must follow that this is a simple yes/no question (would the trading have been profitable ?), and hence falls to be decided on the balance of probabilities. I accept that this is so, even though as a matter of strict logic it is not entirely obvious why there should be such a sharp difference of approach from the <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span> type of case. The profitability of the restaurant in Vasiliou presumably depended on whether it would have attracted sufficient custom, or in other words whether a number of third parties would have chosen to come to Mr Vasiliou's restaurant; and this does not seem very different in kind, only in degree, from the question in <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span> which was whether the third party in question would have chosen to accede to Allied Maples' request for a particular contractual term. It may be that the difference is between one particular third party and a pool of potential customers; in the case of an individual third party, the Court must assess the chance of his acting in a particular way, but in the case of a pool of potential customers, the Court is not concerned with how any individual would have behaved but with whether there would have been sufficient custom generally to make the business a success.  </p>

So far as Mr Maden is concerned, he had to satisfy the judge, albeit only on the balance of probabilities, that he would have settled on those terms: that is because he was the claimant in these proceedings, and therefore the court had to arrive at a conclusion, one way or another, whether he would have settled. However, the other party to the hypothetical settlement, Mrs Chadburn, is not a party to (and was not even a witness in) these proceedings.

The judge was merely emphasising that his decision was, as it were, on the right side of the line from the point of view of Mr Maden, and on the wrong side of the line from the point of view of Cliffords.

Of course, parties in litigation do turn down offers which they and their solicitors have indicated they would accept, but in light of the uncertainties involved in the Wardle action, the relatively high potential liability for costs, and the fairly consistent approach to settlement by Mrs Chadburn, I consider that, while a discount was appropriate, it should not be a very large discount. </p>

And…the converse is true at the other end of the scale.” </span>At the former end of the scale the requirement of causation will be easily and quickly satisfied, and at the quantification stage there will be no reduction. At the latter end of the scale, the requirement of causation will not itself be met. Between those two positions provided that there is a real or substantial chance (as opposed to a speculative one) of the third party taking the action under consideration then the requirement of causation will be met, and the evaluation of the chance will be part of the assessment of the quantum of damage.  </p>

The first was how the court deals with multiple contingencies for example where the claimant’s loss depends on the hypothetical action of a number of third parties. The second (that I raised with the parties) is whether the position is different, in relation to the application of loss of chance principles if the court hears from the witness or witnesses concerned from a third party – is the chance still to be evaluated a percentage ascribed to that chance, or in such a scenario can the matter be decided on balance of probabilities.  These questions are addressed in the sections that follow. </p>

Indeed, if one looks at the matter that way round, any interplay between the issues arising from questions of credibility could well be said to have improved prospects on Issue 1 to the point where the 20% chance of failing would have reduced to the insignificant, in other words to a point where it could be altogether disregarded. </p>

In principle, however, trading which is speculative in the sense that it may turn out to be loss-making is capable of giving rise to an award of damages if on the evidence the court is able to find to a sufficient standard that it would in fact have been profitable. Applying this approach, Flaux J found as a fact on the balance of probabilities that the claimant would have made profits. He awarded damages accordingly, adopting what he regarded as a conservative figure pitched at a level which took account of the inherent trading risks and the probability that some individual trades would have been loss-making (see e.g. [188] and [192]).

Some claims for consequential loss are capable of being established with precision (for example, expenses incurred prior to the date of trial). Other forms of consequential loss are not capable of similarly precise calculation because they involve the attempted measurement of things which would or might have happened (or might not have happened) but for the defendant's wrongful conduct, as distinct from things which have happened. In such a situation the law does not require a claimant to perform the impossible, nor does it apply the balance of probability test to the measurement of the loss. </p>

Thus, as the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Veitch v Avery </span>[2008] PNLR 7 cited by Mr Smith demonstrates, if the third party's actions can be closely associated with those of the claimant (in that case it was the relationship of father and son), then the Court may be more able to deal with the particular evidence said to have causative effect on the basis of the balance of probability. In that case, the issue was whether the claimant's father would have advanced funds that would have saved what was otherwise a doomed business in a case where it was necessary for the claimant to show that the business was not doomed.  </p>

I reach this view in the light of my finding above as to the nature of the relationship between the Fund and TIL, it being of importance and significance, in my judgment, that the Fund had, through CAM, delegated to TIL the specific function of dealing with the legal work necessary in relation to the relevant transaction, and that TIL was acting as agent of the Fund to that extent at least.” </p>

But that does not mean that AssetCo’s case depends on the act of third parties (the banks): the act of making or refusing to make payments for the benefit of the London group would still have been an act of AssetCo. The possibility of agreement with the London group banks is a matter which is relevant only to the question whether AssetCo has proved, on the balance of probabilities, that it would have ceased to make payments for the benefit of the London group.” </p>

The principle is only “permissive” in the sense that it allows a claimant to succeed on causation in a loss of a chance case where he would have failed on causation had he been required (which he is not in such cases) to establish causation on balance of probabilities – that is what was decided, or affirmed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples</span> is not authority for AssetCo’s proposition that in a loss of a chance a claimant can choose, or elect, or has the option (however its point might be characterised) to seek to prove the action of third parties on a balance of probability.

I think your evidence is and obviously correct me        if I get this wrong, that the dates you have put here        are the dates you would have gone to -- the competent        auditor would have gone to management.  In cases where        there is a suspicion or discovery of management        dishonesty, then the date for going to those charged        with governance would effectively be the same because        you would circumvent management.

In relation to this Mr Bligh accepted that the cash in transit issue had been identified by 12 May 2010. He also accepted that there was an issue around what was supposed to be the restricted payment under the SOC Contract, though he questioned whether it needed to be ring-fenced (I am satisfied it did), and suggested that the payment could have been made to AssetCo in the UK for a legitimate purpose (such as supplies for AADL from the UK), but he confirmed to the Court that he could not refer to anything specifically that suggested that anything was being paid for a legitimate purpose.

Mr Bligh’s evidence was that a Competent Auditor would have wanted to understand what this figure represented, and that by 20 May 2009 a Competent Auditor would simply have ruled out any question of finance lease accounting (although he considered, rightly, that no Competent Auditor would have been anywhere near a finance lease in the first place). I consider that a Competent Auditor would have reached this conclusion earlier, given the importance of the matter, and after raising it with Mr Shannon in the first instance (without any agreement in terms of accounting treatment) would have escalated the matter to the Chairman of the Audit Committee by around 20 May 2009.  </p>

If the possibility of finance lease accounting been raised as a possibility in 2010 it would have been followed up quickly – not least as it would have raised or reduced profits by £13.m depending on the accounting treatment, and as such would have been a significant issue. Mr Bligh (rightly in my view) considered that Mr Shannon would have refused to action the matter appropriately, which would have resulted in a Competent Auditor going to the Audit Committee (on the basis that Mr Shannon was seeking to place a limitation on the audit). Mr Bligh’s evidence was that this would be by late May, “probably a few days later than 24 May” (the date put to him), and, on the basis of such evidence I  find that this would have occurred by around 27 May 2010. </p>

Unlike in 2011 (where there was something of a dripfeeding of information to the market that led to uncertainty) such key points would have been provided to the market, albeit in measured terms, at one time, or in short-order, given that a Competent Auditor would have presented a clear picture of the accounting problems, and consequences, to the Audit Committee, and AssetCo would have had to make one of more RNS announcements to the market in respect of the same without delay.  </p>

Shannon and Flynn, were both well aware of the circumstances of those monies.

Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that the legal advice that NAV and AADL would have received was that they would be able to demonstrate a good arguable case that there was an express trust in favour of AADL or a <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span> type trust in favour of NAV, and that they could consider seeking a freezing injunction in that regard, with the issues being determined by the court in due course if legal action was taken.

Of course the factual scenario was not the same in 2011 (the money having been spent), but in 2011 (as AssetCo say would have happened in 2009) AssetCo’s immediate reaction was to offer financial support, and to pursue the business opportunities in Abu Dhabi utilising AssetCo’s experience notwithstanding the financial difficulties that AssetCo was in (which did not, in the event, prevent the subsequent renewal of the SOC Contract). </p>

At this stage no particular re-financing scheme had been agreed and the fact that 25% of the shares were controlled by Mr Shannon would not have impacted upon what NAV would have done at this stage of the Counterfactual (i.e. get Mr Davies appointed as chairman to consider potential restructuring and refinancing).

First, although there were preference shares which had been issued to NAV/NAV’s investors, the ordinary shareholder of AADL was AssetCo plc, and in such circumstances the interests of the two company were potentially aligned. Secondly, whilst AADL would have had a claim against AssetCo plc for the return of the preference share monies (and indeed this was its major asset), it might well have been in AADL’s best interest to allow AssetCo to reach a solvent outcome rather than pursuing its claim against AssetCo and ending up as a creditor at least partly unsecured in any solvent liquidation. Thirdly, Mr Davies did in fact become chairman of AssetCo in 2011 whilst he was a director of AADL, and without any apparent actual problem – in circumstances where AADL was funded by NAV, and NAV wanted a solvent outcome for AssetCo and the only other party with an equity interest in AADL was AssetCo itself.  </p>

In the 2010 Counterfactual the SOC Contract would have been in place, and I am satisfied that the position as to the appointment of Mr Davies in return for financial support would have been <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> – business had already been won in Abu Dhabi (albeit it would have been too early to determine if the SOC Contract was profitable) and Mr Mills’ would again have been keen to support AssetCo, and would have regarded it likely that profitable future business in Abu Dhabi could be won. AssetCo would once again have turned to NAV for support and Mr Davies was in a position to accept appointment (as already addressed above). At this stage, and whilst liabilities remained unknown (as in 2009), this would not have prevented NAV offering support on the basis of Mr Davies’ appointment as chairman, and in anticipation of Mr Davies making recommendations, and taking action, in relation to restructuring and re-financing. As for the board of AssetCo and whilst it might have considered administration as a “Plan B” (as in 2011), on balance of probabilities it would have agreed to Mr Davies’ appointment in return for interim financing pending Mr Davies recommendations as to restructuring and financing.  Accordingly on the 2010 Counterfactual AssetCo would on balance of probability have agreed to Mr Davies’ appointment as chairman, and there was a real and substantial chance of AssetCo offering such support and Mr Davies accepting the position, indeed I am in no doubt </p>

Once the Pledge Shareholders put forward their proposal for recapitalising the company, Northern Bank was content to allow its petition to be adjourned pending negotiations.

What they agreed to do was for them, KPMG, and us to monitor the amounts needed and they would let it come out of the blocked or locked account. The locked or blocked account had the gross receipts in it.  As this developed and until the business was disposed of, this was the system.  The banks would support through that … It was the only way that they could do it because they wanted a solvent solution.

This expenditure would therefore not have been financed by AssetCo but it would instead have been paid from the UPs under the LFEPA/Lincoln Contracts. Had AssetCo not neglected its suppliers for so long, and faced such intense pressure as a result of the winding-up petitions which it was facing, I would not have authorised this expenditure in 2011. At the time, in my judgment this was the only commercial choice. In fact as can be seen from the schedule, despite all the difficulties in 2011 as a result of the petitions and the lack of financial records, as a result of the agreements which we reached with the banks, AssetCo’s net expenditure on its subsidiaries from 6 May 2011 onwards was only approximately £38,000.” </p>

However it is important to recognise that each of the subsidiaries was directly or indirectly 100% owned by AssetCo plc and it seems inherently unlikely that the directors of the subsidiaries would have acted in the manner suggested. If AssetCo had been wound up its liquidator would presumably have sought to dispose of the shares in the subsidiaries and absent a buyer the subsidiaries would themselves, in all probability, have gone into liquidation.  </p>

However I do not consider it to be in point - what would have mattered was Mr Mills’ perception or belief that AssetCo would be awarded profitable business in Abu Dhabi not whether in fact it would have won such business (a future unknown), albeit I consider that  AssetCo <span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span> have won the SOC Contract, as indeed it did in 2010, notwithstanding any revelations in 2009 (just as it successfully renewed the SOC Contract notwithstanding the revelations of 2011), as I address in detail in due course below. </p>

Based on Mr Mills’ belief (which I accept) as to the potential benefits of supporting AssetCo, this would either preserve or enhance NAV’s reputation, whereas taking AssetCo into insolvency (either by litigation by AADL or taking the Abu Dhabi business for itself) could only damage the reputation of Mr Mills and NAV. The point is academic, however, as I am satisfied that that is not what Mr Mills and NAV would have done.</p>

It is true that AssetCo also has alternative pleas as to sources of finance (AS Fire and Rescue Ltd and/or Todd Research Ltd and/or a bank bridging facility), but none of these other (third party) sources of finance are relevant if NAV would have provided any necessary funding. </p>

In 2011, it was estimated that if AssetCo plc was placed into administration or liquidation, the return to creditors was likely to be “nil to 0.54p [i.e. around half a penny] in the £”. By contrast, a Scheme was estimated to produce a return of 23p in the £ for NonGroup Creditors.  Creditors, it is said, would therefore have had no rational incentive to seek to wind up the company in the run-up to a Scheme.  I consider that there is some force in this submission – if a creditor would get more in the scheme than via winding-up AssetCo this would be an incentive not to present (or follow through) a petition, and a disincentive to do so. Of course what any creditor was interested in was getting paid – and so a creditor might have threatened a petition with a view to achieving the same. It is also possible that if one creditor did issue a petition, others might have supported a petition (as in 2011). </p>

On 2 June 2009, the VAT arrears were £1,484,769.  At that time HMRC was asking for AssetCo’s audited accounts and a cash flow forecast in order to consider AssetCo’s request for time to pay.  On 30 June 2009, AssetCo sent to HMRC the FY08 and FY09 audited account as requested.  On 7 July 2009, AssetCo sent the further requested information to HMRC, including a cash flow statement to 30 June 2009 and a cash flow forecast to 30 June 2010.  On 31 July 2009, the AssetCo group VAT liability was £1,237,307, with an additional £594,944 becoming due on 7 August 2009 (though it appears that the true amount of the VAT return liability due on 7 August 2009 should have been “in the region of £1.1 million” as there was an outstanding “£660,000 adjustment from the last period”). On 7 August 2009, HMRC was chasing for a revised cash flow statement for the VAT group companies only, which AssetCo provided that day.  Also on 7 August 2009 AssetCo informed HMRC that significant payments of the outstanding VAT had been made, including payment in full of the most recent return of £594,944.  This was paid from the proceeds of the July 2009 placing (there would not have been a placing in July 2009 in the 2009 Counterfactual).  </p>

However if a point in time came where HMRC would not defer VAT liabilities generally the likelihood is that there would have been a delay before any petition was issued, and in the meantime (if need be) AssetCo would have been in a position (with the financial support of NAV that I have found) to pay any VAT liabilities and so avoid any petition (and any publication of the same, so as to avoid any creditors becoming aware of the same and supporting the petition).  </p>

However were it to be relevant, I consider that there is very much more than a real and substantial chance that HMRC would have granted the requisite time to pay, and indeed I consider that HMRC would have done so (as they did in 2011).

In this regard AssetCo rely on Ms Fowler’s analysis in her second report that on the 2009 Counterfactual each of the subsidiaries retained by Mr Davies would have generated sufficient cash to meet its own operating expenses.  Her analysis is based on the assumptions identified in her report based on Mr Davies’ evidence including that Mr Davies would have ceased all non-essential expenditure, would have required all subsidiaries in the Group to be selffinancing, and that AssetCo would have entered into the same arrangements with its banks as it did in 2011, which are consistent with the findings that I have made.

If, as I have found, NAV would have been offering financial support and were on-side for AssetCo (rather than AADL) undertaking the Abu Dhabi business which itself was a serious prospect (as I have found), and if as I have also found the banks would almost certainly have been on-side as to the use of monies in support of the UK business, then I consider that an insolvency practitioner could have signed off on such an application (and time could have been bought via such an application whilst a scheme of arrangement was entered into). But whether that is so or not is academic, given the findings I have made as to NAV’s support, and the further support that NAV would have offered in the event of any winding up petition.    </p>

As already noted GT accepts that this stage is not wholly independent of the earlier question whether NAV would have agreed to keep AssetCo afloat in the first instance (which has already been addressed above and taken into account), which is clearly right. However, as I have found that had funds been needed, NAV would have supplied the same, the consequence is that even if it were established (on a consideration of the Counterfactual) that a particular creditor or creditor(s) would have threatened to seek to wind up AssetCo or indeed would have gone so far as applying to do so (contrary to my findings above), it would make no difference to the outcome of the CounterfactuaI as such liabilities would have been discharged (if necessary) using NAV funds, and with NAV’s agreement, and I so find.  </p>

However on the 2010 Counterfactual, as on the 2009 Counterfactual, I am satisfied that NAV would have provided funding support through to a scheme of arrangement, which would have included the necessary costs of servicing the SOC Contract. There is the additional point (as GT recognises) that in 2010, as in 2011, it would have been possible for AssetCo to use the strategy of a pre-emptive administration application to fore-stall any winding up petition, and validation orders could have been obtained to permit essential expenditure (which could have been paid with NAV’s support). Accordingly I consider, and find, that in the 2010 Counterfactual AssetCo would not have been wound up, or gone into insolvent liquidation, in the period prior to the scheme of arrangement. </p>

In this regard I accept Mr Davies’ evidence that <span style="font-style:italic">“They were well rewarded, well incentivised and professional people … I don’t think they would have gone”.</span>  I regard GT’s suggestion that Mr White and Dr Ord would have preferred to move to a competitor without AssetCo’s “tarnished reputation” and with an existing business, as pure speculation lacking in any evidential basis. </p>

The point does not arise in 2010 as licences existed. The evidence of Mr Chatila (which I accept) is in any event that the bureaucratic process was largely one of rubber-stamping, and had the requirement existed or been enforced, there were ways in which AssetCo could have complied.

Thus in fact, there was less for Mr Shannon to “cover up” in 2009 than in 2011 and (contrary to GT’s suggestion) no incentive for him to see the company wound up in the hope that this would not be investigated. I have also found that whilst he would not have been able to carry on as a director, the evidence is that he would continue to have been employed “behind the scenes” so he had an incentive to support AssetCo.  </p>

Equally it is academic as to whether the scheme could have been structured in such a way that it did not require the support of Mr Shannon as Mr Mills suggested. It is possible to envisage the scheme being so structured, but the evidence on this was neither fully developed, nor was it pleaded, and as it is academic I do not consider it appropriate to express any findings on the point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“The first and most important rule is that the claimant must take all reasonable steps to mitigate his or her loss consequent upon the defendant’s wrong and cannot recover damages for any such loss which he or she failed, through unreasonable action or inaction, to avoid. Put shortly, the claimant cannot recover for reasonably avoidable loss. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">The second rule is the corollary of the first. It is that where the claimant does take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him consequent upon the defendant’s wrong he or she can recover for loss incurred in so doing; this is so even though the resulting damage is in the event greater than it would have been had the mitigating steps not been taken. Put shortly, the claimant can recover for loss incurred in reasonable attempts to avoid loss. </p>

In addition, where the loss has been mitigated by other reasonably foreseeable means, the claimant can again recover only for the loss as lessened. Put shortly, the claimant cannot generally recover for avoided loss.” </p>

As Robert Goff J observed in [<span style="font-style:italic">The Elena d’Amico</span>] at 88, the three rules are all aspects of the principle of causation. Thus, as I have indicated, the essential purpose of the mitigation rules is to identify, in the light of what the claimant has done or not done to avoid loss resulting from the defendant’s breach of contract or other legal wrong, which costs and benefits accruing to the claimant are to be treated as consequences of the defendant’s wrong and which are to be treated as caused by the claimant’s own action or inaction. The basic test which the doctrine of mitigation involves is whether the claimant has acted reasonably in response to the defendant’s wrong. Insofar as the claimant has acted reasonably, costs and benefits accruing to the claimant are included in the calculation of damages. Insofar as the claimant has not acted reasonably, the claimant’s damages are assessed as if it had.

Rather, as AssetCo submits, GT can only claim the benefit of the 2011 Scheme if it can prove that (i) the Scheme mitigated the losses caused by GT’s negligence (and not merely other losses); (ii) a Scheme would not have taken place but for GT’s negligence; and (iii) GT’s negligence was the legal cause of the Scheme. However none of these points has been demonstrated by GT.  </p>

First, the 2011 Scheme of Arrangement was not a step taken in mitigation of AssetCo’s losses caused by GT’s negligence and it did not enter into the Scheme to recoup or recover or reduce any of (i) the wasted expenditure, (ii) the PSA monies, (iii) the money paid away under the Jaras transaction, (iv) the 2009 and 2010 dividends, or (v) the dividends AssetCo could have taken out of AS Fire and Todd.

In this regard GT’s negligence was not the proximate, or most immediate, cause of the 2011 Scheme - which was (i) AssetCo plc’s perilous financial position; (ii) AssetCo plc’s commercial decision that it was commercially advantageous to compromise its debts and emerge as a “clean” company, ring-fenced from its subsidiaries, in order to pursue business in Abu Dhabi; and (iii) creditors’ commercial decisions that it was more advantageous to compromise their debts at 23 pence in the £ (in respect of non-group creditors) and 0.01 pence in the pound (in respect of group creditors),  than to place AssetCo into liquidation.  </p>

The Scheme was <span style="font-style:italic">res inter alios acta </span>being an independent bargain between AssetCo and creditors. Indeed, the position can be tested (as AssetCo submitted) by considering the position if AssetCo had entered into a Scheme of Arrangement in order to pursue business in Abu Dhabi, and had later sustained losses as a result of that commercial decision, it would be unable to recover such losses since they would <span style="font-style:italic">“represent the result of an independent decision based on [AssetCo’s] commercial judgment, the risk and benefit of which are for [its] own account”</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">Thai Airways</span> at [50]).

A variety of legal concepts serves to limit the matters for which a wrongdoer is legally responsible. Thus the law distinguishes between a mere precondition or occasion for a loss and an act which gives rise to a liability to make it good by way of damages: <span style="font-style:italic">Galoo Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray</span> [1994] 1 WLR 1360. Effective or substantial causation is a familiar example of a legal filter which serves to eliminate certain losses from the scope of a defendant’s responsibility. It is an aspect of legal causation.… But the relevant filters are not limited to those which can be analysed in terms of causation. Ultimately, all of them depend on a developed judicial instinct about the nature or extent of the duty which the wrongdoer has broken”. </p>

In both cases the decision was that the auditor was not liable for the increase in the company’s deficiency arising after the date when a careful audit should have led to the appointment of a receiver or liquidation. The decisions were based on want of causation but as Lord Hoffmann himself has pointed out (lecture to the Chancery Bar Association 15 June 1999) the same result might (even might better) have been reached by application of the ‘scope of duty’ concept. In both <span style="font-style:italic">Cambridge Credit</span> (the majority) and <span style="font-style:italic">Galoo</span> the courts applied an ultimate test of whether ‘as a matter of common sense’ the relevant act of omission was a cause. ‘Common sense’ is, however, an uncertain guide. One man’s common sense may be another’s nonsense. But if an auditor simply as such is not to be liable for losses arising from the audited company’s continued existence (which as the law stands is, I think, undoubtedly the case) I find it difficult to discern any distinction of substance which could justify liability for a failure to sell itself and so to realise the then value of whatever assets a company had.” </p>

My Lord, the answer to that is the same as the point that we have just been discussing, the Jaras payment is part of the pattern of fraud, indeed it is itself a fraudulent transaction that Grant Thornton failed to spot in 2009 and the legal cause of the loss is Grant Thornton's failure to spot that the company was being dishonestly run when they gave their opinion on the financial statements for 2009 in June 2009. It is simply a particular loss which is caused by their failure to detect fraud in 2009.  So it can form part of the 2009 claim.  Indeed, we say it does.

If, in consequence of the injuries sustained, the plaintiff has enjoyed receipts to which he would not otherwise have been entitled, prima facie, those receipts are to be set against the aggregate of the plaintiff’s losses and expenses in arriving at the measure of his damages. All this is elementary and has been said over and over again. To this basic rule there are, of course, certain well established, though not always precisely defined and delineated exceptions. But the courts are, I think, sometimes in danger, in seeking to explore the rationale of the exceptions, of forgetting that they are exceptions.

There is simply no sufficient connection in fact or in time (even recognising that benefits can accrue sometime after a breach). Equally in the context of the GT’s breaches in 2010, the proximate or effective cause of AssetCo’s decision to undertake the share placing was again its need for cash to meet what were said to be its short term funding requirements, in light of its on-going failure to achieve a debt restructuring – it being common ground that such a need existed.  </p>

Indeed they expressed concerns that the accounts would require restatements, and asked AssetCo to provide further analysis. Gartmore said it was “worried about the cash burn” and wanted “a breakdown of last year’s profits and how this translated to cash flow”.  It later asked for further information, including a “balance sheet review”. Blackrock wanted “a detailed run through on accounting procedures going forward as well as working capital commitments and LFB contract info”. Investec wanted “a firm understanding of the historic capitalisation trends and any restatements [to the accounts] that may or may not need to be made”. They were concerned that “declared profits may not represent the true picture and [AssetCo] needs to disprove that they have been aggressively capitalising costs”.  On 25 February Investec repeated its concern that “the company are going to have to restate profits”.

AssetCo says that this is not mere accounting treatment but has a real impact on the company (and its shareholders) in that the proceeds raised by share issues are accounted for by equal entries on both the assets and the equity side of the balance sheet; and in consequence the company’s pool of share capital which may not be distributed to shareholders by way of dividend is increased.

It is said that there is no principled reason why that should be the case. And that the contrary is true. It is a readily foreseeable consequence of a breach of an auditor’s duty – particularly regarding the duty to detect fraud – that the company via (dishonest) management will continue to suck in capital which will be wasted on precisely the same fraudulent or imprudent ventures as should have been uncovered by the audit.

Secondly it is doubtful whether there was even “but for” causation on a “giving credit” analysis – AssetCo’s case is that if GT had not committed the breaches it did, AssetCo would have had the PSA monies available to it and would not have wasted them. On the findings I have made (and even assuming there was an arguable case that monies were held on trust) NAV and AADL would in any event have allowed monies to be used as necessary pending a scheme of arrangement whereas, in fact, AssetCo continued to trade in a dishonest manner and squandered such monies. Thirdly, and fundamentally, GT does not even attempt to establish that its breaches legally caused any alleged benefit. Logically GT would have to say that its breaches legally caused AssetCo to <span style="text-decoration:underline">retain</span> the PSA monies such that it must give credit for them, in circumstances when in fact those breaches caused those monies to be wasted. Whether or not this is the right analysis, no basis is advanced, or made out, by GT that any benefit was legally caused by its breaches which is fatal to its submission. In such circumstances AssetCo is not required to give any credit to GT in relation to the “AADL” money. </p>

But if the delegates fail in their tasks, such that the company fails to take proper care of its own interests, their failure is to be attributed to the company and its board of directors. Where the company is a claimant, and its management failures are relevant to an issue of negligence or breach of contract, those failures are to be treated as fault for the purposes of a defence of contributory negligence.” </p>

As I have remarked, it is upon such directors and officers that the primary duty to protect the company from loss occasioned by fraud rests. […] The authorities establish that the auditor’s duty is to report to the shareholders, in particular, on the conduct of the company’s management. But the shareholders cannot escape responsibility for the conduct of those directors and officers whom they have been instrumental in appointing, directly or indirectly. The comparison here is between the degree of blameworthiness of the auditors for the negligence which I have found and that of the management of BFS for the fault, some accepted and some contested, but which I have also found to be established.” </p>

The relevant factors included the $200m fraud of Mr Al Sanea (for which the claimant was vicariously liable for the purposes of contributory fault) and the failure of the company and other directors to supervise him. On the other side of the balance, the invocation of the ‘very thing’ principle and “flagrant nature” of the breach of duty, justified the judge’s apportionment.  As was stated at [94]-[95]: </p>

The judge took into account all the appropriate factors as elements of contributory negligence, namely the supine nature of the other directors, their failure to control Mr Al Sanea, and Singularis’s vicarious liability for his actions, and concluded that the damages should be reduced by 25 per cent.”  </p>

In reply Mr Wolfson submitted that the point in relation to respective causative potency is something of a double-edged sword for AssetCo, for if the matters they identify did not cause AssetCo any loss how is it that GT’s failure to identify them itself caused AssetCo loss? </p>

This provided for just two working days between the Audit Committee meeting and the announcement of results. It is submitted that the degree of reliance the Audit Committee and NEDs placed on GT was entirely reasonable in these circumstances. GT agreed from the outset that this would be sufficient time for the Audit Committee to perform the role ascribed to it and never suggested that the meeting should be brought forward or the results materially delayed.

I do not consider that there is any merit in GT’s case in this regard. First any Competent Auditor would not have proceeded to act if inappropriate restrictions were placed on timing or remuneration. Secondly, I do not consider, on the evidence before me, that there were any such restrictions. But thirdly (and fundamentally as an independent point), GT admits that a competent auditor <span style="text-decoration:underline">in its position</span> would have conducted the Audits very differently and <span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span> have uncovered that the business of the company was ostensibly sustainable only on the basis of dishonest representations or unreasonable positions made and taken by dishonest management.

AssetCo’s case is that the business of AssetCo was being run in a thoroughly dishonest manner, and that it continued to carry on business in a way that was only sustainable on the basis of dishonest representations made by management which GT should have identified, and that it continued to trade in a particular manner in reliance upon GT’s negligently audited accounts, and that absent GT’s negligence it would have entered into a Scheme of Arrangement with all the identified steps leading up to that. AssetCo has succeeded in such case. It has also succeeded in establishing legal causation, that trading losses are recoverable as they were incurred as a result of the company continuing to trade in a particular manner in reliance upon the negligent audit. </p>

Equally I consider that AssetCo is right that the fraud would not have occurred (or would not have had any effect or relevance) had GT not itself suggested that AssetCo might adopt the inappropriate finance lease treatment (as a result of which Management seized upon the possibility of finance lease treatment and sought to take advantage of the suggestion), Management then being able to dishonestly overstate the profits, as a result of further negligence on GT’s part. </p>

Here the Management and the NEDs were at fault, as they knew the terms of the PSA yet allowed them to be dissipated otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the PSA. Prior to the 2009 Audit the failure to ring-fence was causative of the PSA monies that were expended prior to the 2009 Audit (but AssetCo brings no claim in respect of the sums already wasted at the date of the Audit). Thereafter (as I have found) GT’s own breaches were and remained an effective (legal) cause of the loss of the monies, but that does not mean that AssetCo’s continuing fault did not also have causative potency or relative blameworthiness.  The fact is that the Management and the NEDs knew of the terms of the PSA but failed to respect those terms and allowed the monies to be wasted. I consider and find that such contributory fault did have causative potency and in terms of blameworthiness GT was blameworthy given that it should have discovered such matters, but equally AssetCo was blameworthy in its failings in relation to the PSA monies. I set out my apportionment in the conclusion section below.  Having regard to the relative causal potency of their acts and relative blameworthiness I consider it just and equitable to reduce the damages recoverable in respect of the PSA monies by 35%. </p>

I have already set out AssetCo’s response to this under AssetCo’s overview points. The matters relied upon by GT are all matters in which GT failed to gather sufficient, reliable audit evidence, failed to exercise the requisite professional scepticism, wrongly deferred to Management in circumstances when its duty was to act sceptically towards them and ultimately represented that issues were resolved to their expert satisfaction. I consider that the NEDs reasonably relied upon their expert auditors in respect of such matters, and the causative potency is all with GT in this area. It is to be contrasted with GT’s reliance on the Audit Committee which GT (rightly) accepts it ought not to have placed reliance on.    </p>

Save for the fact that the monies were not in AADL accounts (and could not have been as AADL did not have a bank account), this explanation was consistent with the provisions of the loan agreement that permitted the use of up to £5m for working capital purposes.  The NEDs were then subsequently misled by Mr Shannon and told that NAV had authorised the release and use of the PSA monies, but I do not consider the NEDs were at fault in accepting that explanation.  </p>

GT failed to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect of every material audit issue raised in these proceedings, it failed to apply appropriate professional scepticism (GT admitting that had it done so this would have led to the dishonesty being discovered), and it failed to ensure that the accounts gave a true and fair view of AssetCo’s financial position. If it had acted as a Competent Auditor would have done, a Competent Auditor would have reported as I have found, and events would have turned out on the Counterfactual as occurred in 2011 but without the very substantial wasted expenditure that was incurred.

Thus, whilst being processed in 2010, what is being recognised (as an existing state of affairs) is that the amounts were irrecoverable from subsidiaries – self-evidently those amounts had not been recovered in 2009 and it was recognised that the amounts were not recoverable (leading to the need for a provision in the full amount of the debit) which was then processed in 2010. I consider that this reflects that they were not recoverable in 2009 given that (i) there is no evidence of any recoveries in 2009 and (ii) there was a recognition that there was no basis for the amounts being recoverable, which was then processed in 2010.  </p>

The ACMS management fee was paid over two transactions on 24 July (£369,907) and 31 December 2009 (£450,030).  Mr Davies’ evidence in his second witness statement is that he would not have paid similar sums or equivalent sums in 2009 or 2010 (in the counterfactual), he would not have authorised these fees to be paid in the counterfactual as any liability to AC Management Services Limited would have been compromised as part of the refinancing and restructuring, as in fact happened in 2011 – thus NAV agreed to terminate the consultancy agreement under which the management fee was due, and to waive any outstanding fees (as reflected in Clauses 6.1 and 6.4(a) of the Share Exchange Agreement dated 9 September 2011). Whilst Mr Davies was asked about this payment in cross-examination, his response was that he would have done what he did in 2011, and would not have paid it – and that answer was not challenged. I accept Mr Davies’ evidence in this regard which is also consistent with the findings I have made in relation to him “turning off the tap” in relation to the subsidiaries.  Accordingly it is expenditure which would not have occurred on the counterfactual, and which was wasted.  It was expenditure paid by AssetCo Group Limited on behalf of AssetCo plc, and as such it was a loss to AssetCo plc which it is entitled to recover in respect of (again subject to reduction for contributory fault and apportionment as addressed in Section K above). </p>

The largest is £1.45 million repaying a bridging loan.  It was put to Mr Davies that AssetCo could not contend it had suffered a loss without giving credit for the benefit of the loan. This is a legal, rather than a factual, point. The short answer is that these monies were squandered on subsidiaries like the other wasted expenditure, with the result that AssetCo bore the burden of the loan but none of the benefit. In any event, the loan was to AssetCo Fire and Rescue Limited and the repayment, and therefore the expenditure or loss, was made by AssetCo (as reflected in Mr Davies’ evidence and the validation order of Kitchen J on 21 March 2011). </p>

AS Fire and Todd were both directlyowned subsidiaries of AssetCo plc. Mr Davies’ evidence is that he would have stopped cross-subsidisation and prevented other subsidiaries using the profits earned by AS Fire and Todd, in line with his general strategy for the Group, and would instead have retained AS Fire and Todd and extracted their profits by way of dividend, pending a decision as to their disposal. Whilst Mr Davies was cross-examined about almost every surrounding paragraph in his evidence, he was not cross-examined about paragraph 152 of his first statement where such evidence is addressed.

Ms Fowler confirmed her analysis set out in the joint statement when cross-examined. Whilst Mr Cuerden did not agree with that analysis when cross-examined, I do not consider he gave any plausible explanation as to why there would be substantial transfers of cash from AS Fire/Todd to AssetCo and in such circumstances I conclude that there were no such transfers so that any inter-company balances between the companies were mere paper transactions without substance. </p>

GT’s submissions in this regard lack an air of reality (and it may be no coincidence that GT rested in closing on what it had said in opening, itself relegated to a section on “miscellaneous” matters). </p>

Its negligence was most certainly not minor or technical, and not only was it pervasive and compelling it was, as I have found, of the most serious nature. In this regard I refer back to what I have found in section K above (contributory fault).  The breaches consisted of a catalogue of failures over two audit years that were of the utmost gravity and that went to the very heart of an auditor’s duties and the ‘very thing’ GT admits it was responsible for but failed to do. This was negligent conduct of the highest order (short of recklessness) which also amounted to a breach of professional standards. As GT and Mr Napper accepted, the <span style="font-style:italic">“Misconduct fell </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">significantly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> short of the standards to be  reasonably expected of them”</span> (Sir Bernard Eder’s emphasis, which I also emphasise).   </p>

As the PSA expressly recognises, professional scepticism lies at the heart of auditors’ duties and the proper exercise of such scepticism by GT and Mr Napper would have led to the dishonesty being uncovered. In such circumstances, the significant failures of both GT and Mr Napper over an extended period not only “could” but, in my judgment, would (at the very least) be expected to undermine public confidence in Member Firms. That is, in my view, a very serious matter particularly in light of the other aspects of the Misconduct.” </p>

There is nothing in relation to the timing and audit fees point as I have already addressed in the section on contributory fault, it was part of GT’s duty to act with professional scepticism which if it had done so would have disclosed the dishonesty and that it had been misled, and AssetCo’s conduct has already been taken into account in the context of contributory negligence. </p>
