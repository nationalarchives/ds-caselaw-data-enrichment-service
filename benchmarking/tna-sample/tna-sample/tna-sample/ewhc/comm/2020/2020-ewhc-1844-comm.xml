	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">These are very substantial proceedings which have been described, not inaccurately, as being akin to divorce proceedings between three extremely wealthy Ukrainian businessmen: Mr Vitaliy Gaiduk, Mr Sergiy Taruta and Mr Oleg Mkrtchan (together, the ‘Partners’). Mr Gaiduk and Mr Taruta are also prominent in Ukrainian politics, Mr Gaiduk being a former Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine (as well as having held various other ministerial posts) and Mr Taruta being both a former Governor of Donetsk Oblast, a region which has since March 2014 been held by pro-Russian forces, and a member of the Ukrainian Parliament representing the same region. Another party, Prandicle Ltd (‘Prandicle’: the Third Third Party), is beneficially owned by Mr Oleh Dubyna, who was for a time Minister of Industrial Policy and First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine. As for Mr Mkrtchan, although amply represented by both solicitors and counsel at trial, he was unable himself to attend trial owing to the fact that he is currently in prison in Russia after a secret trial which culminated in his receiving a nine-year sentence of imprisonment in August 2019.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">By way of relatively brief background, the history of this dispute begins in 1995, when Mr Gaiduk and Mr Taruta (amongst others) founded a global portfolio of assets which came to be worth billions of dollars, including a Ukrainian metallurgical business called the Industrial Union of Donbass (‘IUD’). Mr Gaiduk was then Deputy Chair of the Donetsk Regional Council/Deputy Head of the Donetsk Oblast region, in which role he was responsible for the region’s industrial and energy sectors. Mr Taruta had enjoyed a successful career in the metallurgical business and was appointed as IUD’s first General Director.  </p>

The reason for Mr Gaiduk’s larger share was that earlier in the year it had been agreed with Mr Oleh Dubyna, who managed certain IUD-owned businesses, that he would receive a share in IUD by way of bonus. This was to be held for Mr Dubyna by Mr Gaiduk. The terms on which Mr Mkrtchan acquired his stake entail some dispute, as explained later. </p>

According to Mr Taruta, however, Mr Gaiduk’s exit was accelerated by a breakdown in his relationship with Mr Mkrtchan.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Gaiduk wanted a price of US$3 billion for his stake in IUD. Mr Taruta’s evidence was that this was an unrealistic price in the prevailing market, but that he and Mr Mkrtchan were forced to try and facilitate Mr Gaiduk’s exit so as to prevent him from selling his interest to a hostile third party. On 20 November 2007 Vizavi wrote formally to Azovintex and Region notifying them of an intention to dispose of its share in IUD at a price of approximately US$3.55 billion and offering them an opportunity to purchase the stake or to waive their pre-emption rights over it. According to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan, this was an attempt by Mr Gaiduk to force them to acquire the stake at an inflated price, when in reality (and as Mr Gaiduk accepted at trial) he had identified no alternative buyer. </p>

The FMTG MOU related back to Mr Mkrtchan’s 2006 acquisition of his one-third stake in IUD and provided for Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan to pay their US$50 million share of the dividends to Mr Gaiduk. Mr Taruta’s contribution (the ‘FMTG Payment’) was expressed as a loan to Mr Mkrtchan but the repayment terms of this loan were left blank. According to Mr Mkrtchan this is because the US$50 million payment by Mr Taruta was not, in fact, a loan at all but, in essence, the price of his 17% stake in Region, an interest which had not been disclosed to Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

At that meeting Mr Gaiduk repeated his demands for payment of US$3 billion for his interest in IUD, a form of security for the price and also a penalty if Mr </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Also at about the same time, and so again in about December 2009, shortly before the deal with VEB was due to be signed, Mr Taruta requested that he and Mr Mkrtchan enter into an agreement amending the Settlement Agreement and providing for payment by Mr Mkrtchan. The background to this was that from September 2008 the value of IUD had fallen dramatically, such that the September 2008 price of US$750 million significantly overvalued a 5.62% interest in IUD. A new price of US$281 million was, accordingly, agreed, based on a valuation at the same price per share which VEB was to pay to buy its interest in IUD (less commission). The date for payment was extended to 30 April 2010. The parties waived any claims arising under the original Settlement Agreement prior to the ‘Amended Settlement Agreement’.  </p>

On 15 December 2009, the directors of the Partners’ corporate vehicles, Avonwick, Azitio and Dargamo approved the transaction and granted powers of attorney to the relevant Partners to enter into it on their behalves. The final version of the Gaiduk sale was a deed signed on 18 December 2009 (the ‘Castlerose SPA’) which gave Azitio and Dargamo the right to acquire Avonwick’s shares in Castlerose for US$950 million. Although not clear from the face of the Castlerose SPA, it is common ground that the US$950 million price was intended to include Mr Gaiduk’s interest in a number of assets including the Hyatt Hotel, UGMK, Agro Holding and DPP. Mr Taruta’s case is that an agreement was reached, reflected in the Castlerose SPA as well as in certain other exchanges in December 2009 (the alleged ‘2009 Shareholders’ Agreement’), pursuant </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, following the acquisition of IUD, the Russian Buyer wished to acquire Gorlane Business Inc (‘Gorlane’), which owned almost 50% of Zaporozhstal Steel Works (‘Zaporozhstal’). The Russian Buyer insisted that Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan match their investment. It was agreed that Mr Mkrtchan would fund Mr Taruta’s share of the investment of US$105,825,000 through his company, Etmor Investments Ltd (‘Etmor’) (the ‘Etmor Payment’). This payment was made on 19 May 2010. Although it is common ground that this was intended as part-payment of a debt owed by Mr Mkrtchan, there is a dispute as to the nature of that debt. Mr Taruta’s position is that the payment was repayment of the US$100 million loan in respect of Mr Mkrtchan’s acquisition of Mr Gaiduk’s shares. Mr Mkrtchan’s case, on the other hand, is that there was no US$100 million debt and that the Etmor Payment constituted partpayment of the US$281 million debt under the Amended Settlement Agreement.   </p>

Mr Taruta’s case is that, in the course of these discussions, the Partners agreed that: (i) Mr Gaiduk would buy Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan’s share of 14-B Yaroslavov Val for US$15.83 million each; (ii) Mr Taruta and Mkrtchan would sell their shares in USK, a steel business, for US$42 million each; and (iii) Mr Gaiduk would transfer his interest in Transport Holding in equal shares to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan, who would in return transfer to Mr Gaiduk their interests in Construction Holding.

It is common ground that this sum constituted technical consideration. Draft documents were sent to Mrs Gaiduk for signature on 20 April 2011.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As regards NET, this had been transferred from CIG to Mr Gaiduk’s company Roselink Ltd (‘Roselink’: the Second Third Party) under arrangements by which Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan provisionally transferred their interests to Mr Gaiduk in discharge of US$100 million of their debt to him. On 12 April 2012 Roselink entered into a SPA with Pontena Holdings (‘Pontena’), a company owned by Mr Mkrtchan, to transfer 49.99% of its interest in NET (the ‘Roselink-Pontena SPA’). This agreement provided for technical consideration of US$13,400,900. This sum was paid, and the shares were transferred to Pontena. Mr Gaiduk claims to have been ready and willing to transfer the other 50% of NET to Mr Taruta but that Mr Taruta made no attempt to conclude a SPA. This is denied by Mr Taruta, who states that he was, in fact, pressing for the transfer of NET. An SPA between Roselink and Prandicle, Mr Dubyna’s corporate vehicle, was executed on 11 September 2012 (the ‘Roselink-Prandicle SPA’), whereby Prandicle acquired 24.5% of NET for the price of US$6.5 million, that money having been lent by a Gaiduk company, Sputnick Ltd, to Blake Industries Services Ltd (‘Blake’) which, then, lent it to Prandicle.

Between 2012 and 2015 Mr Taruta’s representatives made some effort to contact Mr Gaiduk regarding the transfer of the above assets, although there is some dispute as to the extent of those efforts. In the event, in 2013, the Russian Buyer brought arbitral proceedings against the vehicles of Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan that were heard in London in 2015. This seems to have prompted Mr Taruta to enlist Mr Mkhitar Madoyan, an exemployee of IUD, to help in recovering the alleged debts from Mr Mkrtchan. Mr Madoyan suggested that Mr Taruta engage the services of a Moscow-based organisation called Za Spravedlivost (‘For Justice’ in English). On 18 November 2015, Mr Taruta signed a co-operation agreement with Za Spravedlivost, which provided for Za Spravedlivost’s assistance in recovering US$281 million from Mr Mkrtchan, and the shareholdings to which Mr Taruta was allegedly entitled under the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the Further Shareholders’ Agreement. Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan allege that Mr Madoyan was a former associate of the powerful criminal Mr Aslan Usoyan, and that Za Spravedlivost is a criminal organisation with close links to the Chechen mafia.  </p>

Most notable amongst these, again as will become apparent, are the causation and loss issue in the context of the Price Representation case.

Albeit that in opening Mr Neil Calver QC, on behalf of the Gaiduk Parties, observed that this is <span style="font-style:italic">“a relatively straightforward commercial claim, which has been made to look much more complicated than it is”</span>, it is probably helpful to pause at this juncture and highlight the fact that it is the Gaiduk Parties’ case that, Mr Mkrtchan having come to Mr Gaiduk in June 2009 to inform him that he and Mr Taruta had found a Russian Buyer for Mr Gaiduk’s stake in IUD at a price of US$750 million, being the best price he and Mr Taruta could get in the current market, the Court should conclude that, the Price Representation having thereby been made, Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan ruthlessly took financial advantage of the trust which Mr Gaiduk placed in them when they subsequently, in December 2009, through their respective corporate vehicles, Dargamo and Azitio, ‘flipped’ Avonwick’s 33.84% interest in IUD to the Russian Buyer at a vast profit to themselves, the Russian Buyer paying them US$2.74 billion for the 50% + 2 share stake in circumstances where Avonwick (and so Mr Gaiduk) received a more modest US$750 million.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As Mr Calver QC put it, whatever the precise words which were used, the message that Mr Mkrtchan must have intended to convey, and did convey, in the June 2009 Meeting was unequivocal: that the three Partners were all being treated equally so far as price was concerned and the price being paid to Avonwick represented its <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> share of the price being paid by the Russian Buyer. That, Mr Calver QC submitted, was a lie which was relied upon by Mr Gaiduk (and Avonwick) in not inquiring any further about the price being paid by the Russian Buyer and instead proceeding on the basis that US$750 million represented Avonwick’s <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> share of the price being paid by the Russian Buyer for the shares in IUD. As a result, Mr Calver QC submitted, Avonwick should be awarded damages for the loss that it suffered, measured by reference to the difference between the price paid for its shares by the Taruta Parties and the Mkrtchan Parties and the much higher price for which the same shares were on-sold to the Russian Buyer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It was Mr Calver QC’s submission that the Avonwick Claim had clearly been made out and so that there should be judgment in favour of the Gaiduk Parties in relation to it. He highlighted, in particular, how it was common ground at trial as between Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan (and, indeed, Mr Petrov who was present also at the June 2009 Meeting) that the purpose of the meeting was to negotiate the price for which Mr Gaiduk’s stake would be acquired, Mr Mktchan telling Mr Gaiduk that the Russian Buyer would be acquiring 50% +1 share of IUD, including Mr Gaiduk’s 33.08% stake, and that at the start of the meeting they spoke to Mr Taruta on the telephone during which conversation Mr Taruta indicated that Mr Mkrtchan would be speaking on his behalf at the meeting – indeed, that Mr Taruta indicated that he would accept whatever price Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan agreed.  </p>

Mr Calver QC added in this regard that Mr Gaiduk’s account of what was said about price at the meeting is corroborated by the events of April and May 2016, specifically the fact that, after Mr Gaiduk was told by Mr Mkrtchan about the price paid under the VEB SPA, he immediately approached Mr Taruta and, having done so, in response Mr Taruta did not suggest that Mr Gaiduk already knew what price Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan were to receive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, Mr Foxton QC and Mr Wolfson QC submitted, Avonwick faces the further problem that it would have made no commercial sense for Mr Gaiduk to get the same price per share as Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta since Mr Gaiduk was selling a minority interest in IUD, and giving minimal warranties, in exchange for an immediate cash payment and a quick and clean exit from IUD with no ongoing involvement in its management, whereas Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta were selling a majority interest in IUD, giving extensive warranties and undertaking other obligations to convince VEB to invest in what was at the time a financially troubled business.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Indeed, this is why, Mr Wolfson QC in particular highlighted, in 2013 Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta had to defend themselves (successfully) in certain LCIA arbitration proceedings brought by VEB on the warranties which they had been required to give to VEB. It is also why, Mr Wolfson QC added, Mr Mkrtchan was not able to attend the trial, Mr Mkrtchan having (seemingly at least), subsequently and as a result of his involvement with VEB, a Russian State-owned bank, fallen foul of the Russian state with the consequence that he now finds himself convicted and imprisoned by a Russian Court for allegedly defrauding VEB. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In these circumstances, Mr Foxton QC and Mr Wolfson QC submitted that it would have been obvious to all the Partners in 2009 that Mr Gaiduk had struck a different bargain for a different price and with different purchasers (Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan) when compared with that struck by Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan with VEB. So, they suggested, any suggestion that they would all be getting the same price per share would have been absurd. Nor, they went on to submit, is it realistic to suppose that an experienced businessman such as Mr Gaiduk would have agreed to the price of US$750 million for his interest in IUD without any negotiation, merely on the faith of the Price Representation which he alleges was made.  </p>

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses’ motives and to the overall probabilities can be of very great assistance to a judge in ascertaining the truth.” </span>

In this respect, it is worth bearing in mind the observations concerning the fallibility of memory which were made by Leggatt J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Gestmin SGPS SA v Credit Suisse (UK) Limited</span> [2013] EWHC 3560 (Comm) at [16]-[22], another authority which it has become customary now to cite in this context, specifically that it would be a mistake to suppose not only that, the stronger and more vivid is our recollection, the more likely it is to be accurate, but also that, the more confident that a person is in his or her recollection, the more likely it is that their recollection is accurate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In addition, again as pointed out by Leggatt J, external information, as well as a person’s thoughts and beliefs, can intrude into a witness’s memory. Events can come to be recalled which did not happen at all. Perhaps more commonly, a person’s assumptions as to a state of affairs, or their interpretations of events, can come to be recalled as memories of what in fact happened. Furthermore, as explained by Leggatt J, memory is particularly vulnerable to interference when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where it is already weak due to the passage of time. The process of civil litigation can frequently exacerbate this tendency. In particular, the preparation of witness statements has the effect of establishing in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events. It is for these reasons, amongst others, that Leggatt J concluded at [22] that: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“…the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses' recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts. This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. However, its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which crossexamination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.” </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">That must be right. Nonetheless, in this case (as in many other such cases) it is of particular importance to have regard to the contemporaneous documents, the parties’ motives and the inherent probabilities. That, indeed, was the very point made by Teare J at [11]-[12] in the same case. As noted above, the key events took place between 2008 and 2010. Much of the dispute turns on the contents of undocumented conversations. Each of the factual witnesses was either a party to the action or, if not themselves a party, a long-serving employee or associate of one of the parties. The passage of time, combined with the natural tendency to reconstruct memories in a selective and self-serving way, means that the witnesses’ recollection of those events ought probably not to be too readily accepted. The more so, since I am clear that each of the main witnesses sought, on occasion, to tailor their evidence to suit their case or the case of the party on whose behalf they were called.  </p>

On a number of occasions, it appeared that a witness was being deliberately evasive, only for it to transpire that problems of interpretation had led to a misunderstanding between the witness and counsel. There were also several instances where a witness was cross-examined about the English translation of a Russian-language document, only for the interpreter to indicate that a word or phrase in that document could (and sometimes should) have been translated differently, so as to alter the meaning and significance of the document as a whole.

At the end of December 2009, Mr Gaiduk received US$950 million under the terms of the Castlerose SPA, of which US$150 million was referable to the shares in NET. In 2011-2012 Mr Gaiduk took steps to transfer 49.99% of the shares to Mr Mkrtchan, and 24.5% to Mr Dubyna.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">These steps are obviously inconsistent with Mr Gaiduk believing that the Russian Buyer had paid for and was entitled to 100% of the shares in NET. Mr Gaiduk’s explanation was that in 2012 Mr Mkrtchan had told him that the Russian Buyer no longer required the hotel.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">However, there are two further problems with the evidence. The US$150 million valuation of NET had been calculated by reference to a debt owed on a US$29.5 million loan from the International Finance Corporation (‘IFC’). In June 2011 the shareholders decided to repay this loan in full ahead of schedule. However, there would have been no reason to reduce NET’s debt if the Hyatt Hotel had already been promised to and paid for by the Russian Buyer, with the debt priced in. Mr Gaiduk’s explanation in cross-examination was that the Russian Buyer <span style="font-style:italic">“would have paid more”</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In July 2018 Mr Taruta was interviewed by Russian authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into Mr Mkrtchan, which has since led to his imprisonment. The transcript of that interview was obtained by the Mkrtchan Parties during the trial and disclosed to the other parties. However, the first page of the interview was omitted and it was not apparent from the face of the document when or where the interview took place. The Taruta Parties were, therefore, asked to explain the circumstances in which this interview came about. In a letter sent by Mr Taruta’s solicitors, Hogan Lovells LLP (‘Lovells’), on 17 October 2019, it was said that:  <span style="font-style:italic">“Following repeated requests, including from the Chairman of VEB, Mr Taruta ultimately agreed to meet with the investigator Mr Miniahmetov, in Minsk in July 2018 … The meeting took place at a restaurant over lunch, and lasted around one and a half hours … He left Minsk later that day.”</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Taruta was cross-examined extensively on these contradictions. His oral evidence was that he had flown to Minsk and then travelled by car to the Belarus-Russia border, where he had met the investigator in a restaurant. He was adamant that he had not crossed the border because <span style="font-style:italic">“post-2014, when I became the governor, and I have been quite vociferous in my criticism on Russian policies, I could have run into problems”</span>. The meeting had not lasted three hours, he said, because he was rushing back to Minsk to catch his return flight. Mr Taruta explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“Lunch doesn’t necessarily mean specific time of the day, it means sitting around the table with food on it”</span>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As it transpired, Mr Taruta’s solicitors had failed (albeit entirely innocently) accurately to record Mr Taruta’s account. A note of the meeting with Mr Taruta was disclosed and showed that he had, indeed, told his solicitors that he had travelled from Minsk to the Russia-Belarus border. The Belarussian authorities have since provided confirmation that Mr Taruta flew into Minsk at around lunchtime on 19 July 2018 and flew out later that night. It follows that many of the inconsistencies seized upon by the Gaiduk and Mkrtchan Parties were not quite what they seemed. However, it remains the case that his continued claim that he was not sure whether he crossed the border into Russia was unconvincing. The hotel where the interview took place is approximately 40 minutes’ drive from the border. Mr Taruta would obviously have </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Perhaps more telling, however, are the inconsistencies between the evidence given by Mr Taruta in the interview with the Russian investigator and his evidence in these proceedings. For example, an important issue as between Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan, addressed later in context, concerns the terms on which Mr Mkrtchan acquired his share in IUD from Mr Taruta. Mr Taruta’s case is that they agreed that payment would be deferred and that Mr Taruta would acquire 17% of Region as security for that debt. However, this is contradicted by Mr Taruta’s statement to the Russian investigator as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">This is consistent with Mr Mkrtchan’s account, which is that Mr Taruta agreed to transfer his shares on the condition that he acquired a stake in Region, thereby effectively transferring a smaller stake in IUD to Mr Mkrtchan free of charge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">A further and, perhaps, even more striking example concerns the role played by ‘Za Spravedlivost’, the Russian organisation engaged by Mr Taruta to resolve his disputes with the other Partners.

Indeed, Mr Taruta gave no satisfactory explanation for his decision to hire Za Spravedlivost, rather than seeking to recover the debt through what might be described as more usual channels. Whilst I recognise that there is no evidence of actual or intended criminality on the part of Mr Taruta or his representatives, and no suggestion that violence was used or explicitly threatened, it is improbable that Mr Taruta neither knew about nor intended to exploit Za Spravedlivost’s rumoured criminal links as leverage in his negotiations with Mr Mkrtchan.  </p>

Nonetheless, I do accept that where the parties positively rely on the involvement of those individuals (the non-witnesses) as evidence in support of their case (for example, Mr Taruta’s assertion that Mr Pisarevsky possesses the documents concerning Mr Bakai), that is evidence which it would be wrong too readily to assume would have been substantiated had the witnesses, in fact, been called, and so to consider whether there is documentary evidence which is supportive or whether the inherent probabilities provide such support. However, it would not be appropriate, in my view, to draw adverse inferences from the mere fact that particular witnesses were not called to give evidence in circumstances where the same criticism can be made of each party. </p>

This apparently prompted Mr Gaiduk to delete the documents in question. It was also revealed in July 2018 that in 2012 Mr Petrov had given a one-off instruction in 2012 to wipe all emails from his CIG account and transfer them to a device. This device subsequently stopped working and the data was lost. This amounts to a persistent pattern of data deletion. However, given that most of these documents were deleted in 2012 or earlier, it would be wrong to infer that there was a deliberate decision on the part of the Gaiduk Parties’ deliberately to conceal or destroy evidence relevant to these proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">By contrast, there is some suggestion that the Mkrtchan Parties did take deliberate steps to destroy evidence after proceedings were issued. On 12 June 2018 the Taruta Parties made an application for specific disclosure in relation to devices belonging to Ms Shchygolyeva, Mr Molchanov, Ms Strilko and Ms Buzovskaya. At a CMC on 16 July 2018, the Mkrtchan Parties were ordered to search those devices, which included four desktop computers. However, it was subsequently revealed that in late June or early July, the hard drives of those computers had been erased and replaced. That this occurred shortly after the issue of the Taruta Parties’ application (and long after the Mkrtchan Parties came under an obligation to preserve documents), raises the distinct possibility that it was done to prevent adverse documents from coming to light.  </p>

If I am right about this, then, it seems to me that this authority is probably of less assistance on the facts of the present case than it might be on other facts. Put shortly, the fact that in the present case precisely the same claims which are brought against Mr Mkrtchan are brought against the other three defendants (Azitio, Dargamo and Mr Taruta), and those will all be tried under English law, is of somewhat lesser significance. The more so, in my view, given that it is not English law which is applicable by virtue of Article 4(1) but the law of Cyprus since the fact that Cypriot law and English law are to be treated as identical in this case cannot, in such circumstances, amount to a reason why Cypriot law should not be displaced in favour of Ukrainian law. For this reason, I do not base my decision concerning Article 4(3) on this further consideration. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“According to Recital (30) to the Regulation culpa in contradendo is an autonomous concept and should not necessarily be interpreted within the meaning of national law. The Recital goes on to point out that it should include ‘the violation of the duty of disclosure and the break-down of contractual negotiations’. But, Art. 12 ‘covers only non-contractual obligations presenting a direct link with the dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract. The means that if, while a contract is being negotiated, a person suffers personal injury, Art.4 or other relevant provisions of this Regulation should apply’. The terminology and these various observations suggest that Art.12 will apply to fault based claims, for example, to non-disclosure, fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations and duress which occur during the negotiation of a contract. Accordingly other types of claim, for example a claim for the value of services provided in anticipation of a contract, may fall outside Art.12, and within other provisions of the Regulation (notably, Art.10 dealing with unjust enrichment). Equally, however, these observations emphasise that the ‘culpa’ in whatever form must occur in the context of negotiations with a view to concluding a contract. Thus Art.12 would not, it seems, apply in a case where (for example) a misrepresentation is made outside contractual negotiations or where a third party relies on a representation made in connection with a contract concluded between the representor and a different party. Such cases will fall, normally, within Art.4. Finally, as the principal connecting factor under Art.12 is the law applicable to a contract (or putative contract), its application may be restricted to claims between the parties (or prospective parties) to that contract, and not against any third party (e.g. an agent) involved in the pre-contractual dealings.”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“As the primary connecting factor within Art 12 is the law applicable to a contract, either concluded or contemplated, there is a strong argument for restricting its scope to claims between the (intended) parties to the contract so as to exclude (for example) a claim for damages by one of the parties against the issuer of securities that he has purchased on the market or the agent of another for misrepresentation or as a false procurator. There may, of course, be good reasons for concluding that claims against an agent, whether in contract or in tort/delict, should be governed under the Rome I Regime or Art 4 of the Rome II Regulation by the law of the contract (lex contractus), especially if he has taken an active part in negotiations conducted on the basis of drafts containing a choice of law provision. Art 12, however, would appear to contemplate an existing or contemplated contractual relationship between the parties to the non-contractual obligation. That view is consistent, for example, with the approach taken under English law to liability for misrepresentation, providing a separate claim for damages as between the contracting parties only. …”.</span>

There was no requirement as a matter of law, that the representee should state in terms that he would not have made the contract but for the misrepresentation but the absence of such a statement was part of the overall evidential picture from which the judge had to ascertain whether there was inducement or not. The fact that there were other reasons (besides the representation) for the claimant to have made the contract did not mean that he was not induced by the representation made. Insofar as Reynell v Sprye had said that there was no need for evidence from the claimant or that it was sufficient if the claimant ‘might’ have made the contract, if there had been no representation, that did not represent the law at any rate if ‘might’ meant something different from ‘influencing’ his decision in deciding whether to make the contract.”</span> 191.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Longmore LJ went on at [45] to say this: </p>

If it means no more than being actively present in the mind of the representee to repeat the phrase of Bowen LJ, it is perhaps a convenient shorthand. However, if it means that the court cannot make up its mind on inducement and, therefore, decides as a matter of law to give the representee the benefit of the doubt, it is not a helpful concept because that would be contrary to the law as I conceive it to be, see para 32 above, which requires the representee to prove inducement albeit with the assistance of a presumption that ‘will be very difficult to rebut’.

It is fair to call this a presumption of inducement. However, it is a presumption of fact which can be rebutted, not a presumption of law which cannot be rebutted or can only be rebutted in a particular way.

As he was giving his oral evidence, however, asked about the inconsistency between the originally pleaded case and the more recent amendment, Mr Gaiduk produced his account of key features of his sale of the Castlerose Interest being outlined by Mr Mkrtchan at two different meetings, despite the fact that in his written evidence, when referring to further meetings with Mr Mkrtchan around the middle or end of June 2009, he made no suggestion that any significant features of the transaction were changed after the initial June 2009 Meeting or that the structure of the transaction changed after that meeting.  </p>

Mr Gaiduk explained in response to this that paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Particulars of Claim relate to two different meetings: the first being concerned with the June 2009 Meeting, the second relating to <span style="font-style:italic">“the next meeting, when we discussed how to do it technically …”</span>. He, then, went on to say that it was at the first meeting that the proposal was made that Avonwick should sell its indirect interest in IUD (via a sale of its shareholding in Castlerose) directly to the Russian Buyer. However, when being cross-examined by Mr Wolfson QC three days later and asked how this was consistent with his having stated in his first witness statement that he <span style="font-style:italic">“was never asked if Avonwick was willing to provide more extensive warranties to the Russian Buyer or if Avonwick would be willing to sell part of its interest in ISD together with Azitio and Dargamo directly to the Russian Buyer”</span>, his answer was rather less than compelling.  </p>

The partners first had to buy my share, so that having owned 100% they would have sold a controlling shareholding … At my first meeting, Mkrtchan said ‘majority shareholding’ and nothing about a controlling package.

I am, accordingly, satisfied that it was not the case that at the June 2009 Meeting he was told that the Russian Buyer only wanted a majority interest, which it could get by way of direct transfers from Dargamo, Azitio and Avonwick, and that it was only at a subsequent June meeting that he was told that the Russian Buyer wanted a controlling interest.  </p>

This is not merely a pleading point, however, since the inconsistency highlighted by Mr Foxton QC inevitably impacts on the credibility of the Gaiduk Parties’ case that the Price Representation was made. A controlling interest could not be transferred directly from Dargamo, Azitio and Avonwick. Nor did the documents subsequently produced (specifically the 15 June ‘Iris’ Shareholders’ Agreement term sheet) reflect an intention that Mr Gaiduk should sell to the Russian Buyer and then remain as an ongoing shareholder in IUD along with the Russian Buyer, Dargamo and Azitio.  </p>

It follows, as was explored with Mr Gaiduk in cross-examination, that the total consideration received by Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan for 100% of IUD would have been US$24 billion (US$6 billion and US$18 billion), or US$240 million per 1%. Mr Gaiduk, by contrast, stood to receive a price per 1% of approximately US$89 million (calculated by reference to the US$3 billion he was to have received for his 33.84% interest).

Once he had achieved a satisfactory price, it is entirely understandable that he would not have concerned himself with the possibility that his Partners might, then, turn a profit on any related transaction. By contrast, in 2009 Mr Gaiduk was presented with a much lower price and told that there was no room for negotiation. In those circumstances, it is, in my view, much more likely that he would wish to know that everyone was, as it were, “<span style="font-style:italic">in the same boat</span>”. Moreover, the two deals were not directly comparable. I am not, therefore, persuaded, on balance, that the Evraz merger particularly assists one way or the other.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">This leads to a closely related second point. A central argument advanced by the Gaiduk Parties was that it would be inconceivable for Mr Gaiduk not to have asked about the price. The Defendants’ answer to this was to make the point that, since Mr Gaiduk was looking for a “<span style="font-style:italic">clean break</span>”, he did not wish to give warranties or indemnities in relation to IUD, but instead was simply looking to extricate himself from his relationship with Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan as quickly and cleanly as possible. This was said to explain his willingness to accept the price of US$750 million without further negotiation. I cannot agree with that, however, because I am clear that, whilst Mr Gaiduk may have been willing to accept a lower price in order to facilitate a “<span style="font-style:italic">clean break</span>”, I do not consider that he would have been so eager to exit the business that he would do so on disadvantageous terms. I will come on later, however, to deal with the broader warranties/indemnities point since it is one upon which significant reliance was placed by the Defendants.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The third related point advanced by the Defendants is that by June 2009 the relationship had broken down to such an extent that Mr Gaiduk would never have trusted Mr Mkrtchan if he had made the Price Representation. The Defendants rely, in particular, on Mr Petrov’s evidence that Mr Gaiduk felt that he had been taken advantage of when he discovered the scale of the 2008 withdrawals. I cannot accept this point either, however, since, even if there was some ill feeling between the Partners by the time of the June 2009 Meeting, as I consider there was, it is unrealistic to suppose that Mr Gaiduk would, as a result, have doubted everything that he was told by them, particularly if it was consistent with what he might have expected. The Partners had worked together for many years and had, as is common ground, enjoyed in that time a relationship of trust and confidence. Furthermore, if Mr Gaiduk did, in fact, mistrust Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta, then, it seems to me that he would have been wary of any attempt by them to exploit the situation, which would have made it more, not less, likely that he would have sought confirmation of the price being paid by the Russian Buyer. Again, however, the mistrust point is one to which I shall return.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Mkrtchan admits, in short, that he told Mr Gaiduk that there was a Russian Buyer of their stakes but that the way in which the transaction would be structured would be by way of a sale of the Gaiduk Parties’ interest to Azitio and Dargamo and, then, a sale of that stake (together with 8.5% stakes of both Azitio and Dargamo) to the Russian Buyer at around the same time. The issue between the Gaiduk Parties and the Mkrtchan Parties is as to whether Mr Mkrtchan also told Mr Gaiduk (and Mr Petrov) that they would be paid the same price per share. This, in circumstances where Mr Mkrtchan admits in the Mkrtchan Parties’ Defence that he told them that<span style="font-style:italic"> “the price that was being offered to Avonwick was determined by the position of the Russian Buyer”</span> but not otherwise and not, as the Gaiduk Parties would have it, that Mr Gaiduk was told that he would be paid US$750 million for his shareholding, that this was the best price that Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta could obtain in the market, that there was a Russian Buyer for the combined majority stake whose identity could not be revealed and that Mr Gaiduk would receive the same price proportionate for the share that he was selling as Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan would receive for theirs.  </p>

Specifically, Mr Calver QC highlighted how Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan met in their offices in Donetsk in June 2009, before Mr Mkrtchan left for Kiev to discuss matters with Mr Gaiduk, in order to agree a price with Mr Gaiduk in order that the deal with the Russian Buyer could be progressed or, as Mr Taruta somewhat inaccurately characterised it, in order to renegotiate the price under the Evraz deal.  </p>

Moreover, as also acknowledged by Mr Taruta, the agreement which he and Mr Mkrtchan reached at the meeting was arrived at by reference to their knowledge of what the Russian Buyer was willing to pay.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The first of these notes was made, so Mr Taruta explained, in either September or December 2009. It shows Mr Taruta giving <span style="font-style:italic">“2500”</span> as the price payable by the Russian Buyer less the commission to Mr Bakai. From this, he deducted the US$750 million payable to Mr Gaiduk, indicating this with <span style="font-style:italic">“Gaiduk (33.84%)”</span> on one side and <span style="font-style:italic">“22.16”</span> as the price for 1% of that interest. Mr Taruta then writes <span style="font-style:italic">“16.6”</span> in order to reflect the share which he and Mr Mkrtchan were selling to the Russian Buyer. Next to this, the figure <span style="font-style:italic">“1750”</span> appears, i.e. US$2.5 billion (the proceeds from the Russian Buyer transaction) less US$750 million (what was to be paid to Mr Gaiduk). Alongside this is <span style="font-style:italic">“105.42”</span>, which is the price for 1% of IUD calculated by reference to the fact that the price for 16.6% is US1.75 billion. Mr Taruta, then, averaged 105.42 (the price per share received by himself and Mr Mkrtchan) and 22.16 (the price per share received by Mr Gaiduk), so as to arrive at a <span style="font-style:italic">“63.79”</span> blended figure, before, then, giving US$361 million as 5.66% multiplied by that blended figure.  </p>

Similarly, he again took a figure of <span style="font-style:italic">“1750” </span>for the cash that he and Mr Mkrtchan were to receive from the Russian Buyer. Although the value produced for Mr Gaiduk’s stake is not the same but a little lower since it uses 33.4% rather than 33.84% as the basis of the calculation, the figures are much the same.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Importantly, so Mr Calver QC submitted, what this second note shows (like the earlier note) is that Mr Taruta was thinking about the transaction in terms of the price per share that would be received by all the participants, that he was connecting the two transactions and that no distinction in his mind fell to be made between majority and minority interests in IUD, with no minority discount being applied. This is significant, Mr Calver QC went on to submit, for at least two reasons: first, because it demonstrates that Mr Gaiduk’s interest in knowing what price per share was going to be paid was entirely to be expected; and secondly, because it shows that Mr Taruta, and so also Mr Mkrtchan, were trying to generate as much profit as possible from what was, in essence, a ‘flip’ transaction and were calculating that profit by reference to the price per share. It does not, in my view, follow from this, however, that the Price Representation was made. On the contrary, it seems to me that the handwritten notes make it neither more nor less likely that the Price Representation was made.  </p>

This is because whether the Price Representation was made or not ultimately depends on an assessment as to what is likely to have been stated during the course of the June 2009 Meeting, and that is an issue on which little (if any) light is cast by evidence such as this.

It is much more likely that, instead, he agreed and stated simply that Mr Mkrtchan would be negotiating on his behalf as well as on his own behalf. The more so, in circumstances where Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta had acted jointly in offering to buy Mr Gaiduk’s stake in 2008.  </p>

There are, in my view, however, a number of difficulties with that case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The first, and probably most significant, such difficulty is that I am not persuaded that, had Mr Mkrtchan said what he admits saying, Mr Gaiduk (and Mr Petrov) would necessarily, then, have followed up by doing as Mr Calver QC suggested he (or they) would have done, which is to ask what price Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan (or their companies) were to receive from the Russian Buyer. On the contrary, it seems to me that, if Mr Mkrtchan did, indeed, tell Mr Gaiduk and Mr Petrov that <span style="font-style:italic">“the price that was being offered to Avonwick was determined by the position of the Russian Buyer”</span>, then, Mr Gaiduk (and Mr Petrov) would very likely have accepted this without following up with the type of question which, if the Gaiduk Parties’ case is to succeed, needs to have been posed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I appreciate that it is not accepted by Mr Gaiduk (and Mr Petrov) that Mr Mkrtchan said what he admits saying, and so that it is not strictly part of the Gaiduk Parties’ case that he did so, but it is instructive that the questions put to Mr Taruta in crossexamination by Mr Calver QC, as set out earlier, took as their starting point the fact that Mr Mkrtchan did, indeed, say what he admits saying and, in my view, understandably so since I consider that it is likely that Mr Mkrtchan said it. Although Mr Mkrtchan did not attend trial, for reasons which have previously been explained, and nor did he prepare a witness statement, for the same reasons, the fact that he made the admission which he did in his Defence is, in my view, significant. He did not merely deny what had been alleged, as he could have done, but was very specific in making the admission which he did.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">That admission seems to me, in the circumstances, to have an authenticity which ought not to be too readily dismissed. I consider, in short, that Mr Mkrtchan did, indeed, say what he admits saying and that, having done so, neither Mr Gaiduk nor Mr Petrov felt any necessity to ask a follow-up question. Although Mr Calver QC suggested, only really in passing, that what Mr Mkrtchan admits saying could reasonably be understood as an admission that US$750 million was his proportionate share of the price that he, Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan (or their companies) were going to be paid by the Russian Buyer, the Price Representation case is not an implied representation case but an express representation case and, as such, must stand or fall on the Gaiduk Parties being able to establish that Mr Mkrtchan went further than he admits and represented that all three of them were to be paid the same price per share. There is no scope for implication in such circumstances. Nor, in any event, do I consider that Mr Calver QC was right when he suggested that the words which Mr Mkrtchan admits using carry with them such an implication. </p>

This is something which both Mr Petrov (in his witness statement) and Mr Gaiduk (in cross-examination) confirmed in evidence and is suggestive of at least an element of mistrust creeping into the relationship between Mr Gaiduk, on the one hand, and Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan, on the other.  </p>

This, despite the fact that it was Mr Petrov’s evidence that, after the June 2009 Meeting and two further meetings the same month, <span style="font-style:italic">“As usual, I recorded the matters discussed at the June 2009 Meeting and the subsequent meetings outlined above in a MoU”</span>.

Had the Price Representation been made, I am quite clear that it would not merely have been mentioned but that it would have featured with a significant degree of prominence, probably, indeed, as a term in the MOU or the Castlerose SPA providing that Mr Gaiduk would be paid the same price per share as Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta were to receive.  </p>

Thus, although it should be pointed out right away that only some documents were produced and that in respect of others privilege was maintained, it was Mr Kravets’ evidence that Mr Petrov told him orally in June 2009, shortly after the June 2009 Meeting, that Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta wanted to buy Mr Gaiduk’s minority interest in IUD and proposed to sell a majority interest to a Russian Buyer.

Both these documents, therefore, did what no document did in relation to the Price Representation, which was to make reference to a representation having been made.

Clearly, with such a starting point, the differences are not as significant as they are if the assumption made by Mr Calver QC is not made and, instead, the Court proceeds with a more open mind as to what Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan were doing in June 2009. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The first of the differences highlighted by both Mr Foxton QC and Mr Wolfson QC concerns the fact that, whereas what Mr Gaiduk sold to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan was a minority stake in IUD, what Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan sold to the Russian Buyer was a majority stake, albeit that this largely comprised the stake which they purchased from Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">As a general proposition, not really disputed by Mr Calver QC, a majority stake would have been more valuable to the Russian Buyer than a minority stake. I agree with Mr Foxton QC and Mr Wolfson QC, therefore, that it was inherently unlikely that Mr Gaiduk would receive the same price per share for his Castlerose Interest as the Russian Buyer was paying for a majority and controlling stake. Mr Calver QC’s submission was, rather, that in this particular case the Court should proceed on the basis that the various buyers under the VEB SPA were not acquiring a majority stake. Whilst that might well, strictly speaking, be right since there were, in fact, as Mr Calver QC put it, multiple ‘Russian Buyers’, the submission nonetheless overlooks the reality that what Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan sold was a majority stake to entities which, as a result of the transaction, overall acquired that majority stake and so control of IUD. It is artificial, in my view, to suggest otherwise.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">There is, however, more substance in Mr Calver QC’s submission that the two transactions were treated as a single, overall transaction and, as such, Mr Gaiduk’s minority sale to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan ought to be regarded as part of the overall onward majority sale to the Russian Buyer, so as to mean that the distinction between minority and majority stakes is less significant than would otherwise be the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It is instructive, indeed, in this context, that Mr Gaiduk’s initial understanding as to what was proposed was consistent with the way that the Russian Buyer itself viewed the transaction, in the sense that there was a single transaction by which Mr Gaiduk’s stake was being sold to the Russian Buyer, as reflected in the term sheet with the Russian Buyer until at least 15 June 2009 and in early drafts of the VEB SPA which envisaged a direct payment to Avonwick for the Castlerose shares right up until 13 December 2009, just a few days before execution of the Castlerose SPA, when the relevant provision (Clause 3.2.1) was revised to provide that Azitio and Dargamo would pay Avonwick for the Castlerose interest using funds provided by the Russian purchasers.

The statement was made, it is clear, in order to enable Mr Gaiduk to distance himself politically from the transaction at a time when it would not have been helpful to him, from a political perspective, for the people of Ukraine to be under the impression that he had sold his shareholding to a purchaser which was Russian. As he put it, he was<span style="font-style:italic"> “not offering the people of Ukraine an account of the legal structure of the transaction” </span>but <span style="font-style:italic">“assuring them that the real purchaser of [his] shares was not the Russian Buyer but [his] partners”</span>.  </p>

It does not follow, however, that it would be appropriate to regard Mr Gaiduk as being in the same position when selling his shareholding to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan as Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan were when selling their shareholdings (bolstered by Mr Gaiduk’s shareholding as sold to them) to the Russian Buyer.  </p>

On the contrary, under the first transaction, Avonwick agreed to sell its 100% interest in Castlerose (and thus Castlerose’s 33.84% interest in IUD) to Dargamo and Azitio with virtually no obligations but the transfer of the shares whereas, under the second transaction, Dargamo and Azitio agreed to sell a 50% + 2 share interest in each of Kairto, Muriel and Castlerose (and thus an indirect 50% + 2 share interest in IUD) but on terms giving the Russian Buyer 75% of the value, and locking Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan into significant commitments and for a long period. Accordingly, the Russian Buyer never obtained the entire 100% share in Castlerose which was sold by Avonwick to Dargamo and Azitio: the Russian Buyer received a 50% + 2 share interest in Castlerose and the other 50% - 2 share interest remains with Dargamo and Azitio, in equal proportions (25% - 1 share each).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The two transactions were, of course, related, in particular since there were provisions in the VEB SPA which cross-referred to the Castlerose SPA, but this does not change the fact that there were two separate transactions, the explanation for such provisions obviously being that the Russian Buyer had an interest in ensuring that Mr Gaiduk did not retain any interest in his stake in order that Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta could pass full title to the Russian Buyer.  </p>

Whatever may or may not have been considered as regards the structuring of the deal at an earlier stage, this is how the deal ultimately came to be structured.

Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan were thereby giving the Russian Buyer a right of first refusal on any future investment or joint activity in their field of expertise, even if unconnected to IUD.

The term sheet of 15 June 2009 provided for Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan to guarantee to pay back the advance payments made if the deal did not complete, to guarantee the restructuring of the deal and the price if certain governmental consents were not received and to guarantee <span style="font-style:italic">“all of the obligations of each of the Sellers under the SPA”</span>.

As at 25 September 2009, the Russian Buyer was still asking for personal guarantees for the Sellers’ obligations under the SPA, and they were maintaining their position as at 22 October 2009. The final version of the VEB SPA imposed an obligation on Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta to ensure that Mr Gaiduk and his affiliates did not become a creditor of IUD and included a small number of personal warranties (although in 2017 Promeritum, a hedge fund in which the Gaiduk Parties are investors, did just that).  </p>

Thus, Clauses 8.6 and 8.7 gave the Russian Buyer so-called <span style="font-style:italic">“Tag Along Rights”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“Drag Along Rights”</span>. These enabled the Russian Buyer to effect a sale of 100% of the shares in IUD to a third party, and to receive 60% of the purchase price in exchange for selling their 50% plus 2 shares stake. Clause 16.2 entitled the Russian Buyer to receive 85% of the dividends issued by IUD, in order for the Russian Buyer to repay the money it had borrowed to finance the acquisition of its stake in IUD.  </p>

He must, therefore, have known, like Mr Petrov, that the agreement into which Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan were to enter would differ. He must have known that the differences would include the fact that Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan would have to give warranties. He might not have known the detail of those warranties or other obligations. This was not a matter in which he would be interested. What matters, and all that matters, is that he would have known that warranties would be given.  </p>

There is, indeed, no such evidence. There is, however, evidence, as Mr Calver QC fairly acknowledged, that Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan tried to avoid having to give warranties as extensive as the Russian Buyer required.

Specifically, Mr Taruta ultimately accepted in cross-examination that Mr Gaiduk did, indeed, tell him at such a meeting that Mr Mkrtchan had told him what price had been paid by the Russian Buyer, and that he (Mr Taruta) confirmed to him during this meeting that what Mr Mkrtchan had told him was true.  </p>

I accept also, therefore, that Mr Gaiduk was telling the truth when he described Mr Mkrtchan as recounting during the meeting that he had been threatened and had been required during a meeting in Moscow in December 2015 attended by Mr Taruta and, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alios</span>, Mr Delimkhanov to sign a document which stated that he owed Mr Taruta substantial sums.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I accept, furthermore, that Mr Gaiduk asked what obligations Mr Mkrtchan was talking about, to which Mr Mkrtchan explained the Amended Settlement Agreement entered into on 30 December 2009, which required Mr Mkrtchan to either pay Mr Taruta c. US$280 million or transfer a c. 5% interest in IUD to him. That led, I also accept, Mr Gaiduk to ask how much the Russian Buyer had paid, because it was readily apparent that, if a 5% interest in IUD was worth US$280 million, the Russian Buyer had paid far more than Mr Gaiduk had been told.  This led Mr Mkrtchan, unthinkingly, to say <span style="font-style:italic">“2.7”</span> – thereby revealing the price. I agree with Mr Calver QC that, whilst Mr Mkrtchan’s admission was a surprising one, in context, it was understandable given that Mr Mkrtchan had been summoned to the meeting with Mr Delimkhanov and feared for his life.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Lastly, consistent with the evidence which Mr Taruta ultimately came to give, I accept that at the meeting on 13 May 2016 Mr Taruta confirmed the price to Mr Gaiduk, Mr Gaiduk had told him that he felt deceived by, and angry at, him and that there was a discussion at this meeting about the fact that the price paid to Avonwick was not proportionate to that paid by the Russian Buyer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Although not, strictly speaking, the relevant test, again as previously explained, asking what would Mr Gaiduk have done if he had been told the true price being paid by the Russian Buyer is instructive from an evidential perspective when seeking to answer the correct question, namely what Mr Gaiduk (and Avonwick) would have done had the Price Representation not been made. It is tolerably clear, at least if Mr Mkrtchan did not say what he admits saying, that what Mr Gaiduk would have done was ask what Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan (or their companies) were to be paid, and that, as a bottom line, he would not have allowed Avonwick to enter into the Castlerose SPA.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It should be made clear that I approach this matter on the basis that, ultimately, as Mr Gaiduk himself stated, he would not have entered the Castlerose SPA, and not, therefore, on the basis that, had the Price Representation not been made, he would have allowed Avonwick to enter into this contract but on different terms to those, in fact, agreed. This is because, as I shall come on to explain later when dealing with causation and loss, the only case which has been pleaded, and so the only case which it is open to the Gaiduk Parties to advance, is that, but for the Price Representation, Mr Gaiduk would not have entered into the Castlerose SPA at all or entered into any other such contract of sale with any other party, not whether Avonwick would have entered into a sale contract at a different price or on other terms.  </p>

This is because, as I have previously explained, it is equally clear that whatever was done cannot have been a particularly detailed exercise. Moreover, as made clear by Longmore LJ in<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Rembrandt</span> at [32] and [45] the test for reliance entails asking whether there has been a material influence and it is possible that a representation is but one reason among several reasons provided that it is nonetheless itself material.  </p>

A person who has been induced to enter into a contract with A as a result of a misrepresentation made to him by B and of which A had no notice has no ground of relief against A unless B was A’s agent. It is, however, not necessary to show that the misrepresentor was the agent of the other contracting party for the purpose of concluding the contract, or even for the purpose of conducting negotiations; it is sufficient if the misrepresentor was the agent of the other contracting party simply for the purpose of passing on the misrepresentation to the misrepresentee.”</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I have already touched on this topic. However, that there was the call is not in dispute. Nor is it in dispute that the call took place towards the start of the meeting, Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan (as well as Mr Petrov) being in Mr Gaiduk’s office at 14-B Yaroslavov and Mr Taruta being in his office at IUD in Donetsk. The call was placed by Mr Gaiduk’s assistant, who contacted Mr Taruta’s reception, it appears, using IUD’s secure lines between Kiev and Donetsk.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It was Mr Gaiduk’s evidence in his witness statement that, indeed, the reason why the call took place at all was to check that Mr Taruta was content for Mr Mkrtchan to negotiate on his behalf. That was what Mr Petrov said in his witness statement also. Asked in his oral evidence about this, Mr Gaiduk was explicit: </p>

That is something which Mr Taruta could have been asked to confirm after the meeting between Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan (and Mr Petrov) had come to an end, whereas it would obviously have been sensible to have ascertained whether Mr Mkrtchan had authority to speak on behalf of Mr Taruta before Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan took their discussion forward.  </p>

He was, accordingly, unable to be tested by Mr Foxton QC on this issue. However, his is an admission which is both clear and unequivocal. As I say, it also accords with what I consider to be the inherent probability. I repeat that this is a topic on which I have already touched, but Mr Taruta’s evidence that he was doing no more than agreeing to pay whatever price Mr Mkrtchan himself agreed to pay was, in contrast, implausible. Mr Taruta was, indeed, ultimately constrained to accept in cross-examination that it was Mr Mkrtchan, a tough negotiator, who was taking the lead on the negotiations with Mr Gaiduk. The fact that Mr Mkrtchan was taking the lead is entirely consistent with Mr Taruta being content that Mr Mkrtchan should represent him at the meeting.  </p>

Again, this is consistent with Mr Mkrtchan representing Mr Taruta. The same had happened previously when Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta had acted jointly in offering to buy Mr Gaiduk’s stake in 2008. They had agreed that Mr Mkrtchan would take the lead on this negotiation with Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In these circumstances, Mr Gaiduk was entitled to assume that Mr Mkrtchan was acting on behalf of Mr Taruta, and that is sufficient to establish apparent authority, although in all probability there was, in fact, actual authority vested in Mr Mkrtchan by Mr Taruta. Either way, I am clear that the agency case is made out. It makes no difference that the relevant agency was confined to the making of representations such as the Price Representation.  </p>

I agree with Mr Calver QC when he described this as strained and unnatural. This further supports my conclusion that the evidence given by Mr Taruta on this topic is not evidence which can be accepted. On the contrary, it is evidence which, in my view, was made up.  </p>

This would have been integral to the negotiation since a party which authorises another to negotiate on its behalf should, in my view, be regarded as authorising that person both to receive and, importantly in the present context, to communicate information relevant to, and as part of, that negotiation. If that is right, then, in making the Price Representation, Mr Mkrtchan must have been acting not only on his own behalf but on behalf of Mr Taruta also. </p>

Put differently, had the Price Representation been established, I would also have concluded that Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan agreed in their prior discussions to perpetrate a fraud on Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

Mr Taruta accepted in evidence that the purpose of this meeting was to agree a price (he characterised it as a renegotiation of the price under the Evraz deal) with Mr Gaiduk in order that the deal with the Russian Buyer could be progressed. Mr Taruta accepted also that by this stage the two of them knew that they were getting between US$2.5 billion and US$2.75 billion from the Russian Buyer and that he had calculated that the price for 1% of IUD on that basis was US$105 million and that his and Mr Mkrtchan’s agreement was reached by reference to their knowledge of what the Russian Buyer was willing to pay.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">If, therefore, the Price Representation was made, as the Gaiduk Parties maintain, then, Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan must have known that they stood to receive much more from the Russian Buyer for their smaller proportion of shares than Mr Gaiduk was set to receive. Had the Price Representation been made, the irresistible inference would, accordingly, have been that Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan had decided by about this time that they would deceive Mr Gaiduk by buying his shareholding and flipping it on to the Russian Buyer instead of allowing him to share in the profits of the sale to the Russian Buyer by way of a single SPA to which they were all parties.  </p>

Mr Beketov (the Taruta Parties’ expert) and Mr Likarchuk (the Mkrtchan Parties’ expert) were in agreement that, if the claimant and defendant are parties to a contract which is recognised as valid and binding under Ukrainian law, albeit that it may not, strictly speaking, amount to an agency contract as a matter of Ukrainian law, then, the parties’ rights and obligations will be governed by the general principles applicable to contracts.  </p>

If so, then, irrespective of whether a formal agency relationship came into existence or not, it is difficult to see how it could really be suggested that the Avonwick Claim should not succeed also against the Taruta Parties, bearing in mind the factual matters which I have addressed at some length when considering the position under English law.  </p>

During the Second World War the defendants, believing that the claimant could not be traced and being fearful for the safety of the goods during the Blitz, gave the property away. After the War the claimant reappeared and demanded the return of her goods. She sued the defendants in conversion when they were unable to comply with this demand. They pleaded that the cause of action arose in 1940 when they disposed of the goods (on which assumption the action was out of time) but the claimant argued that the disposal of the goods was ‘fraud’ within what is now s.32(1)(a), so that time did not start to run until she discovered the loss in 1946. Both Denning J and the Court of Appeal held that the action was not based on fraud, although their approaches to the definition of fraud in this context were different. Denning J held that there was no fraud where the defendant honestly believed that the owner had consented to the disposal or that he would have done so had it been possible to contact him and seek his approval. The Court of Appeal laid down a more general test applicable to any case in which s.32(1)(a) is pleaded. An action is ‘based on fraud’ for this purpose when (and only when) fraud is an essential element of the claimant’s claim.21 This requirement was not satisfied here, since the action was pleaded in conversion, a tort which can be committed without any fraud </span>

Accordingly, as, in essence, Mr Calver QC and Mr Foxton QC agreed (along with Mr Wolfson QC also, assuming that English law applied rather than Ukrainian law), the issue in this case is whether Mr Gaiduk and Avonwick either did discover, or could by reasonable diligence have discovered, the fraud prior to 9 August 2010, which is to say 6 years prior to the issue of the proceedings. </p>

That interest in IUD was a very valuable asset, and its proposed sale was, therefore, of particular importance to Avonwick. It follows that, when considering Millett LJ’s reference in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Paragon Finance</span> at page 418 to <span style="font-style:italic">“how a person carrying on a business of the relevant kind would act if he had adequate but not unlimited staff and resources but not excessive sensed of urgency”</span>, it needs to be borne in mind that Avonwick was a vehicle of Mr Gaiduk, who was at the relevant time a very wealthy and powerful individual, with a team of internal advisers and the resources to instruct external advisers such as Allen &amp; Overy, UBS and PwC.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">That said, as Mr Calver QC submitted, it is not altogether clear how Avonwick could have verified the position even if Mr Gaiduk had harboured doubts concerning the Price Representation. Mr Wolfson QC suggested that Avonwick had a means available to it from about June or July 2009 to investigate whether the alleged Price Representation was true since it was known by Mr Gaiduk then that VEB and Mr Dmitriev were closely involved in the transaction, and Mr Gaiduk discussed this further with Mr Taruta in December 2009. Accordingly, he observed, Mr Gaiduk, Mr Petrov or Mr Kravets could have approached Mr Dmitriev (whether directly or indirectly) in order to discover whether the alleged Price Representation was true – as, indeed, Mr Gaiduk had done previously in the context of the proposed transaction with Evraz. I am not persuaded by this, however, since I consider that Mr Calver QC was right when he made the point that there is no real basis for supposing that, had Mr Dimtriev and VEB been asked, they would have told Mr Gaiduk the true position, thereby jeopardising the transaction. I do not, therefore, consider it right to decide that either s. 32(1)(a) or (b) is applicable on this specific basis. </p>

Again, however, I cannot agree with Mr Wolfson QC about this since, as Mr Calver QC observed, the evidence was that Mr Petrov was asked to remain on one side of the room and so away from the documents relating to the VEB SPA. This was not a case, therefore, where, it would seem, as a matter of fact, that Mr Petrov did actually cross the room to look at such documents. It follows that there was no actual knowledge. Nor is there any reason to think that, had he tried to look at the documents, this would have been permitted. Either way, this is neither a s. 32(1)(a) nor a s. 32(1)(b) case. Indeed, it is worth bearing in mind in this respect that it was Mr Foxton QC’s submission, admittedly directed at the prior question of whether Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan should be treated as having set out to deceive Mr Gaiduk rather than the limitation issue, that it was clear in the lead-up to the closing, and so obviously at the closing itself, that the amount being paid by the Russian Buyer would not be revealed to Avonwick since it was a matter which was confidential as against Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

Given this confidentiality, it is difficult to see how it really can be the case that Mr Petrov (and, through him, Mr Gaiduk) should be treated as having either actual or constructive knowledge of the price which the Russian Buyer was paying to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan or their respective companies.  </p>

This is that, whatever Avonwick knew or could have known previously, Avonwick must have acquired the requisite knowledge, alternatively could have acquired such knowledge, by early 2010 (specifically January to April 2010, and so before 9 August 2010). This is because both the international and Ukrainian press were reporting at that time that the transaction had a value of US$2 billion. This was inaccurate, of course, in that the transaction had a higher value since VEB paid more than this. What matters, however, is that such a valuation is inconsistent with the Price Representation since it works out at some 1.8 times more than the price per share which was received by Mr Gaiduk.  </p>

He went on to submit that, as a result, it is not clear what reasonable diligence Mr Gaiduk should have conducted, adding that, had he asked Mr Taruta or Mr Mkrtchan, it is unlikely that they would have admitted that the Price Representation was false given that they had (at least on the Gaiduk Parties’ case) just defrauded him.

Two of those (an Antiraid article dated 9 January 2010 and a uaprom article dated 12 January 2010) reported that US$2 billion was the price paid for an interest of 50% plus one or two shares (an <span style="font-style:italic">“announced price of US$ 2 billion, for the 50%+1 package”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“the Russians paid US$ 2 billion for 50%+2 shares”</span> respectively), whilst the other four articles referred to that same US$2 billion figure without spelling out whether this related to all or part of IUD.  </p>

That alternative valuation, a Discounted Cash Flow (‘DCF’) valuation, leads, according to Mr Calver QC, to a very much larger amount: US$2.054 billion and after a suggested 15% minority discount, US$1.746 billion.  </p>

It is, however, a topic which, my having already decided that the Price Representation case must be rejected on other grounds, including my factual determination that the Price Representation was not made, does not arise. To grapple with the myriad of matters raised would require a detailed examination which would lengthen an already long judgment and which would delay its production.  </p>

In the event that the matter were to proceed to an appeal and that appeal were to be successful, I would obviously be willing at that juncture to produce a further judgment dealing with this topic.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, none of the MOUs produced by Mr Taruta, Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan, or by others on their behalf, including MOU 4, contains an express choice of law provision. In fact, there is no evidence that they ever expressly discussed which law would apply to the agreements now alleged by Mr Taruta, namely the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, Mr Foxton QC’s reliance on the fact that the Castlerose SPA contains an express English choice of law provision does not assist in circumstances where that was an agreement between Avonwick, Dargamo and Azitio, and so an agreement to which Mr Gaiduk, Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta (the alleged parties to the alleged </p>

It follows that the express choice of English law in the Castlerose SPA was not an express choice of law made by the parties to the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement. The fact that the parties to the Castlerose SPA were closely associated with these individuals is, as a matter of analysis, neither here nor there: the simple point is that the choice of law made in the Castlerose SPA cannot, in my view, constitute an express choice of law between entirely different parties to a different agreement.  </p>

It follows, for these two reasons, that I am unpersuaded by submissions which are reliant on what was agreed in the Castlerose SPA.  </p>

Specifically, Mr Gaiduk was clear that this was not the case. So, too, was Mr Petrov, who made the point that Mr Taruta, Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan only had limited knowledge of English law. Indeed, Mr Taruta himself accepted that no English law advice was taken prior to signing MOU1 or MOU2.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">More significantly still, Mr Taruta accepted in cross-examination that agreements between the parties prior to 2009 contained no English choice of law clause or any choice of law provision and, indeed, in some cases were expressly subject to Ukrainian law. Thus, the IUD’s members’ agreement and foundation agreement from 2006 were expressly subject to Ukrainian law. Similarly, Mr Taruta acknowledged that the Dubyna MOU from January 2008 did not contain an English governing law clause.  </p>

However, this assertion was not borne out by the documents. For example, in the process of restructuring IUD, each of Region, Azovintex and Vizavi sold their shares in IUD to Kairto, Muriel and Castlerose, which are Cypriot companies, and each SPA was governed by Ukrainian law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">This brings me to Mr Foxton QC’s alternative submission, which is that, even if there was no express choice of law, there was an implied choice of law because of the close connection between the Castlerose SPA (with its English law choice of law provision) and the obligations imposed by reason of the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement. This, again, is a submission which I cannot accept for a number of reasons.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, as previously explained, since the Castlerose SPA was entered into between different parties to the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement, it is difficult to see how it can be the case that Mr Gaiduk, Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Taruta should be treated as though they made an implied choice as to the applicable law when concluding the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement. To repeat, they were not themselves parties to the Castlerose SPA.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, even if it were permissible to approach the contractual party matter in a somewhat looser way, still it is difficult to see that the implied choice suggested by Mr Foxton QC is made out in this case. The more so, given that there were agreements entered into between the parties concerned with their ‘divorce’ in which there was an express choice not of English law but of Ukrainian law: the 2008 SPAs, the CIG SPA, the UGMK SPAs, and the Agro Holding SPA all provide for Ukrainian law. Why, in such circumstances, it should be assumed that Mr Taruta, Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan were impliedly choosing English law (as opposed to Ukrainian law) is hard to fathom, particularly given that the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement relate to the assets to be transferred under those very (Ukrainian law-governed) agreements. I agree with Mr Wolfson QC’s submission that the parties would have been unlikely to have chosen a different or inconsistent law from that chosen in these agreements to apply to the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement and the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, although Mr Foxton QC was keen to highlight that US$200 million of the Castlerose SPA sale price was attributable to assets which are the subject of the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement, it does not follow from this that the two agreements (the Castlerose SPA and the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement), still less the alleged 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement, were so closely related that English law should be treated as having been impliedly agreed in respect of all three agreements.

Article 638(1), paragraph 2, stipulates that such terms are those that (i) concern the subject matter of the contract, (ii) are required by law, (iii) are necessary for contracts of that type and (iv) are required by one of the parties to be agreed.

Accordingly, even an unsigned draft agreement can constitute or evidence a final agreement where it is fully or partially performed. However, as Mr Likarchuk explained, by reference to one of the authorities he cited, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">LLC Food Trading Company v A</span> No 338/180/17 dated 5 June 2018, partial performance needs to be consistent with the content of the draft agreement and must evidence the intention of both parties to be bound by the terms of the draft. I take from his evidence and the evidence given also by Professor Kuznetsova that the partial performance must be sufficient to lead to the conclusion that there has been acceptance and that it would not be enough were the partial performance also to be explicable for some other reason which does not involve a contract having been entered into. As Mr Beketov again fairly accepted, this is a question of fact.  </p>

The fact that Article 207(1) contemplates a contract being in writing if it is concluded by exchanging telegrams does not detract from this conclusion, even though it seems that there is nothing in Ukrainian law that requires telegrams to be signed, since it seems probable that the Article 207(2) reference to signing would be regarded as not being confined to a conventional signature on the written page. </p>

It is, therefore, unnecessary for the Court to be concerned with whether the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement or the 2010 Further SHA was in written form, save to the extent that the failure to comply with the ‘written form’ requirement is indicative of a failure by the parties to reach agreement.

He noted that <span style="font-style:italic">“these comments are given outside the context of a detailed sale and purchase contract containing all essential conditions of the transaction (such a contract has yet to be developed)”</span> and, on that basis, observed that <span style="font-style:italic">“at this stage it is inadvisable to offer counter comments to the selling shareholder’s party”</span>.

This is consistent with there not at this stage being a concluded sale contract, and so with MOU 1 instead merely recording the commercial terms discussed between the parties. This supports, in turn, the view that, whatever the position concerning earlier MOUs entered into between the Partners, whether they gave rise to legally enforceable obligations (or were regarded as doing so) or not, in the case of MOU 1 the Partners were not at this stage treating it as a valid and binding contract. </p>

He was referring here to how, in recognition of certain liquidity issues which would be caused to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan, it was envisaged in Clause 8 of MOU 1 that their shares in CIG could be temporarily transferred to Mr Gaiduk in lieu of payment. As Mr Foxton QC explained, the first draft of the SPAs effecting the temporary transfer was circulated on 29 April 2008 and final versions were executed on 12 May 2008, 14 business days after MOU 1 was executed, with provision for payment to be deferred for 150 calendar days in line with the five months contemplated in MOU 1.  </p>

The fact that the SPAs were entered into, however, is just as consistent with the parties having discussed what would happen as it is with their having entered into a valid and binding contract which imposed an obligation on Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan to do what they, then, and in short order as envisaged by MOU 1, actually did.  </p>

Indeed, it would be somewhat surprising if that were the case with what, after all, is merely a recital. Furthermore, the fact that Clause 2 goes on to reflect the fact that, when CIG’s assets are sold, Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan (as the Buying Shareholders) are to have their share reduced by US$300 million, again, hardly represents, as Mr Calver QC put it, <span style="font-style:italic">“language generating a free-standing debt”</span>.  </p>

Mr Gaiduk, therefore, agreed to extend the deadline, with MOU 3 (dated 4 September 2008) referring to an extension of the deadline to 31 October 2008. He accepted, indeed, in cross-examination that the extension of the deadline was necessary to avoid triggering the penalties prescribed in MOU 2.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Foxton QC submitted that, as a result, Mr Gaiduk was conceding that what had previously been agreed both as regards deadlines and as regards penalties was legally binding. If that is right, however, then, the Evraz deal subsequently having collapsed in October 2008, so as to mean that the revised deadline was also missed, on the assumption that the MOUs were binding, Mr Gaiduk would have been entitled to sell CIG and retain US$300 million in addition to his share of the proceeds. However, as previously explained, at no point did Mr Gaiduk seek to enforce this right. He never received the US$3.063 billion, the shares in IUD were never pledged and, although CIG was transferred, that was not done within 15 days. MOU 2 was similarly not performed: in particular, no US$300 million penalty was ever paid and CIG’s assets were not auctioned. I agree with Mr Calver QC that the reason why he did not do this is that it was understood not only by him but also by Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan that MOUs 1 and 2 were not legally binding.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Foxton QC submitted that the argument that Mr Gaiduk did not demand payment of the originally agreed penalty figure because the MOUs were not legally binding belies the commercial reality in which the negotiations were taking place, namely that the financial crisis had left the markets in meltdown. He suggested that, in such circumstances, the only possible commercial solution was to renegotiate the price. Even if that is right (and it may well be), it does not explain, however, why nowhere in the documents is there any indication that Mr Gaiduk was making a decision not to enforce his rights. The more likely explanation is that nobody (Mr Gaiduk included) considered that there were the legal entitlements which, on the Taruta Parties’ case, Mr Gaiduk enjoyed.   Instead of taking the steps to which I have referred, on 10 November 2008, Mr Novak, who had been involved in drafting the earlier MOUs, produced a further MOU (MOU 3) which extended the deadline from 31 October 2008 to 1 May 2009.  </p>

There was no such agreement, as demonstrated by the fact that the basis on which the shares in NET were being transferred was the subject of continued negotiation even after 13 April 2009 since, although the draft of that date provided for a buy-back option exercisable until 1 July 2010, on 26 May 2009 Mr Novak introduced certain amendments, including an extension of the buy-back period to two years, and a provision that the management and decision-making in respect of the Hyatt would be preserved during the term of the option. The updated MOU circulated by Mr Petrov on 2 June 2009 did not include this buy-back period, instead providing that after the shares were transferred the parties would sign an option agreement for buy-back by 1 August 2010.  </p>

Then, in early December 2009, those negotiations were re-awoken, with Linklaters circulating a mark-up of the July Castlerose SPA on 7 December 2009. At this stage, closing was scheduled for 15 December 2009 and, as Mr Foxton QC pointed out, it is probably no coincidence that, also on 7 December 2009, Mr Mkrtchan appears to have requested to see the MOU amended by Mr Novak in May 2009.  </p>

Let’s just think through how that would work out. Okay? The first point is that Mr Tkachenko, who is your most senior in-house lawyer, is instructing Linklaters, no doubt at some cost, to produce a legally binding English law contract to transfer those assets, despite knowing that you, Mr Mkrtchan and Mr Gaiduk propose to sign the MOU, which, on this basis, would be a binding contract for the transfer of those same assets.

If the Taruta Parties are right and an agreement was reached on 13 December 2009, which was evidenced in the 15 December Draft, then, it would not be altogether surprising that the side letter became sidelined in the manner suggested by Mr Foxton QC during closing when he submitted that the Partners (to the extent that they were aware of the side letter at all) were content to record their agreement by means of an updated MOU, namely MOU 4, an agreement which they recognised the necessity of reaching that agreement before the Castlerose SPA was signed.  </p>

Specifically, Mr Taruta had circled the assets said to be included in the price for IUD and written the figure of US$750 million next to it. Below that, he rounded down the total price, including the additional assets, from US$953.6 million to US$950 million – the price paid under the Castlerose SPA. The exchange was as follows: </p>

Indeed, even Mr Foxton QC did not suggest that MOU 4 was irrelevant, yet the case as it came to be put forward in closing effectively sidelined the role which it played, as demonstrated by Mr Foxton QC’s suggestion that Mr Gaiduk did not care about any formalities associated with it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">There is, in any event, the further difficulty which has previously been identified concerning Mr Taruta’s position. Specifically, it will be recalled that it was only after Mr Gaiduk had given his evidence that Mr Taruta somewhat tentatively clarified that, based on his looking at certain family photographs from around 13 December 2009, he had worked out that he was in Kiev for his daughter's birthday on that date, and so considers that there may have been a meeting at around that time.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">This is hardly the most definitive (or compelling) evidence from somebody whose case ultimately came to rest on there having been such a meeting. That is all the more the case given that that person’s position had previously been not that an oral agreement was reached at a meeting on 13 December 2009 but that the agreement was contained in a subsequent version of MOU 4. It follows that Mr Foxton QC’s reliance on the fact that on 14 December 2009 Mr Petrov sent Mr Tkachenko and Mr Pisarevsky the 15 December Draft (a revised version of MOU 4 allegedly reflecting an agreement reached at the 13 December 2009 meeting) is problematic.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So, too, was Mr Foxton QC’s reliance on the fact that the draft was post-dated 15 December 2009, in line with the scheduled closing date of the Castlerose SPA, and the fact that, prior to its circulation, on 13 December 2009, Mr Tkachenko stressed the importance of the MOU being <span style="font-style:italic">“finally agreed and signed before day x”</span>, that being a reference to 15 December 2009, the closing date of the Castlerose transaction and Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan’s deal with the Russian Buyer. This is for a simple reason: if the Partners had entered into a final and binding agreement on 13 December 2009, then, it is difficult to see why Mr Petrov, in sending the 15 December Draft, did not make it clear that what he was sending reflected what had been finally agreed the day before. He, however, did nothing of the sort, instead merely describing the 15 December Draft as <span style="font-style:italic">“another draft”</span>.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The very fact that the 15 December Draft was followed by other drafts makes it impossible to conclude that the parties had already entered into a final and binding agreement since, if that were the position, there would obviously be no need for further drafts to be produced. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Furthermore, if it really was the case that there was a final agreement on 13 December 2009, then, it is odd that, when Mr Petrov told Mr Gaiduk about the side letter which had been produced by Linklaters on 10 December 2009, Mr Gaiduk did not propose that Mr Petrov revert with the suggestion that the blank schedule of assets should list what had been agreed at the meeting on 13 December 2009. Although, therefore, as previously explained, I am unpersuaded that the side letter, in and of itself, makes it implausible that the Partners would have entered into an agreement in the form of MOU 4, it does nonetheless seem to me that this particular aspect concerning the side letter makes it unlikely that there was the final and binding agreement which Mr Foxton QC submitted was entered into at the meeting on 13 December 2009.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Foxton QC went on to suggest that, the closing of the Castlerose transaction having been delayed until 18 December 2009 and the date of MOU 4 having been updated by Mr Tkachenko to reflect this on 17 December 2009, what happened in terms of the further draft MOUs was all part and parcel of what had been agreed at the meeting on 13 December 2009. There is, however, a clear difficulty with this. This is that the Partners continued to negotiate over the wording of MOU 4 in the days which followed, until it was decided to enter into the Castlerose SPA without including in that agreement any obligation as regards the transfer of disputed assets.  </p>

Even if this was a busy time, there is no reason why the agreement was not formalised in the weeks which followed the 13 December 2009 meeting.

As he pointed out, as with the July Castlerose SPA, the December SPA provides no indication of the assets other than IUD which Mr Gaiduk had agreed to transfer in exchange for the payment price. The payment price had increased significantly from the US$723.75 million to which reference was made in the July version. As Mr Foxton QC submitted, the price of US$950 million was calculated on the basis that it represented US$750 million for the Claimant’s 33.84% interest in IUD plus US$200 million for various other assets that were owned indirectly by Mr Gaiduk and which were to be transferred to the Defendants at the same time.  </p>

I agree with Mr Wolfson QC that the basis on which these sums were transferred under the Castlerose SPA was that they represented an advance from Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan to Mr Gaiduk, made in the expectation that the parties would reach legally binding agreements, against which those sums would be offset using offshore structures.  </p>

As such, it is not evidence which assists the Taruta Parties’ case. Again as Mr Wolfson QC put it, in his case displaying more of an agricultural bent than a sporting one, reliance on the payment having been made is to put the cart before the horse since, although if there was a separate 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement between the Partners, then, the payment could constitute performance of that agreement, if there was no 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement, then, the payment would amount to a deposit or advance made in hope of future agreements.  </p>

It is said that they could not seriously enter into these negotiations and then break them off without reason, but that is not for us to consider. That they were entitled not to complete the purchase seems clear, and I do not accept the view that the purchasers were paying the deposit as a guarantee or earnest of good faith that they would complete the purchase, because they could have revoked what had up to that time been agreed upon at any moment. It seems to me that when once the negotiations came to an end the rights of the parties were gone, and the purchasers were entitled to receive their money back.”</span> Warrington LJ adopted a similar approach at page 110: </p>

It may be paid by way of guarantee that the purchaser will not break off negotiations without good cause, or it may be paid, as [the claimant] contends, in anticipation of a binding contract. In any event, the mere fact that a deposit has been paid does not help me. Then it is said that in contemporaneous documents the parties refer to the document as an agreement for sale, but when you know from the document itself that it is not an agreement for sale, the mere reference to it as such in the other documents does not make it so. Therefore neither the payment of deposit nor the reference to the document as an agreement for sale is sufficient to alter the prima facie meaning of the document of July 10, 1922. It has been undoubted ever since the decision of Sir George Jessel in Winn v. Bull 36 that the words ‘subject to the preparation and approval of a formal contract’ in a document prevented the document from being held to be a final agreement.”</span>

The Gaiduk and Mkrtchan Parties’ position, however, is that no obligation to make payments or transfers arose until a “<span style="font-style:italic">final reckoning</span>” had been reached by the Partners as to the global terms of their divorce. The Taruta Parties’ position, in contrast, is that legal entitlements were acquired before the “<span style="font-style:italic">final reckoning</span>”, pointing, indeed, to examples of such agreements being acted on far in advance of such a reckoning. For example, Mr Petrov conceded in cross-examination that assets were transferred to Mr Mkrtchan well before any such final reckoning had taken place. Consistently with this, Transport Holding dividends were paid to Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan 50:50 up until October 2012, which the Taruta Parties say reflects an understanding that the Taruta Parties had an immediate legal entitlement to a half-share of this asset. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The first of these further reasons concerns the lack of documentation suggesting that any final agreements were concluded. Mr Foxton QC was able to point to two spreadsheets used by Mr Gaiduk and Mr Mkrtchan during their balancing exercise in the period 2011-2013, described in the proceedings (but not contemporaneously) by the Taruta Parties as the ‘FSHA Spreadsheet’ and the ‘Divorce Spreadsheet’, the former dealing only with the assets for which payment is now claimed under the 2010 Further Shareholders’ Agreement, the latter dealing with other assets which formed part of the wider ‘divorce’. It was Mr Foxton QC’s submission that the Partners were </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">dealing with the assets listed in the separate FSHA Spreadsheet because they were already the subject of a final, binding agreement. This, however, is, in truth, little more than supposition. In any event, it does not follow that there were binding agreements of the sort now alleged.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The same applies to Mr Foxton QC’s reliance on the fact that, in the final iteration of the FSHA Spreadsheet, the sum payable for USK was reduced by US$19,164,750.00, being the sum paid by Mr Gaiduk under the CIG SPAs, in support of a contention that Mr Gaiduk intended for that sum to constitute part-payment. Although Mr Foxton QC submitted that, if the Partners had only reached a preliminary understanding regarding the division of assets, it would have made no sense for Mr Gaiduk to agree for the CIG SPA payment to be made in partial discharge of those obligations, again, I do not agree that it necessarily follows that the payment was made in respect of a binding contract. Mr Gaiduk had paid the deferred consideration under the CIG SPA and thereby acquired its assets. The Partners were nonetheless proceeding on the basis that he would have to pay for his share in those assets. It would, therefore, have been a sensible and practical solution to agree that the payments under the CIG SPAs would serve as part-payment, to be credited to him in the “<span style="font-style:italic">final reckoning</span>”. This is consistent with what the Gaiduk and Mkrtchan Parties say was happening in this period or at least as consistent with what they say as with what is alleged by the Taruta Parties. On this basis, it would be inappropriate, whether under Ukrainian law or under English law, to decide that the agreements alleged by the Taruta Parties were final and binding. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The same also applies to the Taruta Parties’ reliance on the fact that asset transfers were being made long before the final balance was reached. Mr Petrov relied on documents dating from August 2013 as setting out the final balance, by which point Mr Gaiduk had already transferred to Mr Mkrtchan interests in, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, Transport Holding.

It, again, does not follow that the agreements were binding in isolation.

Mr Calver QC and Mr Wolfson QC’s position was that nothing in Article 530(2) dictates a conclusion that parties to a contract (including, therefore, the parties in the present case) cannot have intended that performance would take place immediately (Mr Calver QC’s position) or within a reasonable time (Mr Wolfson QC’s primary position) and instead requires that in a case such as the present <span style="font-style:italic">“the debtor”</span> should be given a demand to perform and, then, should have the seven days to which Article 530(2) refers. This would, they suggested, make no sense at all since it would mean that a claimant could wait any period of time after a contract to make a demand, and that time would only start running eight days after that demand was made.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">This is not a particularly easy matter to resolve. On the face of it, the Resolution provides significant support for Mr Foxton QC’s position. On the other hand, not only is it not in dispute that the Resolution is not binding and is merely persuasive (as Professor Kuznetsoka put it, it <span style="font-style:italic">“is just of a recommendatory nature”</span>) but, furthermore, there are a number of Ukrainian court decisions identified by Professor Kuznetsova in which a different approach has been adopted both before and after the Resolution, perhaps the most apposite of which is a decision of the Ukrainian Supreme Court dated 7 May 2018. In that case, Princom-Group (as seller) and Dubko (as buyer) had concluded a contract which required that Dubko should pay a security deposit before 11 June 2012 and also that the parties should enter into a purchase agreement by 31 December 2013. Whilst Dubko paid the security deposit on time, the parties did not enter into a purchase agreement, with the result that in May 2017 Dubko brought a claim to recover the security deposit which it had paid. Princom’s response was to assert that the claim was time-barred. It appears that the contract provided no deadline for the return of the security deposit. Applying the analysis of the law advanced by the Taruta Parties, it ought to follow that time did not start to run until the buyer first sought to recover the security. However, the Supreme Court did not approach matters in this way and instead approved the Appeal Court’s decision: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows that the Appeal Court (and so also the Supreme Court) treated time as beginning to run when the period for entering into the purchase agreement expired, namely the day after 31 December 2013. This was when Dubko was entitled to require repayment of the security deposit which it had paid. It was on this basis that the Appeal Court (and also the Supreme Court) concluded that the claim became time-barred after 31 December 2016, three years after Dubko became entitled to demand repayment even though no such demand was, in fact, made. The Appeal Court (and the Supreme Court), accordingly, approached matters on the basis that no demand was required in order for the limitation clock to start to tick.  </p>

In addition, although Mr Beketov (the Taruta Parties’ expert) considered that the case is covered not by the second part of Article 261(5) but by the first part (“<span style="font-style:italic">In respect of obligations with a specific period of performance, the limitation period shall begin to run upon expiry of that period”</span>), that plainly is not right since there is no hint in the decision that either the Appeal Court or the Supreme Court approached matters on the basis that the case entailed an obligation with a defined time for performance.  </p>

In that case, the claimant contractor and the defendant customer had contracted for the claimant to carry out building works. The contractor duly completed the building works, and a certificate of acceptance dated 25 April 2013 was agreed, entitling the contractor to the price of UAH 15,040.24. The defendant failed to pay the price and the claimant issued a claim for it. The defendant raised a limitation defence. The court held, first, that the parties’ contract did not set a time within which the customer had to pay the contractor the price and, secondly, that time began to run from the time when the claimant’s right to demand the purchase price arose. Again, this is a decision which is inconsistent with the Resolution since the court was here deciding that time began to run when the right to demand performance arose rather than when a demand was actually made. </p>

Despite signing the certificate, the Council did not pay the UAH 57,800 due to NVF Grant for that phase.

The focus, in other words, was not on when a demand was made but on when the right to make a demand accrued. The court also held that, since the Council’s obligation to pay the price was not subject to a defined time for performance, the Council had a 7-day grace period to do so from the time of NVF’s right to make a demand arising, with time beginning to run for limitation purposes following the expiration of that grace period.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">I might add that, as to that <span style="font-style:italic">“grace period”</span> provision, I agree with Mr Calver QC (and Mr Wolfson QC) that this is a provision which operates if a demand is actually made and assuming that it is a demand which is itself made within the currency of the threeyear limitation period but not otherwise. In effect, time starts to run when a right to make a demand accrues, but, if a demand is made within three years of then and a grace period is either given in that demand or is treated as having been given by virtue of Article 530, then, the <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> starting date for limitation purposes is adjusted accordingly and time starts to run from the expiration of that adjusted starting date. This might mean that, by making a demand late in the three-year limitation period, a claimant buys a considerably longer limitation period, potentially almost as long as six years, but nonetheless there is, on this basis, less risk that stale claims will be brought than if time starting is linked to the making of a demand at any point, however long that might be after the right to make a demand has accrued. </p>

It was Mr Foxton QC’s submission, relying upon certain evidence given by Mr Beketov, that there is simply no scope under Ukrainian law to imply an obligation to perform within a reasonable time where no express provision is made in the contract to that effect. I am not so sure, however, that the position is quite so clear cut as that since, as Mr Wolfson QC pointed out, Mr Beketov confirmed in cross-examination that there is nothing in Article 530 to prevent a court from finding that the parties must have intended performance to take place immediately (or, for that matter, in some other timescale), even if this was not expressly set out in the relevant contract.

Indeed, Mr Calver QC acknowledged, in terms, that, if and insofar as the unjust enrichment claim flows from, and is closely related to, the Castlerose SPA, then, as he put it,<span style="font-style:italic"> “there may be considerable force in the contention that English law applies”</span>.

All that matters is whether there is a legitimate unjust enrichment claim as a matter of English law on the premise that the alleged 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement did not come into existence.  </p>

IEG settled Mr Carré’s claim and brought proceedings in England against Zurich (the successor to the liabilities of Midland), seeking an indemnity. The Supreme Court had to consider whether IEG was entitled to a full indemnity, or whether Zurich had an equitable right of recoupment against IEG for a portion of the claim, in order to reflect the time that it was not on risk. A majority of the seven-strong Supreme Court held that, whilst the insurer was obliged to meet the whole of the employer’s liability to Mr Carré under the insurance contracts, it was entitled to recover proportionate contributions from other insurers which had given liability cover and, in respect of any period in which there was no insurer, from the employer itself.  </p>

While recognising a ‘broad equitable right’ of contribution between insurers may be regarded as an extension of existing principle, giving an insurer an equitable right to recoup part of the insured loss from its insured is not just close to inconsistent, but is clearly inconsistent, with the contract between the parties as it was interpreted by the majority in IEG.

There is nothing exceptional about this case which justifies a departure from the general rule. It follows that if, contrary to what I have decided, there was a concluded 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement, then, I would likely have gone on to decide that the Taruta Parties were unable to recover any sums paid in accordance with that agreement through the unjust enrichment route.  </p>

The parties were not agreeing that they would enter into a reasonable contract, but that they would enter into such a contract, if any, as they might ultimately agree and sign.

In the present case, in contrast, the monies now sought to be recovered by way of the unjust enrichment claims were paid pursuant to a contract, namely the Castlerose SPA.

It is also not without significance that on 27 April 2011 Mrs Gaiduk and Mr Taruta concluded an SPA for the sale of an interest in Agro Holding. I agree with Mr Foxton QC when he submitted that, in the circumstances, it would be wrong to treat time as having started to run before then.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Sixthly, it is similarly instructive that, the month before the Etmor Payment was made (on 19 May 2010), Ms Bashynska (the head of Mr Taruta’s family office) and Ms Shchygolyeva (on Mr Mkrtchan’s behalf) arranged jointly for the production of a novation agreement (drafted by Linklaters) to implement Mr Taruta and Mr Mkrtchan’s preference that the obligations under the Amended Settlement Agreement be settled via their respective wholly owned SPVs rather than personally as had previously been envisaged. There was no mention in this context of there being any loan indebtedness, despite the fact that, only the day before Etmor Payment was made, a draft Deed of Novation, Amendment and Restatement was produced under which Mr Mkrtchan’s obligations under the Amended Settlement Agreement would have been novated to Etmor. Mr Wolfson QC was plainly right when he submitted that it would be a somewhat surprising coincidence had the parties been negotiating an agreement to transfer the debt under the Amended Settlement Agreement to Etmor the day before Etmor made a payment which would have partially discharged Mr Mkrtchan’s liability under the Amended Settlement Agreement. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Seventhly, there are internal accounting documents which record the Etmor Payment as having discharged an Amended Settlement Agreement liability rather than any loan liability. Thus, an internal presentation on cash flow entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“Flow of Funds January –April 2010” </span>produced on 5 May 2010 recorded a liability from Mr Mkrtchan in the sum of US$280 million, not US$100 million or any lesser loan amount. The same document, updated as at August 2010 and produced on 13 September 2010, recorded an expected payment from Mr Mkrtchan of US$174 million, explaining that this liability was US$280 million,<span style="font-style:italic">“(less 105,825,000)”</span>. Mr Taruta’s only answer to this was to speculate that there might have been an error on the part of Ms Bashynska. I do not accept that explanation, however. Mr Taruta was here simply trying to explain away the obvious: that the Etmor Payment was made in discharge of obligations not under any loan arrangement but under the Amended Settlement Agreement.  </p>

The fact that it is evidence which is given in support of a claim for as much as US$50 million merely serves to underline its inadequacy. As Mr Wolfson QC submitted, it is unrealistic to suggest that, although apparently unable to recall any of the details of the loan, Mr Taruta nonetheless has a clear and reliable recollection that the sum was advanced and that this was done by way of a loan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly (or fifthly overall), it would have made no sense at all had the sum to be paid to Mr Gaiduk been US$200 million because, on that basis, Mr Mkrtchan would have been US$50 million short in terms of what he needed to pay Mr Gaiduk, even if Mr Taruta had lent him US$100 million rather than merely US$50 million. That is because, to repeat, the sum paid to Mr Gaiduk via the FMTG dividends was US$100 million and Mr Taruta says that he only advanced a further US$50 million (the alleged first tranche) for the purpose of the purchase of part of Mr Gaiduk’s interest in IUD. If Mr Taruta were right about this, it would give a total paid to Mr Gaiduk not of US$200 million but of just US$150 million.

Nor does the MOU stipulate what the level of indebtedness owed to Mr Gaiduk by Mr Mkrtchan actually was, whether that be US$200 million as alleged by Mr Taruta (or US$100 million after payment of the US$100 million) or any other level of indebtedness. Nor does it anywhere refer to Mr Taruta having paid a first tranche of US$50 million to Mr Mkrtchan with another US$50 million tranche due also to be paid. Indeed, as Mr Wolfson QC explained, the FMTG MOU is not even consistent with Mr Taruta’s own case given that what he maintains was a first tranche had been paid over a year before. In such circumstances, the language used in the MOU makes no sense.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Suffice to say, for present purposes, that I consider that the FMTG MOU provides no real support for the submission advanced on Mr Taruta’s behalf that there was an initial US$50 million tranche (prior to any subsequent US$50 million tranche) advanced to Mr Mkrtchan by way of loan. I say this notwithstanding Mr Foxton QC’s submission that Mr Gaiduk appears to have required that the FMTG MOU referred not to full repayment but partial repayment.

This was an all too convenient thing for him to say since it might explain the absence of documentation pointing to the existence of a loan liability. Needless to say, when asked about this, Mr Taruta changed his tune and agreed that cash was not the means of payment, yet the fact remains that there is no record of a transfer. The notion that this should be the case in relation to so large a sum of money is little short of fanciful.  </p>

If it were a point which had any real merit, it should have been raised in a proper and timely way. In any event, even if dividends were otherwise formally distributed to shareholders in IUD and no dividends were distributed in respect of the 17% Region stake, I agree with Mr Wolfson QC that this would not be sufficient to establish that the stake was a security interest in the face of the overwhelming contrary evidence. Furthermore, the evidence was clear that the Partners’ approach to dividends was somewhat haphazard. As a result, the dividends point is not a significant one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The second fundamental difficulty with Mr Taruta’s insistence that the FMTG Payment entailed the payment of a loan instalment is that there is no documentary evidence of such a debt having come into existence.

Indeed, aside from the features which have already been identified and aside also from the obvious fact that the FMTG MOU is not itself a loan agreement, as Mr Wolfson QC pointed out, it is a document which contains a number of inaccuracies. These include the fact that, contrary to what is stated in the first recital, of the US$150 million distributed by FMTG, US$32 million had already been distributed some two months earlier, on terms that the whole of that sum would be paid to Mr Gaiduk. Other inaccuracies include the fact that, contrary to what is also stated in the recitals, at the time of the FMTG MOU, owing to his ownership of the 17% Region stake, Mr Taruta had a 38.7% beneficial interest in IUD rather than the one-third interest described, and Mr Mkrtchan did not have a 100% interest in M3 but (because of Mr Taruta’s 17% interest) only an 83% beneficial interest. </p>

Mr Taruta, indeed, gave no evidence that he ever agreed or even discussed such matters with Mr Mkrtchan. These are essential features of any loan arrangement. Indeed, as previously explained, interest would have been particularly relevant given the liability which, according to him, he had to incur to fund the loan through Mr Schlosberg.  </p>

Ms Bashynska agreed, indeed, in cross-examination that, on occasion, this was the practice, at least in the context of what is known as ‘progonka’. Accordingly, Mr Wolfson QC suggested, the FMTG Payment was made to look as though it was a loan which was never intended to be enforced, hence there being no need to agree the normal features of a loan such as duration and interest rate. </p>

That, however, does not evidence such a demand, which is hardly surprising, as I shall come on to explain, given what the purpose of the Amended Settlement Agreement was. </p>

The fact that the 17% Region stake and the indirect 5.62% interest in IUD </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In fairness to Mr Wolfson QC, the submissions which he made on this topic took as their premise that that there was a debt from Mr Mkrtchan to Mr Taruta under the alleged US$100 million loan and, furthermore, that the transfer of the 17% Region stake was a security interest rather than an outright transfer in return for the FMTG Payment. On that basis, the argument that the alleged US$100 million loan and the Amended Settlement Agreement were so closely connected that the former should be regarded as discharged by the latter is more viable than it might at first appear. Still, however, I am unconvinced that the discharge argument can be right, given the very particular wording of Clause 7.2.1 and the express subject matter of the Settlement Agreement/Amended Settlement Agreement. </p>

This may occur where the action for an agreed sum would be unavailable or unsuitable, such as where the contract is to pay a third party, so that the damages recoverable by the contracting party would be merely nominal, or where the contract is to make periodical payments, requiring a multiplicity of actions at law to enforce payment. Although the third party cannot himself sue on the contract, he can enforce any order for specific performance which the contracting party obtains. More controversially, in what has been described as an ‘awkward exception’ to the normal requirement that damages should be inadequate, in contracts for the sale of land, the vendor is readily warded specific performance even though his interest in performance is purely financial and thus damages or the action for an agreed sum would (other than in exceptional cases) be an adequate remedy. This is commonly justified on the basis of mutuality, but this principle is no longer given the weight it traditionally was and, in any event, the purchaser’s entitlement to specific performance against the vendor may no longer be absolute.</span>”  </p>

Furthermore, if Mr Foxton QC were right that the fact that a calculation is required means that specific performance is appropriate, this would potentially mean that specific performance would be available in a far wider range of cases than hitherto recognised.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">On the final day of trial, perhaps recognising these difficulties, Mr Foxton QC sought to elaborate on his case by submitting that Clause 3 is a composite remedy which requires Mr Mkrtchan to return the shares pursuant to Clause 3.1.1 and, then, return the benefit derived from having held those shares pursuant to Clause 3.1.2. Mr Foxton QC, therefore, submitted that, if the obligation to transfer the shares is amenable to specific performance (as the Mkrtchan Parties accept it is), then, the same should apply to Clause 3.1.2, which is “<span style="font-style:italic">part of the same package</span>”, making consequential adjustments following the share transfer.  </p>

That is, of course, why it is not open to a party to claim damages in respect of a failure to pay damages. Such a claim would entail the party seeking to claim in respect of a secondary obligation.

If demurrage were that, it would be a liability sounding in debt. I deal next with what demurrage is. It is a liability in damages to which a charterer becomes subject because, by detaining the chartered ship beyond the stipulated lay days, he is in breach of his contract. Most, if not all, voyage charters contain a demurrage clause, which prescribes a daily rate at which the damages for such detention are to be quantified. The effect of such a clause is to liquidate the damages payable: it does not alter the nature of the charterer’s liability, which is and remains a liability for damages, albeit liquidated damages.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“are all cases in which the facts giving rise to the claim were sufficient to found an action at law and a suit in equity and in which substantially identical relief (an account in the first two cases and damages or equitable compensation in the third) was available in each case. In such circumstances one can well see why equity took the view that the limitation period applicable to a claim at law should also apply to a claim in equity. To hold otherwise, even at a time in the 19th century when the jurisdictions of the common law courts and the courts of equity were separate, would have undermined the statutory provisions; in the modern legal world, in which the same courts apply the rules of both law and equity, the consequences would be even more anomalous and unacceptable. However, in cases where the facts capable of supporting a claim for equitable relief differ from those capable of supporting a claim at law, or where the equitable remedy differs in a material respect from that available at law, there is not the same reason to deprive the court of the power to grant equitable relief in an appropriate case by adopting the statutory limitation period by analogy.”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“No doubt it is true that most claims for specific performance are made in response to an existing breach of contract, but as Hasham v Zenab [1960] AC 316 shows, an accrued right of action for breach of contract is not a necessary precondition to obtaining relief of that kind. It is, therefore, wrong in principle to treat specific performance as merely an equitable remedy for an existing breach of contract. Moreover, since a claim for specific performance may be made as soon as the contract has been entered into, it is very arguable that, if the limitation period were to be applied by analogy, it would be necessary to regard the cause of action as accruing at that moment with the unfortunate result that the claim could become timebarred before any need for relief had arisen. This lends further support to the conclusion that the application of the limitation period by analogy is not appropriate in relation to claims for specific performance.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">“In my view that question must be answered by reference to the nature of the remedy and the circumstances in which it is available. Both factors point to the conclusion that claims for specific performance fall outside the scope of the principle identified by Lord Westbury in Knox v Gye LR 5 HL 656 and applied by this court in Cia de Seguros Imperio v Heath (REBX) Ltd [2001] 1 WLR 112 : the remedy is available in circumstances where no cause of action exists at law, so the factual circumstances giving rise to a claim need not be the same as those which would support a claim for breach of contract, and no comparable remedy is available at law. It follows that despite the powerful arguments put forward by Colman J [2005] 1 WLR 3733 in favour of holding that the same limitation period applies to claims for specific performance as to claims for damages for breach of contract, I think he was wrong in reaching the conclusion that P &amp; O’s claim was time-barred as a result of the application by analogy of the limitation period contained in section 5 of the Limitation Act 1980. Moreover, with all respect to the judge this is not in my view such an implausible position when one bears in mind that in general under English law limitation bars the remedy and not the right itself. Nor does it mean that claimants can delay with impunity safe in the knowledge that, although their claims for damages may become time-barred, their right to obtain specific performance can still be asserted. As one can see from the cases mentioned earlier, one can find many examples of the court’s refusing relief by way of specific performance as a result of delay far shorter than is necessary to bar a claim for damages. The equitable doctrine of laches, to which I shall turn in a moment, provides the court with ample power to refuse relief when delay on the claimant’s part would make it inequitable to grant it and I should be surprised if there were many cases in which, in the absence of fraud, the court would be willing to grant relief by way of specific performance if the claim had not been made within six years after the contract was due to be performed.</span>” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, Mr Wolfson QC pointed out that a claim for specific performance would have been available immediately on the failure to make payment under Clause 2 – some six and a half years after the accrual of the contractual cause of action. Furthermore, again as Mr Wolfson QC pointed out, any such entitlement would have accrued following a breach of contract, in circumstances which are exactly analogous with a claim for damages for breach of contract, a claim which is itself subject to a six-year limitation period. This is in contrast to the position in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Nedlloyd</span> where the availability of specific performance did not depend on establishing a breach of contract. In the present case, any liability under Clause 3 only arises on breach of Clause 2 and as a remedy for that breach. In such circumstances, I agree also with Mr Wolfson QC that Mr Taruta must be taken to have known from the moment of breach that he had an entitlement under Clause 3.1.1 yet he did nothing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, again as Mr Wolfson QC submitted, Clause 3.1.1 is only one of the aspects of the mechanism under Clause 3.1; it is inextricably tied to the other elements of that remedy, with the individual liabilities set out under Clause 3.1 implementing an overriding remedy contained in Clause 3 overall. It follows that there is some force in Mr Wolfson QC’s observation that the individual sub-clauses are so connected that they should not be enforced individually.

Such a conclusion effectively makes the specific performance claim subject to a statutory limitation period which does not apply to it.  </p>

In consequence, there was always the prospect or possibility that relief could be obtained in respect of Clause 3.1.1 which could not be obtained under Clause 3.1.2 (or under Clause 2), and so that Mr Mkrtchan would have to comply with the discrete aspects of Clause 3 without having to comply with all the obligations which it contains. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In any event, I agree with Mr Foxton QC when he submitted that there is no evidence that Mr Mkrtchan has suffered detriment in the belief that Mr Taruta would not enforce his rights under the Amended Settlement Agreement, and (to the extent that it is relevant) no basis on which to conclude that Mr Taruta acquiesced in Mr Mkrtchan’s failure to perform. Mr Wolfson QC sought, in this respect, to rely upon the fact that Mr Mkrtchan is now imprisoned in Russia and so was unable to attend trial or give evidence in his defence – indeed, also that he has been made subject to swingeing fines and orders for compensation which would (if ever enforced) make him destitute. This, in circumstances where the Russian criminal proceedings which gave rise to Mr Mkrtchan’s imprisonment arise, so Mr Wolfson QC suggested, directly from his ongoing involvement with IUD as a shareholder and manager following the Amended Settlement Agreement. I agree with Mr Foxton QC, however, that this is not relevant prejudice for laches purposes, specifically that the linkage between Mr Mkrtchan’s trial and imprisonment in Russia and the Amended Settlement Agreement is somewhat tenuous. </p>
