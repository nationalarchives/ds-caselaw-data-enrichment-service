	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">This case has been brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (“the FCA”), the regulator of the defendant insurers, as a test case to determine issues of principle in relation to policy coverage under various specimen wordings underwritten by the defendants in respect of claims by policyholders to be indemnified for business interruption losses arising in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the advice of and restrictions imposed by the UK Government in consequence. We have been asked to determine those issues as to the correct construction of the policy terms and as to whether cover is available in principle by reference to a set of agreed facts (which we summarise in the next section of the judgment) and assumed facts (which were essentially illustrative factual scenarios as to how certain businesses have been affected). Since, in their oral submissions, the parties did not rely upon the assumed facts, we have not felt it necessary to set them out in this judgment, although we have taken them into consideration in reaching our conclusions. </p>

The Framework Agreement provided that the parties have a mutual objective of achieving the maximum clarity possible for the maximum number of policyholders and their insurers, consistent with the need for expedition and proportionality. The parties agreed to put forward for consideration a representative sample of the standard form business interruption policies issued by the defendant insurers in the test case. In these proceedings, the FCA represents the interests of the large number of policyholders who purchased the relevant policies, many of whom are small to medium sized enterprises.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">On the same day as the Claim Form was issued, the FCA made an application, supported by the defendant insurers, for (i) the expedition of the trial and (ii) the Financial Market Test Case Scheme under Practice Direction 51M to apply to the claim. That Practice Direction provides for the Scheme to apply to any Financial List claim which raises issues of general importance in relation to which immediately relevant authoritative English law guidance is needed. It also provides that in a case of particular importance or urgency the trial may, at the court’s discretion, be heard by a court consisting of two Financial List judges, or a Financial List judge and a Lord or Lady Justice of Appeal. The first Case Management Conference (“CMC”) on 16 June 2020 was heard by Butcher J alone. Orders were made for the expedition of the trial and for the case to be heard under the Scheme with the trial being conducted by what was in effect a Divisional Court consisting of Flaux LJ and Butcher J. The trial was fixed for 8 days from 20 July 2020.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">At that first CMC, there was an issue about the FCA’s proposed reliance on certain expert evidence about the prevalence of the disease at various dates. The Court ruled that there would be no expert evidence going to the issue of actual prevalence, from either the FCA or the insurers. However, it was left open to the parties to raise arguments about what type of proof would be sufficient to satisfy the onus of proof on the insured about the prevalence of the disease, and the issue was to be revisited at the next CMC. </p>

We also dismissed Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Plc (RSA)’s application to introduce additional policy wordings as part of the factual matrix for construing the wordings with which we were concerned. We also dismissed the FCA’s application to adduce expert evidence in relation to certain diseases to aid the construction of an exclusion in the Ecclesiastical Insurance Office plc policies. Finally, on the question of expert evidence proving the prevalence of the disease, we reiterated the earlier ruling that such evidence was not to be adduced, ordering that at trial the issue would be confined to determining: (i) what type of proof could be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on the insured as to prevalence of the disease; and (ii) assuming that the FCA’s evidence was the best evidence available, whether that evidence would be sufficient in principle to discharge that burden. </p>

We received detailed written opening submissions from all the parties and the two interveners and oral submissions from counsel for the FCA, each of the defendants and the interveners. It was and is evident that a tremendous amount of hard work went into the preparation and presentation of the case at trial, on the part of all those involved and their legal advisers.

Certain of the lead policies are related to other policies issued by insurers who are not participants in the proceedings, such as RSA 4 which is in similar terms to certain policies issued by Aviva. Indeed, the FCA estimated that, in addition to the particular policies chosen for the test case, some 700 types of policies across over 60 different insurers and 370,000 policyholders could potentially be affected by the test case.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The relevant provisions of the lead policies essentially fell into three categories: (i) what the FCA termed “Disease Clauses”; (ii) what have been referred to as “Hybrid Clauses”; and (iii) clauses covering prevention of access and similar perils. We will deal with the three categories in turn. The structure of the remainder of this judgment is as follows: Section B, Factual Background, Section C, Applicable Principles of Construction, Section D, disease clauses, Section E, hybrid clauses, Section F, Prevention of Access and similar wordings, Section G, Issues of Causation (although as will become apparent we have reached the conclusion that most, if not all, of the issues of causation raised at some length by the parties are answered by the correct construction of the wordings) and Section H, Prevalence.  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days. That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies. And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now.  </span>

It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111.

And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency.

Although at the second CMC we declined to accede to an application by Mr Gavin Kealey QC for Ecclesiastical Insurance Office plc and MS Amlin Underwriting Limited (neither of which had been represented at the meeting) to strike out this plea, we indicated our firm view that, even in relation to the insurers represented at the meeting (and <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> in relation to those who were not), the meeting and what was said at it or after it was of no relevance to the issues of construction which we had to decide.

The other thing to say is that it isn’t just about the level, it’s also about the slope of the curve, and if the R goes above one anywhere, then that would eventually lead to an exponential rise and a second peak and an overwhelming of the NHS in that area unless it’s addressed, so although the level of the number of cases is different in different parts, the slope of the curve has actually been remarkably similar across the country, so that argues for doing things as a whole country together</span>.” </p>

We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.

So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home.  </span></p>

The court’s task is to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. It has long been accepted that this is not a literalist exercise focused solely on a parsing of the wording of the particular clause but that the court must consider the contract as a whole and, depending on the nature, formality and quality of drafting of the contract, give more or less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to that objective meaning. In <span style="font-style:italic">Prenn v Simmonds</span> [1971] 1 WLR 1381, 1383H1385D and in <span style="font-style:italic">Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar HansenTangen</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">(trading as HE Hansen-Tangen)</span> [1976] 1 WLR 989, 997, Lord Wilberforce affirmed the potential relevance to the task of interpreting the parties’ contract of the factual background known to the parties at or before the date of the contract, excluding evidence of the prior negotiations. When in his celebrated judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</span> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912-913 Lord Hoffmann reformulated the principles of contractual interpretation, some saw his second principle, which allowed consideration of the whole relevant factual background available to the parties at the time of the contract, as signalling a break with the past. But Lord Bingham of Cornhill in an extrajudicial writing, “A New Thing Under the Sun? The Interpretation of Contracts and the ICS decision” (2008) 12 Edin LR 374, persuasively demonstrated that the idea of the court putting itself in the shoes of the contracting parties had a long pedigree.  </p>

But, in striking a balance between the indications given by the language and the implications of the competing constructions the court must consider the quality of drafting of the clause (the <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Sky</span> case, para 26, citing Mance LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Gan Insurance Co Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd (No 2)</span> [2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 299, paras 13, 16); and it must also be alive to the possibility that one side may have agreed to something which with hindsight did not serve his interest: the <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold</span> case, paras 20, 77.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.02in;text-indent:0.50in">Textualism and contextualism are not conflicting paradigms in a battle for exclusive occupation of the field of contractual interpretation. Rather, the lawyer and the judge, when interpreting any contract, can use them as tools to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will vary according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements. Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis, for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they have been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals. The correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater emphasis on the factual matrix, for example because of their informality, brevity or the absence of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of complex formal contracts may often not achieve a logical and coherent text because of, for example, the conflicting aims of the parties, failures of communication, differing drafting practices, or deadlines which require the parties to compromise in order to reach agreement. There may often therefore be provisions in a detailed professionally drawn contract which lack clarity and the lawyer or judge in interpreting such provisions may be particularly helped by considering the factual matrix and the purpose of similar provisions in contracts of the same type. The iterative process, of which Lord Mance JSC spoke in <span style="font-style:italic">Sigma Finance Corpn</span> [2010] 1 All ER 571, para 12, assists the lawyer or judge to ascertain the objective meaning of disputed provisions.” </p>

The issue was whether this exclusion applied to the lending arrangement between Impact Funding and the solicitors. The court held that the exclusion clause applied. After stating the general principles of contractual construction, Lord Hodge (with whom Lord Mance, Lord Sumption and Lord Toulson agreed) made the following observations about interpretation <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentem</span>: </p>

The extent of AIG’s liability is a matter of contract and is ascertained by reading together the statement of cover and the exclusions in the Policy. An exclusion clause must be read in the context of the contract of insurance as a whole. It must be construed in a manner which is consistent with and not repugnant to the purpose of the insurance contract. There may be circumstances in which in order to achieve that end, the court may construe the exclusions in an insurance contract narrowly. The judgment of Carnwath LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Tektrol Ltd (formerly Atto Power Controls Ltd) v International Insurance Co of Hanover Ltd</span> [2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 780, to which counsel for Impact referred, is an example of that approach. But the general doctrine, to which counsel also referred, that exemption clauses should be construed narrowly, has no application to the relevant exclusion in this Policy. An exemption clause, to which that doctrine applies, excludes or limits a legal liability which arises by operation of law, such as liability for negligence or liability in contract arising by implication of law: <span style="font-style:italic">Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</span> [1980] AC 827, 850 per Lord Diplock. The relevant exclusion clause in this Policy is not of that nature. The extent of the cover in the Policy is therefore ascertained by construction of all its relevant terms without recourse to a doctrine relating to exemption clauses.”</p>

Like any other provision in a contract, words of exception or exemption must be read in the context of the contract as a whole and with due regard for its purpose. As a matter of general principle, it is well established that that if one party, otherwise liable, wishes to exclude or limit his liability to the other party, he must do so in clear words; and that the contract should be given the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which is reasonably available to the person or class of persons to whom the document is addressed. (See, among many authorities, <span style="font-style:italic">Dairy Containers Ltd v Tasman Orient Line CV</span> [2005] 1 WLR 215, para 12, per Lord Bingham.) This applies not only where the words of exception remove a remedy for breach, but where they seek to prevent a liability from arising by removing, through a subsidiary provision, part of the benefit which it appears to have been the purpose of the contract to provide. The vice of a clause of that kind is that it can have a propensity to mislead, unless its language is sufficiently plain. All that said, words of exception may be simply a way of delineating the scope of the primary obligation.”</p>

In my judgment, applying this approach, the Court must adopt an approach to the interpretation of insurance exclusions which is sensitive to their purpose and place in the insurance contract. The Court should not adopt principles of construction which are appropriate to exemption clauses - <span style="font-style:italic">i.e</span>. provisions which are designed to relieve a party otherwise liable for breach of contract or in tort of that liability - to the interpretation of insurance exclusions, because insurance exclusions are designed to define the scope of cover which the insurance policy is intended to afford. To this end, the Court should not automatically apply a <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentem</span> approach to construction. That said, there may be occasions, where there is a genuine ambiguity in the meaning of the provision, and the effect of one of those constructions is to exclude all or most of the insurance cover which was intended to be provided. In that event, the Court would be entitled to opt for the narrower construction. This result may be achieved not only by the applicable of the <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentem</span> approach, but also the approach adopted by Lord Clarke, JSC in <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</span> [2011] UKSC 50; [2011] 1 WLR 2900, that in the case of ambiguity, the Court may opt for the more commercially sensible construction, at paragraph 21: “<span style="font-style:italic">If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other</span>”. That said, as Lord Clarke, JSC also said, at paragraph 23 of his judgment: “<span style="font-style:italic">Where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it</span>”. This would, however, be subject to considerations of absurdity or where something plainly has gone wrong with the language of the contract.” </p>

In this section, we will consider the proper construction of a series of provisions to which the FCA refers as “disease clauses”.  Provided that this way of referring to them is not permitted to influence questions of the ambit of the coverage provided, it is a helpful way of distinguishing a group of coverage provisions which cover prevention of access and similar perils, which we analyse later in this judgment.  The clauses with which we will deal in this section are: (i) the “Defective Sanitation, Notifiable Human Disease, Murder or Suicide” cover in Argenta 1; (ii) the “Notifiable disease, vermin, defective sanitary arrangements, murder and suicide” covers in MSA 1 and MSA 2; (iii) the “Murder, suicide or disease” cover in QBE 1 and the “Infectious disease, murder or suicide, food or drink poisoning” covers in QBE 2 and QBE 3; and (iv) the “Infectious Diseases” cover in RSA 3 and the “Notifiable Diseases and Other Incidents” cover in RSA 4. </p>

There was a Notifiable Disease in all parts of the UK by 6 March 2020.  There was an occurrence of that Notifiable Disease within 25 miles of an insured’s premises when a person or persons with COVID-19 was within 25 miles of those premises.  There was interruption of or interference with the business from 16 March 2020, or from a later date to be determined by the Court, as a result of the government’s instructions and/or announcements as to social distancing, selfisolation, lockdown and restricted travel and activities, or alternatively, in cases where businesses were ordered to close, from 23 March 2020.  Any losses as insured were sufficiently causally connected with the interruption or interference and the interruption or interference “followed” the occurrence of COVID-19 if they would not have occurred had there been no COVID-19 outbreak or intervention by the government.  In relation to this last aspect, the FCA contended that the word “following” deliberately connotes an event “<span style="font-style:italic">which is part of the factual background and represents a looser causal connection than ‘resulting from’ and similar</span>”.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">For its part, RSA contended that there was no cover under RSA 3 on the basis advanced by the FCA.  As elaborated by Mr David Turner QC, RSA made three groups of points, as follows.  In the first place, he submitted that the cover was only against business interruption or interference proximately caused by a local outbreak of a Notifiable Disease (i.e. one within 25 miles of the premises).  That, he submitted, imported a requirement of “but for” causation.  The use of the word “following” did not alter this.  Had there been no occurrence of COVID-19 within a 25 mile radius of insured premises, the insureds’ businesses would still have suffered from a general reduction of demand after 1 March 2020, and would also have suffered from the impact of the government’s social distancing measures from 16 March 2020, and from any closure measures, because those would have been introduced anyway by reason of the occurrence or feared occurrence of the disease in areas other than the 25 mile radius.  Secondly, RSA submitted that cover for an epidemic such as COVID-19 was, in any event, excluded by the terms of General Exclusion L.  Thirdly, RSA relied on the socalled “trends clause” in the BI section of the policy as limiting its liability under the relevant extension to any loss which would have been sustained had the insured peril not occurred, which RSA contended meant had the local occurrence not occurred.  This was said to provide an alternative route to the same result as reached by reason of the first two arguments.  We will consider each of these points in turn. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In relation to the first argument it is helpful to deal at the outset with two preliminary points.  The first is that it is common ground that COVID-19 was a Notifiable Disease for the purposes of Extension vii (a)(iii) in all parts of the United Kingdom by 6 March 2020.   The second is as to what constituted an “occurrence” of COVID-19, and in particular what constituted such an “occurrence” within the 25 mile radius provided for in Extension vii.  The FCA’s case is that there will have been an occurrence of the disease whenever or wherever a person had contracted COVID-19 such that it was diagnosable, whether or not it had been verified by diagnosis, and whether it was symptomatic.  RSA’s pleaded case is that nothing less than an actual diagnosis of COVID-19 would be sufficient to establish any relevant “occurrence”. We consider that there will have been an “occurrence” of COVID-19 within an area when at least one person who was infected with COVID-19 was in the relevant area.  We do not consider that it is necessary for there to have been an “occurrence” of the disease that the case should have been diagnosed.  The definition of Notifiable Disease is in relevant part “<span style="font-style:italic">illness sustained by any person resulting from … any human infectious or human contagious disease</span>…”  Such a Disease thus “occurs” when the illness is “sustained” by a person, which we consider means, in simple terms, that they are suffering from it, not that they have been diagnosed with it.  This fits in with the other parts of the Extension.  For example, in sub-clause a(i) of Extension vii, if there were cases of food poisoning at the premises, which led to business interruption, but it took some time for it to be diagnosed that this was due to a Notifiable Disease, we would consider that the Notifiable Disease had “occurred” when there were the first cases of food poisoning, and that the “occurrence” was not postponed until there was diagnosis.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The next issue which needs to be addressed, and on which there was extensive argument, is as to what is required by the causal connectors within Extension vii, and in particular as to whether interference or interruption with the business was part of the loss or part of the insured peril, and as to the meaning and effect of the word “following”.  Taking the first of those particular points, for our part we consider that the “peril insured against” is the composite peril of interruption or interference with the Business during the Indemnity Period following one of (a) to (d).  Accordingly the requirement of proximate causation, codified in marine insurance by section 55(1) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, but which is a reflection of the common law, including as to non-marine insurance, is between the loss claimed by the insured and such “<span style="font-style:italic">interruption or interference with the Business</span>”.  The requirement that the business interruption or interference should “follow” one of (a) to (d) is, as we see it, a requirement within the composite peril insured.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">As to what is intended by the requirement that the business interruption or interference should “follow” one of (a) to (d), we consider that this imports more than merely a temporal relationship.  We consider that the FCA is correct to say that it involves a requirement that one of (a) to (d) should have a causal connection to the business interruption, but not necessarily one of proximate causation.  While it is the case that courts tend to avoid drawing nice distinctions between causative phrases in an insurance context, and that it is often appropriate to infer that the intention of the parties was to refer to the established test of proximate causation, it does not appear that it is appropriate to construe “following” here as having that meaning.  As we have said, we do not consider that it is a link between the loss and the peril, which is the central case where it is generally to be inferred that the parties intended a test of proximate causation.  In any event, it appears to us that, in context, it was used to denote a looser form of link than that of proximate causation.  Its natural meaning does not itself import such a link, and it makes good sense that a word implying a looser link should be used in recognition of the fact that, of the matters referred to within Extension vii, (a) and (d) would not of themselves directly cause interruption to or interference with the business, but would in almost every case have such an effect only via the reaction of the authorities and/or of the public.  In (b) and (c) that part of the chain is specified in the clause, but not in (a) and (d), and thus the use of the word “following” is entirely understandable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We were not persuaded by RSA’s arguments to the effect that the word “following” must denote proximate causation by reason of other provisions of Extension vii.  There were two such arguments.  One focused on the terms of the definition of “Indemnity Period” given in the extension, and in particular on the words “shall be affected <span style="font-style:italic">in consequence of</span> the occurrence discovery or accident”.  The phrase “in consequence of”, RSA submitted, must be read as requiring proximate causation.  In our view, however, the phrase is used simply to refer to the requirement that the interruption should “follow” one of (a) to (d) which is specified in the main body of the extension.  “Following” on any view, and as the FCA accepts, imports some causal connection and as we see it, the phrase “in consequence of” is intending to refer to the same connection.  It is significant that, within the definition of “Indemnity Period”, what is envisaged is that the “occurrence discovery or accident” shall have business interruption or interference as a “consequence”.  But, as we have already said, the “occurrences” in (a) and (d) would not have a direct effect on the business.  “In consequence of” is accordingly intended to embrace, at least, indirect causation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The second argument is based on the terms of Clause 4 under the heading “<span style="font-style:italic">Additional Definition in respect of Notifiable Disease</span>” in Extension vii, and in particular the words “We shall only be liable for the loss arising at those <span style="font-weight:bold">Premises</span> which are directly affected by the occurrence discovery or accident…”  We consider that this provision is aimed at ensuring that there is no cover for the effects on the business which do not arise from those premises which are impacted by the contingency insured (whether it be (a), (b), (c) or (d) within Extension vii).  Accordingly, for example, this provision makes clear that, if vermin or pests were discovered at an insured’s premises A and as a result the competent local authority shut down the insured’s premises B as well as a result of concerns about the insured’s safety standards, the business interruption caused by the shutting of premises B would not be covered.  In our view, however, it is not intended to narrow the cover provided under (a) to cases where the relevant occurrence or discovery occurred at premises A or had an effect upon premises A without any intermediate cause.  That would be inconsistent with the grant of cover in respect of the business interruption following any occurrence of a notifiable disease within 25 miles of the Premises, which clearly envisages that the occurrence of the disease will be at a distance of up to 25 miles from the Premises in question.  A disease occurring at such a distance would only be likely to have an effect on the business at the Premises indirectly, namely via the reaction of the authorities and/or the public.  </p>

Nonetheless, given that the FCA accepts that even the term “following” imports a causal link, we regard it as necessary to consider how that can be said to have been fulfilled.  Furthermore, the FCA made it clear that, while its primary case was that Extension vii does not import a requirement of proximate causation, it contended that it would not make any difference if it did: that there would be cover under the clause even if it needed to be shown that a proximate cause of the business interruption was the occurrence of a Notifiable Disease within a radius of 25 miles of the Premises. We will consider that argument here as well, in case the matter goes further and because it is a theme relevant to other “disease clauses” which we have to consider. </p>

The government’s decisions were based on the fact that there were such occurrences in a very large number of places.  The decisions were accordingly based on all of those occurrences.  He said that the way in which this should be analysed is either that there was one indivisible cause, namely the disease, of which all the outbreaks formed part, or that there were many different concurrent effective causes, none of which is excluded.  That analysis, Mr Edelman QC submitted, meant that the looser “following” test was certainly satisfied, but also that there was proximate causation, if that needed to be shown. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">This is undoubtedly a significant argument, but it is one which we are unable to accept because we have concluded that it does not withstand detailed consideration of the nature of a cover in relation to Notifiable Disease in the terms of that provided for in Extension vii.  Two matters are fundamental to this conclusion.  The first is the language of the particular clause.  Extension vii (a) is not expressly confined to cases where the interruption has resulted only from the instance(s) of a Notifiable Disease within the 25 mile radius, as opposed to other instances elsewhere.  Nor in our view does the language used in this clause implicitly have that effect.  Instead, the clause can and should properly be read as meaning that there is cover for the business interruption consequences of a Notifiable Disease which has occurred, i.e. of which there has been at least one instance, within the specified radius, from the time of that occurrence. The wording of the clause, in other words, indicates that the essence of the fortuity covered is the Notifiable Disease, which has come near, rather than specific local occurrences of the disease. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The second matter is the implications of the fact that the cover relates to occurrences of a Notifiable Disease.  By reason of the terms of 1(ii) of the Additional Definition of Notifiable Disease, Notifiable Diseases include those which are required to be officially notified.  The relevant scheme for notification, as mentioned above, is contained in the 1984 Act and the 2010 Regulations. Under the 2010 Regulations, registered medical practitioners have a duty to notify proper officers of the relevant local authority, amongst other things, of grounds for suspecting that a patient has a notifiable disease.  Under the same Regulations, the relevant local authority must disclose the fact of a notification of a notifiable disease to, amongst others, PHE, and to the proper officer of the local authority in whose area the patient usually resides, if different.   At the time of the conclusion of the contracts of insurance in question, there were some 31 diseases specified in Schedule 1 to the 2010 Regulations as notifiable, including cholera, plague, typhus, yellow fever and SARS.  Under RSA 3, furthermore, the cover in Extension vii is not limited to Notifiable Diseases which have been included on Schedule 1 at the outset of the insurance, but extends to others which may be added thereto, as COVID19 has been. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">While there is clearly a spectrum of diseases within the category of Notifiable Diseases, it includes diseases which are capable of widespread dissemination, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus for which there is no vaccine.  It is in the nature of human infectious and contagious diseases that they may spread in highly complicated, often difficult to predict, and what might be described as “fluid”, patterns.  Furthermore, the list of diseases includes some which might attract a response from authorities which are not merely local authorities, and which is not a purely local response.  The requirement under the Regulations of notifications to PHE, and to other local authorities facilitates such wider responses.  Moreover, in terms of Extension vii, the fact that it is envisaged that the occurrence of a notifiable disease up to 25 miles away might be followed by interruption of business at the insured’s premises demonstrates, in our view, that the parties must have contemplated that there might be relevant actions of public authorities which affect a wide area.  They must also have contemplated that the authorities might take action in relation to the outbreak of a notifiable disease as a whole, and not to particular parts of an outbreak, and would be most unlikely to take action which had any regard to whether cases fell within or outside a line 25 miles away from any particular insured premises. </p>

By way of example, if 20 people contracted a Notifiable Disease in a town 24 miles away from the premises and the authorities decided as a result to take “locking down” or other action which affected the insured’s premises, there would on RSA’s case (as we understood it) be cover, even though the aim of the public authorities was in large part to prevent the disease spreading elsewhere including outside the area of the 25 mile radius.  On the other hand, if 20 people in a town 26 miles from the premises contracted the Notifiable Disease and the authorities decided to act by imposing a lockdown or other measures, there would be no effective cover for the resulting interruption or interference with the business, notwithstanding that some of those 20 people might have subsequently moved into, or infected people within, the 25 mile radius, and notwithstanding that a part of the motivation of the authorities in imposing the measures was to prevent or slow the spread of the disease within the 25 mile radius.   </p>

On RSA’s case, if the local measures were caused by the occurrence of the disease within the 25 mile radius, then there would be cover for their effects.  But if the disease developed and spread more quickly, so that the response was national, and simultaneous, then there would be no effective cover in any area, because the response was not taken specifically in relation to any particular area.  </p>

We do not consider that a reasonable person, equipped <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> with knowledge of the 1984 Act and the 2010 Regulations, would have understood the parties in using the words they did to mean that or intend such results. </p>

They argued that it became, on the FCA’s case, just a condition which had to be fulfilled, so that, if there were just one case of a disease within the 25 miles, then there would be cover for the effects of an epidemic which had no other link to the locality, but if no case came within 25 miles, then there would not be.

Even if the word “following” imports the requirement of proximate causation we would consider that, given the nature of the cover as we consider it to be, this is to be regarded as satisfied in a case in which there is a national response to the widespread outbreak of a disease.

As Mr Edelman QC submitted, there is material in the Agreed Facts which provides a sufficient basis for this analysis.  He pointed to the information which the government was acting upon, and a number of SAGE minutes, which show that the government response was the reaction to information about all the cases in the country, and that the response was decided to be national because the outbreak was so widespread.  As Mr Edelman QC pointed out, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Mr Hancock, on 28 April 2020 stated that thought had been given to imposing measures first on London and the Midlands, but it had been decided that “<span style="font-style:italic">we are really in this together</span>”, and that “<span style="font-style:italic">the shape of the curve … has been very similar across the whole country</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">While RSA seeks to rely on the appearance of the word “epidemic” within Exclusion L, it appears to us that this reliance carries no conviction.  “Epidemic” is not alone in the list but, as we have said, is in the company of “poisoning” and “disease”.  As we have said, we find it impossible to consider that loss as a result of these matters insofar as expressly covered under Extension vii, was intended to be excluded by this General Exclusion.  Furthermore, the list of diseases which, even at the time of the conclusion of the contracts of insurance, were required to be notified to the competent local authority included some, such as SARS, which might undoubtedly give rise to an epidemic; and furthermore Notifiable Diseases as defined in Extension vii were not a closed category, and clearly a newly occurring disease giving rise to an epidemic would be likely to lead to a requirement for notification, as indeed happened with COVID-19.  Accordingly, there is cover under Extension vii for certain losses following an epidemic, and for the same reasons as apply to “poisoning” and “disease” we find it impossible to accept that the general exclusion was intended to withdraw such express cover.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We consider that the correct construction of the policy is that sub-clause L(b) (bis) must be understood as meaning that the terms of the exclusion were not intended to override express grants of cover, or at least was not intended to apply to the disease clauses in Extension vii.  It seems likely that L(b)(bis) was included precisely to cater for the possibility that, without it, General Exclusion L might not fit well with other terms of the policy in which it was being included.  L(b)(bis) is not confined to preserving the effect of other exclusions in the policy, because the first part of the clause applies to “<span style="font-style:italic">all other terms and conditions of the Policy</span>”, and the second part of the clause applies to a particular class, namely exclusions, which are “especially”, which connotes not exclusively, not to be superseded.  It is therefore wide enough, in our view, to apply to cases such as the present, in order to avoid the absurdity, and potential unfairness, of an express grant of cover being eliminated by a General Exclusion dealing with a range of matters most of which are irrelevant to the cover involved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">RSA’s third main argument relates to the “trends clause”.  It contends that the “trends clause” included after the “Definitions for Section 2” is applicable to the calculation of an indemnity under Extension vii.  This is notwithstanding that the “trends clause” is couched in terms of “circumstances” affecting the Business either before or after “the Incident”, and “Incident” is defined as loss, destruction or damage to physical property.  RSA contends that this should, in effect, be manipulated, so that it is applicable to nondamage perils insured under the extensions to Section 2.  The FCA contends, by contrast, that the indemnity under Extension vii is not subject to any of the contractual quantification machinery, and the “trends clause” is relevant only if that machinery is applicable.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In our view, though the policy is not well drafted, it should be construed as meaning that the contractual quantification provisions are applicable for the purposes of the calculation of the indemnity under Extension vii.  It would, in our view, be commercially surprising if the parties intended that the provisions relating to quantification of business interruption claims arising out of damage should not apply, with appropriate adjustments, to claims in respect of non-damage perils and the parties should be left to debate the correct approach to the quantification of such claims notwithstanding their agreement on the principles relating to claims for business interruption following damage.  If this is right, then there is also no good reason why the “trends clause” should not apply to such non-damage claims, though it would necessarily have to be manipulated to make it applicable.  That manipulation would involve reading the clause as saying <span style="font-style:italic">“… adjustments shall be made as may be necessary to provide for the trend of the Business and for variations in or other circumstances affecting the Business either before or after the occurrence of the insured peril or which would have affected the Business had the insured peril not occurred so that the figures thus adjusted shall represent as nearly as may be reasonably practicable the results which but for the insured peril would have been obtained during the relative period after the occurrence of the insured peril</span>”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">There are two important related preliminary points about the “trends clause” in this wording, which are equally applicable to all the trends clauses and provisions which we are considering. First, it is in the quantification machinery for a claim, so that it is not part of the delineation of cover, but part of the machinery for calculating the business interruption loss on the basis that there is a qualifying insured peril. Where the policyholder has therefore <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> established a loss caused by an insured peril, it would seem contrary to principle, unless the policy wording so requires, for that loss to be limited by the inclusion of any part of the insured peril in the assessment of what the position would have been if the insured peril had not occurred. Second, subject to the particular wording providing for something different, the object of the quantification machinery (including any trends clause or provision) in the policy wording is to put the insured in the same position as it would have been in if the insured peril had not occurred. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Therefore, in applying this clause, as manipulated, the insured peril would need to be recognised as the interruption or interference with the business following the occurrence of a Notifiable Disease within 25 miles.  Given that the “trends clause” is intended simply to put the insured in the same position as it would have been had the insured peril not occurred, and given the construction which we have found to be correct in relation to the ambit of the insured peril under Extension vii (a)(iii), what this means is that one strips out of the counterfactual that which we have found to be covered under the insuring clause.  This means that one takes out of the counterfactual the business interruption referable to COVID-19 including via the authorities’ and/or the public’s response thereto.  The relevant Indemnity Period, however, only starts with the first occurrence of a Notifiable Disease within the 25 mile radius, because that is provided for in the special definition of Indemnity Period contained within Extension vii itself.  Accordingly, to the extent that there was business interruption or interference related to COVID-19 before that date the insured could not claim for it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The FCA contends that there will be cover under Clause 2.3(viii)(d) of RSA 4 for any interruption or interference with an insured’s business as a result of COVID-19, including the government’s and the public’s response thereto, as from 31 January 2020, when there were the first diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the UK.  The FCA’s contention is that, as from that date, COVID-19 had occurred within the “Vicinity” (as defined in RSA 4) of all premises in the UK.  The FCA calls attention to the particular terms of the definition of “Vicinity” and argues that, as a notifiable disease with a national impact, and one which had already become a national epidemic in other countries, the occurrence of COVID-19 anywhere in the UK could reasonably be expected to have led to a national response, and all businesses in the UK would reasonably be expected to be impacted by such measures.  Its alternative case is that the Vicinity requirement was satisfied when COVID-19 occurred in a more localised area of the insured premises, this being a question of fact to be determined in each case.  But, the FCA submits, (i) an occurrence of COVID-19 within at least the same city, town or village or other development is always likely to be within the Vicinity; and in any case (ii) that the area involved remains relatively wide.  </p>

In particular the FCA contends that it cannot have been the intention of the parties that cover would be confined to the adverse effects of a response to a disease which occurred only inside the Vicinity, assuming that imports a relevant geographical constraint, and that there would be no cover if the disease was both within and outside the Vicinity and the response was to the disease as a whole.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">RSA’s submissions were that Vicinity, as used in the policy, has a “<span style="font-style:italic">physically circumscribed (as opposed to an expansive)</span>” meaning.  It contended that the words “<span style="font-style:italic">area surrounding or adjacent to</span>” suggest “<span style="font-style:italic">close spatial proximity to the Premises</span>”.  The FCA’s case that Vicinity could extend to the whole of the UK was incorrect.  RSA accepted that what constituted the Vicinity was fact specific in each case, but denied that Vicinity would always include the same city, town, village or other development.  RSA further contended that the only causally relevant incidences of a notifiable disease were those within the Vicinity of the premises.  The relevant insured event, it submitted, “<span style="font-style:italic">must be one specific to the Vicinity</span>” and cannot be one which takes place over a wide area which encompasses the Vicinity.  What falls within the insured peril must happen inside, and not beyond, the Vicinity, and it is only that which happens inside the Vicinity which must proximately cause the relevant business interruption for there to be cover.   Any interruption or interference with the insureds’ businesses would have been caused either by the general presence of COVID-19 in the country as a whole or by the closure measures and/or the social distancing measures, and none of those were caused by the occurrence of a notifiable disease within the Vicinity of insureds’ premises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We also had the advantage of detailed submissions from the HIGA Interveners on RSA 4, including on the Notifiable Diseases aspect of its cover.  The HIGA Interveners emphasised in particular the following matters.  The definition of Notifiable Diseases &amp; Other Incidents includes a list of 33 illnesses, which largely, but not entirely, mirrors the list of notifiable diseases in Schedule 1 of the 2010 Regulations.  One of those listed diseases was SARS which emerged in China and spread to various countries in 20022003, and which in certain places led to stringent control measures.  The policy thus specifically envisaged that there would be cover for business interruption as a result of SARS, a disease capable of causing an epidemic or pandemic, occurring in the Vicinity of the insured’s premises.  Furthermore, the definition of Notifiable Diseases &amp; Other Incidents meant that there would be cover for any additional disease which became notifiable under the 2010 Regulations.  A disease included in that category might well be highly contagious with the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic: a highly contagious, fast-spreading, serious disease is exactly the sort of disease which would be expected to be made notifiable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the HIGA Interveners stressed that the use of the term Vicinity meant that RSA 4 was unlike every other policy in the test case.  The relevant area in which the disease must have “occurred” was not expressed in terms of a fixed, measurable distance from the insured location.  Under the RSA 4 definition, while the Vicinity is an area surrounding or adjacent to an Insured Location, that did not place a limit on the size of the area.  The second part of the definition was therefore of key significance, and what that involved was identifying the area surrounding the location in which events occurring would reasonably be expected to have an impact on the insured or its business.  In that part of the definition, “events” must refer to the relevant triggers within the insured perils.  What this definition entails is that the area constituting the Vicinity could depend on three matters, namely (a) the nature of the “events”, (b) the nature of the insured’s business, and (c) the location of the Insured Location.  In the case of a new notifiable disease, the area constituting the Vicinity would depend on its nature.  In the case of COVID-19, a highly contagious, and often fatal, disease, the relevant area would be the entirety of the UK because one would reasonably expect a national response which might affect the insured’s premises wherever they were.  If that were correct then RSA had no remaining basis for denying cover, as any interruption or interference which resulted from the presence of COVID-19 in the country, including the national response thereto, would unquestionably be the result of a notifiable disease within the Vicinity. </p>

In particular cover was not precluded by the requirement that the interruption or interference with the business should be “a result of” the notifiable disease within the Vicinity.  In this context Mr Philip Edey QC, for the HIGA Interveners, submitted that “as a result of” did not import a requirement of proximate causation.  That test was apposite between the loss and the peril. Here the peril was business interruption or interference resulting from a notifiable disease in the Vicinity.  The phrase “as a result of” was accordingly a link within the insured peril; there was no presumption that it meant proximate causation; and meant something looser than that.  But even if that was wrong, any causal requirement was satisfied in this case, when the nature of the peril was understood, because, given the nature of the peril, the cause should be regarded as one indivisible thing, namely COVID-19, of which the local cases were a part, or each was a different equally effective cause. </p>

She drew attention to the fact that one of the HIGA Interveners, insured under the equivalent of the RSA 4 wording, though not in fact by RSA, has 340 locations in the country, and the vicinity of those locations (on any view of that term) covers a large swathe of the country.  On RSA’s argument, that insured could not establish that interference with its business was the result of the notifiable disease within the Vicinity of any of those 340 locations, because it would have resulted from the occurrence of the disease elsewhere. She submitted that that was an absurd result which demonstrated the fallacy of RSA’s case. </p>

This is the question of the date on which COVID-19 is deemed to have been a notifiable disease.  There is no dispute that COVID-19 is a notifiable disease in the sense of Definition 69 (ii).  What is in issue is the relevant date of its “initial outbreak”, and thus the deemed date of its being a notifiable disease in accordance with that Definition.  The FCA contends that the “initial outbreak” was on 31 December 2019, when the first cases in Wuhan were confirmed.  RSA contends that the date of the “initial outbreak” is 31 January 2020, when the first positive test for COVID-19 occurred in England.  We consider that the FCA is correct in relation to this point.  The Definition does not refer to an initial outbreak “within the Territorial Limits” or within England and Wales or within the UK.  </p>

If that outbreak was abroad, subsequent appearances of the disease in the UK, which might well be isolated and sporadic, would not readily be described, without any elaboration, as “the initial outbreak” of the disease.  As we have said, however, we doubt that this conclusion is of great significance, given the Vicinity requirement which, on any party’s case, could not be met by an occurrence of the disease in China. </p>

We fully accept that the ordinary meaning of “vicinity” is a near area, and that the ordinary meaning of a word, even if the word is contractually defined, is some guide to what it is intended to mean as defined.  We accept that it would not be normal parlance to refer to the whole of England and Wales as within the “vicinity” of any part of England and Wales.  Nevertheless, given the particular terms of the definition of Vicinity in RSA 4, the perils insured under the policy, and the role that the defined term has in relation to those perils, we consider that the FCA and the HIGA Interveners are correct to say that, in relation to a disease such as COVID-19, an extensive area, possibly embracing the whole country, can be regarded as the relevant Vicinity for the purposes of this wording.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We say this because it appears to us to be correct that, given the terms of the definition, the extent of the Vicinity depends in part on the nature of the event which may occur within it.  “Events” in this context must include the occurrence of any of the notifiable diseases within Definition 69 (i), (ii) and (iii).  The occurrence of some of those diseases, anywhere in the country, might very well, possibly depending on the nature of the insured’s business, reasonably be expected to have an impact on it.  One example given by the FCA is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in sheep and cattle which, depending on the insured’s business, might reasonably be expected to have an impact on it, even though the outbreak was geographically very distant.  More similar to the case of COVID-19 is SARS, which as we have set out was named in the policy as a notifiable disease.  Given the severity of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 in various countries, it would in our view have been reasonably expected, at the time of conclusion of the contracts of insurance, that a significant outbreak of a SARS-like disease anywhere in the UK would have “an impact” on an insured or (depending in part on what that business was), its business.  That is not to say that the extent of the measures in the event taken in relation to COVID-19 or the extent of its effects on the population and the economy would reasonably have been expected, but some impact would be.  A similar point can be made in relation to malicious deposits of radioactive isotopes or of biological or chemical materials within Definition 69 (iv).  It is, and we consider would have been at the time of the conclusion of the policies, reasonably expected that some such incidents would have a very wide-ranging, and possibly national, impact.   </p>

What that area might be is not something which we can determine and would need to be addressed on a case by case basis.  It will only be material to do so, however, if RSA is right to contend that, if the Vicinity is confined as it alleges, then even if there was a case or cases of COVID-19 within the relevant Vicinity, because there will also have been the occurrence of the disease outside that Vicinity, the cover under 2.3 is not intended to apply to such a situation and/or that the cases outside the Vicinity will have been the cause of the interruption to or interference with the business.

We do not consider that that construction is dictated by the words used.  The cover is not confined to the effects of a disease occurring only within the Vicinity, nor in our view is it expressly or implicitly confined to the effects only of the cases of the disease within the Vicinity.

We do not consider that in agreeing Clause 2.3 (viii)(d) the parties would be reasonably understood to be restricting the cover to interference or interruption of the business which was caused only by the fact that the relevant disease was within “the Vicinity”, as distinct from its also being outside “the Vicinity”.   </p>

The nature of highly infectious or contagious notifiable diseases is that cases in different areas will be related to each other, having spread from one source to multiple individuals in different places.  As people move, the disease moves with them.  Given the nature of notifiable diseases, which was a matter which was or is taken to be known to the parties when agreeing the insurances, we consider that the correct construction of the cover provided by Clause 2.3 and in particular by (viii)(d), is for the business interruption or interference caused by a notifiable disease, if that notifiable disease occurs within “the Vicinity”.  The occurrence of at least a case of the disease within the Vicinity is required for there to be cover, which is a restriction which means, on the interpretation of Vicinity now under consideration, that there is no cover for diseases which are only geographically remote.  </p>

As we understood it, this argument was principally directed to supporting RSA’s argument that cover was provided only for the occurrence of a relevant insured event, here a disease, specific to the Vicinity, and not in respect of one which occurs in a wide area encompassing the Vicinity.  We did not consider that this point had force in relation to RSA 4.  It is true that Definition 17 is of “Covered Event”, and that it refers to the matters in the Insuring Clauses as “events”. That appears simply as a shorthand for what is in the various insuring clauses, some of which (as in Clause 2.3 itself) are more specifically identified as “specified causes”, while Clause 2.4 is by contrast called a “Cyber Event”.  Certainly, we do not regard Definition 17 as importing any additional requirement or re-definition of what constitutes an insured peril beyond what is set out in Clause 2.3 itself.   Moreover, a consideration of the matters within Clause 2.3 indicates that the insurance in that clause is not simply against the effects of a matter which may happen at one time and be swiftly over.  The cover in respect of the deposit of radioactive isotopes etc, which is part of the cover under Clause 2.3 (viii), and Definition 69 (iv), is an example.  While the deposit may occur at a particular time, the cover will extend to the effect of the presence of the radioactive isotopes over a period of time.   </p>

We consider that, as such, the causal connection which the phrase imports must be one which gives effect to and does not defeat the intentions of the parties in agreeing the cover.  We agree with Mr Edelman QC that the phrase “as a result of” requires that the matter within one of (i) – (xiii) of Clause 2.3 should be an effective cause of the interruption or interference to the Insured’s Business. Given the nature of the insurance, which we have addressed above, that requirement is to be regarded as fulfilled on the basis either that the occurrence of the disease within the Vicinity was part of an indivisible cause, namely COVID-19 and the governmental and public reaction thereto, or was one of many equally effective causes. </p>

If we are right in relation to Vicinity, or if we are right in rejecting RSA’s case that, if Vicinity is given a narrower meaning, the occurrence of the disease outside the Vicinity constitutes a separate cause which can be relied upon as showing that the business interruption would have occurred even without the occurrence of the disease within the Vicinity, then there is no further point which arises in relation to the definition of Standard Turnover.  On these bases the “Covered Event” will include the effects of COVID-19 on the business, and that is what will need to be removed for the purposes of the Standard Turnover definition.  On our preferred analysis of what is meant by Vicinity, there will have been a Covered Event from the date of the occurrence of the disease in England and Wales. If Vicinity has a more confined meaning, then there will have been a Covered Event from the date on which there was the occurrence of a case of COVID-19 within whatever was the relevant </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The FCA contends that there was relevant cover under sub-clause (d) of the “Defective Sanitation, NOTIFIABLE HUMAN DISEASE, Murder or Suicide” extension.  It contends that COVID-19 was a Notifiable Human Disease for the purposes of the definition in the policy; and that there was an occurrence of an illness sustained by a person resulting from COVID-19 within a radius of 25 miles of the premises when a person or persons who had contracted COVID-19 was or were within that radius.  It argues that the reference in the extension to the BI section to “such interruption” is a reference to the primary, damage-based BI insuring clause, which refers to “BUSINESS at the PREMISES is interrupted”.  The FCA submits that all Argenta’s relevant insureds, and all Category 6 businesses, were interrupted from 16 March 2020, and thereafter by (i) the social distancing guidance including to stop all unnecessary travel of 16 March 2020; (ii) the 21 March Regulations closing bars and pubs to the extent those were run by Category 6 businesses; (iii) the 24 March 2020 statement on holiday accommodation closure; and (iv) the 26 March 2020 Regulations closing holiday accommodation.   </p>

There is no required element of authority action, though such action may well be the means by which the disease results in the interruption.  The FCA contends that COVID-19 within the 25 mile radius was at least <span style="font-style:italic">an</span> effective and proximate cause of the interruption.  The government was responding to the presence of COVID-19 around the country, and if there was a case of the disease within 25 miles of the premises that was a part of what the government and the public were responding to.  The parties had clearly not intended that cover could be denied on the basis that the causal connectors or a “but for” test could defeat a claim when a disease was both inside and outside the 25 mile radius.  The correct interpretation was that the disease occurring elsewhere was not “another matter”: it was the same disease as occurred within the 25 mile radius. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Argenta took issue with the FCA on three particular matters.  In the first place, it submitted that an insured would have to demonstrate that any interruption with its business had been proximately caused by the occurrence of COVID-19 within the 25 mile radius. Only the consequences of such a “local” occurrence were insured.  There was no cover provided for losses caused by measures taken in response to occurrences outside the 25 mile radius or the response of the public to such occurrences.  While Argenta accepts that there may be some cases where the occurrence of COVID-19 has caused some covered loss, for example where customers cancelled bookings prior to 16 March 2020 due to a specific occurrence of COVID-19 within 25 miles of the premises, or as a result of targeted lockdowns like the one in Leicester, these represent a tiny proportion of the COVID-19 claims received by Argenta.  Secondly, Argenta contends that sectional exclusion (iii), namely for losses arising from premises not “directly affected by the occurrence” was applicable.  Thirdly, Argenta contends that the correct application of the “trends clause” contained in the definition of “Standard Gross Income” was that there should be removed from the counterfactual only the occurrence of COVID-19 within the 25 mile radius.  On this basis policyholders would in all or almost all cases have suffered the same loss in any event because of the occurrence of the pandemic elsewhere and the governmental and international reactions to it.  In particular Argenta contends that there is no cover for any loss that would have been sustained in any event as a result of anyone complying with the UK Government’s advice on 16 March or 24 March, because such losses would have been sustained anyway, or as a result of the requirements to close holiday accommodation imposed on 26 March in England, Wales and Scotland, again because they would have been sustained absent any “local” cases.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The argument proceeds against a background of common ground that COVID-19 was added to the list of notifiable diseases set out in Schedule 1 to the 2010 Regulations as from 5 March 2020, and that it thereby became a Notifiable Human Disease as defined in the Argenta lead policy.  Further, it is common ground between the FCA and Argenta that an “occurrence” of COVID-19 for the purposes of Extension 4(d) requires there to be at least one person within the relevant 25 mile zone on the relevant date who has contracted COVID-19 such that it is diagnosable, whether or not it has been verified by medical testing and whether or not it is symptomatic.  Argenta accepts that there will have been an occurrence of COVID-19 within 25 miles of many of its policyholders by at least the end of April 2020, but its position is that it will be a matter for the policyholder to prove in each case.  Argenta accepts that this may be proved by reference to the best available scientific evidence at the time the issue is decided and does not dispute that inferential proof may be appropriate in relation to this issue. We return to these latter matters when considering “Prevalence”, in Section H below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Argenta’s case, as with that of other insurers where their policy contains what was called by Mr Edelman QC a “relevant policy area”, was that the policyholder needed to demonstrate that business interruption was the result of the occurrence of the disease within that area, and not its occurrence elsewhere.  In our consideration of the RSA policies, we have already given our reasons why we did not consider that that argument was correct in relation to the cover provided under those policies.  Equally, we do not consider Argenta’s similar argument to be correct in relation to its relevant policies, and for essentially the same reasons.  In brief, we do not consider that Argenta’s argument accurately reflects the nature of the cover provided by an agreement in the terms of its policies. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Critical here again is the fact that Extension 4(d) does not say “<span style="font-style:italic">any occurrence of a NOTIFIABLE HUMAN DISEASE only within a radius of 25 miles of the PREMISES</span>” or anything which dictates such a reading.  Essential also is that what was being insured under Extension 4(d) was business interruption resulting from Notifiable Human Diseases, and that it was known at the time of the conclusion of the contracts that such diseases embraced the list to which we have already referred, including SARS and other highly contagious or infectious diseases, which were required to be notified precisely in order to permit a response from the authorities, and some of which were capable of spreading over large areas, as infected people moved around.  Furthermore, the nature of the definition of Notifiable Human Diseases in the policy meant that newly occurring diseases, if made notifiable by the relevant authorities, would count, even if they had not existed or been notifiable at the outset of the policy.   The potentially widespread effects of the diseases in question were recognised by the fact that the “relevant policy area” was stipulated to be a radius of 25 miles, which, as the FCA reminded us on a number of occasions is an area of about 2,000 square miles, or as we were told, an area the size of Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire combined.  The ways in which a disease could have such an effect must have been recognised as including via the reaction of the authorities and / or the public.  The parties thus knew or must be taken to have known that what was being insured under Extension 4(d) was business interruption deriving from a range of diseases some of which might spread over a wide and unpredictable area, and which might have an effect at a considerable distance from a particular case, including through the reaction of the authorities; and where it might well be impossible to distinguish whether that reaction was to the disease within or outside the relevant policy area. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In the context of Argenta’s submissions, two particular anomalies of its position appeared to us to be striking.  The first relates to its case that there would not be any cover for any loss which would have been sustained as a result of anyone complying with the UK Government’s advice on 16 March as to avoidance of unnecessary travel, or of 24 March that Category 6 businesses should remain closed for leisure-related stays, or with the 26 March Regulations when businesses providing holiday accommodation in most of the UK were required to close their premises.  This case is that, even if the policyholder could show that there had been a case of COVID-19 in the relevant policy area by any of these dates, there will be no cover because these steps would have been taken anyway.  However, as the FCA pointed out, in the particular context of holiday accommodation, whether that accommodation was within an area of some 2,000 square miles with no COVID-19 or alternatively was in an area with COVID-19, would have been relevant to decisions as to where to go on holiday.  Had there been no government action which closed down holiday accommodation, the occurrence of the disease in the relevant policy area would have been likely to affect the holiday businesses in that area.  But, on Argenta’s case, because the government acted nationally and thus forestalled individual decisions based on or influenced by local incidence of the disease, there is no cover because that national response is to be regarded as an independent and the true proximate cause.  The insured would thus have been in a better position under its insurance if the government had not taken steps to prevent the spread of the disease, including restricting its spread within the relevant policy area.  It appears to us that such results cannot have been intended and an interpretation of the policy which gave rise to such results is not that which a reasonable person would have put on the language they used.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The other case which was the subject of argument in the context of Argenta was a “local” lockdown of the sort which, at the time of the hearing, had been introduced in Leicester, and which has subsequently been imposed or mooted elsewhere.  Argenta accepts that in the case of the imposition of such localised lockdowns there would be cover for business interruption resulting for businesses within the relevant policy area.  However, it is easy to imagine a case in which there were two local outbreaks (A and B), perhaps rather more than 25 miles apart, and the decision was taken on the basis of the occurrence of each to impose a lockdown on a wider area, which embraced both (the example given in argument was a lockdown of the East Midlands).  We consider that it would not be open to an insurer of a business in the relevant policy area of outbreak A to contend that the lockdown would have been imposed in any event because of outbreak B.  The reason, as we see it, is that such an argument would be inconsistent with the nature of the cover granted under Extension 4(d). </p>

The link “as a result of” is thus within the composite insured peril.  We nevertheless agree with Ms Leigh-Ann Mulcahy QC for the FCA that it imports a requirement that one of Extensions 1-6 must be an effective cause of the interruption; but that the application of the causal test must give effect to and not thwart the intention of the parties.  We agree that the test can be regarded as satisfied on the basis that the occurrence of the disease within the area was a part of an indivisible cause, constituted by COVID-19.   Or alternatively, that each of the cases of the disease was an independent cause, and they were all equally effective in producing the government response.   </p>

It indicates that, in the case of multiple premises of the insured, it is only losses arising from the premises which are directly affected by the occurrence, discovery or accident (i.e. whichever of Extensions 4(a) to (e) is applicable) which are covered.  In relation to Extension 4(d), its main significance is likely to be to eliminate losses arising from premises which are not within a radius of 25 miles of an occurrence of a notifiable disease.  On our analysis, set out above, however, if there was the occurrence of a case of  COVID-19 within the 25 mile radius of an insured’s premises, then we consider that those premises count as “premises directly affected by the occurrence”. </p>

Given that the “trends clause” is intended simply to put the insured in the same position as it would have been had the insured peril not occurred, and given the construction which we have found to be correct in relation to the ambit of the insured peril under Extension 4(d), what this means is that one strips out of the counterfactual that which we have found to be covered under the insuring clause.  This means that one takes out of the counterfactual the business interruption referable to COVID-19 including via the authorities’ and/or the public’s response thereto.   </p>

The FCA contends that the “disease clauses” in MSA 1 and 2 are the most straightforward such clauses in this test case.  This is because, as the FCA puts it, they require only (1) loss “resulting from” or “as a result of” interruption or interference with the business (2) “following” any COVID-19 within 25 miles of the premises.  </p>

It accepts that from 5 March 2020 in England and from 6 March 2020 in Wales COVID-19 was a notifiable disease for the purposes of the policies.  It does not accept that it could be shown that there was a notifiable disease within the relevant area if the case was not diagnosed and was asymptomatic. In any event it contends that the insured would have to establish that any business interruption was caused by the illness of a person or persons within the 25 mile radius from the premises.  And MSA further contends that this can be tested by assuming that the person(s) in the radius who had the disease, did not have it. Would that have made a difference?  MSA suggests that the answer will be that the government’s response would have been no different.  </p>

It appeared to us that the appropriate manipulation of the consequential loss definition, to make it applicable to the cover in Additional cover 6, was that it should read “interruption of or interference with the <span style="font-weight:bold">business</span> carried on by <span style="font-weight:bold">you</span> at the <span style="font-weight:bold">premises</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">following</span> [one of (a) to (d)]”.  Certainly, we see no reason to construe “following” in Additional cover 6 as having a meaning different from its natural meaning by reference to a different clause which is admittedly drafted without proper reference to the terms of the Additional covers.  In any event, we would consider that, even if the definition of “consequential loss” is to be read, as manipulated, as including the words “in consequence of [the insured peril]”, this is a shorthand for the causal requirement in the Additional covers.  </p>

The MSA “disease clauses” are not expressed in terms of the “occurrence” or “manifestation” of the disease, but rather in terms of there being the disease within the 25 mile radius. That would embrace any case where a person has or persons have the disease within the radius.  The definition of notifiable disease does not require that the disease should have been diagnosed.  More generally, as the FCA submits, the fact that the relevant MSA clauses do not refer to an “occurrence” makes it, to our minds, relatively straightforward to conclude that the cover extended to the effects of a notifiable disease if and from the time it is within the 25 mile radius and is not limited to the specific effects only of the instances of the disease within the radius.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, as the FCA pointed out, MSA’s interpretation of the provision in Condition 3 to Additional cover 6, namely that the insurer would only be liable for loss “<span style="font-style:italic">arising at those </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">premises</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which are directly affected by the loss, discovery or accident</span>”, was in line with its own, namely that what it was aimed at was to exclude losses which might arise from the interruption of business at insured’s premises B, if there was a “knock on” effect on that business from a matter affecting the insured’s premises A.  We consider that that is the correct construction of the provision.  MSA was right, in our view, not to seek to raise an argument that that provision assisted its argument that there was no effective cover under the “disease clauses” because of the fact that the notifiable disease, here COVID-19, was present and had effects outside the stipulated radius. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, there was an issue as to whether the “trends” provision in the definition of “standard turnover” in both MSA 1 and 2 was applicable to the covers under the “disease clauses”.  We conclude that it is, notwithstanding the reference in it to “damage”.  In our view the parties cannot have intended that the policy should be silent on how non-damage business interruption losses should be calculated given that they had made provision for the calculation of damage-based business interruption claims.  Furthermore, there are particular definitions of “Indemnity period” and “Maximum indemnity period” for the “Notifiable Disease cover”.  Those definitions are only relevant when assessing the insured’s losses in accordance with the basis of settlement provisions, because it is only those provisions that require, in relation to the gross profit basis of settlement that the insured’s claim for reduction of turnover be assessed by reference to the amount that the turnover “during the indemnity period” falls short of standard turnover.  That appears to us to show that the parties intended the basis of settlement provisions to be applicable to the additional covers.  </p>

It contends further that there will have been an interruption or interference with the business from 16 March 2020 given the government advice and lockdown restrictions from that date, alternatively (but only when the business was ordered on that date to close) from 20 March 2020; and that the interruption or interference arose from and was caused by the disease, if they would not have occurred had there been no COVID-19 outbreak or interventions by the government.  The FCA further contended that the bases of settlement clauses and quantification machinery (including the “trends clause”) do not apply to claims under the relevant extension of cover in two of the four policies within the QBE 1 type (QBE 1 PBCC040120 and PBCC170619), though it accepts that the quantification machinery (and “trends clause”) is made applicable in relation to QBE 1 POFF180120.  In relation to QBE 1 POFP040120 the FCA contends that while there is an incorporation of the contractual quantification machinery, and while the relevant definitions say that they are “trend adjusted” there is no definition of what that means, and it is ineffective.   </p>

Did the insurances have the meaning contended for by the FCA, such that they covered the effects of a notifiable disease, if it occurred within the relevant policy area, or did they cover only the consequences of such occurrence of the disease as there was in the relevant policy area, such that if an interruption in the business would have happened in any event by reason of the occurrence of the disease elsewhere, there was not cover?  As he submitted, once that question of construction had been answered, whichever way it was answered, there would be little if anything left by way of issues of causation.  He submitted that QBE’s construction was correct, and that the FCA’s approach to the clauses meant that the requirement of the manifestation or occurrence of the disease within the relevant radius became a matter of chance or happenstance, irrelevant to the purposes of the insurance, and reduced the insurance to “a game of lotto”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">At the heart of the dispute in relation to these policies is the question of whether the insured is entitled to recover only for business interruption which can be shown to have been the consequence of the manifestation / occurrence of the disease within the particular radius as opposed to its manifestation / occurrence or the threat of its manifestation or occurrence outside that radius.  This depends on a proper construction of the policies, and it is necessary to consider each separately and in turn.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">One minor issue of construction should be addressed at the outset.  This is what is meant by “manifested” as used within Clause 7.3.9(a).  Clearly someone who is displaying symptoms of a disease can be said to “manifest” it. We consider that it would also be the case that a person “manifested” the disease if, though superficially asymptomatic, he or she was diagnosed with the disease, because the disease would have “manifested” itself to the diagnoser.  We do not consider that it is possible to speak of someone who is asymptomatic and has not been diagnosed as having the disease as having “manifested” it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We turn therefore to the main issues of construction of Clause 7.3.9.  It is a clause which is expressed in a somewhat convoluted way.  We understood it to be common ground, however, and in any event appears clear, that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">an outbreak of which the local authority has stipulated shall be notified to them</span>” simply identifies the relevant human infectious or contagious diseases as being notifiable diseases, including those notifiable under the 2010 Regulations.  AIDS and AIDS-related conditions are not relevant.  Accordingly, for the purposes of simplicity, Clause 7.3.9 can be shortened as follows: “interruption or interference with the business arising from: (a) any notifiable human infectious or contagious disease manifested by any person whilst in the premises or within a 25 mile radius of it…”.  That is the relevant insured peril. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Focusing on the language and structure of Clause 7.3.9, we consider that, within the insured peril, the required causal link (“arising from”) is between the interruption or interference with the business on the one hand and the notifiable disease on the other, provided it has been “manifested” by a person within the 25 mile radius.  We do not consider that the clause most naturally reads, or should be construed, as saying that the interference has to result from the particular case(s) in which the disease is manifested within the 25 mile radius.  Instead the cover is for the effects of a notifiable disease if it has been manifested within the 25 mile radius.  This appears to us to be apparent from the juxtaposition of the phrase relating to business interruption with that relating to notifiable disease, and the fact that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">manifested by any person whilst in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">premises</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or within a twenty five mile radius of it</span>” is most naturally read as an adjectival clause limiting the class of notifiable diseases which, if they interfere with the business, will lead to coverage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We consider that this makes good sense.  On this interpretation, cover is provided for the effects of a notifiable disease on the business, if the disease has come to or within the specified distance of the premises; and is not provided solely for the consequences of the particular manifestation of the disease by one or more individuals who happen to be within the radius.  On this basis, what would be significant is the fact of the disease having been (relatively) close, not whether it was the particular case(s) within the radius which had had any specific effect.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The clause does not spell out, or seek to limit cover by reference to, the ways - or what might be called the “transmission mechanisms” - by which the notifiable disease may cause interruption or interference with the business.  It is obvious that one such way for business interruption or interference to arise is as a result of the response of governmental or local authorities, and of the public, to the existence of the notifiable disease.  Consistently with this, there is no exclusion in Clause 7.4.3 of loss caused by civil, government or military authority caused by or following disease.   If a notifiable disease manifested itself both within and outside the 25 mile radius it would be likely that there would be such governmental / public responses to the disease outbreak, rather than to specific cases of the disease, either those within or outside the radius.  The construction we favour of the terms of Clause 7.3.9 avoids the anomaly of there being no effective cover in such a case.  </p>

The insurers clearly cannot, on this basis, contend that the occurrence of the disease elsewhere, or the reaction to it, are to be regarded as separate causes.  There is to be regarded as sufficient causation of the business interference if the disease which has manifested itself in the radius is an effective cause of that business interference.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Specifically, in QBE 2, there is a combination of factors which together, to our minds, indicate that the cover is indeed intended to be confined to the results of specific (relatively) local cases.  This combination of factors has meant that our first, and subsequent, impressions of the relevant “disease clause” is not as contended for by the FCA and the HIGA Interveners.  In particular, the relevant clause has the following features.  In the first place, the insuring clause itself identifies the matters in (a) to (f) as “events”. This indicates that what is being insured is matters occurring at a particular time, in a particular place and in a particular way: see the dictum of Lord Mustill in <span style="font-style:italic">Axa Reinsurance v Field </span>[1996] 1 WLR 1026 at 1035 as to the meaning of “event”.

Given the reference to “events”, and taken with the nature of the other matters referred to in (a), (b) and (d) to (f), the emphasis in (c) appears to us in this clause not to be on the fact that the disease has occurred within 25 miles, but on the particular occurrences of the disease within the 25 miles.  It is the “event” which is constituted by the occurrence(s) of the disease within the 25 mile radius which must have caused the business interruption or interference.  If there were occurrences of the disease at different times and/or different places then these would not constitute the same “event”, and the clause provides no cover for interruption or interference with the business caused by such distinct “events”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">This focus of the clause is then emphasised by the fact that in (h), it is stated that the insurer is only to be liable for loss arising at those premises which are directly subject to the “incident”, and that in (i) there is a limitation per “incident”.  These uses of the word “incident” appear to us to reinforce the fact that the clause is concerned with specific events, limited in time and place.  This is further emphasised by the terms of Clause 18.47.2, which reiterates that the cover is in respect of the effects on the business in consequence of “an event”; and, although the reference in Clause 18.47.2 to the subparagraphs of Clause 3.2.4 (at least in the version put before us) are inapposite, it is significant that there is a further reference to the “incident”.  Clause 3.2.5, which provides that certain clean-up costs may be recoverable in relation to matters falling within Clause 3.2.4 contains a further reference to an “incident” (Clause 3.2.5(b)). </p>

In the General definitions, at Clause 18.2, there is an “accumulation limit”, which limits the maximum amount of benefits payable by the insurer “where a single event, or series of events in a twenty kilometres radius originating from the same proximate cause, occurs…”.  This indicates that the draftsman, and the parties in agreeing the wording, distinguished between an event, a series of events, and a cause.  When the term is used in Clause 3.2.4 it envisages that each of the matters within (a) to (f) will be an event, not a series of events or a cause.   </p>

However, as we have said, the terms of Clause 3.2.4 show that there is cover only if there is business interruption as a result of the “event” of the person(s) sustaining that illness within the area.

Proviso (i) to Clause 3.4.8 refers to an “incident”.  On these bases we consider that this clause too is confining cover to the consequences of certain happenings, in particular specific occurrences of the disease within the radius, as opposed to other happenings or events, including instances of people contracting the disease outside the radius.   The fact that the radius specified in QBE 3 is 1 mile makes it all the easier to accept that this is what the parties have agreed, because that reinforces the view that what is being contemplated is specific and localised events. </p>

The requirement that the losses should be “solely and directly” the result of the interruption, was relevant only to the relationship of the losses to the interruption, not to the causes of the interruption.  As to the requirement that the interruption should be “caused by” the restrictions imposed by the public authority, there could be little dispute as to this, if the FCA’s case on the meaning of “interruption”, of “restrictions imposed” and of “inability to use” were accepted.

The Hiscox Interveners supported the contentions of the FCA.  The Hiscox Interveners particularly stressed that the words “solely and directly” qualify only the requirement that losses must result from the interruption to the business.  On the other hand, it is enough if one cause of the inability to use the insured premises was the restrictions imposed by the public authority.  If all the elements of the insured peril ((1) occurrence of a notifiable disease, (2) following which, restrictions imposed by a public authority, (3) an inability to use the insured premises as a result, (4) causing an interruption in business activities, (5) resulting solely and directly in losses) were present, then Hiscox must indemnify the insured in respect of its business interruption loss.  Insofar as there was a question of “but for” causation, the question was whether “but for” all the elements of the insured peril what would the insured’s position have been, i.e. “but for” the entire chain of events, including the occurrence of the disease.  That also answered the counterfactual question posed by Hiscox: it was a world in which all the elements of the insured peril did not exist.   </p>

In such cases, the right construction was the broader one.  Further he submitted that it was impossible to read into the Hiscox policies the restriction of “occurrence” to a local matter specific to the premises.  The clauses did not include any such limitation and could not be read as doing so. </p>

Accordingly, it was only the inability of the insured to use the premises which was relevant and no one else’s.  Secondly, inability to use denoted the insured being unable to use the premises, not something less.  Thirdly, the “restrictions” referred to, particularly because of the use of the word “imposed”, must be mandatory.  The only restrictions capable of fulfilling those requirements, and then only in respect of businesses covered by them, were Regulation 2 of the 21 March Regulations and Regulations 4 and 5 of the 26 March Regulations.  Fourthly, the only “occurrence” contemplated by the clauses was one which was local and specific to one or more of the insured, its business or its premises.  There was, Hiscox contended, no relevant “occurrence” here.  Fifthly, the clause contemplated an “occurrence” that was identifiable, which, in the present context meant a case of COVID-19 which had been scientifically confirmed.  An unidentifiable occurrence could not lead to public authority action.  Sixthly, the word “following” required a causal connection and there was no such connection between any occurrence and the restrictions.  Seventhly, interruption meant cessation and nothing less.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We begin with the issue of what is meant by “restrictions imposed” by a public authority.  The issue has to be addressed by considering the words used and the context in which they are used.  In our view, what these words mean is something which is mandatory, and they do not include something which is less than mandatory.  This is the natural meaning of “imposed”.  Furthermore, these words are used in the context of a resulting inability on the part of the insured to use its own premises.  That reinforces the conclusion that what is being referred to is something that has the force of law.  Each of paragraphs (a) to (e) of the “public authorities” clause in – by way of example – Hiscox 1 is a case in which mandatory action can be taken by relevant authorities in respect of premises under identifiable legal or statutory powers, and the reference to “restrictions imposed” most naturally refers to the legally binding powers that can be exercised in relation to those situations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">What this means for present purposes is that the only relevant matters which constituted “restrictions imposed” are those which were promulgated by statutory instrument, and in particular Regulation 2 of the 21 March Regulations and Regulations 4 and 5 of the 26 March Regulations.  Guidance, exhortation and advice given by the Government, including by the Prime Minister, including as to social distancing, do not count as “restrictions imposed” by a public authority.  Nor would cases in which people decided not to visit premises, notwithstanding that they were legally permitted to do so, be caused by any “restrictions imposed”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We turn then to the phrase “inability to use”.  In our view this plainly does not embrace any and every impairment of normal use.  “Unable to use” means something significantly different from “hindered in using” or similar.  Furthermore, the phrase is used in a context which includes the various sub-clauses (a) to (e) (in Hiscox 1), in each of which situations restrictions amounting to a complete inability to use the premises for the purposes of the business (albeit typically for a limited time) are readily foreseeable.  We agree with Hiscox that there will not be an “inability to use” premises merely because the insured cannot use all of them; and equally there will not be an “inability to use” premises by reason of any and every departure from their normal use.  Hiscox accepted, however, in our view correctly, that partial use might be sufficiently nugatory or vestigial as to amount to an “inability to use” the premises.  Whether that was so would depend on the facts of a particular case.   </p>

As we understood it, such a police cordon would constitute a “restriction imposed” in that it would be unlawful to cross it without proper excuse.  Its effect would be to keep the public away, but it would not be directed either to the insured or to the insured’s use of the premises.   </p>

As we have said, “inability to use” premises means what it says and is not to be equated with hindrance or disruption to normal use.  Given the exceptions to Regulation 6, which include the general exception of “reasonable excuse” and the specifically enumerated exceptions including travel for the purposes of work where it was not reasonably possible for the person to work from home, and given the possibility (and reality) that businesses could operate or come to operate by contacting customers at home, it appears to us that the cases in which Regulation 6 would have caused an “inability to use” premises would be rare.  Whether there were such cases would be a question of fact.   </p>

We recognise that that is the typical case of what may fall within the sub-clause.  However, we do not consider that the words used dictate that no other episode (to use what is intended to be a neutral term) can qualify, and nor is the context sufficient to mandate such a limited meaning.  It is true that the phrase used is “an occurrence”, but in talking about “an occurrence” of a disease the clause is in our view plainly not equating “occurrence” with each case of the disease, such that if there were two or more cases it would necessarily follow that there was not “an occurrence” but multiple occurrences.  We consider that there can be “an occurrence” of a notifiable disease for the purposes of the clause if there is an outbreak of such a disease.  We therefore consider that the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK could qualify as “an occurrence” of a notifiable disease. </p>

In relation to Hiscox 1-3 this may not be of great significance in that, if we are correct to say that the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK was “an occurrence” of a notifiable disease then any “restrictions imposed”, to the extent that there were any (as to which see above), “followed” that outbreak.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">With more hesitation, we reach a similar conclusion in relation to Hiscox 4.  For reasons which we have canvassed in relation to the “disease clauses” above, when one is considering notifiable diseases, it is not difficult to envisage that official responses will be to the full extent of an outbreak, and not necessarily specific to those in a given geographical area.  In the circumstances, and unless the language otherwise dictates, it is appropriate to regard a response as having “followed” the local occurrence of the disease, provided that the response was temporally posterior, if it was a response to the outbreak of which the local occurrence formed a part.  Were this not the case, similar anomalies to those we have considered in the context of the “disease clauses” would arise in relation to Hiscox 4.  An example would be a case where there was a severe outbreak of a disease within the same town as the insured’s premises but just outside the one mile area, and also a few cases within the one mile area; and the outbreak outside the 1 mile area, and its potential to spread, was the reason which led to the local authority imposing the restrictions, the fact that there had actually been cases within the one mile area playing no part in the authority’s thinking.  It would be surprising if there were not cover in such a circumstance, and while we accept that that result might be dictated by the terms of the clause, we do not consider that it is by the wording of Hiscox 4.  The relevant clause would reasonably have been understood to be requiring the link to be between the restrictions imposed and a disease which has “occurred” within a one mile radius, rather than between the restrictions and the specifically local instances of the disease.   </p>

However, the stem wording has to be viewed in the context of the insuring clauses which follow. As we set out below, it seems to us clear from a number of those clauses, at least in the Hiscox 1 lead wording, that “interruption” in this wording is intended to mean “business interruption” generally, including disruption or interference, not just complete cessation.  </p>

There would be no good reason why the parties would have wanted the trends clause to apply differently as between claims involving material damage and claims involving non-damage business interruption. This is emphasised by the fact that such clauses can favour insureds on particular facts, as well as insurers on others, as Mr Gaisman QC pointed out.  We consider that there is here an obvious error and that it can be corrected as a matter of construction, as we consider that it can be in relation to a number of other policies which we have had to consider where a similar mistake has been made.   </p>

This means assuming that the insured peril did not occur.  The insured peril is a composite one, involving three interconnected elements: (i) inability to use the insured premises (ii) due to restrictions imposed by a public authority (iii) “following” one of (a) to (e), relevantly (b) an occurrence of an infectious or contagious disease. What the insured is covering itself against is, we consider, the fortuity of being in a situation in which all those elements are present. In answering the counterfactual question as to what would have been the position of the insured’s business but for the occurrence of the insured peril, it is accordingly necessary to strip out all three interconnected elements, including in this instance the national outbreak of COVID-19.   </p>

That would not, in our judgment be how a reasonable person would understand what was agreed.

That is part of the very nature of such restrictions.  We regard it as not being a reasonable interpretation of the parties’ agreement that the insured could only recover to the extent that it could show what was the position which would have appertained without the restrictions, but on the basis that the situation which had led to those restrictions is assumed to have occurred, in circumstances where the insured has been put into an unusual situation by the emergency (and accordingly cannot rely simply on the ordinary results of its business) and where the  effect of the restrictions will have been to render it impossible to say with any certainty what that position would have been. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In our view, the FCA effectively illustrated the fallacy and unreality of the insurers’ case in relation to the counterfactual, with particular reference to the Hiscox “public authorities” clauses, by focusing on the provision of cover in respect of an inability to use an insured’s premises, assumed to be a restaurant, due to restrictions imposed on them by the local authority following the discovery of vermin dislodged from a nearby building site.  On the insurers’ case, the counterfactual involved stripping out the restrictions, but assuming the vermin were in the premises throughout, with whatever other consequences on the business the presence of vermin would have had.  Thus, on insurers’ case the insured could not recover in respect of the period after the imposition of the restrictions, unless it could show that customers not coming to the restaurant was due to the restriction imposed rather than due to the vermin, and that if the insured could not demonstrate that customers would have come despite the presence of vermin, it could not recover.  As the FCA submitted, this would render the cover largely illusory, as insurers would argue that, as no one is likely to want to eat at a restaurant infested by vermin, all or most of the business interruption loss would have been suffered in any event. Such illusory cover cannot have been intended and is not what we consider would reasonably be understood to be what the parties had agreed to.  </p>

It was suggested on behalf of insurers that it would be done by cross-examining customers as to their motives in not coming.  Quite apart from the impracticality of such an exercise if dealing with a large number of customers, insurers provided no answer to how all the customers who had not come could be identified, given that, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, they had not come, and the restrictions had made it impossible for them to do so.   </p>

For reasons developed in the context of the “disease clauses” the FCA’s case was that the requirement that the closure or restrictions should be “as a result of” a disease manifesting itself in the 25 mile radius imported no special requirement other than proximate causation which was met here because the Governmental actions and advice were the response to the occurrence of COVID-19 nationwide.  </p>

But RSA does not accept that there was any “closure” or “restrictions” placed on cottages prior to 26 March 2020.

Further, it was only the cases which manifested themselves within the 25 mile radius which had any causal relevance.  The policy would respond, if at all, only to the consequences of events within the prescribed radius, rather than to the consequences of events taking place in a wider area.  None of the government’s measures, including the closure measures of 26 March, had been caused by the presence of COVID-19 specifically within the relevant radius of each premises, but as a result of the occurrence and anticipation of a nationwide pandemic.  </p>

If the social distancing measures were a part of the “restrictions placed on the premises” then the correct counterfactual involved an assumption that the premises could have remained open, there would have been no legal prohibition against customers travelling to or staying at the premises, but there would still have been a COVID-19 epidemic in the country and all other businesses in the vicinity of the premises whose closure was mandated by the 26 March Regulations would have been required to stay closed.  If the social distancing measures were not part of the peril insured then the correct counterfactual assumes that the premises would not have been closed from 26 March 2020 but that customers would still have been prohibited, by Regulation 6 of the 26 March Regulations, from travelling to or staying in the premises.  On either analysis, there would have been no difference in outcome.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The argument that it is only the local cases of the disease which have causal significance in relation to the closure or placing of restrictions on the premises, is one which we have considered in relation to other wordings.  In our view, on this clause, that is too narrow a construction.  The phraseology used is that the closure or restriction must be as a result of the notifiable disease manifesting itself at the premises or within a 25 mile radius. The link is thus expressed in terms of whether the disease has shown or manifested itself close to the premises.  Individual cases within the area are therefore treated as the demonstration of the presence of the disease at or relatively near the premises, rather than being focused on as being, in themselves, the cause of the closure or restrictions.  For reasons which we have already canvassed this is not surprising.  Notifiable human diseases may manifest themselves in areas which are not constrained by boundaries such as a 25 mile radius, and the response of the authorities is likely to be to the whole of whatever outbreak there is, rather than parts.  In the same way as for a number of the “disease clauses”, we consider that there will be satisfaction of this requirement of the clause, if and from the time that there has been a case of the disease within the 25 mile radius, and this can be regarded as having led to (resulted in) the closure or restrictions placed on such premises on 26 March because it was part of one cause of those restrictions, which were imposed by the government as a response to a national picture which was made up of the individual local parts.   </p>

The social distancing measures did not amount to “enforced closure”.  Furthermore, RSA contended that the health reasons or concerns which give rise to the enforced closure must not be of a general global or national nature but must arise from matters “occurring in the Vicinity”.  In the context of this clause, RSA relied also contended that any business interruption would have been caused by the general presence of COVID-19 in the country as a whole or by the social distancing measures, and also relied on the Standard Turnover clause as another route to the same conclusion. </p>

We agree with RSA that this would extend to closure which either is or is legally capable of being enforced.  By “legally capable of being enforced” we include a case of where a governmental authority or agency or local authority directs that particular premises should be closed, and states that if they are not closed then a compulsory order for their closure will be obtained.  But we consider that in that type of situation, there would have to be a clear direction by an authority which has the power to close premises that they should be shut failing which a compulsory order will be obtained.  In the present case, we consider that the only “enforced closures” resulting from the actions of the government about which we have been addressed would be the closures of all or part of premises pursuant to the 21 and 26 March Regulations. To the extent that they required the closure of all or part of the premises of insureds under RSA 4, there will have been “enforced closure”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The 21 and 26 March Regulations were undoubtedly imposed “for health reasons or concerns”.  The remaining question is whether the “enforced closure” had to be the result of “health reasons or concerns” which arose from matters occurring in the Vicinity, and if so, whether that requirement was satisfied.  In our view, the correct reading of the clause is that it is the “health reasons or concerns” which need to “occur within the Vicinity”.  The only other candidate is that the “enforced closure” must be within the Vicinity, but it would be unnecessary to say that.    As we have already said above, we consider that the meaning of Vicinity in RSA 4, with its extended definition, could, depending on the facts, embrace a very extensive area, including possibly, in the case of a disease such as COVID-19, the whole country.  If that is right, then we regard it as clear that the “health reasons or concerns” “occurred” within all relevant Vicinities. Even if Vicinity has a narrower meaning of close geographical proximity, however, we consider that there were “health reasons or concerns” which occurred in all such vicinities.  This is because the clause does not require that there be particular cases of a disease in any vicinity at any given time.  What is required is that there should be </p>

On behalf of Arch Mr John Lockey QC submitted that, under this wording, the insured peril is prevention of access to the premises as a result of government actions or advice taken in response to an emergency likely to endanger life or property. The insured peril or risk is not as the FCA contends the “emergency”. We agree with Mr Lockey QC the insured risk is not the “emergency” but is the interruption of the business resulting from the composite peril as described by Mr Lockey QC. </p>

Arch also accepts that, where the effect of the actions or advice was that businesses had to close or cease business, there was a prevention of access, in other words, it was not necessary that access be physically impossible or obstructed. Thus, in relation to the 20 March advice which was to the effect that nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres should close and that pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants should not remain open for consumption of food and drink on the premises but could continue to provide take-out services, Arch accepts that there was prevention of access to businesses in Category 2 and that, in relation to businesses in Category 1 which did not previously provide take-away services, access was prevented because they could not be opened to customers without the policyholder making a fundamental change to the nature of the business. Arch also accepted that the effect of the Prime Minister’s announcement on 23 March was that there was a prevention of access to the premises of businesses in Category 4, non-essential shops, and Category 7, schools and places of worship if they closed pursuant to the advice (although as stated above, only two Arch policyholders fall into this latter category). </p>

Where pubs, cafes or restaurants in Category 1 had a pre-existing take-away business, Arch did not accept that there was any prevention of access.

She contended that the Arch approach that, if part of the insured business (for example a take-away service) could still be carried on from the premises, there was no prevention of access, was completely unrealistic. Likewise in relation to Category 4, non-essential shops, where the 26 March Regulations permitted premises to be accessed to carry on a mail order or online business, she submitted that it was unrealistic for Arch to adopt the approach that if part of the business already involved mail or online orders there was no prevention of access.  </p>

Likewise, in the case of the service industries in Category 5, clients were only permitted to travel to the premises if it was essential to do so and she queried to what extent at the time of the lockdown, a visit to one’s financial adviser or accountant was essential. In each case there was a substantial reduction in turnover and she submitted that partial prevention of access to the premises for customers was still prevention of access for the purposes of this wording. </p>

Ms Mulcahy QC submitted that this was 16 March when the Prime Minister’s advice was to stop nonessential contact and unnecessary travel and avoid going to pubs, clubs and theatres.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Arch’s case focused on the meaning of the words: “Prevention of access to The Premises”. It was common ground for the purposes of all the policies which we are considering where the word “access” is used that this is the means of entry or approach to the premises. Mr Lockey QC submitted that “prevention” bore its ordinary and natural meaning of something which stopped the means of access. In the context of the government actions or advice, only such actions or advice which recommended or required the closure of the premises qualified as “prevention of access” for the purposes of this provision. He submitted that the FCA’s case conflated “prevention of access” with restrictions on the use of the premises but this provision was limited to “access” not “use”. Furthermore, he submitted that the FCA case conflated “prevention” with “hindrance”. Hindrance meant that access to the premises was rendered more difficult, but prevention meant that access was stopped, effectively prohibited. Other provisions in the Arch wording drew a clear distinction between prevention and hindrance.

He submitted that the restrictions on free movement imposed by Regulation 6 of the 26 March Regulations on those who may use the premises, whether the owner of the business, the employees or customers and clients, are not directed at the means of access to the premises and do not prevent access to the premises. He accepted that the fact that prevention could be as a result of advice meant that the prevention of access did not need to be legally or practically impossible. It was sufficient if the advice recommended closure of the premises, but the recommendation had to be for total closure. He also accepted that access for a limited purpose which was not a breach of Regulations requiring closure, such as to switch off the electricity or to carry out urgent maintenance, would not preclude there being a prevention of access, since it is access to the premises for the purposes of carrying on the business which must be prevented.  </p>

However, where a pub or restaurant already provided a takeaway service as part of its Business, at least where that service was more than a <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> part of the Business, and carried on providing that service during lockdown, Arch did not accept that there had been a prevention of access within the GLAA Extension.

He submitted that there could be no prevention of access to such businesses by reason of government action or advice where the relevant action or advice was to the effect that such businesses were expressly permitted to remain open. Furthermore, even if, contrary to Arch’s case, it was relevant to look at the position of the policyholder or employees or customers of such essential businesses, the Regulations expressly permitted all of them to work at or shop at essential businesses. The fact that some shops chose to close did not amount to a prevention of access within the GLAA Extension since such closure did not result from any government action or advice. The fact that businesses in Category 3 which stayed open had less footfall than usual or found it more expensive to operate because of social distancing advice did not amount to a prevention of access.  </p>

We were unimpressed by that argument. We have no sense that in any of these cases, the Courts gave to “prevention” or “hindrance” an unduly narrow meaning or anything other than a natural meaning in the particular commercial context. It seems to us that, albeit the definition of “prevention” requires some adaptation to take account of the fact that the clause we are considering concerns prevention of access to the premises as a result of government action or advice as opposed to prevention, for example in the delivery of goods, impossibility as the touchstone of prevention, as opposed to something being rendered more difficult, which is what “hindrance” connotes, is entirely apt.   </p>

The paradigm example is that of the local restaurant which in addition to in-restaurant dining offered a takeaway collection or delivery service which may have formed a substantial part of its business. Whilst the government advice and the Regulations required the restaurant to close so far as consumption of food and drink on the premises is concerned, Regulation 4 of the 26 March Regulations did not require the restaurant to close the premises to the extent that they were used for the purposes of providing a takeaway service. It seems to us that Mr Lockey QC is right that, in such circumstances, there is not a prevention of access, as the restaurant owner policyholder and his employees are not prevented from accessing the premises for the purposes of carrying on that part of the existing Business which involves providing the takeaway service. They may be impeded or hindered in their use of the premises because they cannot operate the restaurant for in-house dining, but the Arch GLAA Extension does not insure against “hindrance” or against prevention or hindrance of “use” of the premises. If it had been objectively intended by the parties to provide cover against hindrance of access as well as prevention of access they could and would have used the words “hinders or prevents access to The Premises” as they did in Clause (1). We agree with Mr Lockey QC that the FCA’s argument that there is prevention of access even if part of the pre-existing business (like a takeaway service or a mail order part of the business) is still permitted to be carried on, conflates “prevention” with “hindrance” when the two are distinct concepts with different meanings, for the reasons we have given.  </p>

That advice did not in any sense cause a prevention of access to any premises, as can be demonstrated by the example of pubs. As we discussed with Mr Lockey QC in the course of argument, for the rest of the week after 16 March, there seems to have been something of a “boozefest” with people making the most of going to pubs before the anticipated instruction to close which came with the government advice on 20 March that pubs should close. </p>

To the extent that, in consequence of the Regulation, fewer people went to the relevant shop or office or only did so for the purposes of buying essential supplies or transacting business which could not be carried out remotely from home, it could be said that there was hindrance in the use of the premises in question for the purposes of the Business carried on there, but it is a complete misuse of language to describe that as “prevention of access to The Premises”.

Where those businesses closed completely in response to the 20 March advice or the 21 March Regulations, there was a qualifying prevention of access from the moment of closure. If the business then set up a takeaway service which it had not carried on before, there was still a qualifying prevention of access, since that takeaway business was fundamentally different from the Business described in the policy schedule. However, if the business had an existing takeaway service which it continued to operate from the premises, then for the reasons we have given, there was no prevention of access, save possibly, as Mr Lockey QC accepted, where the existing takeaway service was a <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> part of the Business, which will depend on an analysis of the particular facts. </p>

As the FCA accepts, they were permitted to carry on business by Regulation 5. Since none of them had to close due to government actions or advice, there is simply no qualifying prevention of access under the GLAA Extension. It is no answer for the FCA to say that there was a reduced footfall in such businesses because people only went out for essential supplies or, in Ms Mulcahy QC’s example, could only purchase essential items from the hardware store. That may amount to an impediment or hindrance in the use of the premises, but it is not in any sense a prevention of access to the premises. Where the policyholder chose to close down the business because of reduced footfall or for some other reason, that is not a qualifying prevention of access, because the closure was not due to government actions or advice, since the relevant actions or advice permitted the premises to remain open.   </p>

Under Regulation 5 of the 26 March Regulations those shops and businesses had to cease trading and close their premises save for the purpose of making deliveries in response to orders received online, by telephone or by post. Where a business in this category closed completely pursuant to Regulation 5, there was a qualifying prevention of access from the moment of closure. In other cases, we agree with Mr Lockey QC that the question of whether coverage is triggered is fact sensitive. As with Category 1, if the relevant business, for example an independent bookshop, did not previously deliver pursuant to orders online or by telephone or by post, it seems to us that the setting up of such a service would not preclude there being a prevention of access, since that business would be fundamentally different from the business described in the policy schedule. In contrast, there would not be a prevention of access in the case of an estate agent which already conducted a proportion of its business online and which was permitted to continue using its premises to conduct that online business even though clients could no longer come to the premises in person. There will be variations according to the particular facts, for example if, before the closure was ordered the bookshop was already processing a handful of telephone and postal orders for elderly customers who were too infirm to come to the shop in person. Continuing that service after the Regulations came into force might be thought to be <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>, thus not precluding there being a prevention of access, but whether there was coverage would depend on the particular facts.  </p>

We agree with Mr Lockey QC that it cannot be said that there was a prevention of access within the meaning of the GLAA Extension in relation to any of those businesses. It is nothing to the point that clients or customers did not visit the offices of their accountant, lawyer or financial adviser because of the restrictions on movement imposed by Regulation 6 of the 26 March Regulations and conducted their business by Zoom or the like or by telephone. The offices were not required to close and at most there was an impediment or hindrance on the use of the premises, nothing which amounted to a prevention of access. To the extent that professional firms such as solicitors and accountants told their staff to work from home and not come into the office, that was due to the government advice to work from home where possible and due to the general concerns about the pandemic, not due to any actions or advice of government preventing access to the relevant premises. In other industries such as construction, the business in question was not ordered to close the construction site or sites and, if there were fewer workers than usual, that was due to general concern about the pandemic not due to any actions or advice of government preventing access. </p>

Mr Lockey QC submitted that the FCA’s case involved the heretical proposition that any and all causes of the operation of an insured peril are to be excluded from consideration whether those causes are identified in the insuring clause or otherwise, which was not a point which could turn on whether this was a composite peril or not.

First, on the agreed facts, many businesses did suffer a reduction in turnover in consequence of the pandemic, before any closure advice or the 21 and 26 March Regulations. The cause of any loss from that reduction in turnover was the emergency not the prevention of access due to government actions or advice. Second, even businesses permitted to remain open after 20 March suffered a loss of turnover compared to the same period last year because of the economic recession, the lack of consumer confidence and the restrictions on movement. Third, likewise, in the case of businesses required to close but which have since re-opened, they have also suffered a loss of turnover following the re-opening because of the economic recession and the lack of consumer confidence. He submitted that these were all issues which Arch was entitled to raise in any assessment or adjustment of the loss of any particular insured and the FCA was not entitled to declaratory relief which sought to rule out that entitlement.  </p>

The current provision requires adjustments for any trends or circumstances which would have affected the business had the Damage not occurred. The definition of “Damage” and the Cover (1) Gross Profit provision make it clear that in the case of “standard” Business Interruption cover under this wording “Damage” is not damage in the abstract, but accidental damage occurring by any cause not excluded by the terms of the Property Damage Section of the policy, that being the relevant insured peril. As we note in the section of the judgment on Causation where we deal with the decision of Hamblen J in<span style="font-style:italic"> Orient Express</span>, part of what we see as the fallacy in the reasoning in that case is that both the arbitrators and the judge proceeded on the basis that only the Damage in the abstract should be stripped out in assessing the counterfactual under the trends clause. However, we consider that, on a proper analysis, the insured peril in that all risks policy was not Damage in the abstract, but Damage caused by a fortuity, there the hurricane, so that what should have been stripped out in the counterfactual was not just the Damage but the Damage and the hurricane. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">It follows that upon the true construction of the Arch policy wording, the comparison required for the assessment or adjustment of the business interruption loss is between the performance of the business as a consequence of the prevention of access to the premises due to the actions or advice of the government due to the emergency and what the performance would have been had there been no emergency and thus no government actions or advice and no prevention of access to the premises. Of course, other trends of the business which would have operated had the insured peril not occurred will be taken into account. The example used by the parties during the course of argument is of the Michelin starred restaurant whose principal chef handed in his notice at the end of February to expire at the end of March. In all probability that business would have seen a downturn in business irrespective of the pandemic which must be brought into account.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In our judgment, this approach to the counterfactual question raised by the trends provision is not only correct on the true construction of the policy wording but accords with commercial and practical reality. We agree with Mr Edelman QC that the approach advocated by the insurers of stripping out the government restrictions etc. and their immediate effect, such as, in the case of the Arch wording, prevention of access, whilst leaving the pandemic and its economic and social effects is entirely artificial and ignores the inextricable connection between the various elements of the insured peril, both as a matter of legal analysis and as a matter of practical reality, given the nature of the pandemic emergency. For reasons elaborated in more detail in Section G of the judgment dealing with causation, we do not consider that “but for” causation, upon which insurers placed considerable reliance, requires a different result, if it is relevant at all, given our conclusion as a matter of construction of the policy wording. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">That leaves the issue raised by Mr Lockey QC’s first practical point, the fact that many businesses had suffered a reduction in turnover as a consequence of the pandemic and its social and economic effects before the insured peril operated, here before the actions or advice of the government due to the emergency that businesses should close, thus preventing access. This was an issue raised generally by Mr Edelman QC in submissions on behalf of the FCA. In the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">New World Harbourview</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Hotel v Ace Insurance </span>[2012] HKCFA 21; [2012] Lloyd’s Rep IR 537, a case concerned with a business interruption claim arising out of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Sir Anthony Mason NPJ (in a judgment with which the other members of the Court agreed) concluded that coverage was not available in respect of the period before the date when the disease became notifiable, because the cause of the loss under the policy wording had to be a notifiable disease and a disease did not become notifiable until it was required to be notified, which was on 27 March 2003. Before that date, any loss caused by SARS was caused by a loss which was not notifiable and hence not covered by the insurance.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Edelman QC contended that even if that case was correct, it could be distinguished in relation to the trends clauses which we are considering because the whole emergency i.e. the coronavirus pandemic had to be taken out of the equation for the purposes of the counterfactual assessment, not just that part of the emergency which occurred after the date when the disease became notifiable. He argued that this was not to compensate the policyholder for loss prior to the disease becoming notifiable which was not permissible, but in relation to loss after notifiability, the effect of the pandemic on the policyholder’s turnover before it became notifiable should also be extracted. He submitted that if an insuring clause was contemplating insurance against a notifiable disease, it must encompass the emergence of a disease which, once the authorities get round to it, will be made notifiable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Ingenious though this argument is, we consider that it is fallacious. Upon analysis, if it were correct, once an insured peril occurred, here the prevention of access due to government actions or advice due to the pandemic, the policyholder would in fact recover for its losses both before and after the occurrence of that insured peril, despite Mr Edelman QC’s attempts to contend that this was not the effect of his argument. In any event, in the case of the Arch policy wording, whatever the merits of the argument it is precluded by the express words of the trends provision. Any downturn in turnover before the date(s) when businesses closed pursuant to government advice or the Regulations was a trend or circumstance which affected the business before the Damage i.e. as manipulated before “the Prevention of access to The Premises due to the actions or advice of government due to an emergency which is likely to endanger life” within the meaning of (i) of the trends provision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">As Mr Edelman QC submitted, there is a tension between the various provisions. The insuring provision in the Prevention of access Extension talks of “any action of government, police or a local authority” whereas both exclusion (iii) and the specified disease clause talk about the “order or advice of the competent local authority”. The FCA’s case is that the answer to the issue of construction is not to be found, as EIO suggests, in an analysis of public health legislation, with which the FCA did not disagree. The reasonable reader of the words “competent local authority” when contrasted with “government, police or local authority” would conclude that the exclusion did not exclude orders or advice of the government. Mr Edelman QC submitted that when exclusion (iii) and (iv) are viewed together (and they are run into one provision in the Type 1.2 wording) they are all dealing with matters which are parochial and local, like food poisoning, defective drains and vermin on the premises, matters for which a local borough council would be responsible. The reference to “the occurrence of an infectious disease” is likewise to be construed as a local outbreak in relation to which such a local authority would give any orders or advice. </p>

The provisions were to be construed against the relevant legal background, here the relevant public health legislation. It was not necessary for that legal background to be actually known by the insurer or by the average insured. It was sufficient if it was reasonably available to the parties.

Separate powers in relation to public health protection are provided by the 1984 Act as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2008. Under the 1984 Act as amended the administration of public health functions and responsibilities is largely in the hands of a “local authority” defined as district councils, county councils, London borough councils, the Common Council of the City of London, the Sub-Treasurer of the Inner Temple and the Under Treasurer of the Middle Temple. Public health protection is dealt with by Part 2A, added by the 2008 Act. Section 45C of the 1984 Act as amended enables the appropriate minister to make regulations in relation to preventing or protecting against the spread of infection or contamination in England and Wales, including the imposition of restrictions on persons and premises.

An example of the latter was the Leicester Regulations. It has never been the case that the only authority competent to act in relation to public health protection is the local authority.

Mr Kealey QC agreed that the list in the clause did not include SARS, no doubt because EIO did not want to insure against SARS, but there was nothing to confine the clause to local outbreaks of the diseases specified. A number of the diseases would have the capacity to spread more widely, like the plague and in that context, central government would be expected to intervene and would be the competent local authority to impose any restrictions. He submitted that here the closure of or restriction on the use of the premises was due to government order or advice as a result of the occurrence of COVID-19, an infectious disease, so the infectious disease carve-out applied and there was no cover under either of the EIO wordings.  </p>

Contrary to the FCA case, the Prime Minister’s advice on 16 March did not hinder access to or use of churches. It did not mention churches and EIO submitted that it was entirely reasonable to suppose that reasonable church goers would not have interpreted what he said as requiring them not to go or discouraging them from going to church. Furthermore, the mass gatherings which the advice told people should not take place were gatherings such as sporting events where emergency services would have been deployed, not church services. In relation to schools, whilst the FCA relied on the government announcement on 18 March that schools would close on 20 March, EIO relied upon a Department of Education press release on 18 March that schools would close on 23 March other than for children of key workers and vulnerable children. Accordingly, Mr Kealey QC submitted that the Court should go no further than making a declaration that access to or use of the relevant premises was hindered by action of government due to an emergency which could endanger human life from 23 March. </p>

The applicable principles are as summarised by the judge in <span style="font-style:italic">Crowden</span> and there is no place for the application of the principle of <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentem</span>, to the extent that principle has any application in the modern law of construction of contracts.  </p>

In the latter, given the legislative background which can legitimately be taken into account in construing the phrase, we consider it inherently unlikely that the parties intended the scope of cover provided by the clause to be limited to local outbreaks of a specified disease for which only the local district council or other local authority as defined in section 1 of the 1984 Act issues orders or advice. A number of the specified diseases are, as Mr Kealey QC pointed out, on the list of notifiable diseases under the 2010 Regulations, no doubt at least in part because of their capacity to lead to more widespread infection or contagion than in a particular locality. Many of those diseases, at least historically, have been widespread, not just the plague or diphtheria or tuberculosis but in more recent times, measles, mumps and rubella. </p>

If one assumes for the purpose of the argument that <span style="font-size:11pt">COVID</span>-19 was a specified disease in the list, if “competent local authority” had the narrow meaning of the local district council or other local authority as defined in section 1 of the 1984 Act for which the FCA contends, then there would not be cover in relation to the restrictions on the use of premises imposed by central government in bringing into force the Leicester Regulations. However, there would be cover if the same restrictions were imposed by Leicester City Council or if the Secretary of State asked the Council to impose the restrictions. The narrow meaning for which the FCA contends leads to an artificial and illogical result. In our judgment, Mr Kealey QC is right that the phrase “competent local authority” means whichever authority is competent to impose the relevant restrictions in the locality on the use of the premises, including central government.  </p>

This is accepted by the FCA in relation to the Type 1.2 wording in its Reply, but not accepted in relation to Type 1.1 wording.

The insured peril was not the emergency or the pandemic or any action of government other than the action which caused access prevention etc. to the premises. He submitted that a distinction had to be drawn between the insured peril and matters which qualify and define the insured peril. Thus, “any action of government” qualified what type of prevention or hindrance of access or use of the premises is covered and “emergency which could endanger human life” further defined and qualified what type of government action would trigger coverage.  </p>

In particular, the emergency endangering human life, the pandemic, is not to be reversed out. It is not an insured peril in its own right, but its only function is to qualify and define the type of government action which triggers the cover.  It is to be assumed that there continued to be an emergency endangering human life from COVID-19. Mr Kealey QC submitted that if the counterfactual reversed out not just the access prevention of the qualifying type but also the emergency itself, EIO would be made insurer of all business interruption losses caused by the pandemic, which would expand the cover being provided beyond recognition.  </p>

What the insurers were contemplating was an emergency sufficient to generate the government action since it is only if there is an emergency of sufficient seriousness to provoke the government into action that it will act, but their counterfactual took out that government action and assumed that the government did not react to the emergency contemplated by the cause. He described this variously as “cloud cuckoo land” or “salami slicing”. He submitted that the insurers’ approach was incorrect because the insured peril was the combination of events, the access or use being prevented or hindered by government action which in turn is due to the emergency. All the elements are required for cover to be triggered. </p>

Contrary to his argument the insured peril is not prevention or hindrance of access to or use of the premises with the government action and the emergency simply qualifying or defining that peril. On a proper analysis of these insuring clauses, as with others which the Court is considering, the insured peril is a composite one involving three interconnected elements: (i) prevention or hindrance of access to or use of the premises (ii) by any action of government (iii) due to an emergency which could endanger human life. For cover to be triggered that composite peril must have caused the interruption of or interference with the business.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In assessing the loss suffered by the policyholder where cover is triggered two related preliminary points similar to the points we made above in relation to the RSA 3 wording apply here. First, the “loss of income” and trends provisions in the wordings are not delineating cover, but are part of the machinery for calculating the business interruption loss on the basis that there is a qualifying prevention of access. It would seem contrary to principle, unless the policy wording so requires, for the loss to be limited by one or more of the elements of the insured peril still being included in the counterfactual assessment of what the position would have been in if the insured peril had not occurred.  </p>

This can be seen clearly once the literal meaning of “damage” is manipulated so that it means “damage or insured peril”. Again, once the true nature of the insured peril is identified, it is clear that the counterfactual requires not only the prevention or hindrance to be stripped out but the government action and the emergency, since the insured peril comprises all three elements. “But for” causation upon which the insurers, through Mr Kealey QC, placed so much emphasis, does not dictate a different answer. The correct answer to the question it poses “but for what?” is “but for the insured peril”, which is the composite one we have identified.  </p>

As noted above in respect of Arch, the insurers’ approach is an artificial one which ignores the inextricable connection between the various elements of the insured peril, both as a matter of legal analysis and as a matter of practical reality, given the nature of the pandemic emergency.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Thus, in the example of the church collection which we discussed with counsel during the course of argument, if, before the insured peril was triggered on 23 March (assuming for these purposes that the infectious disease carve-out does not relieve EIO from liability), the collection had gone down to 80% of what it was in the equivalent period last year, that loss of income before the insured peril was triggered is not recoverable under the Parish Plus policy, for the same reasons as we gave in relation to the Arch wording. If we assume that between 23 March and the date in July when churches were allowed to reopen, the collection had gone down to 10% of what it was in the equivalent period last year, the 70% loss of income would in principle be recoverable under the policy. It would be no answer for insurers to argue that the real cause of the loss of income was the economic effect of the pandemic rather than the closure of the church on the advice of the government, as the prevention or hindrance of access by the government action is inextricably bound up with the emergency and its social and economic effects. </p>

It should be given its ordinary, natural meaning which is an occurrence or an event. The incident can be local, regional or national and provided that its occurrence encompasses the applicable one mile radius there is cover. Mr Edelman QC gave the example of the Great Fire of London which could be described as an incident occurring on a wide scale and if access to the insured’s premises in the suburbs was hindered by authority response to the incident, there would be cover, provided that the fire encroached within one mile of the insured’s premises. The fact that the preponderance of the fire may have been outside the one mile zone would be irrelevant. Mr Edelman QC submitted that the fact that the clause required the denial of access or hindrance in access to last for more than 24 consecutive hours pointed to an incident which continued for some considerable time, not one of short temporal duration. The FCA’s pleaded case was that the pandemic was both an “emergency” for the purposes of certain other wordings and an “incident” for the purposes of the Hiscox wordings. </p>

He submitted that access to insured premises by customers or clients was hindered by the restrictions on movement contained in Regulation 6 of the 26 March Regulations. Hiscox’s argument that as long as there was no physical or legal impediment to access, there was no hindrance, was wrong.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of Hiscox, Mr Gaisman QC described the FCA’s case on the NDDA clause variously as “feeble” and “hopeless”, noting that the Hiscox Interveners were not running any case relying on the clause, notwithstanding that several of its policyholders had policies which contained the clause. Mr Gaisman QC agreed that an “incident” is to be equated with “an occurrence” and “an event” and submitted that Lord Mustill’s dictum in <span style="font-style:italic">Axa Reinsurance v Field </span>at 1035 that: “In ordinary speech, an event is something which happens at a particular time, at a particular place, in a particular way”<span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span>was equally applicable to “an incident”. His primary submission was that, applying that meaning, the FCA could not satisfy the requirement for “an incident”. In context, what the clause was focusing on was something occurring within a one mile radius of the premises or in the vicinity of the premises, some local incident such as a burst water main or a gas leak or a traffic accident or a crime, which caused the authorities to impose or order a denial of or hindrance in access. A nationwide pandemic such as COVID-19 was not “an incident” within the meaning of the clause. It was too geographically dispersed, too prolonged, too variegated and too non-specific to qualify as “an incident”. Likewise, he submitted that the presence of someone within the one mile radius or in the vicinity of the premises who had COVID-19 could not possibly be described as “an incident”. The person might come and go without knowing he had the disease and people might not know he was infected. Such an undetectable happening could not be “an incident”.  </p>

The pandemic is everywhere but nowhere in particular. The requirement in the clause that an incident must occur within a one mile radius is a stipulation of a specific geographical condition which must be satisfied. The word “within” connoted that the incident must be within the circle, not outside it. That requirement of proximity was inserted to ensure that only local incidents were covered.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Contrary to the FCA’s pleaded case “an incident” is not synonymous with “emergency” or “danger”. The incident could be said in any given case to cause an emergency or danger to arise, but it is not synonymous with it. Whilst, in other wordings than the Hiscox wordings we are considering, the COVID-19 pandemic can properly be described as <span style="font-style:italic">“an emergency which is likely to endanger life” </span>(as in the Arch and EIO wordings considered above), it is a misuse of language both generally and on the correct construction of the NDDA clause to describe the pandemic as <span style="font-style:italic">“an incident”</span> let alone <span style="font-style:italic">“an incident occurring… within a one mile radius of the insured premises”. </span> It may amount to a state of affairs but it is, as Mr Gaisman QC put it, too geographically dispersed, variegated, prolonged and non-specific to amount to an incident. We consider that Mr Gaisman QC’s analysis is correct. Saying that the pandemic is everywhere does not mean that it is present at particular insured premises and certainly does not mean that it amounts to <span style="font-style:italic">“an incident occurring… within a one mile radius of the insured premises”</span>. It is no answer for the FCA to say that there is an incident if someone with COVID-19 is present within the one mile radius. As Mr Gaisman QC said, that person might or might not know that he or she had COVID-19 and, in any event, it is a misnomer to describe the presence of someone in the radius with the disease as “an incident” for the purposes of the clause.  </p>

In a given case it might encompass a greater area than the one mile radius, in another case it might encompass a smaller area. However, other than possibly in the case of wordings which give “Vicinity” a specific defined and extended meaning (as in RSA 4), it cannot mean the entire UK simply because, even assuming that the pandemic could be described as “an incident”, it would be reasonably expected to have an impact on the insured or its business.  </p>

However, as we say above in respect of the Hiscox hybrid clauses, it seems to us clear from a number of the clauses which follow the stem wording, at least in the Hiscox 1 lead wording, that “interruption” is intended to mean “business interruption” generally, including disruption and interference. </p>

Since that contemplates a shortfall in expected income, it is clearly encompassing not just the case where the insured damage in the vicinity leads to the insured premises closing because of lack of customers but the case where the premises remain open but because of the insured damage in the vicinity, there are fewer customers. Hiscox sought to address the obvious difficulty which this provision places in the way of its argument that “interruption” means total cessation by submitting that the loss of attraction provision should have been included as one of the additional covers, Clauses 17 to 19, which are not contingent on interruption at all, such as “Cancellation and abandonment”. However, that would require rewriting the wording. The loss of attraction provision is clearly included as one of the covers contingent on “interruption” in the stem wording (as it is also in the lead Hiscox 4 wording). </p>

The question remains as to the meaning and scope of <span style="font-style:italic">“a denial of access or hindrance in access to the insured premises”</span> in the NDDA clause. As we have already noted, it is only where the denial or hindrance in question is imposed by the 21 or 26 March Regulations that this provision could respond, even if the FCA were correct about the meaning of “an incident”. Although Mr Gaisman QC’s primary case was that the Regulations did not impose any denial or hindrance of access rather than use, it seems to us that this is too absolutist a position. In relation to businesses required to close by either set of Regulations, that is businesses in Categories 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7, it seems to us that there was a denial of access. Furthermore, in the case of businesses where under the Regulations people were only allowed to access the premises for limited purposes, such as to run a takeaway service in a pub or restaurant and to collect the takeaway food or drink from that pub or restaurant, whilst there was not a denial of access in those circumstances, we consider that there was a hindrance in access, since no-one was allowed to access those parts of the premises which would normally be used for in-house dining or drinking. In the case of such businesses there would have been an “<span style="font-style:italic">interruption to </span>[the insured’s]<span style="font-style:italic"> activities</span>” on the basis that interruption also encompasses disruption for the reasons we have given.  </p>

In the case of people who could and did work from home (as in the case of many professional people) it seems to us a misuse of language to say that they were denied access to or hindered in their access to their offices. To the extent that they needed to access their offices to obtain files etc., they could freely have accessed the premises. At most there was a restriction on use of the offices because they could work from home, but since the Regulations were silent about businesses in Category 5, it cannot be said that any such restriction on use was imposed by or by order of the government. </p>

However, as Mr Gaisman QC pointed out the 2 metre rule is not contained in the Regulations and is only government advice or guidance, so that it cannot be said to have been imposed by government or any relevant authority within the meaning of the NDDA clause.   </p>

The cause of the imposition of the restrictions was the national pandemic which cannot be described as <span style="font-style:italic">“an incident”</span>. The position as regards causation might be different if the NDDA clause had referred to an emergency endangering human life, as in the case of the Arch and EIO wordings, but it did not and, even on the basis that Mr Edelman QC is correct about the counterfactual analysis in relation to those other wordings, that analysis cannot overcome the insurmountable difficulty the FCA faces that it cannot establish that the restrictions on access imposed were caused by “an incident”.  </p>

MSA also accepts that “action” encompasses government advice or guidance as well as the making of Regulations. MSA’s case is that coverage under the AOCA clause was not triggered for two reasons: (i) because none of the government action prevented physical access to any insured premises in circumstances where prevention of access requires nothing less than making physical access to the insured premises physically or legally impossible; and (ii) because no danger in the vicinity of any insured’s premises caused the government advice or Regulations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of the FCA, Mr Edelman QC submitted that equating prevention of access with physical or legal impossibility put the test far too high. It would almost never be physically or legally impossible to access any part of premises for any purpose at all. He submitted that the approach of MSA was wholly unreal. It admitted that only Category 2 businesses required to close by the Regulations suffered a prevention of access. It denied that Category 1 businesses, pubs, cafes bars and restaurants, suffered a prevention of access because they could theoretically have turned themselves into takeaways. As with other wordings, including the Arch wording which we have already considered, he submitted that prevention of access included partial prevention and prevention of access for specific purposes required by the insured business, for example for customers to make purchases. Prevention of access did not require any physical or legal constraint. It was in this context that he gave the example of the hardware store to which customers could not go save in exceptional circumstances, after the restrictions on movement were imposed by the Regulations. He submitted that this was as much a prevention of access as if police tape had been placed across the entrance door. Accordingly, the FCA’s primary case was that from the 16 March advice to work at home and only travel for essential purposes, there was a prevention of access in respect of all insured premises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">As to what constituted: <span style="font-style:italic">“a danger…in the vicinity of the premises”</span> the FCA case is that there was an emergency or danger from at least 3 March when the government published its action plan and quarantining was in place, alternatively 12 March when the government elevated the risk level to high following COVID-19 being designated a notifiable disease and the first reported UK death. MSA admits that presence and/or real risk of the presence of COVID-19 amounted to an emergency which could endanger human life from 12 March onwards. Mr Edelman QC submitted that from 3 March, alternatively 12 March, the risk of contracting the disease was a danger everywhere in the UK and thus in the vicinity of any UK premises, a conclusion supported by MSA’s admission that from 12 March there was an emergency likely to endanger human life. </p>

We do not consider that this is something which matters very much, given that the FCA accepts that “following” does mean something more than a temporal or sequential connection and connotes some causal connection, however loose, between in this instance the government action and the interruption of or interference with the business. In other words, if the FCA is right as to the construction of the clause, nothing will turn on the precise causative effect of “following”. </p>

He submitted that a prevention of access cover could not be transformed into a prevention of use cover. In any event, given that MSA 1 was predominantly, although not exclusively, used for businesses in Categories 3 and 5, which were never required to close pursuant to the Regulations or otherwise, there was no prevention of access in relation to the premises of those businesses.        </p>

As to whether there was in any given case a qualifying danger would depend upon the facts of the particular case. The action of the government, here the imposition of the regulations, was not in any sense caused by the danger of COVID-19 in the vicinity of any insured premises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">As we said above in our discussion of coverage under the Arch wording, the touchstone of prevention is impossibility, whereas hindrance connotes that access is rendered particularly difficult. To that extent, we agree with Mr Kealey QC that the FCA case conflates prevention with hindrance. However, we consider that Mr Kealey QC’s submission that access has to be physically and legally impossible goes too far and is unduly narrow. The “premises” is defined in the policy as <span style="font-style:italic">“the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">buildings</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and the land…at the property address shown in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">your</span><span style="font-style:italic"> schedule occupied by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for the purpose of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">business</span><span style="font-style:italic">”</span>. This demonstrates that what the AOCA clause is focusing on is prevention of access to the premises for the purpose of carrying on the business. It seems to us that the approach advocated by Mr Lockey QC on behalf of Arch that “prevention of access to the premises” connotes closure of the premises is a realistic one, equally applicable here. Accordingly, if the other elements of the cover under the clause are satisfied, closure of the premises is sufficient to amount to access being prevented, even if the policyholder could still physically access the premises for other purposes than carrying on the business, such as essential maintenance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">We also consider that, as in the case of the Arch wording, only total closure rather than partial closure will amount to prevention of access, from which it follows that any insured business which carried on part of its existing business, such as an existing takeaway service, as permitted by the Regulations, did not suffer total closure or, therefore, a prevention of access. In relation to businesses which, after the Regulations came into force, started up a takeaway or internet service from the premises which had not previously been carried out (and it is unclear whether there are any MSA 1 policyholders who fulfil that criterion) we would be inclined to reach the same conclusion as we reached in relation to the Arch wording, that in such a case there was still a prevention of access because the “business” which is defined in MSA 1 as the business specified in the schedule can no longer be carried on from the premises and the insured is carrying on a new “business”. </p>

It is no answer for the FCA to rely upon the restrictions on movement imposed by Regulation 6 of the 26 March Regulations to argue that customers’ ability to visit many premises was severely limited. At most, in the case of businesses which remained open or were not required to close, that was a hindrance in use, not a prevention of access.</p>

It is immediately to be noted that unlike other wordings, such as the Arch wording, the clause does not refer to “action” and “advice”. In our judgment, Mr Kealey QC is right in his argument that in the context of this clause “<span style="font-style:italic">action of </span>[government]<span style="font-style:italic"> where access will be prevented</span>” connotes steps taken by the relevant authority which have the force of law, since it is only something which has the force of law which will prevent access. There was discussion during the course of argument about police cordons and whether they had the force of law, but what emerged is that under various statutory regimes, individuals other than those permitted to go through a cordon, such as emergency workers, would be breaking the law if they went through a cordon.</p>

It was only with the passing of the 21 March Regulations requiring businesses in Categories 1 and 2 to close and the more wide-ranging 26 March Regulations, that there was “action” by the government within the meaning of this clause. That is another reason why the FCA case that the advice of the Prime Minister on 16 March caused a prevention of access is wrong.</p>

The paradigm example of what it covers, as he submitted, is the bomb scare or gas leak in the vicinity or neighbourhood of the premises which causes the authorities (whether the police or the army in those examples), exercising statutory powers, to evacuate insured premises and require policyholders and their employees and customers not to access the premises. We do consider that the undefined term “vicinity” does have a local connotation of the neighbourhood of the premises. What that constitutes may depend on the nature of the danger or disturbance and the particular facts of the case, but, contrary to Mr Edelman QC’s submissions, we do not consider that the entire country can be described as in the vicinity of the insured premises, from which it follows that, on the true construction of the AOCA clause, the government action in imposing the Regulations in response to the national pandemic cannot be said to be following a danger in the vicinity, in the sense of in the neighbourhood, of the insured premises.    </p>

It is highly unlikely that that could be demonstrated in any particular case. The narrow, localised nature of this cover means that the wider issues of causation and counterfactuals, such as we have discussed in relation to the Arch and EIO wordings above and such as we discussed earlier in the judgment in relation to the so-called “disease clauses” and “hybrid clauses” do not arise.</p>

Mr Kealey QC added one point in relation to MSA 2, that the Prevention of access-non damage clause here referred internally to “interruption to your business caused by an incident” etc. and, unlike other insuring clauses such as Clause 4 loss of attraction and Clause 6 the notifiable disease clause (which we considered earlier in this judgment) was not prefaced by the words “consequential loss as a result of” or “following”. “Consequential loss” was defined in this wording as “Loss from interruption of or interference with the business”.

The only difference between the two wordings of any significance is the one to which Mr Kealey QC referred. Because the reference to “interruption” is not in stem wording covering a number of insuring clauses which point to “interruption” including “disruption”, and Clause 8 does not refer to “consequential loss” as defined, it seems to us that Mr Kealey QC is right that “interruption” in this clause must bear its strict meaning of cessation. We also consider that the FCA case on causation fails for the same reasons as we gave in relation to the Hiscox NDDA clause. </p>

Mr Edelman QC submitted that the real risk of the presence of COVID-19 was a threat or risk of injury throughout the UK, which therefore included the vicinity of the insured premises. The wording was wider than the AOCA clause in MSA 1 because it encompassed prevention or hindrance in the use of and access to the insured premises. It was common ground that use of or access to premises is hindered where it is made more difficult or is inhibited and whether the difficulty or inhibition applies to the insured and/or its employees and/or its customers.

It might amount to hindrance, but that would depend on the particular facts of any given case. The announcement on 18 March that schools would close from 23 March meant that, as was also accepted by EIO, there was a hindrance of use of schools from 23 March. MSA accepts that the Prime Minister’s advice on 20 March that businesses in Categories 1 and 2 should close constituted a hindrance of use but did not constitute prevention of access or use.

In those circumstances, Mr Kealey QC correctly accepted that “action of a competent public authority” had a wider meaning in this wording and encompassed not only the Regulations but the advice of the government. However, the essential problem which the FCA faces in relation to this specialist forge cover is that forges are in Category 5, businesses about which the advice and the Regulations are silent and which were never required to close. In relation to such businesses it is impossible to say that the advice or the Regulations prevented access or use. At most it could be said that they hindered use of insured premises, for example by restricting movement so that members of the public could not visit retail premises except for essential purchases. However, we are doubtful as to how many members of the public ever visit forges and we were informed by Mr Kealey QC that there have been no claims by insureds under this specialist cover. Were there to be any claim, there would be a question of fact as to whether the insured could establish that the government advice or Regulations had caused a hindrance of use of the insured premises. </p>

However, it relies upon exclusion (b) in “What is not covered”: <span style="font-style:italic">“Any loss…during any period other than the actual period when access to the Premises was prevented”</span> which it says delineates the scope of cover so that the sole relevant question is whether the assumed losses were incurred during a period when access to the premises was <span style="text-decoration:underline">prevented</span>. Mr Edelman QC submitted that this was in effect giving with one hand and taking away with the other. If it had been intended to limit the cover provided to prevention of access, the insuring clause would have said so.

As the RSA 2.1 wording demonstrated in the equivalent “What is not covered”, the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“any amount in excess of £10,000” </span>was intended to be a separate financial inner limit to the amount of the indemnity available under this provision, such as was found in a number of the other “What is not covered” provisions within these Extensions. A reasonable person would have understood that the inner limit within the Public Emergency Extension was intended to be free-standing.

We agree with Mr Edelman QC that RSA’s case on exclusion b) involves the absurd proposition that cover for “hindrance” and for “prevention or hindrance of use” is given with one hand and taken away with the other. If it had been intended, as Mr Turner QC submitted, to delimit cover to prevention of access, this provision could and would have said so in “What is covered”, not engaged in the tortuous process which RSA’s case involves. Although exclusion b) is not as well-worded as it could be, its intention is clear. It is excluding cover for the after-effects of the relevant prevention or hindrance, not limiting the cover it has just bestowed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as exclusion e) is concerned, we agree with Mr Edelman QC that there is no obvious error in the positioning of the words <span style="font-style:italic">“any amount in excess of £10,000”</span> within the exclusion and that insurers might very well have good commercial reasons for inserting an inner limit in respect of disease cover. Whilst the provision as it stands could be better worded, we do not agree with Mr Turner QC’s submission that it does not read grammatically. In any event, that is no reason for the change proposed, which rewrites the clause and, conveniently for RSA, creates a complete exclusion where previously there was only a financial limit. In our judgment, were it not for the order of the wording in “What is not covered” in the RSA 2.1 wording, this point would be totally unarguable. The fact that different wording is expressed in different terms is not a reason for construing this provision to mean something different from what it clearly means on its face, that in respect of diseases there is an inner limit of £10,000. Even if RSA were able to establish that in positioning the words in the exclusion, they had made a mistake, the mistake was entirely theirs, to which insured policyholders cannot be said to have contributed, so there is no scope for the application of the doctrine of rectification.   </p>

We have already concluded in relation to other wordings that prevention of access does not require physical or legal impossibility. Prevention would be demonstrated by the requirement to close and, even if that were not prevention of access, it would clearly be prevention of use. Because these wordings also cover hindrance of access and use, the much-discussed example of the pub or restaurant which maintained an existing take-away service would still be suffering a hindrance of access or, at the very least of use, since it could not use the restaurant space for in-house eating or drinking and its customers could not access that </p>

It does not seem to us that the fact that, unlike the MSA 1 AOCA clause, this clause also encompasses hindrance and use, in any sense requires an expansion of the geographical limitation on its scope. As we have already said, however elastic the concept of “vicinity” it connotes neighbourhood, the area surrounding the premises.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">It is important in considering this Prevention of Access-Non Damage provision to identify first what is the insured peril. In our judgment, this involves three interlinked elements: (i) “interruption or interference to the Insured’s Business as a result of (ii) the actions or advice of…governmental authority…in the Vicinity of the Insured Locations (iii) which prevents or hinders the use of or access to Insured Locations during the Period of Insurance.” In other words, as in the case of many of the other wordings we are considering, this is a composite peril. However, what is strikingly different about this wording is that it does not require that the actions or advice of the government are “following” or “due to” an “emergency” or “danger” in the vicinity of or within a particular radius of the insured premises. All that it requires in entirely general terms is that the actions or advice of the government are “in the Vicinity of the Insured Locations.”<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>Even without the extended definition of “Vicinity” in the RSA wording, we consider that the actions or advice of the government, taken nationally and affecting all insured businesses will inevitably be in the vicinity of the insured premises if they lead to prevention or hindrance of use or access of the insured premises. It is no answer for RSA to say that the actions or advice also affected a substantial number of other insured premises elsewhere. Nowhere in this wording is there any limitation of qualifying actions or advice of government to such actions or advice <span style="text-decoration:underline">specific</span> to the insured premises or their vicinity. </p>

First, the definition of Standard Turnover with its trends provision is not part of the delineation of cover, but part of the quantification machinery for calculating the business interruption loss on the basis that there is a qualifying prevention of access. Where the policyholder has therefore <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> established a loss caused by an insured peril, it would seem contrary to principle, unless the policy wording so requires, for that loss to be limited by the inclusion of any part of the insured peril in the assessment of what the position would have been if the insured peril had not occurred. Second, subject to the particular wording providing for something different, the object of the quantification machinery (including any trends clause or provision) in the policy wording is to put the insured in the same position as it would have been in if the insured peril had not occurred. </p>

The approach which RSA advocates involves a totally unrealistic and artificial counterfactual which assumes that the part of the government actions or advice which relates to the insured premises and their vicinity is stripped out but the nationwide actions and advice remain somehow the same. The fallacy in this approach is that the actions and advice in so far as they affect the insured premises and their vicinity are inseparable from the nationwide actions and advice. They are one and the same. The only way of establishing what the insured’s business would have achieved if the Covered Event (here the Prevention of Access-Non Damage peril insured) is to strip out all the prevention and hindrance and all the actions and advice, in other words to assume that there had been no COVID-19.  </p>

The Zurich wording used the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">“immediate vicinity”</span> elsewhere, as in Condition 1 applicable to Section G in Zurich 1, which relates to the Use of Heat and refers to clearing the area <span style="font-style:italic">“in the immediate vicinity of the work”</span> of loose material (the same provision appearing in Condition 2 applicable to Section K in Zurich 2). She submitted that the definition of “Vicinity” in the RSA 4 wording is a sensible, workable definition. Since the danger of the disease was everywhere in the UK, the whole country was in the vicinity of the insured premises, because the danger everywhere else could reasonably be expected to impact on the insured premises. The suggestion by Zurich that there has to be a specific local danger under this clause was equally misconceived. The fact that a danger was within the vicinity did not prevent it also being elsewhere outside the vicinity.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The principal submissions on behalf of Zurich by Mr Orr QC echoed submissions addressed by Mr Kealey QC in relation to the MSA 1 AOCA clause. First he submitted that the Zurich wordings drew a clear distinction between prevention and hindrance and access and use as demonstrated by the Extension POA 4 Prevention of Access in Zurich 1 which began: <span style="font-style:italic">“Property in the vicinity of the Premises,</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">loss or destruction of or damage to which shall prevent or hinder the use of the Premises or access thereto…”</span> Prevention of access in this clause should therefore be given a narrow meaning, that access to the premises was physically obstructed or rendered impossible. This construction of “prevention of access” was consistent with US decisions on business interruption insurance where access is “prohibited” or “denied”. For example, in the decision of the US District Court (New York) in <span style="font-style:italic">Abner, Herrman &amp; Brock, Inc. v Great Northern Insurance Co., </span>308 F. Supp. 2d 331 (2004), the policy provided cover where there was a prohibition of access by a civil authority. There was cover for the period from 11 to 14 September 2001 when access to the insured premises was prohibited by the New York civil authorities in response to the 9/11 attacks, but no cover thereafter when vehicular access was restricted but pedestrian access was permitted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Orr QC’s third point was that these extensions to the Business Interruption cover provide pockets of cover, each limited by its own specific requirements, so that there is no blanket coverage for example in respect of danger or notifiable diseases. That was particularly apparent from the notifiable diseases extension. The same circumscription of cover was apparent in the AOCA extension: (i) that the geographical location of the danger or disturbance must be <span style="font-style:italic">“in the vicinity”</span>; (ii) that the danger or disturbance in the vicinity must cause the action by the relevant authority, i.e. the one must follow the other and (iii) the type of public authority action which triggered cover must prevent access to the premises. He submitted that these limitations were fundamental but were ignored by the FCA in their arguments. He noted that the causal link between the vicinity and the government action was an important distinction between this wording and the Arch “Government or Local Authority Action” clause.  </p>

As <span style="font-style:italic">Riley on Business Interruption Insurance</span> 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition at §10.34 explains, these types of AOCA extensions arose out of terrorist activity in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s which involved devices that did not explode, not just those that did, so that traditional business interruption cover contingent on property damage did not respond.  </p>

It was not focusing on the connection between the civil authority action and any danger or disturbance outside the vicinity. The meaning of “in the vicinity” was best encapsulated in the term “in the immediate locality”. The FCA’s argument that this could not be so because of the use of the words “in the immediate vicinity” in the condition about hot work was a false point. That condition is to do with welding and other hot work and “in the immediate vicinity” means effectively the small area where the hot work is being carried out.

As we said in relation to the MSA 1 AOCA clause, it seems to us that the interpretation of what is meant by “prevention of access” advocated by Mr Lockey QC on behalf of Arch is a realistic one. It connotes closure of the premises for the purposes of carrying on the business, so that there is prevention of access even if the insured can still access the premises physically for other purposes, such as carrying out routine maintenance. In this regard, we did not find the US authorities on different policies using different words such as “prohibition” or “denial” of any assistance.   </p>

Whilst we see the force of the submissions made by Ms Mulcahy QC as to the dictionary meaning of “action”, the word has to be read in context. In this clause, it is <span style="font-style:italic">“action…whereby access </span>[to the premises]<span style="font-style:italic"> shall be prevented”. </span>As in the case of the MSA 1 AOCA clause, it seems to us that this connotes steps taken by the relevant authority which have the force of law, since it is only something which has the force of law which can prevent access. Furthermore, if it had been intended to encompass advice in this clause, the parties could and would have said so expressly, as they did in the disease clause. It follows that the only “action” of the government which would qualify under this clause is the imposition of the 21 and 26 March Regulations and any subsequent Regulations or legislation with the force of law.  </p>

We do not consider that Mr Orr QC is right that it is akin to proximate causation.

As we have said elsewhere, the undefined term “<span style="font-style:italic">vicinity”</span> in itself connotes an immediacy of location.

It is highly unlikely that that could be demonstrated in any particular case.

The classic example is where two persons independently search for the source of a gas leak with the aid of lighted candles. According to the simple “but for” test, neither would be liable for damage caused by the resultant explosion. In this type of case, involving multiple wrongdoers, the court may treat wrongful conduct as having sufficient causal connection with the loss for the purpose of attracting responsibility even though the simple “but for” test is not satisfied. In so deciding the court is primarily making a value judgment on responsibility.

As a general rule the “but for” test is a necessary condition for establishing causation in fact. However, there may be cases in which fairness and reasonableness require that it should not be a necessary condition. This is most likely to be in the context of negligence or conversion claims, but I would accept that in principle it is not limited to tort or to particular torts. I would also accept that a case in which there are two concurrent independent causes of a loss, with the consequence that the application of the “but for” test would mean that there is no cause of the loss, is potentially an example of a case in which fairness and reasonableness would require that the “but for” test should not be a necessary condition of causation, particularly where two wrongdoers are involved. However, whether or not that is so will depend on all the circumstances of the particular case and ultimately the issue is whether the Tribunal erred in law in applying a “but for” causation approach under this Policy on the facts as found by them.

Second was that whether fairness and reasonableness required that the “but for” test should not be applied was very much a matter of fact for the arbitration tribunal not for the court on an appeal limited to questions of law. At [37] he noted that the issue had not been addressed by the tribunal which had made no findings in relation to it. Third, he said at [38] that he was not satisfied that fairness and reasonableness did require that the “but for” test was not applied. He gave various examples of alternative scenarios such as an undamaged hotel in an undamaged city but concluded that since that would measure gross operating profit which OEH would have made if the hurricanes had not struck at all, that would compensate OEH for all business interruption losses even if not caused by the damage and thus not recoverable under the main insuring clause.  </p>

As to the wording of the clause, OEH submits that, even on a literal approach to the words, “had the Damage not occurred” or “but for the Damage”, on the Trends clause’s hypothesis, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (which caused that damage) could not have occurred either. One cannot ignore the Damage and yet pretend, for the purposes of the Trends clause, that the event which caused the damage still happened. However, this does not follow.

Secondly, OEH submits that the Trends clause is dealing with the effect of real “trends, variations or special circumstances” which either did affect the business or which would have affected the business, had the damage not occurred. It is dealing with the implications of actual events, not imaginary or hypothetical ones. The only permitted counterfactual is to assume that there was no insured damage and to ask what consequences these actual trends, variations or circumstances would have had. A hypothetical Rita or Katrina (i.e. one which is assumed not to have caused damage to the hotel but which otherwise operated to its full extent), is not a “special circumstance” which would have affected the business had there been no damage but an entirely fictional event. However, the clause requires a single assumption to be made (that there was no damage), and for the actual facts to be considered on the basis of that assumption. That is what the tribunal have done.” </p>

So, if the tsunami or hurricane or fire only affects the insured property, this will give rise to a full, unadjusted recovery for all business interruption loss caused by the damage to the insured property; yet, should the tsunami, hurricane or fire cause additional devastation to a whole swathe of properties in the same area, the claimant is somehow to be worse off because it is to be treated as if its insured property had (hypothetically) escaped damage but as if its business would still have suffered a loss of income due to the damage (or resulting loss of attraction) in the wider area. However, under this policy the amount recoverable under the main insuring clause will always depend on the extent to which the business interruption losses claimed are caused by damage. That is what the main insuring clause requires as a matter of causation. It has nothing to do with whatever other devastation the hurricanes may have caused elsewhere than at the insured property.” </p>

What we see as the fallacy in the judge’s reasoning can be found in the last sentence of [52] of the judgment quoted above: “However, the relevant insured peril is the damage; not the cause of that damage.” The same fallacy appears in [46]-[47] and [57] which we have quoted. The hurricanes as the cause of the Damage were an integral part of the insured peril, not separate from it. It seems to us that the error in the reasoning may have come about because the judge focused only on the “but for” causation issue and, to our minds surprisingly, did not pose the question of what was the proximate cause of the loss claimed, which must be the primary question in relation to claims under contracts of insurance, as section 55(1) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 makes clear.

As OEH said, if the hurricanes had only damaged the hotel, there would have been full recovery for the business interruption loss suffered as a consequence of the damage, but because the overall devastation caused by the hurricanes was to the whole city and surrounding area, OEH was on the insurers’ analysis worse off because it was to be treated as if, hypothetically, the hotel had escaped damage, but its business would still have suffered the same loss because of the devastation wrought by the hurricanes everywhere else. Given that the hurricanes will inevitably have caused widespread damage to the area and not be confined to the insured’s property, the effect of the insurers’ analysis was that the business interruption cover was rendered illusory.

We have already referred to Clarke. Professor Merkin in <span style="font-style:italic">Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance</span> (12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed) at §24-107 describes it as a “curious outcome that, the greater the damage to the vicinity and thus of the risk of depopulation, the less prospect there is of any recovery by the assured”. <span style="font-style:italic">Riley on Business Interruption Insurance</span> (10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed) at §15-21 states that “there must be doubt over whether it is actually a satisfactory outcome for either insurers or policyholders”. The editor makes the point that when Main Street in Cockermouth, Cumbria, flooded in 2009, insurers did not seek to argue that none of the businesses could recover much because, but for the flooding of their business the rest of the street would have been closed and effectively a building site for approaching six months, anyway.  However, on the analysis accepted by the judge in <span style="font-style:italic">Orient Express</span>, any given insured business in Cockermouth would not have recovered for the business interruption loss it suffered because insurers could have argued that it would have suffered the same loss because even if its business was not flooded, the rest of the street was closed. In our view, the consequence which flows from the <span style="font-style:italic">Orient Express</span> decision, that the worse the fortuity which befalls the insured and the vicinity of the insured’s premises, the less the insurance responds, cannot have been intended.   </p>

The NHS Deaths Data have been published on a daily basis and include data from 1 March 2020 onwards, showing both daily and cumulative totals, aggregated at the level of NHS Hospital Trusts. The FCA accepted that the NHS Deaths Data do not show the numbers of deaths caused by COVID-19 because, for example, an individual might test positive for COVID-19, but then recover and die in hospital from a different cause. The FCA submitted that this possibility does not affect the utility of the NHS Deaths Data in showing the presence of COVID-19 in a particular area. The FCA submitted that if a person contracted COVID-19 and then subsequently died from another cause, that makes no difference to the fact that COVID19 was present in the relevant NHS Hospital Trust at a time prior to the death. In other words, identifying the cause of individual deaths is not necessary for the purposes of proving prevalence. </p>

Adopting the phraseology of Evans J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Wurttembergische v Home Ins Co</span> [1993] 2 Re LR 253, at p. 261, it can be suggested that the concern here lies with the “evidential and therefore a shifting burden of proof”.

Of course, should the evidence relied upon by Equitas be incapable of satisfying the burden resting upon it (if say, actuarial modelling is incapable of sufficing for the purpose at hand) or if such evidence in fact falls short of doing so (if, for example, the models do not sufficiently approximate reality), then the Equitas claim/s must fail.

The dispute as to this affects all the categories of publicly available data. In the case of the NHS Deaths Data, it is possible that a person will have tested positive for COVID-19, then recovered, and subsequently died in hospital from a different cause. The FCA is correct to say that it is not relevant whether a particular individual died from COVID-19 or something else. The issue, when considering the question of prevalence, is whether it can reliably be inferred from a death or deaths on a particular date that the disease was present in that NHS Hospital Trust area at a particular prior date. It is not possible for the Court, without evidence either way, to determine what a death on a particular date says about <span style="font-style:italic">when</span> the disease was present in the relevant NHS Hospital Trust area. Inferences can clearly be drawn, and it appears to us likely that the relevant inference may be more obvious in some circumstances than others. For example, if an individual died in early March 2020 after testing positive for COVID-19, it appears to us <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> likely that the disease will still have been present in the local area at the time of death, because the individual could not have tested positive very much earlier.  </p>

The ONS Deaths Data are published weekly. The parties were agreed that deaths in a particular week show the presence of the disease in the particular local authority or health board area in the period “immediately prior” to that week. The insurers have accepted the infectious period for the disease is 7-12 days for moderate cases and up to 14 days on average for serious cases. It is therefore appropriate to infer from the number of deaths in a particular week as reflected in ONS Deaths Data that all of the deaths in a particular week represent active cases on the first day of that week, if not earlier. The infectious period for a severe case is agreed to be longer, so it may be that the deaths in a particular week can safely be treated as active cases many days before the beginning of that week, but it is difficult to say without hearing evidence on the question. </p>

Given the agreed 7-12 day infectious period in moderate cases, an insured should be able to take into account the cases on a particular day, together with cases on 2-3 days either side of that day, as being active on that particular day.

The simplest cases are where a reporting area, such as an LTLA, is entirely within a relevant policy area, and in respect of those scenarios the parties have reached the agreements noted above. But wherever there are more complex intersections between the reporting area and the relevant policy area, something more may be needed to show the presence of the disease within the relevant policy area. On this point, as we have said, the FCA relied on its “averaging methodologies”. The insurers conceded that this type of evidence, that is, evidence about the distributions of cases, could be used in principle to discharge the burden of proof.  They were right to do so.  We accept, however, that, as the insurers have said, the Court cannot go further than this at this stage. The particular method of averaging cannot be something on which the Court expresses an opinion without hearing what evidence might be put against (for example) the proposition implied by a weighted average that the disease is likely to be distributed through a region by reference to population density.  </p>

This might be because the best available evidence does not really address the particular burden on an insured, or otherwise fails to satisfy the balance of probabilities. The disagreement between the parties on this question was limited to the use of the methodologies of averaging and undercounting. It was not suggested by the insurers that the particular types of underlying data pleaded by the FCA (specific evidence, NHS Deaths Data, ONS Deaths Data and reported cases) would not discharge the burden of proof if they were the best available evidence in a particular case.  </p>
