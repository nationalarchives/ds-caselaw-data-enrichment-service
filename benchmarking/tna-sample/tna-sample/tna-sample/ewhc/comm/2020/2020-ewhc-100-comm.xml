Mr Yurov participated in it in the same way as he participated in the Bank’s activities generally: as Chairman of the Supervisory Board he had a general strategic knowledge about the direction the Bank was taking, and approved it.

Mr Yurov does not accept that it was improper, and invites the Court to conclude that it was not. The essential reasons for that stance are (a) that he does not accept that it was impossible that balance sheet management would succeed in its objective of buying the Bank time to turn its business around and unwind the various schemes and (b) that he does not accept that the various schemes required breaches of the law (in so far as any are pleaded), and could not be lawfully carried out. In his understanding, there are lawful and unlawful ways to achieve a favourable presentation of a company’s financial position, particularly vis-a-vis the CBR, and he reasonably assumed that those adopted by the Bank’s management fell the right side of what may have been a rather unclear line. </p>

Mr Yurov openly offered to transfer the off balance sheet companies to Otkritie, or as it might direct, and was ready to do so. In those circumstances, the Bank knew about the alleged wrongful acts, not just as a matter of suspicion but as a matter of positive knowledge, by early 2015.

They probably inflated the apparent assets of the Bank, as interest accumulated, but they did not involve the expenditure of any real cash or any new liability or loss. The biggest loss suffered was in bond trading by Erinskay and Baymore, but that was not a loss caused by the scheme but by the market and would not have been significantly higher if the Bank had held the bonds itself. Otherwise, apart perhaps from the very small amount that went to Merrill Lynch and for the Kolyada litigation, and apart from the significant but not high costs of maintaining and operating the network (which together amount to around 2 or 3 percent of the money lent), the money all returned to the Bank and the Bank is not thereby worse off than it would have been if the various Loans and Transactions had not been made. </p>

Towards the end of 2006, a decision was taken by YBF to buy out Mr Kolyada’s shareholding, which they claim was designed to disassociate him from the Bank. The acquisition of Mr Kolyada’s shares was funded by a loan from Credit Suisse acting together with a number of other international lenders. In March 2007 US$40 million was paid to MC Trust. YBF personally guaranteed the loan and pledged some of their shares in TIBH and other Bank entities to Credit Suisse. Immediately following the payment, YBF borrowed US$40 million from MC Trust.

This led to the parties producing a “List of Agreed Facts and Issues to be Determined at Trial” (the “Agreed Facts and Issues”), which was agreed by the parties during the course of the trial. Due to the distinctions between the case of Mr Belyaev and that of Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov, a number of qualifications as to the Agreed Facts and Issues were made by Mr Belyaev, as recorded on the face of the document.  </p>

As stated by Lord Millett in that case, fraud or dishonesty must be distinctly alleged and distinctly proved; it must be sufficiently particularised; and it is not sufficiently particularised if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence. This means that a claimant who alleges dishonesty must plead the facts, matters and circumstances relied on to show that the defendant was dishonest and not merely negligent, and facts, matters and circumstances which are consistent with negligence do not do so (per Lord Millett at [184]-[186]) – see also Lord Millett at [189], Lord Hope of Craighead at [55]-[56] and Lord Hobhouse at [160].

When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence… Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. </p>

The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.” </p>

In applying the civil burden of proof on the balance of probabilities, inherent probabilities can be weighed alongside or against specific evidence from a particular case. But care must be taken in working out what in a particular case is inherently probable or improbable. It is generally correct that, absent other information, the more serious the wrongdoing, the less likely it is that it was carried out, because most people are not serious wrongdoers. The standard of proof remains the same, but more cogent evidence is required to prove fraud than to prove negligence or innocence because the evidence has to outweigh the countervailing inherent improbability.

He is not a reliable witness but I have to decide whether the Bank has established that he did not know. The bank must do so on the balance of probabilities but the allegation is extremely serious and exposes Mr Zharimbetov to a personal liability of over US$1 billion. The evidence must therefore be of a cogency commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation. The Bank's case is based upon inference from circumstantial evidence. In this regard it is helpful to recall what Rix LJ said about circumstantial evidence in his judgment on the occasion of Mr Ablyazov's appeal against the finding of contempt at [2012] EWCA Civ 1411 at para 52: </p>

That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact - every piece of evidence - relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.’” </p>

Whilst such matters do impact upon his credibility, and whilst I also bear in mind that he was a relatively junior employee, he was in a factual position to comment on how the IFRS accounts were, as a matter of fact, put together, and what was, and was not, included in the category of “related-party” transactions. He was not challenged in that regard, and I accept his evidence in relation to that. In large part, in any event, the documents speak for themselves (for example, in terms of the size of loans to WR and RCP which were, and remained, around US$110 million (at least RUB 3 billion), and so they cannot have been included in the related-party lending figures in the accounts).  I also bear in mind that he was a factual witness and that there was no permission to call an expert on IFRS accounting. Nevertheless, from his knowledge and involvement in the preparation of such accounts, he was in a position to give factual evidence in relation to the Bank’s IFRS accounts and the associated IFRS requirements.  </p>

This caused the Bank (now merged into one) considerable difficulties (as it did for all other banks in Russia and elsewhere). In particular (i) there were large numbers of defaults from 2008 onwards on corporate and personal loans that had previously been made; and (ii) the Bank suffered heavy losses from the fall in the value of Russian securities in 2008, and again in 2014. The Bank also suffered as result of the fall in the Russian Rouble, in particular in 2014. In addition, in 2009 the Russian courts found the Bank liable to Rosneft for US$75 million (the claim arose out of a previous transaction entered into by the Bank on behalf of Yukos), which further reduced the Bank's capital. I estimate that between 2008 and 2012, the Bank lost around US$70 million in total, which was around a quarter of the share capital.  </p>

The impact of the diminution in capital was magnified, because the Bank was restricted in its ability to lend funds by reference to a multiple of its capitalisation. Accordingly, the Bank's ability to lend was greatly reduced by any fall in capital. This was compounded by the fact that the Bank was unable to raise additional capital by issuing further shares, because its shares were frozen. </p>

The truth is equally obvious – but Mr Yurov was not prepared to admit it – namely that these were high-end luxury holidays for the Shareholders and their wives paid for by the Bank.  </p>

It also refers to the large personal loans that the Shareholders had taken from MC Trust, when it had borrowed US$140 million from Crédit Suisse and Merrill Lynch for the purpose of buying out Mr Kolyada and making shareholders’ loans to the Bank.

He also made express reference to TIBI in his witness statement in the Kolyada proceedings in 2014 when he stated, <span style="font-style:italic">“Nor have I received any dividend or income from my shares in TIB Investments Limited, or my shares in NBT”</span>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are two further reasons why it is inherently improbable that Mr Yurov did not know about TIBI. The first is that there are numerous references to it in contemporary documentation to which he was a party. For example, when Mr Drozdov sent structure charts showing the Bank’s holding structure to the Shareholders he told them in an email dated 18 December 2008 that, <span style="font-style:italic">“I’m sending the structure of the TRUST Group and NBT stockholders for your information. I didn’t say that TIB investments owns 60% of the shares of the 3Sistercos, since you are the ultimate owners of TIB investments in a ratio of 1:1:1.5”. </span>Then in late 2009/early 2010 when Mr Worsley became involved he created and distributed structure diagrams that showed TIBI interposed between Tactio (owned by the Shareholders) and various intermediate companies in the holding structure of the Bank. Whilst Mr Yurov claimed during his cross-examination that TIBI was a subsidiary of the Bank, it is common ground that it was beneficially owned by the Shareholders.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second is the sheer size and number of the loans made to Mr Yurov which involved TIBI. The use of TIBI to make personal loans is considered in Mr Allen’s Schedule 7. He addresses how particular liabilities of Mr Yurov to TIBI were cleared on 1 December 2008 by what he describes as a “<span style="font-style:italic">cycle scheme</span>”. The involvement of TIBI is illustrated with an example where monies originating from the Bank ended up with Mr Yurov (via TIBI) to be withdrawn “<span style="font-style:italic">in cash</span>” and used for Mr Yurov’s own personal benefit. On 1 December 2006, the Bank made a loan of RUB 300 million (about US$10 million) to Nikilin. RUB </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">270 million of this went, via TIBI, into Mr Yurov’s personal bank account and then on 4 December 2006, Mr Yurov withdrew US$7 million in cash which was taken from the Bank in an “<span style="font-style:italic">armoured vehicle</span>”, with the remainder being withdrawn a few days later to pay 40-50% of the purchase price of a property outside Moscow. The transfer of the RUB 270 million to Mr Yurov was characterised as a “payment for shares” that were “sold” to him by MC Trust. The result, says the Bank, is that he never had to pay back this loan. It is said that he further benefitted when the property was sold in July 2013 for RUB 381 </p>

He responded <span style="font-style:italic">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">OK</span><span style="font-style:italic">”</span> – the only possible meaning of this word is that he was agreeing to such (inappropriate) conduct. It is not the response of someone who had nothing to hide. On the contrary, and as the Bank submits, rightly in my view, it is the action of a guilty man. In the very same exchange of texts on 22 December Mr Worsley is proposing names for an “indemnity”, to include himself – the obvious context in which indemnities would be needed would be in the context of contemplated proceedings (civil and/or criminal).</p>

As explained in Steptoe's letter of 30 January 2017 and at paragraphs 44-49 of the Ninth Witness Statement of Neil Dooley (“Dooley 9”), after the rehabilitation of the Bank and the temporary administration in December 2014, the Bank's IT specialists (led by Andrey Babiy, an independent IT contractor) established that data from the Bank's email servers had been deliberately deleted shortly prior to the Bank's rehabilitation. In particular, emails held on the accounts of the First to Third Defendants (the “Primary Defendants”) and other senior executives (including Mr Iskandyrov, Ms Balkan, Ms Sidorova, Mr Pospelov, Mr Postnov, Mr Popov, Mr Vartsibasov, Ms Karalkina, Mr Kazakov, Mr Kuznetsov) had been systematically deleted.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">

Mr Yurov initially denied that he knew who these consultants were, but later suggested they were small time Russian law firms advising the Bank on CBR regulations. Given the amounts paid (US$2.7 million in 2013), this seems implausible.  One of Mr Worsley’s memos under the heading “<span style="font-style:italic">potential partners</span>” referred to the involvement of “X”, and included the comment, <span style="font-style:italic">“We need to provision for what happens if/when X is caught doing all of this. Currently, we pay X on a deal by deal basis. In other words we have some room to escape from trouble by saying that it was a one off. In the proposed new deal, we would be embedded with X in a concrete fashion and we risk being dragged into any charges that X may one day face.

One example is Mr Yurov’s evidence as the source of cash deposits totalling around US$14 million in cash into his account with the Bank between 2010 and 2014 (receipt of which he did not dispute), and which he said represented profits from a boxing academy and promotion company (Mr Fetisov received </p>

Mr Yurov’s evidence was that the business was sold for around US$1 million in 2015 despite (allegedly) having generated profits of over US$25 million over a 5 year period. This evidence (absent further explanation which was not forthcoming) appears incredible – there is a clear mismatch between the two. Whilst the true source of the cash is not clear, and it is not possible to know whether there was in fact any alleged sale of a business, I am satisfied that Mr Yurov’s account was not a frank and truthful account.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Another area illustrating Mr Yurov’s propensity to give untruthful evidence relates to the purchase of the Kolyada shares, the Kolyada case itself, and legal costs recovered in that case. As to the first Mr Yurov denied that the Bank ended up paying for his, and the other Shareholders’ acquisition of Mr Kolyada’s share in the Bank in 2006/7 stating that the money to pay back Credit Suisse/Merrill Lynch originated from the sale of shares to Merrill Lynch. However, the difficulty with this is what is stated in an email on 15 October 2014 from Mr Worsley to him summarising discussions between him and Mr Worsley in which it is stated, <span style="font-style:italic">“NBT paid back ML and CS facilities”.</span>  He could not offer any explanation for this other than to say that Mr Worsley was in <span style="font-style:italic">“unstable shape”.</span></p>

As Mr Worsley put it in his text to Mr Yurov of 27 May 2014 (which reflected the truth of the decision to be taken), “<span style="font-style:italic">Main problem is that we have loans of 1.2 billion USD, 90% of which are under water… And we have to finance them… And service all [these] companies that get loans… I will also make a corporate event budget. Basically, if you guys </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">keep</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only the two cash flow positive companies for Billa, plus the trusts, the costs are super minimal… Like almost zero.

The best example is that given by the Bank in relation to the negotiations to sell the “Personal Companies” Willow River and RCP in 2015 - i.e. after the Bank’s collapse. As the Bank points out, the Shareholders were in negotiations to sell Willow River and RCP, and the commercial properties owned by Willow River and RCP were managed by another company in the offshore network called Alians Development which was owned by Wave.  Yet Wave was used for balance sheet management and so on the Shareholders’ version of events they had to argue that it was a “Bank Company”, owned by and run for the benefit of the Bank with the result (it would follow) that Alians Development was a Bank Company. Despite Wave being allegedly a “Bank Company” in 2015 the Shareholders were arranging a transaction with the Guriev family whereby the Gurievs would buy Willow River, RCP and Alians Development (which required Wave agreeing to sell Alians Development – this could not have been procured if Wave was a Bank Company). I am satisfied that the reality was that there was no such distinction and the companies were all beneficially owned by the Shareholders. </p>

First, it was abundantly clear to me from the start of his cross-examination not only that he had received witness training but that he had taken from that witness training just about every available technique to avoid answering questions asked of him if he did not wish to do so or wished to gain time before doing so. These techniques included asking for questions to be repeated, re-phrased or broken down when not required and questioning the meaning of phrases when the meaning was obvious.  I formed this impression within minutes of him starting to give evidence but his approach pervaded the entirety of his evidence and the answers he gave. In this regard I consider the points made by the Bank in its Closing Submissions at paragraph 134 (and the examples given) to be entirely apposite and representative of his approach to questions asked of him. </p>

As already identified, and contrary to paragraph 21.2 of Mr Belyaev’s Closing Submissions, there is every reason to doubt Mr Belyaev’s version of events as to not reading emails and not reading documents he was signing, not least because I am satisfied that he is not a witness of truth, and his evidence is simply not credible, and is contrary to common sense. It is inherently improbable that he did not read emails sent to him or documents he was asked to sign. If he was in late 2008 and following working 20 hours a day trying to save the Bank (as was his evidence) that is all the more reason why he would perform his duties diligently and read what was sent to him, and read what he was asked to sign. A pressure of work defence might be an answer to missing something in a particular document but not failing to read anything, and failing to put his mind to anything he signed – those are not the actions of someone performing their duties and acting in the best interest of the Bank.  </p>

That email contained a detailed update of the progress made by Mr Worsley in relation to restructuring the offshore network. Mr Belyaev’s response when the document was put to him was to say that<span style="font-style:italic">, “if we are talking about 2010 and this is the Bank's email, "trust.ru", I'm suggesting that I was only able to read this email being present at the Bank”</span>.

He was able to, and did, email Mr Worsley from his “trust.ru” (work) account when he was travelling to Las Vegas. See, for example, his email to Mr Worsley at 9.11pm on 18 January 2010 from his “trust.ru” email address in response to an email from Mr Worsley to that email address: </p>

As he put it, the 2010 agreement was <span style="font-style:italic">“somewhat misleading”</span> because <span style="font-style:italic">“there was no as such an investment block at the bank, as a defined unit at the time”</span> and he had <span style="font-style:italic">“stopped trading or taking positions”</span> after 2010. Either the employment agreement was a sham to justify paying Mr Belyaev US$2.5 million a year, or he did have the responsibilities (and with it the knowledge that would come from the exercise of those responsibilities). The balance of the evidence favours the latter. If one looks to the contemporary documentation, for example in May 2012, Mr Worsley was describing Mr Belyaev’s role in an email to a Mr Heiner of VP Bank as “<span style="font-style:italic">…Sergey runs investment block” w</span>hich is entirely consistent with Mr Belyaev’s contract, but not his evidence.   </p>

His signature upon such documents is, selfevidently, unhelpful to his denial of knowledge of the offshore network, his denial as to the use of that network in “balance sheet management” and his denial of a personal interest in the offshore companies, as such signatures (at least at first blush) fix him with knowledge of the contents of those documents.  When asked about this he claimed not to have read what he was signing in particular cases. Indeed, in the context of “<span style="font-style:italic">regulatory</span>” documents and “<span style="font-style:italic">anything to do with indemnifying</span>” he went as far as to suggest that it was his practice not to read documents of such types. This evidence was not credible and if true (which I am satisfied it was not) would be a serious dereliction of duty of a director of a Russian company under Russian law – based on the expert evidence before me (there being no evidence of the alleged Russian banking practices alleged):- </p>

This is, on any view, an admission of obvious impropriety. If such a decision was not made, or Mr Belyaev was not party to it, the obvious response would be for him to reply either saying it was not true, or (if he had not been aware of it) expressing shock and surprise at such impropriety.

Yet further, if he genuinely regarded it as “garbage” one would have expected him to engage with his fellow shareholder upon it.

He himself had said in his witness statement that Mr Worsley had been hired to <span style="font-style:italic">“manage various companies for the Bank, a number of which were incorporated outside Russia”.</span>  He was particularly coy about even referring to companies in the “offshore network” choosing instead to use the term “SPV” for such a company which was neither apposite (given that SPVs are neither necessarily offshore nor necessarily off-balance sheet) nor a term that features heavily in the contemporary correspondence. Even when asked to give an example of an “<span style="font-style:italic">SPV</span>” being used to take over a defaulted asset/project during the relevant period (a practice he accepted he had some awareness of in a general sense), Mr Belyaev asked for a “<span style="font-style:italic">specific company</span>” to be named. </p>

All of these problems placed the Bank in a <span style="text-decoration:underline">very precarious financial position</span>. The impact of the diminution in capital was magnified, because the Bank was restricted in its ability to lend funds by reference to a multiple of its capitalisation. Accordingly, the Bank's ability to lend was greatly reduced by any fall in capital. This was compounded by the fact that the Bank was unable to raise additional capital by issuing further shares, because its shares were frozen.  </p>

Mr Belyaev did not respond asking what Mr Worsley was talking about. I am satisfied that Mr Belyaev (contrary to his evidence) knew perfectly well about the offshore network, and its use for balance sheet management (as well as the ultimate beneficial ownership in the Shareholders – as reflected in the numerous documents signed by Mr Belyaev declaring him to be one of the beneficial owners of companies in the offshore network).

Mr Belyaev went so far (in his evidence in chief) to delete evidence from his own witness statement that he and Mr Plyakin knew each other socially from attending martial arts classes together (which he must have consciously included in his witness statement, before subsequently regretting saying that). He then also denied attending that meeting despite Mr Belyaev being recorded as attending in the contemporaneous minutes signed by Mr Plyakin himself and sent to the Bank under cover of a letter also signed by Mr Plyakin. It is difficult to see why the minutes would be other than accurate or if not accurate why they would not have been corrected.

It just        would have to be funded probably from the profit of the        Bank but it would be quite possible to do that.  I would        not think that it would be right way to do that        personally but legally and from a financial standpoint,        that would be perfectly fine.  As you probably know,        banks in Russia own, you know, planes, can pay for the        travels of the executives, they charter yachts.  This is        a permissible way of doing things.  I would not agree        that this is probably the, you know, the most ethical        way to do things. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Fetisov, like Mr Belyaev before him, was also a user of techniques such as denying he had been at meetings or had read mails when he considered that presence at those meetings or the contents of those emails, to be contrary to his interest.  Tellingly such matters tended to be at the heart of the Bank’s case in relation to particular loans that are in issue and his approval of them at CC meetings, and his ownership of companies in the offshore network. He was also defensive and argumentative at times as candidly recognised in Mr Fetisov’s Closing Submissions. I do not consider, however, that he was an “<span style="font-style:italic">essentially</span>” honest witness (as I was invited to find at paragraph 8(1) of Mr Fetisov’s Closing Submissions). On the contrary, and in the circumstances I identify, I am satisfied that Mr Fetisov did not give honest answers of questions asked of him, and was prepared to lie with a view to evading evidence that he perceived as contrary to his own interests. He made wild and, I am satisfied, unjustified allegations against Mr Worsley (largely in </p>

I address examples of such matters below. Overall I consider that little, if any, weight can be placed on his evidence in areas of controversy, save where it is supported by contemporary documents or amounts to an admission contrary to his interest. </p>

Despite the importance of the signing-off of accounts as a result of which one would expect anyone in Mr Fetisov’s position to read carefully what he was signing Mr Fetisov suggested that he had not read the part setting out the Bank’s policies in relation to subsidiaries, and he would not accept that companies owned or controlled by the Bank (per Mr Fetisov’s evidence on the offshore network of companies) would fall within such definition.

When this document was put to him (somewhat incredibly) he said: <span style="font-style:italic">“I've seen a number of documents during this trial, where my signature clearly is not mine or initials not mine.

As was pointed out to him there would be no way for Chrysanthou &amp; Chrysanthou to understand that there were different beneficial ownerships.

I also seen that – the whole arrays of the documents missing, he showed me emails, for instance -- I've seen emails where Worsley communicates with employees of Teos and this particular lady called Melanie -- -- I forgot her last name but she comes up saying: I have nothing, no documents whatsoever on these, these, these, companies, can I create them as usual. And miraculously, like later in the day or next day or two days, documents appear to be suddenly available, found somewhere. So this is why I'm saying that this is all -- like not clear to me how it was all organised, I definitely never gave instructions to include all that into my personal trust and, at best, I think that all constitutes big sort of dishonesty and deception, maybe possibly fraud.” </p>

Equally, where a borrower needed to pay interest this would often be funded by way of a loan to another company. This feature is critically important in evaluating whether the Loans/Transactions in issue were harmful to the Bank: ‘recycling’ effectively prolongs the status quo (and avoids recognising a loss) rather than itself causing any harm to the Bank’s existing financial position.” </p>

He augmented such denial in particular cases with an account of being away at the time of meetings. Thus, he said he was in eastern Russia racing rally cars on 25 February 2010, when the documents show that, along with Mr Yurov, he voted in favour of a loan to Business Group (this was an absentee ballot). However, he had not previously suggested that he had not approved this loan or sought to modify his evidence by a corrective or supplemental witness statement.  </p>

Ms Podstrekha gave evidence as to the care taken over CBR minutes, and those minutes were sent to the Bank contemporaneously and did not prompt a call for correction.

He too attempted to defend the indefensible and chose to support the implausible account of events recounted by Mr Yurov that I am satisfied was a false account of events.  It was submitted in Mr Fetisov’s Closing Submissions by Mr Willan on behalf of Mr Fetisov that in relation to the intended use of the yachts if any findings can safely be made in relation to the intended use of the yacht they will tell the Court little about the quality of Mr Fetisov’s evidence on the matters in issue in the case. I disagree. His evidence shows that he was prepared to lie to the Court and to defend that which was not capable of being defended. That shows he is not a witness of truth and this inevitably impacts on the veracity of his evidence as a whole. It also shows that he was prepared, contemporaneously, to act in a dishonest manner, which is of relevance when considering the inherent probability of him acting dishonestly in the respects which are in issue. </p>

The Bank says (but the Defendants very much deny) that this material demonstrates what was really happening in relation to the offshore network.  On the exchange of witness statements for trial, the Bank served a Hearsay Notice in relation to Mr Worsley’s affidavit evidence, but then withdrew it, choosing not to rely on Mr Worsley’s evidence at trial, although it says that Mr Worsley’s evidence was (and remains) consistent with the vast number of contemporaneous documents he supplied.  It says that it did not need to rely on Mr Worsley’s evidence on the basis that, post-disclosure and exchange of witness statements, the Bank’s case can be proved by other evidence. </p>

The Bank could have adduced evidence from Mr Worsley about the content of these meetings, it has chosen not to do so, and it has thereby deprived Mr Belyaev of the opportunity of cross-examining Mr Worsley. It is said that this is a particularly important factor when it comes to the Bank trying to piece together a chronological narrative that depends upon establishing that Mr Belyaev was a party to discussions. In the absence of that evidence from Mr Worsley, the Court should apply <span style="font-style:italic">Wisniewski</span> and find that the Bank has not established that Mr Belyaev discussed the matters that the Bank relies upon. Mr Belyaev also identifies other matters on which it is said he would have liked to cross-examine Mr Worsley including Mr Belyaev’s evidence that he would sign bundles of papers without reading them, indeed that he would do so as a matter of course of his work at the Bank, and that it was standard for senior Russian bankers to sign stacks of documents brought to them each day which had been prepared by executives and managers at the Bank.  It is said that in the absence of Mr Worsley’s evidence, the Court should accept Mr Belyaev’s explanations as to how he came to sign so many documents and how, despite his signature appearing on so many documents, he did not have any knowledge or understanding of what he was signing.  </p>

There is little point for either side trying to make much of the other’s reluctance to call Mr Worsley.

It remains important to handle his documents with care. He evidently often had an agenda of his own, and his only consistent loyalty was to his own self-interest. One sometimes says that documents ‘speak for themselves’. In Mr Worsley’s case, however, they often speak through many layers of self-aggrandizement, paranoia, drama, and pretence. As a non-Russian speaker (or rather, as it was suspected, a Russian-language refusenik), whose relationship with his key staff such as Mr Iskandyrov seems to have been appalling, he probably did not understand much of what was really happening. While the fact that Mr Worsley wrote a particular email on a particular date remains a fact, the extent to which anything he wrote was true is highly doubtful. The Bank cannot legitimately place much reliance on anything he said as actually reflecting reality, and the Court should treat it all with as much or more circumspection as it would treat any evidence he might give.” </p>

Each item of documentation must be considered on its own merits, what it says, how it ties in with other evidence (and the issues that arise, who it was provided to, and what response it did or did not generate and from whom).

When it was put to him in cross-examination that this did not make sense, Mr Popkov reiterated that Mr Postnov was scared of the risk of his evidence being used against him, and that Mr Postnov had refused to give even a written statement.

He also assisted the new administration. It is said he would have been in a position to give evidence of procedure at CC meetings. Mr Popkov’s evidence was that he did not know for sure whether there was any reason why he could not have given evidence (an open question equally applicable to all parties) as he <span style="font-style:italic">“stopped any communication with Vartsibasov in March 2015”</span>. In circumstances in which Mr Vartsibasov is said to be one of the Defendants, “<span style="font-style:italic">closest lieutenants</span>” I do not consider the Bank might reasonably be expected to have called him.  In any event I doubt whether Mr Vartsibasov would willingly have given evidence. Once again the Defendants themselves could have sought to call him if they considered it would have been in their interest to do so.  I do not consider there is any scope for drawing adverse inferences in relation to the Bank not calling Mr Vartsibasov. </p>

She also signed the Bank Winter agreements and the IFRS account and was the signatory of the letters prepared for the CBR relating to EWUB. I accept she could have had material evidence to give in relation to such matters, and she is an employee of Otkritie (i.e. the Bank’s owner) so, prima facie, the Bank could have been expected to call her.  </p>

His evidence was also that she said that, <span style="font-style:italic">“there could be no questions really because under no circumstances will she testify for either party.” </span> Whilst Mr Popkov was questioned as to why he did not mention this in his witness statement (he stated he did not consider it “<span style="font-style:italic">pertinent</span>”), Mr Popkov was not challenged as to the truth of his evidence. In such circumstances the evidence before me is that Ms Cherkasova was not willing to give evidence and I am satisfied that this explains why she was not called by the Bank. It is unrealistic to expect the Bank to attempt to compel her to give evidence in such circumstances (even assuming, under the terms of her employment contract, it could do so – as to which there is no evidence before me).  In the above circumstances I do not consider that there is any scope for drawing adverse inferences in relation to the Bank not calling Ms Cherkasova. I would only add that I do not consider that it can be assumed what her evidence would be in relation to balance sheet management or that her views would assist any of the Defendants on the issues in this case.</p>

Whilst I agree that she could be expected to have material evidence to give, Mr Popkov’s evidence (the truth of which was not challenged) was that he did not know where she was employed and when he spoke to her at the end of 2015 or start of 2016, she refused to communicate with him.

This was a sensible agreement which was endorsed by the Court. Mr Fetisov reserved the right to seek a ruling prior to closing submissions, and in due course raised before the Court whether it would be appropriate to do so. However even a preliminary identification of the issues arising by Mr Willan on behalf of Mr Fetisov consumed a significant amount of Court time, and I ruled that matters would proceed as agreed by the other parties with the pleading issues being dealt with in Closing Submissions, as occurred. This ensured the efficient use of Court time and facilitated the conclusion of the trial on schedule. It is unlikely that this would have been achieved if the pleading points had been argued out and ruled upon as the trial timetable could not have accommodated such an approach. </p>

The Bank’s position, in outline, is that its case has been adequately particularised over the hundreds of pages of pleadings already served, which already vastly exceed the guideline length for cases in this Court. In adopting that position, the Bank does not seek to belittle the importance of pleadings in defining the issues and giving the parties fair notice of the case that they will have to meet (or make) at trial. But the Bank does say that, in this case, the Shareholders’ suggestions that the Bank is not entitled to rely on the matters listed in Issue 27 are not well-founded because the relevant issues are adequately pleaded, insofar as they needed to be; and there is no question of the Shareholders having been taken by surprise or not having had a fair opportunity to deal with them on their merits.” </p>

Ultimately what is needed is to consider what is or is not pleaded and what should be pleaded in order to pursue a particular allegation applying the applicable principles as to pleading.

To my mind it seems that in recent years there has been a tendency to forget this basic purpose and to seek particularisation even when it is not really required. This is not only costly in itself, but is calculated to lead to delay and to interlocutory battles in which the parties and the Court pore over endless pages of pleadings to see whether or not some particular point has or has not been raised or answered, when in truth each party knows perfectly well what case is made by the other and is able properly to prepare to deal with it. Pleadings are not a game to be played at the expense of the litigants, nor an end in themselves, but a means to the end, and that end is to give each party a fair hearing. Each case must of course be looked at in the light of its own subject matter and circumstances. Thus general statements to the effect that global or composite claims are embarrassing and justify striking out, to be found for example in Hudson 11th Ed. paragraph 8–204 are not automatically applicable to every case. With regard to the particular pleadings in question, I remain unpersuaded that either McAlpines or PDP were put to any sort of material unfair disadvantage by the way the matter had been set out by the Plaintiffs.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.22in;text-indent:0.00in">The need for extensive pleadings including particulars should be reduced by the requirement that witness statements are now exchanged. In the majority of proceedings identification of the documents upon which a party relies, together with copies of that party's witness statements, will make the detail of the nature of the case the other side has to meet obvious. This reduces the need for particulars in order to avoid being taken by surprise. This does not mean that pleadings are now superfluous. Pleadings are still required to mark out the parameters of the case that is being advanced by each party. In particular they are still critical to identify the issues and the extent of the dispute between the parties. What is important is that the pleadings should make clear the general nature of the case of the pleader. This is true both under the old rules and the new rules. The Practice Direction to CPR, paragraph 9.3 requires, in defamation proceedings, the facts on which a defendant relies to be given. No more than a concise statement of those facts is required. </p>

This is only partly a matter of pleading. It is also a matter of substance. As I have said, the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet. But since dishonesty is usually a matter of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted dishonestly, but also the primary facts which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference. At trial the court will not normally allow proof of primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will not do so in a case of fraud. It is not open to the court to infer dishonesty from facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must be some fact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be both pleaded and proved.”  </p>

If established, the bribery and conspiracy were no more than evidence on which the judge could find that what was the Respondent’s case throughout was established, i.e. that the Appellant had misused the Respondent’s confidential information. Mr Flynn submitted that it would have been unfair to require him to plead the bribery and conspiracy allegations while leaving the Appellant free to make an unpleaded allegation of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Thirdly, he submitted that the factual findings made by the judge had been fairly addressed during the trial. The Appellant had not sought an adjournment or sought to adduce any of the evidence that it now suggested, at this very late stage, would have been adduced if the Respondent’s allegations had been pleaded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">42.  I have no doubt that the Respondent’s allegations of bribery and conspiracy should have been pleaded. The Respondent should not, as Mr Lord submits, have been able to have its cake and to eat it. CPR Part 16.4 (1)(a) requires a claimant to include in its particulars of claim “a concise statement of the facts on which the claimant relies”. The Respondent did rely on the fact of bribery, by adducing evidence that Jitty had been seen paying a large bribe to Gurbir Singh, and the fact that there had been a conspiracy between the Defendants for Gurbir Singh to steal the Respondent’s invoices. Moreover, paragraph 8.2 of the Practice Direction to CPR Part 16 requires the claimant specifically to set out any allegation of fraud and illegality where he wishes to rely on it in support of his claim. The Respondent should not have adduced evidence of the alleged conspiracy and bribery without amending its Particulars of Claim, and Mr Flynn should not have examined or cross-examined witnesses with a view to establishing those facts. It is no answer that the Respondent could have succeeded in establishing liability without establishing those facts: those facts were part of its case at trial. A party’s pleadings set out for the other party and for the Court the facts to be investigated during the trial. The Particulars of Claim in this case did not do so. Nor is it any answer, if it be the case (which I address below), that the Appellant’s allegation of conspiracy was also unpleaded. By alleging the unpleaded matters the Respondent assumed the burden of pleading them. Moreover, once the Respondent’s allegations of bribery and conspiracy had emerged, the preliminary issue as formulated became wholly inappropriate.” </p>

On the principles I have identified I consider that if a finding was to be sought that the fiduciary arrangements involving EWUB and Donau were inherently dishonest then this case should have been positively pleaded (and particularised), and it was not. I do not consider, however, that the point is of any real significance in relation to the issues that arise for determination – if the Bank is right in its submissions about balance sheet management it would matter not that it is not entitled to submit that the fiduciary lending arrangements involving EWUB and Donau were “<span style="font-style:italic">inherently dishonest</span>”, as that is not a necessary requirement to its case on the inappropriateness of balance sheet management (and the alleged breaches of duty that it submits arise in that regard). In any event, none of the Loans or Transactions under consideration appear to have been made via the EWUB or Donau schemes (although some were used in the context of “unwinding” such schemes). In the above circumstances, and whilst I find that it is not open to the Bank to allege that the EWUB and Donau schemes were “<span style="font-style:italic">inherently dishonest</span>”, such a plea is not on the critical path in relation to the Bank’s case on balance sheet management or my overall findings in that regard.   </p>

Instead of using the loan funds for legitimate business purposes, these offshore companies would use them to service the bad debts owed to the bank by other companies in the offshore network, paying interest in order to avoid a default but not reducing (to any great extent or perhaps at all) the outstanding principal. This was a selfperpetuating process since the borrowers could only pay back these loans with money recycled through further sham loans and the overall result was to increase the amount owed to the bank. The bank says that the object and the result of this circular flow of funds was <span style="text-decoration:underline">to deceive</span> the outside world, including <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Central Bank of Russia</span> and the ordinary Russian savers who deposited their savings in the bank, over many years, <span style="text-decoration:underline">by falsifying the bank's accounts</span> and concealing its insolvency.” (emphasis added) </p>

However, I do not understand this to be a free-standing point, but rather one deployed to support other aspects of the Bank’s case and/or to undermine the Defendants’ defences thereto. Thus, in order for the balance sheet management to work, it is said that the accounts had to be manipulated to reflect something other than the true state of the Bank’s balance sheet, and in order for this to happen the auditors (who are not alleged to be complicit) would have to be deceived.  The false information given in interview also goes to the alleged distinction between “Bank Companies” and “Shareholder Companies” given what the auditors and third parties were told about the relevant companies being owned by other individuals (Mr Worsley’s UBOs), and goes to undermine the Shareholders’ pleaded case that the relevant companies were owned by or for the benefit of the Bank itself.  </p>

It is also clear that the Supervisory Board did, in fact, approve accounts given that there are three examples of them doing so in the trial bundles, namely the approval of the 2010 Annual reports and accounts on 31 May 2011, the approval of the 2012 IFRS accounts on 27 May 2013 and the approval of the 2013 annual report and accounts on 29 April 2014. In each case the three Shareholders are stated to have voted by ballot in favour of approval. Item 4 in relation to each of the 2010-2013 AGMs record that Mr Yurov “took to the floor” in relation to the approval of the accounts (there is no full translation of the 2014 accounts but I consider that it is more likely than not that the accounts would have been approved in the same way).  In addition, both the 2008 and 2009 IFRS accounts were signed by Mr Fetisov as President of the Bank.

It was the Supervisory Board that was responsible for making proposals to the AGM in relation to the approval of related-party transactions (although, tellingly, the Borrowers were not mentioned). Thus at the meeting of 10 May 2012, the Supervisory Board (including each of the Shareholders) agreed, at item 10, to recommend that the shareholders approve the entry into related-party transactions <span style="font-style:italic">“that the Bank may carry out in the ordinary course of business</span>” (with a list of companies which were mainly companies in the Bank’s own holding structure) and with the individual Shareholders personally. This proposal was then adopted at the 2012 AGM.  There was no mention of any of the Borrowers (for example Erinskay, which in fact borrowed substantial sums from the Bank in 2012). Equally at the 2010 AGM there was no reference made to WR or RCP which together borrowed around US$110 million from the Bank at the end of 2010 – and which the Shareholders now admit owning. </p>

This is a singularly bad point (not pursued in the witness statements for trial) given the nature of those approvals which cannot possibly extend to specific loans to companies in the offshore network beneficially owned by the Shareholders.

First it is another example of the Supervisory Board’s role being much wider than the Shareholders suggest. But secondly, and importantly, it means that the Shareholders were well aware that there was a specific process to be followed for the approval of related-party transactions – indeed they followed this process for relatively minor dealings between the Bank and companies in its own holding structure, and for personal loans); but they singularly failed to do so for “balance sheet management” transactions or loans to what the Shareholders now admit were their own companies (including SiberianKD, Business Group, Priangarskiy, WR and RCP). The consequence (quite apart from the Shareholders’ failure to follow that process) is that such transactions, which were related-party dealings which would clearly require disclosure and approval, appeared instead, in the Bank’s audited accounts, to be genuine arm’s length commercial lending. </p>

Indeed, Mr Yurov appeared to accept that, as a matter of fact, this did not take place as it was stated at paragraph 103 of his Written Closing Submissions that, “<span style="font-style:italic">since approval was essentially a formality because the Loans and Transactions had been arranged within the Bank and were known to be for the benefit of the off  balance sheet network no further independent consideration was required after approval by the Credit Committee</span>”.

In this regard there is an absence of any actual documentation justifying the commercial rationale and credit risk of most of the loans in issue in the present case, contrary to what would be expected if a bank, and its credit committee, was acting in a normal commercial manner considering the risks of a loan on its merits (which is what was clearly contemplated in the context of the provision of the documentation identified in Article 11.3). To take one example (as identified by the Bank), when the Credit Committee approved a RUB 3 billion loan to Stivilon in March 2010 (approximately US$100 million at the time) there is no evidence that the Credit Committee had <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> reports assessing matters relevant to the risk, including assessing the Gelendzhik project, its anticipated timeline and Stivilon’s ability to generate the revenues that would be needed to service the loan and pay it back within the loan period (3 years). 319.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In other cases, I am satisfied that such paperwork as was produced as purported justification for the loans was, in fact, positively misleading, as I address below in the Erinskay/Baymore and LBSC Borrower Sections below (Sections R.2 and R.3 respectively)<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">.</span></p>

It is also notable that the Defendants did not take issue with the predictive coding used by the Bank during standard disclosure, and have not made any requests for specific disclosure in the 18 months since standard disclosure took place.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">The relevance of the back-dating and falsification of Credit Committee minutes is four-fold. First, it shows that Mr Yurov was not prepared to be honest in the discharge of his responsibilities (and was also cavalier in the discharge of those responsibilities). Second, it sheds light on the fact that Credit Committee minutes were used, on a number of occasions, to provide an approval “paper-trail” (as the Bank accurately puts it) rather than as a forum where there was a genuine and bona fide consideration of a particular loan on its merits.  Third, it rather tells the lie to Mr Yurov’s evidence that his role as a member of the Credit Committee was to manage credit risk and ensure not a single kopek of Bank money was lost due to credit risk, and that he had to be convinced by all the materials available to him that the credit risk had been properly reviewed, valued and calculated, and that making a loan would not harm the Bank due to credit risk. That is hardly consistent with the conduct of someone who was prepared to back-date and falsify documents approving a loan seemingly unaccompanied by any materials, and not even considered at a particular Credit Committee meeting yet to be (dishonestly) recorded as such.  Whilst there is no evidence that this practice took place in relation to the approval to make any of the loans in question in the present case, such practice, and Mr Yurov’s involvement in it, is part of the backdrop against which Mr Yurov’s role in relation to the loans under consideration is set. Fourthly, given that such requests for back-dating and inclusion in minutes after the event (and in some cases even without regard to the subject matter of a particular meeting) were directed by Mr Postnov to Mr Yurov, this shows that the management looked to him (as opposed to the other CC attendees) to approve such matters – which is of relevance in the context of Issue 17 (Shareholders causing and/or procuring and/or agreeing Loans and Transactions, as addressed in due course below). </p>

Given the clear paper trail between Mr Postnov and Mr Yurov it is plain that had there been involvement with, or approval by, other Credit Committee members, this would feature in the contemporary documents – yet there is no such documentation.  The fact that Mr Postnov contacts Mr Yurov and no one else itself evidences, I am satisfied, a recognition that back-dated and falsified resolutions were in the gift of Mr Yurov rather than the Credit Committee as a whole following proper consideration thereof. </p>

The difficulty, however, with this evidence (quite apart from the fact that it would, itself, suggest a lack of appropriate scrutiny), is that it is predicated on the basis of a distinction between “Bank Companies” and “Shareholder companies” (as opposed to all the companies being treated as if they were beneficially owned by the Shareholders) and the (false) premise that “balance sheet management” was in the Bank’s best interest (which it was not), as has already been foreshadowed and as is addressed in relation to Issue 17 below as well as in the Borrower specific sections.     </p>

Further, when one looks at first loans advanced it can be seen, for example by reference to the case of Erinskay, that the first loan advanced involved the use of a positively false and deceptive risk report which misrepresented the company’s true position. The loans are considered in the Borrower specific sections – suffice it to note at this point that there is no evidence of any actual discussion of the commercial merits of loans or the ability of borrowers to repay loans. </p>

One difficulty with this evidence (quite apart from the lack of evidence that anyone on the Credit Committee was analysing the issue of credit risk in depth) is that it comes close to Mr Belyaev admitting, if not averring, that he did not put his mind to the appropriateness of individual loans at all, and that he was abrogating the responsibilities he had. His evidence was also that if the matter before the Credit Committee concerned a roll-over of an existing loan, a change to the currency of the loan, interest rates or drawdowns within existing and pre-approved credit lines, he would not have considered credit risk in any detail as these sorts of changes would not create additional credit risk for the Bank. Again, this does not suggest that Mr Belyaev was, in reality, putting his mind to the appropriateness of particular decisions of the Credit Committee. </p>

It appears that the distressed assets group was concerned with the projects themselves, as opposed to how they were held or how their financing was structured. Mr Iskandyrov agreed that the decisions taken in the group were ones of high level principle rather than detail. </p>

He too attempted to distance himself from events, and from involvement in the Bank’s activities as was well illustrated by his omission of his role of President of the Bank in his written evidence and the denial of various responsibilities set out in his contract employment. In this regard Mr Fetisov does not mention, anywhere in his Defence or in two witness statements that he was President of the Bank, as well as being the chairman of the Management Committee for significant periods of time, and as already addressed I am satisfied that this was a deliberate omission and not something that “<span style="font-style:italic">must have slipped through”.   </span></p>

I am also satisfied, despite Mr Fetisov’s denial of responsibility for risk management in his Defence (at paragraph 8(4), supported by a Statement of Truth), that he was indeed involved high up in the reporting chain in relation to risk management as evidenced by the statements in the Bank’s IFRS accounts that I have already quoted, and which I am satisfied accurately identified his involvement. Mr Fetisov was also keen to distance himself from the audited accounts that he himself signed in 2008, 2009 and 2011, and gave evidence that I did not consider to be credible about not reading the same. Again the reason is plain – he wanted to distance himself from the offshore companies and their associated loans. </p>

The Bank also made use of fiduciary lending schemes through East West United Bank in Luxembourg (EWUB) and VTB/Donau Bank in Austria (Donau).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears that the 2008 financial crisis had a significant impact on the Bank (in common with many other banks), and that it was after the 2008 financial crisis that the use of “balance sheet management” intensified. As already noted Mr Fetisov was head of the “Distressed Assets” group following the 2008 crisis.  He describes how the Bank was <span style="font-style:italic">“hit especially hard”</span> by the crisis and that the Shareholders <span style="font-style:italic">“needed to find a solution which would allow the Bank to continue operating through difficult market conditions”.</span>  However whilst the impression he seeks to portray is of the Bank taking over investment projects whose owners had defaulted on their loans i.e. the Bank acquiring the ownership of such projects or the project company for itself, I am satisfied that this version of events is incorrect. Only Stivilon and StroyEcologia could be said, even theoretically, to fit this pattern, and it appears that in fact those projects were taken over and owned not by the Bank but by the Shareholders personally (although the evidence is that the Shareholders procured the Bank to purchase 19% of Stivilon).  </p>

Realistically, there is no room for argument or ambiguity in this regard. As such, these charts are highly significant documents. None of the Shareholders suggests that there was ever any difference in beneficial ownership as between Yaposha and Otradnoye/Degunino, on one hand; and any of the other disputed companies/assets (including the other commercial property assets) on the other hand. They maintain that they are and were always Bank Companies. But if, as these documents show, Yaposha and Otradnoye/Degunino were Personal Companies then (1) the Shareholders have lied about Yaposha and Otradnoye/Degunino being “Bank Companies”, (2) the fact that these were Personal Companies strongly supports the conclusion that <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> the disputed companies/assets were Personal Companies, and (3) this also supports the conclusion that there was never any distinction between the two (and such distinction is a later invention). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">The funding of transactions in the form of loans provided by the Bank to non-resident companies is explained by the fact that at the time of their completion, the Bank’s counterparties did not have sufficiently developed infrastructure to conduct business in Russia. So far, companies registered in accordance with Russian legislation, that the Bank 23.04.09 [Signature] D8/17T/1 2 is planning to extend loans to, have come into their corporate structure. On account of the funds provided by the Bank, the companies will buy back assets from non-resident companies, which in turn will pay off the loans to the Bank. The Bank believes that this funding structure is final and allows the Bank to protect its creditor’s rights in the Russian jurisdiction and, if necessary, initiate foreclosure procedures and exercise its rights in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. Therefore the structure of the transaction, including the pledge, shall be preserved, which eliminates the appearance of additional risk for the Bank.” </p>

There is indeed a share purchase agreement dated 17 April 2009 by which Mourija was to purchase the shares in Business Group from LLC Jermanta (which was actually another Shareholder company) for US$16.5 million.

Thus, the economic essence of the operation was to transform the risks of financial instruments into credit risks. The amounts of financing deposited in the bank (formed by credit resources) were used by the bank to minimize the estimated provision for CLN to ensure the first quality category.

The Bank actively cooperated with authorised representatives of the Bank of Russia and members of the inspection group, offered all the necessary additional documentation at their request, and arranged informative meetings with employees directly involved in the completion of loan transactions. The Bank believes that this allowed a sufficient level of transparency of the loan portfolio to be ensured. </p>

I am satisfied that Mr Fetisov’s account is untruthful. It is inherently improbable that detailed Minutes would not record such matters – they would have been of obvious interest to CBR, and I am satisfied they would have (contrary to the impression sort to be conveyed by Mr Fetisov) have provoked a strong and, for the Bank, unpleasant reaction from the CBR. Indeed the true position (as recognised by Mr Yurov in Mr Yurov’s memo to the other Shareholders in June 2015) is that the Bank started submitting false accounts from 2008 as a result of the balance sheet management that was being undertaken and<span style="font-style:italic"> “if such losses had been recorded in the bank’s books back in 2008, the CBR would have had to revoke NBT’s banking licence”. </span>The suggestion that the CBR would have reacted with equanimity to any such revelations in the meeting on 7 December 2009 is not credible, and defies belief. The reason for Mr Fetisov’s lies are clear enough – a desire to portray “balance sheet management” as unobjectionable when the reality is that it was anything but (as addressed in relation to Issue 16 in Section G.3 below), and to distance himself from what actually occurred in that meeting (i.e. the painting of a false picture as to the lending that was taking place) coupled with a failure to reveal Shareholders’ ownership of particular companies.</p>

The Bank’s case is that the catalyst for Mr Worsley’s recruitment, and the move out of the Bank of the management of the offshore network of companies and its expansion, was the need for more secrecy prompted by the unwelcome attention of the CBR in mid-2009 that has been addressed above. In contrast Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov say that the decision was due to a loss of confidence in Mr Drozdov, including a suspicion that he had been involved in covering up the embezzlement of funds by Mr Maximov from the offshore network. This rather begs the question as to why Mr Drozdov continued to be employed by the Bank in a senior position </p>

Given Mr Maximov’s alleged wrongdoings, it is notable that he continued to be copied in on emails in the immediate aftermath of Mr Worsley’s appointment.  I do not find the explanation for the replacement of Mr Drozdov to be credible even taken in isolation, but in context, and with the obvious need for the appointment of a “Mr Worsley” and the setting up of a more opaque and labyrinthine offshore network given the increasing scrutiny from the CBR, I reject the reason given by Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov as an untruth. </p>

In this regard I have already referred to the very telling email from Mr Worsley to Mr Belyaev alone (to his private email address) dated 19 December 2012 – i.e. when balance sheet management was in full swing with a network of offshore companies set up or controlled by Mr Worsley, which shows that Mr Belyaev knew very well what was being done by Mr Worsley in relation to an offshore network for balance sheet management with fake nominee UBOs and the like (<span style="font-style:italic">“Sergey, Hi.

What actually happened with the management of an offshore network transferred to a separate external Russian company set up headed by Mr Worsley (Columba) is not in dispute and speaks for itself. Whilst Mr Yurov claimed, in his oral evidence, that Mr Worsley was recruited as the Shareholders could not understand how they owned their assets and needed someone to restructure them, this account does not bear analysis given that Mr Drozdov had sent the Shareholders the structure charts in September 2008 that have already been referred to, and he could no doubt have answered any questions they had. More fundamentally, I am satisfied that the restructuring that took place was clearly designed not to simplify the structure but to make it more opaque with the use of multiple nominee UBOs with the result that true ownership was concealed which facilitated (amongst other benefits for the Shareholders) being able to treat companies as their own, and also to circumvent CBR requirements on related party and concentrated lending. </p>

However, we need to look ahead: I do not currently have details about the companies that are held by TIB Investments at the moment. We discussed 57 companies. Is this the main vehicle that will hold the majority of these companies, or is TIB Investments the hedge fund vehicle? I lack information here to comment properly. My current comments are as follows: We need to look ahead now, in order to minimise future risks. The main issues are around share transfer to ensure 'good title' (see above), <span style="text-decoration:underline">and the disclosure of beneficial ownership (IE</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the identity of the final Shareholders</span>). IF there are going to be many companies under the RHT structure, we should look at the possibility of several identical structures. EG if later, a hedge fund, or Yaposha, needs to be financed, or sold, then it may be better to have separate structures for some of the entities, so that each transaction is individual, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and risks around identity are minimised.

Mr Yurov accepted in cross-examination that he had no reason to doubt that he said these words. Ms Podstrekha also stated in her oral evidence that she had a vivid memory that Mr Yurov had “<span style="font-style:italic">looked me in the eye – I said </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">Are they your companies?</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> and he looked me straight in the eye and he said, </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">No they are not ours</span>”. Ms Podstrekha’s evidence (which I accept) is that she understood Mr Yurov’s statement as applying to the entire loan portfolio. I reject the suggestion (advanced in Mr Yurov’s Skeleton) that the statement related only to those borrowers that are specifically referred to at the start of the Minutes. That is not consistent with the wording of the Minutes (which the Bank would have had the opportunity to comment on and correct) and which encompasses all borrowers and “<span style="font-style:italic">investment projects</span>”. In any event, even if that were so, (and I am satisfied it was not), the evidence is that the likes of Jermanta, Sapkont and Elis Trade were owned by the Shareholders, so it was a lie to state that those companies were not related to the Bank’s owners. Even had the borrowers been beneficially owned by the Bank (but concealed off balance sheet) it could not honestly be said that such borrowers were “<span style="font-style:italic">not related to the Bank’s owners</span>”. </p>

This email exchange ended with Mr Iskandyrov saying that a conference call would be arranged with Mr Fetisov on 12 February 2010. The likelihood is that the subject matter of any such call would be what was quoted above – that is how the companies would open bank accounts and provide KYC information without revealing their true (final) beneficial owners who would be the Shareholders with a trust deed between them and nominee beneficiaries (the “nominee UBOs”).  However I cannot be sure that this call actually took place (in his oral evidence Mr Iskandyrov could not recall whether it did). If it did the likelihood is that such matters would be discussed though again I am not convinced it would be a call about Mr Fetisov “approving” the recruitment of nominee UBOs. The fact is, however, that that is precisely what Mr Worsley went on to do, and it is inherently improbable that he was on a frolic of his own and was not doing so with the knowledge (and approval) of the Shareholders.      </p>

That just bank acquired assets on the default of the        initial loans.  So the assets went under the control of        the Bank and according to what I understand, and what        I remember, there was -- should be a discussion on how        to hold these different type of assets in the proper        way”. </span>

Mr Fetisov contends this reflects his general understanding that SMP were advising on the use of orphan trusts/SPVs to hold assets acquired by the Bank for its own benefit.  For its part the Bank contends that the none of the assets belonged to the Bank.

First, Mr Worsley made a similar suggestion to SMP in October 2010 after SMP (in a compliance context) queried which assets were being placed inside the new structure and Mr Worsley replied with a list that included Stivilon, Willow River/RCP, Yaposha, the commercial real estate and Priangarskiy/Business Group stating <span style="font-style:italic">“Mainly assets seized by the bank during the crisis” </span>when in fact there is nothing to suggest that Yaposha or any of the commercial real estate projects had been acquired on the default of any loans. Second, the documentation that has already been referred to that Mr Worsley was sent and which he passed on to SMP (in anonymised form) clearly showed that Yaposha was directly owned by the Shareholders not the Bank, and Business Group (identified in the structure charts) and the Billa (that is the Willow River/RCP) property portfolio was (per the Shareholders themselves) never acquired by the Bank. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also the case that no such structure actually came into fruition, and it was not suggested in other correspondence sent at the time (which refers to the use of a BVI holding company and nominees, holding assets on trust for the defendants personally). I reject Mr Fetisov’s evidence that the reference in section 3 of SMP’s letter to an <span style="font-style:italic">“orphan trust” </span>structure to <span style="font-style:italic">“own Bank assets” </span> and his evidence that this represented  <span style="font-style:italic">“my general understanding how the assets of the Bank were supposed to be handled”</span> as it is simply inconsistent with all of the proposals in  the multiple structure charts and emails circulating previously, which refer to the use of an “<span style="font-style:italic">invisible</span>” BVI holding company RHT and nominees holding on trust for the Shareholders personally, and even more fundamentally, it is not consistent  with any of the structures subsequently put in place including by or through SMP, Boston or Vassiliades (see below). Equally the SMP “<span style="font-style:italic">orphan trust</span>” proposal involved the orphan status being achieved by the trust having a charitable beneficiary (not the Bank or Shareholders) with a real transfer of asset held by the Bank to the trust structure at full market value with a profit share agreement with the Bank so that the Bank had an economic interest. Quite clearly this is not what happened. </p>

All three Shareholders gave evidence that they did not specifically recall the meeting, but accepted based on the documents that it was likely that it took place. Mr Belyaev claimed that no specific assets would have been discussed and that the meeting would have been no more than a general theoretical discussion of how the Shareholders could hold their assets and business. I am satisfied that all three Shareholders did attend the meeting in London and that there was discussion of assets (even if not at the level of specific assets) and how the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Shareholders</span> would benefit from income generated by the companies, and that the Shareholders are seeking to downplay their knowledge of what was discussed, and envisaged, at that meeting.   </p>

It is the ultimate beneficiary who receives dividends and the structure that is being contemplated (as I am satisfied each of the Shareholders must have known from attendance at the meeting and what was discussed) envisages the Shareholders themselves being the beneficiaries, and thus the true ultimate beneficial owners of the companies concerned (in contrast to the Shareholders’ case). Once again there is no distinction between “Bank Companies” and “Shareholder Companies” – it is envisaged that all benefits would go to the Shareholders’ personally as is reflected under the headings “Nominee Company” / “Discretionary Isle of Man Trusts x3”: </p>

As is apparent from a structure chart produced by Mr Iskandyrov around August 2010, Mr Worsley held a number of companies through Beauduc Capital, of which he was the nominee UBO. It appears the plan at that stage was for Beauduc Capital to execute a trust deed in favour of RHT Management, which the chart shows was held by the Shareholders personally. Mr Schildbach, who worked for Trusban, sent an email to Mr Worsley on 25 August 2010 attaching an engagement letter dated 29 July 2010 which was to be signed by the beneficiaries of the companies. </p>

In particular, on 29 July 2010, Chrysanthou &amp; Chrysanthou sent an engagement letter to Willow River, Moscow River and Black Coast which had been recently incorporated. On the Shareholders’ case, the first two companies were “Personal Companies” whereas Black Coast was a “Bank Company”. No distinction is drawn in the letter between the companies or their ownership and the “Beneficiaries” are defined as “The persons whose names and details appear on the Schedule 2 hereto” – namely the three Shareholders (with their shareholdings in the usual amounts handwritten in). The document itself is stated to be “Approved” by the three Shareholders who have each signed under their name. </p>

It defies belief that this was all Mr Worsley off on a frolic of his own under some fundamental misunderstanding as to what was required of him by the Shareholders, or indeed that the Shareholders would not have been aware had Mr Worsley been proceeding under some fundamental misunderstanding (which I am satisfied he was not).

I do not consider that such argument bears examination or is logical. First, the Shareholders are quite clearly signing as “beneficial owners” and there is no suggestion that they are signing on behalf of the Bank. Second, the Shareholders are not the only shareholders of the Bank, and so it would be neither appropriate nor rationale for them to sign personally on behalf of the Bank, as if they were. Third, a number of the companies are, indeed, avowedly admitted Shareholder Companies, such as RCP and SiberianKD and the Shareholders are (indisputably) the beneficial owners. Fourth, and fundamentally, the letters to Vassiliades were followed by Declarations of Trust over the shares in the companies in favour of the Shareholders personally (and not in favour of the Bank), but (tellingly) this was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not </span>done for the three companies that were subsidiaries of the Bank.  </p>

First, in this email, “Glukovo” (the name of the Stroyecologiya development) and “Siberian Timber” (a reference to Priangarskiy) are treated in precisely the same way and no distinction is made between them despite it now being alleged that one is a “Bank Company” whilst the other is admitted to be a “Personal Company” this being a further contemporary example of a lack of distinction between the two. Second, it is apparent, as Mr Yurov confirmed when cross-examined, that the same people were being used within the Bank to run both projects – a further illustration (like the yacht charters) of the Bank being utilised for the personal benefit of the Shareholders. </p>

They would therefore have been well aware that the structure adopted was one where they were the ultimate beneficial owners of all the companies. I am satisfied that they were so aware, and that the suggested distinction between Shareholder Companies and Bank Companies is a subsequent invention.  In this regard a meeting in London at Claridges on Tuesday 20 November between the Shareholders, Mr Worsley and Boston is of particular importance, as addressed below.  </p>

Instead, Boston travelled to London for a meeting at a conference room in Claridges the following day. What was discussed at this meeting is very much in issue. The Bank submits that it is plain that the recent changes in the offshore network would have been discussed (including bringing a large number of offshore companies under Arlingham, Brora, Gingerson and Serrinson) as well as proposed changes to the structure (including the transfer of further companies under the Boston Structure, and the transfer of the Defendants’ interest into personal discretionary trusts), which were actioned the very day after the meeting.  </p>

Mr Yurov could not recollect the offshore structures being discussed. I consider it defies belief that the changes to the offshore structures already made, and that were proposed to be made (which would have revealed the ownership structures in place and to be put in place) were not discussed on an occasion when the Shareholders had travelled to London, and Boston had also travelled to London for a meeting between the Shareholders, Boston and Mr Worsley. That would be a lot of effort for a “meet and greet” which is also belied by the fact that a conference room was hired for the purpose and Mr Worsley emailed Mr Buyanovsky on Tuesday evening stating that he was in London “<span style="font-style:italic">with YBF last two days</span>”.  </p>

In the usual way the cost of this meeting was met through the offshore network through Kuri Hills (and therefore as part of a loan to one of the companies in the offshore network). If (which is inherently unlikely) the meeting was only about personal trusts – then the Shareholders would also effectively, have been getting the Bank to pay for advice to them in their personal capacity. </p>

I also reject Mr Fetisov’s evidence that he was not aware of the function of the BVI companies to which beneficial ownership was transferred, and that he did not know such companies would hold their interests in the companies on trust for Arlingham and Brora. In accepting that with hindsight maybe he should have asked more questions of Mr Worsley I consider he was seeking to distance himself from what he actually knew.  It is to be inferred from the matters I have already identified that by this time (if not before) each of the Shareholders knew very well how the offshore network was structured and that it culminated in each of them being the beneficial owner of the companies concerned in their respective shares. </p>

He explained he had all of the nominees pre-sign instruments of transfer and letters to the trustees (which were safely stored in the UK), so as to transfer ownership to Dramcon, a company owned by Mr Worsley. He explained that if a nominee died, the company could be taken under Dramcon and re-assigned to a new nominee. He also explained that he had set up a company which Mr Grechishnikov owned, and had signed similar instruments of transfer and letters for Dramcon up to this company. Further, Mr Grechishnikov held a power of attorney over Dramcon. As Mr Worsley put it: <span style="font-style:italic">“If a nominee dies or goes rogue, we take the company under Dramcon.

By June 2014, Mr Worsley was informing Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov that by closing down the Moscow office <span style="font-style:italic">and “firing all other Moscow employees”</span> he had reduced the projected costs for 2015 down to €2.2 million.   </p>

This had potential tax advantages (as the companies would ostensibly not be controlled from Russia) but it also meant that the documentation was not readily available to the Russian authorities should enquiries be made. In this regard the documentary archives of the various companies were transferred from Moscow to Cyprus in late 2014.

Second, I consider it is no coincidence that discussions about the move into a trust took place around the same time that alleged “Bank Companies” were being transferred to Tactio and then ostensibly to BVI companies owned by nominee UBOs. Third, there are no written instructions supporting Mr Fetisov’s alleged distinction in terms of his instructions, and again no distinction drawn in the documentation between Bank Companies and Shareholder Companies in the documents at the time. Fourth, there must have been a discussion between Mr Worsley and Mr Fetisov as to the setting up of a discretionary trust and that discussion must have included a conversation about what companies were to be placed in that trust. Fifth, and as already noted, Mr Worsley would himself, despite running the offshore network for years have had to fail to observe the distinction (or pick it up at the time of the later structure charts). Sixth, the likelihood is (as addressed below together with the position in respect of Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev) that Mr Fetisov (and the other Shareholders) received and/or discussed the later structure charts making the position absolutely clear as to what was in the trusts. </p>

On 31 October 2013 Mr Worsley had another meeting with Boston at Claridge’s. The same day Boston wrote to Mr Worsley summarising the meeting and indicating that they looked forward to hearing from Mr Worsley should the settlors (that is, Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev) wish to proceed with Isle of Man trusts. In this regard Boston stated amongst other matters: </p>

The diagram contained a list of companies underneath Arlingham, Brora, Gingerson and Serrinson, including a number of Disputed Companies and BVI companies with nominee UBOs (which in turn held Disputed Companies). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It follows, therefore, that Mr Worsley would have seen precisely what was in the structure and would have understood what was in Mr Fetisov’s discretionary trust and what was proposed would be within Mr Yurov’s and Mr Belyaev’s discretionary trusts. It is inconceivable, in my view, that Mr Worsley would not have spoken out at this point if there had been some distinction between “Bank Companies” and “Shareholder Companies” as it was clear that no such distinction was being observed. This is a yet further contemporary document showing that in fact there was no such distinction. </p>

The email provided “<span style="font-style:italic">This will apply to their Bank holdings, and also to their holdings in the companies (via Arlingham/Brora etc)”. </span> Again I consider it inconceivable that Mr Worsley would have said this unless he had discussed the transfer into trusts with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev. The question therefore arises as to what was discussed. The Bank submits that it is very likely, given that Mr Worsley had very recently received associated structure charts from Boston and must have been discussing matters with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev, that he would have shared the charts with them and/or showed them and/or discussed them with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev. Mr Stanley, on behalf of Mr Yurov, asks whether this necessarily follows – would Mr Worsley necessarily have gone through the structure diagrams and associated companies with them?</p>

It is difficult to see why he would say this unless he had discussed this with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev – that is the obvious inference from him giving such instruction. Secondly, Mr Worsley had put his mind to what was included and he knew perfectly well what companies were in the structure via Arlingham and Brora. Thirdly, he could hardly have given such a specific instruction unless he had discussed matters in that level of detail with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev. Fourthly, it was the obvious thing to do – the obvious question to Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev would have been – what do you want transferred into the discretionary trusts - which would have led to a discussion and ultimately a decision/instruction which must have included <span style="font-style:italic">“their holdings in the companies (via Arlingham/Brora)”. </span></p>

By Declarations of Trust dated 5 March 2014, Boston Nominees confirmed that they held 4,285.714 shares in both Arlingham and Brora on trust for Watling Limited as trustees of the Watling Trust.   I reject Mr Yurov’s evidence that he did not know what assets were owned by or through Arlingham and Brora as well as the suggestion (for which no reason was provided) that he thought that they only held Willow River/RCP and other “Personal Companies”.

The latter (somewhat fanciful) suggestion is without any evidential foundation and has something of an air of desperation about it. I have no hesitation in rejecting it.

It is also notable that not only did the Shareholders set up these discretionary trusts with the assistance of Mr Worsley, they also appointed him as the “Protector” of the trusts (through further companies owned by him, such as Herne Consulting). Not only is this a reason why Mr Worsley would surely have ensured that the right assets were transferred into the trusts, it also suggests (contrary to certain suggestions made by the Shareholders in evidence) that they still trusted Mr Worsley and most certainly did not regard him as a “loose cannon” or someone off on a frolic of his own. </p>

What was characterised in the Bank’s Written Closing as “cherry-picking of profitable companies” though perhaps more accurately characterised as reverse cherry-picking, or rather there was a duff with some plums in it and when the collapse of the Bank was on the cards the Shareholders chose to take the plums and leave the duff. </p>

In particular, there were discussions between the Shareholders and Mr Worsley at that stage as to what would happen in the case of the Bank’s collapse or a change or control (referred to in euphemistic terms as a “corporate event”, but the point being a scenario where the Shareholders would no longer own the Bank). The obvious matter that would arise is that any change of ownership would result in the Bank itself having new shareholders but the Shareholders would personally own and control all of the Bank’s largest corporate borrowers – and this depended on large amounts of money being made available to them to service their loans and avoid defaults. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Accordingly, what is being proposed by Mr Worsley is that if there is change of control at the Bank, the Shareholders would take Willow River/RCP, and any other “cashflow positive assets” that are worth saving, and abandon the rest of the companies such that they would inevitably default on their loans and go bankrupt, thereby saving the costs of running them. This is what did indeed happen. The distinguishing feature that Mr Worsley is identifying is not that there are “Shareholder Companies” in contra-distinction to “Bank Companies” but rather that particular companies were profitable and worth saving whereas other companies were not. This, therefore, appears to be the genesis of the idea to create a distinction between two categories: one owned by the Shareholders (the cash positive assets) and everything else to be cast adrift (and much later in time to be characterised as “Bank Companies”). Such an approach, of course, has regard only to the interests of the Shareholders and does not have regard to the interests of the Bank itself or for that matter its depositors or employees (or indeed the wider interest of the Russian taxpayer).   </p>

Those that had not included Willow River, RCP and Priangarskiy but also Yaposha (City and Investments) and Filenta. However, NRT, which owned Yaposha City, was in deficit, and the evidence is that by the time of the collapse of the Bank in December 2014, Yaposha Investments could not service the interest on its debts, whilst by that time Filenta had exchanged the building at 5 Spartakovskaya Street for shares in the Bank (at that time of no value) with the result these would not be worth keeping – they were to be labelled </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Yurov’s evidence is that in November 2014 he started negotiating a possible sale of the Bank with the major shareholders of Otkritie - Mr Aganbegyan and Mr Vadim Belyaev (no relation to the Second Defendant). Mr Yurov says he was told by them that they were in a position to buy the Bank and that, due to their close connections to the Russian financial authorities, they could structure this through the CBR’s financial rehabilitation programme (known as “sanation”). Mr Yurov claims that an agreement was reached between him (acting on behalf of all the Shareholders) and Mr Aganbegyan and Mr Vadim Belyaev at a meeting in early December 2014 (“the Oral Agreement”). The agreement was that Otkritie would purchase the Bank, paying US$10 million upon the formal appointment of Otkritie to the Bank’s administration, and a further US$40 within 12 months. </p>

He claims that in the days after the meeting, the Bank opened its books to Otkritie, including the off-balance sheet structure. Following this, text messages were exchanged about recording the agreement. It was agreed that the Oral Agreement would not be put in writing. In this regard there was a text message he sent to Mr Aganbegyan on 29 December 2014 which provided: </p>

Otkritie assisted the temporary administration of the Bank and worked on the Bank’s rehabilitation plan. Work was carried out by Ms Dolenko and Mr Popkov, who were Otkritie employees. On 13 January 2015 Ms Dolenko resigned from Otkritie and was appointed as the temporary administrator of the Bank as has already been noted.

For their part the Shareholders contend that the distinction drawn between Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 reflects a distinction between Bank Companies (which would be transferred to the Bank/Otkritie) and Shareholder Companies (which would not be transferred). In particular, Mr Belyaev’s evidence was that the appendices refer to different types of company: (1) Bank Companies (i.e. companies owned and controlled by the Bank and holding the Bank’s assets) which were to be transferred to Otkritie; (2) companies in which the Shareholders had a personal interest which were not to be transferred to Otkritie, subject to the proper servicing of any debt; and (3) companies owned personally by Mr Belyaev, which were not related to the Bank and had not received any loans from it. </p>

They say this supports the idea that the Bank ultimately controlled the companies, which were used for its own benefit. The Bank contends that the discussions relating to the transfer of the offshore companies were premised on the idea that the companies needed to be transferred in the first place. In other words, if the companies were Bank Companies all along, there was no need for them to be transferred. By way of riposte the Shareholders say that this analysis is pedantic. The notion of “transfer” does not imply any admission that the Shareholders had a personal interest in those companies, but simply that Otkritie or the Bank needed practical assistance to acquire operational control of them. </p>

It is notable that it was drafted with the assistance of the Bank’s English solicitors, as is apparent from the footer which bears the reference of Mr Neil Dooley, then as now the solicitor with conduct of the matter. It would certainly reflect an English law viewpoint of the matter i.e. directors of a company dishonestly diverting the Bank’s assets into companies they controlled with the result that the assets would be owned by the Bank however matters were structured.

It would be truly incredible, and defies belief, that documentation evidencing such distinction would not exist, and indeed be legion, had there been any such distinction. The answer is that there clearly was no distinction. I address below the absence of such documentation, as well as the ignorance of those running the offshore network.

I focus below on the absence of documentation involving those managing the companies, who do not draw such a distinction, which tells the lie to any distinction being “widely known in the Bank”, though the explanation for this is, I am satisfied, that there was no such distinction (rather than it not being widely known). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">Before doing so I note that there would appear to have been some “creep” in terms of what companies are said to be Shareholder Companies. If there was such a distinction then the relevant companies should always have been capable of precise articulation, and should not change over time.  In his Second Affidavit Mr Yurov swore that, <span style="font-style:italic">“…I have never considered myself to be and do not consider myself to be, entitled to the benefit of the companies that are part of this offshore network, which I always understood were – however they were held – for the Bank…. The only exception to this is in respect of a small number of companies (Willow River, RCP, SiberianKD and associated companies)…”</span>  (paragraph 38) and <span style="font-style:italic">“The shares in Willow River, RCP and SiberianKD (and associated companies) are, as far as I am aware, the only assets of my own which are held in this complex offshore structure” </span>(paragraph 164).  No mention is made of Moscow River or Taransay. These are companies through which the Shareholders received personal benefits. That is no doubt why they are now admitted by Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov to be owned by and for the benefit of Shareholders.  No explanation has been proffered, however, as to why, if there was this clear distinction, they were not initially identified as such. </p>

It would have been essential for there to be clarity as to who exactly owned and controlled, and was entitled to direct and receive the benefits from, each of the Projects and for any such distinction to be spelt out clearly in writing. In this regard, for example, it was Mr Nazarov who arranged for cash to be taken from WR and RCP (via the management company Alians Development) which ended up in the Shareholders’ own Swiss bank accounts.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">I have already addressed in Section C.3.2 the reasons why I am satisfied that what was stated (supported by a Statement of Truth) was demonstrably untrue (as was what he stated at paragraph 94.1 of his Defence (again supported by a Statement of Truth)).  There are numerous contemporary documents either sent to, or copied to, Mr Belyaev which referred to the Borrowers, and as addressed above I do not accept his evidence that he did not read emails sent to him – that evidence was not credible and was itself a lie.  The Schedules to the Particulars of Claim included Schedule F (Stivilon) and Schedules H, I and J (Priangarskiy, Business Group and SiberianKD). Mr Belyaev accepted when crossexamined that when he saw the Particulars of Claim (to which his Defence was responding) he recognised the name Stivilon, knew that Stivilon was one of the Bank’s biggest customers and that it was a company where the Bank had a direct investment. Accordingly, in relation to Stivilon, it was simply untrue for him to say that he did not recognise the names of the Borrowers when he pleaded his Defence, as he recognised the name of Stivilon when he saw the Particulars of Claim (to which the Defence was responding). The reality, I have no doubt, is that Mr Belyaev was well aware of the name Stivilon at all material times. In any event what he said in the Defence (supported by a statement of truth) about being <span style="font-style:italic">“entirely unaware”</span> that he had <span style="font-style:italic">“any interest whether ultimate or otherwise</span>” in Priangarskiy, Business Group and SiberianKD is demonstrably untrue as there is contemporary documentation referring to these entities provided to Mr Belyaev from which he clearly knew the names of these entities and was aware of an interest in them, as has already been addressed in Section C.3.2. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">As for evidence in relation to signing of documents his evidence was even less credible. Mr Belyaev signed various documents declaring him to be one of the beneficial owners of companies in the offshore network. His signature upon such documents is, selfevidently, unhelpful to his denial of knowledge of the offshore network, his denial as to the use of that network in “balance sheet management” and his denial of a personal interest in the offshore companies, as such signatures (at least at first blush) fix him with knowledge of the contents of those documents.  When asked about this he claimed not to have read what he was signing in particular cases. Indeed, in the context of “<span style="font-style:italic">regulatory</span>” documents and “<span style="font-style:italic">anything to do with indemnifying</span>”, he went as far as to suggest that it was his practice not to read documents of such types. This evidence was not credible and if true (which I am satisfied it was not) would be a serious dereliction of duty of a director of a Russian company under Russian law. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">As already noted, the impression I formed was that Mr Belyaev was not willing to admit anything unless he had no choice but to do so – and that he resorted to denying he had read documents or read what he was signing, if the admission he had done so would have been adverse to his interests. Still further, if he did not like the content of a document he would attempt to belittle the content or its relevance. The most egregious example of this related to the document sent by Mr Yurov to Mr Belyaev and Mr Fetisov on 28 June 2015 in which a decision being made in 2008 to start submitting false (or as Mr Belyaev would have the translation “unreliable”) accounts to the CBR. This is, on any view, an admission of obvious impropriety. If such a decision was not made, or Mr Belyaev was not party to it, the obvious response would be for him to reply either saying it was not true, or (if he had not been aware of it) expressing shock and surprise at such impropriety. He did neither, and when cross-examined about this he had no answer, resorting to describing a communication from his fellow Shareholder, in the form of Mr Yurov, as “garbage”. The obvious inference (which I draw) is that Mr Belyaev did not respond to Mr Yurov’s memo because he knew perfectly well that the memo contained the truth, and that he was (contrary to his denial) party to that decision. Yet further, if he genuinely regarded it as “garbage” one would have expected him to engage with his fellow shareholder upon it.  His evidence in this regard, as already addressed in Section C.3.2, was not credible. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">In addition when questioned, and rather than answering questions as to his knowledge of the offshore network he obfuscated asking for a definition of the “offshore network” when he knew perfectly well what that meant, was particularly coy about even referring to companies in the  “offshore network” choosing instead to use the term “SPV” for such a company which was neither apposite (given that SPVs are neither necessarily offshore nor necessarily off-balance sheet) nor a term that features heavily in the contemporary correspondence and denying knowledge of “balance sheet management”, whilst being equally evasive in relation to his knowledge of the Bank lending to companies set up or controlled by Mr Worsley.   His very keenness in, and evasiveness in, not admitting any knowledge of balance sheet management, or Bank lending to companies set up or controlled by Mr Worsley begs the question why this was the case, being similarly evasive about the various documents he signed declaring him to be one of the beneficial owners of companies in the offshore network.  I am satisfied that the reason he was lying as to not reading documents he signed and not reading emails he was being sent which revealed the use of the offshore network and balance sheet management was precisely because he knew about balance sheet management and the use of the offshore network but was prepared to lie rather than admit he had such knowledge, given that it was adverse to his interest to do so. </p>

I have already referred, more than once, to the very telling email from Mr Worsley to Mr Belyaev alone (to his private email address) dated 19 December 2012, when balance sheet management was in full swing with a network of offshore companies set up or controlled by Mr Worsley, which shows that Mr Belyaev knew very well what was being done by Mr Worsley in relation to an offshore network for balance sheet management with fake nominee UBOs and the like, it providing: </p>

Mr Belyaev did not respond asking what Mr Worsley was talking about. I am satisfied that Mr Belyaev (contrary to his evidence) knew perfectly well about the offshore network, and its use for balance sheet management (as well as the ultimate beneficial ownership in the Shareholders – as reflected in the numerous documents signed by Mr Belyaev declaring him to be one of the beneficial owners of companies in the offshore network).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">In addition to Mr Belyaev’s involvement in contemporary documents and events, as there evidenced, there are also numerous general matters which further support the conclusions I have reached as to Mr Belyaev’s knowledge. Many of these are (in my view rightly) highlighted by the Bank in paragraph 245 of the Bank’s Closing Submissions.   First, and perhaps foremost, is the fact that Mr Belyaev was one of the three major shareholders in the Bank, and one of the three directing minds and controllers of the Bank (as specifically recorded in each of the Bank’s audited IFRS accounts). Much of the relevant documentation was sent to all three Shareholders without discrimination or distinction. It defies belief that he was not aware of the “balance sheet management” and use of the offshore companies as a result (as evidenced by the admitted knowledge of the other two main shareholders Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov). Second, throughout the relevant period, Mr Belyaev was a member, with Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov, of both the Bank’s Supervisory Board and its Credit Committee (on the latter of which also sat Mr Postnov and Mr Vartsibasov who, as the Bank rightly points out, had detailed knowledge of the offshore network and “balance sheet management” activity). Third, and even to the extent that he did step back from day-to-day management of the Bank after the financial crisis of 2008 he remained one of the Bank’s three major shareholders and the business of the Bank, the state of its finances, the way it was run, and the prospects of its future success (and his financial returns from it) self-evidently would have remained of major importance to him, and the “balance sheet management” was integral to the continuance of the Bank and the associated benefit to the Shareholders. Fourth, in any event he was a recipient of Mr Drozdov’s structure charts in 2008 (as already addressed) from which he would have been aware of the companies in the offshore network including Yaposha. Fifth, it defies belief that he was not aware of the decision to falsify the Bank’s accounts (to avoid intervention by the CBR) – and his lack of response to Mr Yurov’s June 2015 email evidences that he had such knowledge. Sixth, any significant shareholder, a fortiori a Supervisory Board Director and CC member would have known (and would have made sure that they knew) about major projects financed by the Bank including Gelendzhik, Glukhovo and the Yaposha group which were consuming huge amounts of money. Seventh, and a fortiori, Mr Belyaev would have taken a particular interest in how projects that he admits to having an interest in were structured and controlled, and how any profit they made was or would be paid to him. The relevant companies, namely Willow River and RCP, Moscow River, Taransay and Priangarskiy/Business Group/SiberianKD were </p>

Finally, I agree that the recruitment of Mr Worsley, and virtually every communication Mr Belyaev had with him, and with the other Shareholders about him and what he  was doing, from December 2009 onwards is inexplicable unless Mr Belyaev knew what Mr Worsley was doing in relation to the offshore structure and for what purpose (given the contemporary correspondence identified above in which Mr Worsley kept Mr Belyaev (as well as the other Shareholders) fully informed about the offshore network of companies).  </p>

I infer that he, like Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov, lied to hide the truth, which is in any event amply corroborated by the contemporary documents identified above, namely that the Shareholders were the ultimate beneficial owners of all of the Borrowers and that they controlled and used all the companies for their own personal benefit, Mr Belyaev not being distinguishable, in this regard, from Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov.  </p>

There was also a significant risk that various rights (such as land/ development rights) would have been forfeit if the Bank had enforced against the original borrowers and put them into bankruptcy, destroying the value of those borrowers. In such circumstances, its recoveries would have been negligible. Using the offshore structure created the possibility of trading through - in the expectation that the projects would be completed and the market would recover”. </p>

As the Shareholders themselves accept, they were, prior to the financial crisis, the beneficial owners of the Siberian timber project (which was or came to be held through Priangarskiy, Business Group and SiberianKD). Their interests in Yaposha also pre-dated the financial crisis and there is no evidence that there was any “taking over” of any assets of Yaposha due to prior lending being in default or the loans distressed. Similarly, the various other Moscow real estate projects, such as the Bank’s own building, were not previously held as collateral for lending that was taken over in the financial crisis. Equally (and self-evidently) those companies which were what have been referred to as “pure balance sheet management” companies such as Erinskay and Baymore are not examples either not least because they were not linked to any underlying business venture at all (whether pre or post the 2008 financial crisis).  </p>

In this regard the evidence is that between 2006 and 2014 (when the Bank collapsed) the Shareholders received more than US$140 million via payments of salaries and bonuses from the Bank and dividends from Bank-funded companies (on the basis of the lack of distinction between Bank Companies and Shareholder Companies).  The reality, as perceptively identified by Ernst &amp; Young when they undertake their own audit of the Bank’s books in 2009, was that the Bank was in fact bankrolling the Shareholders own projects on a massive scale (noting, for, example, that “<span style="font-style:italic">about 50% of the Bank’s assets are loans granted to companies of the Bank’s shareholders for implementation of their projects”</span>). </p>

When questioned, Mr Yurov referred (in the most general of terms) to technical defaults on certain loans (such as missed interest payments), but, as the Bank points out, this does not mean that such loans were worthless – rather that greater provision would have been required by the Russian banking regulations, which is, no doubt, the very reason why the Shareholders hit upon “balance sheet management” to avoid recognition of liabilities - as most graphically recognised in Mr Yurov’s June 2015 memo but also admitted and maintained in Mr Yurov’s oral evidence  (see in particular Day 16/103:15 to Day 16/104:1 as quoted in due course below in relation to Issue 16 in Section G.3).

As the Bank points out, that was, in itself, a significantly greater sum than the size of the Bank’s entire<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>corporate loan portfolio in 2008 (c. RUB 24.8 billion).  As at 31 December 2013, the Bank’s total reported capital was just RUB 17.5 billion. Hence, as the Bank rightly says, this was not a “closed loop” in which a fixed amount of money was recycled round and round in a series of loans, with the hole in the balance sheet at the end of the process being the same as an original “loss” at the start. </p>

In this regard, the size of retail deposits was not matched by the size of the retail loan book. Mr Allen’s Appendix 5a shows that the customer deposits were consistently <span style="text-decoration:underline">larger</span> than the (growing) retail loan portfolio: <span style="font-style:italic">e.g.</span>, customer deposits in 2012 were RUB 142.5 billion, whereas the retail loan portfolio was only RUB 98.1 billion.

This caused the Bank (now merged into one) considerable difficulties (as it did for all other banks in Russia and elsewhere). In particular (i) there were large numbers of defaults from 2008 onwards on corporate and personal loans that had previously been made; and (ii) the Bank suffered heavy losses from the fall in the value of Russian securities in 2008, and again in 2014. The Bank also suffered as result of the fall in the Russian Rouble, in particular in 2014. In addition, in 2009 the Russian courts found the Bank liable to Rosneft for US$75 million (the claim arose out of a previous transaction entered into by the Bank on behalf of Yukos), which further reduced the Bank's capital. I estimate that between 2008 and 2012, the Bank lost around US$70 million in total, which was around a quarter of the share capital.  </p>

Accordingly, the Bank's ability to lend was greatly reduced by any fall in capital. This was compounded by the fact that the Bank was unable to raise additional capital by issuing further shares, because its shares were frozen. </p>

I address in Section F.2.6 why this was not about correcting a mistake (as claimed by the Shareholders) but about the production of false back-dated documentation purporting to show that such a sale had taken place when it had not, and why it is not credible to suggest that the Shareholders did not read the email and were not aware of what was contemplated. Once again the position of Mr Belyaev is no different either in terms of his signing of documentation in relation to the offshore network including the use of individuals as false UBOs who had no involvement with the companies and most certainly were not active investors, as evidenced by Mr Worsley’s email to Mr Belyaev dated 19 December 2012 (addressed in Section C.3.2 above).  </p>

Equally, in the context of the transfer of companies from Totalserve to Vassiliades as addressed in Section F.2.5.5 above, the Shareholders personally signed instruction letters for all of the companies to be transferred, representing themselves as the beneficial owners of these companies (and most certainly not on behalf of the Bank, as there addressed), many of those companies being avowedly admitted to be Shareholder Companies (and Declarations of Trust over the shares in the companies in favour of the Shareholders personally were signed).  In any event, what was done was not “<span style="font-style:italic">a reasonable reflection of reality</span>” (another submission made on behalf of Mr Yurov) as the Shareholders are not the only shareholders of the Bank, and so it would be neither appropriate, nor rational, for them to sign personally on behalf of the Bank, as if they were. </p>

It is readily apparent, as it would have been readily apparent to Mr Yurov and the other Shareholders, that what was being done was deceptive with a web of offshore companies and false UBOs concealing the Shareholders’ ultimate beneficial ownership. I am satisfied that Mr Yurov knew perfectly well that legitimate ways were not being used to achieve the purposes of the off  balance sheet network – as evidenced by his June 2015 memo with its acknowledgment of false accounts and commission of offences (on any view wrongdoing whatever the precise translation) quite apart from the deceptions inherent in the creation and maintenance of the offshore network leading through to the Shareholders’ ultimate beneficial ownership.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Yurov says his characterisation of the background to the Loans and Transactions (which I have rejected) is supported by four sources of evidence. First, Mr Yurov’s and Mr Fetisov’s evidence. I have already addressed why their evidence in this regard does not accurately reflect the factual position – the only potential pre-existing distressed assets that could fit Mr Yurov’s description related to Stivilon and StroyEcologiya. Second, the establishment of the Distressed Asset Group within the Bank. Whilst there were no doubt (at a level of generality) distressed assets following the financial crisis in 2008, neither the very existence of the Distressed Asset Group, nor anything it did, provides any justification for the use of “balance sheet management” as it was in fact carried out. Once again it is to be noted that it was stated in the Bank’s own audited accounts for 2009 (signed by Mr Fetisov), that <span style="font-style:italic">“During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group did not obtain any assets by taking control of collateral accepted as security for loans to legal entities (31 December 2008:nil)”.</span> Third, reliance is placed on Mr Iskandyrov’s evidence about discussion concerning distressed assets, and his evidence that, <span style="font-style:italic">“These [balance sheet management] schemes were required after the financial crisis of 2008 in order to ensure that the balance sheet ratios submitted by the Bank to the CBRF continued to comply to the…[CBRF] ratios and metrics…”   </span>However, this is again an assertion with a high level of generality, and it is also indisputable that Mr Iskandyrov was implicated in “balance sheet management” himself. As I have already noted in Section C.2.3, I consider that Mr Iskandyrov under-played his involvement in relation to the offshore network, and was very much involved in what forms the subject matter of the Bank’s criticism of the conduct of the Shareholders (and so is himself subject to that same criticism). In any event there is nothing here that grapples with the propriety or appropriateness of balance sheet management and what was being done in relation to the accounts and contact with the CBR. Fourth, reliance is placed on explanations of Mr Yurov in correspondence in December 2014 and May 2015 to the effect that the Bank was issuing loans with the aim of salvaging the value of pre-crisis loans and investments, but such correspondence (essentially at the end of events) is again at a high level of generality, and as already noted, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">First it is suggested that, <span style="font-style:italic">“It was obviously in the Bank’s best interests for it to continue to operate so long as there were reasonable prospects for its long-term survival and recovery”. </span>This suggestion at a banal level is unobjectionable. But it is not a justification for keeping the Bank alive through inappropriate “balance sheet management”, through deceiving the CBR or for inappropriate and non-commercial lending through an opaque network of offshore companies through to the ultimate beneficial ownership of the Shareholders. Nor is it a matter of whether the Bank was or was not insolvent in the context of Issue 16. What is in issue is whether the Shareholders acted in good faith, reasonably and in the best interests of the Bank in performing their duties in the context of “balance sheet management”.   It is worth recognising, once again, that it is not in the best interest of the Bank to act in a way that is either illegal or which gives rise to a risk of it having its banking licence withdrawn. Indeed (as also already noted) Mr Yurov rightly acknowledges that he “<span style="font-style:italic">must accept that if ‘balance sheet management’ involves known illegality then it would not be something that a reasonable director would have pursued”</span>.  To do that which would result in an administrative offence is not to exploit loopholes for a company, nor does it justify falsifying accounts, rather it is to do something which is not in the best interests of a company and should not have been done. This assertion in any event goes to an aspect of the case in relation to the accounts and the CBR, it is no answer in relation to the lending through the myriad of offshore companies for the ultimate benefit of the Shareholders. In the present case the end was no more legitimate than the means. Nor can it be said that there was no real risk of loss – monies were being lent to companies without any proper due diligence or disclosure of interest, and in many cases without any or any sufficient security, as addressed in Section R in relation to the Loans and Transactions.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">There are a number of preliminary points to make about this submission. First, so far as “balance sheet management” is concerned, the central issue is whether, in relation to balance sheet management the Shareholders breached their duties to act in the Bank’s best interests and exercised their rights and performed their duties with respect to the Bank in a bona fide and reasonable manner. This does not just depend on “impropriety” or “dishonesty” – as already stressed these duties can be breached without impropriety or dishonesty (though on the facts, and for the reasons I give in this judgment) I am satisfied </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">that “balance sheet management” (as carried out), was (to the knowledge of the Shareholders) both improper and dishonest.  Second, and accordingly, whilst the nature of any impropriety may be relevant to breach of duty and the seriousness of any breach it does not follow that the intended objective of any impropriety determines whether there was any breach of duty – conceptually one or more of the Shareholders could even have believed what they were doing was in the best interests of the Bank, but it does not follow that what was done <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> in the best interest of the Bank. Third, it does not necessarily follow that (if it be the case) the Bank was an active, knowing and willing participant in what was being done that what was done was in the Bank’s best interest or that this would prevent the Shareholders being in breach of duty. Fourth, I am satisfied that what was done by way of balance sheet management was not reasonable and was not in the Bank’s best interests. That does not depend on impropriety or dishonesty. However, as I have found it did involve impropriety and dishonesty on the facts of this case. Accordingly even if the fundamental premise of Mr Yurov’s case had been made out, Mr Yurov and the other Shareholders would still be in breach of duty and liable for loss caused by their breach of duty. Fifth if (as I am satisfied is the case) the CBR, auditors, and ultimately, the depositors were deceived then that does go to impropriety and dishonesty as it is improper and dishonest to deceive such bodies - it is also not in the best interests of the Bank to do so. </p>

The second is that the various schemes were run with the active involvement of senior managers in the Bank which is true, but it does not follow that they participated  because it was generally understood at the time that such arrangements were lawful and acceptable – the premise is itself false – such arrangements were clearly not lawful (as again recognised by Mr </p>

As to the sixth point, whether or not the use of off balance sheet companies was a very common practice among Russian banks – it does not follow that it was in the best interest of a bank to do so, not least given the risk of the revocation of its banking licence. In any event the allegations of breach of duty go beyond the regulatory perspective, and extend to the massive amount of lending to companies beneficially owned by the Shareholders without any proper scrutiny or disclosure, which was not in the best interest of the Bank. The seventh point that nonRussian banks such as Bank Winter sold products such as fiduciary lending does not necessarily mean that such lending was acceptable from a regulatory perspective, and in any event, once again this point goes only to the regulatory aspect. </p>

This aspect is addressed in Section R (and also Section N in terms of loss).  However, under Issue 16, the Shareholders (and Mr Fetisov in particular) deny generally that “balance sheet management” caused financial loss to the Bank (and as such submit it was not wrongful), as it is said that the granting of a loan did not worsen the Bank’s financial position.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">The first example given by Mr Fetisov is a situation where the Bank is owed money under defaulted CLNs and rather than enforcing in a bad market and suffering a large loss it buys out the underlying business/assets using an off-balance sheet company and makes a direct loan to its company thereby repaying the CLNs. In doing so the Bank has replaced non-performing securities on the balance sheet with what is characterised as a performing loan, it being said that the financial position is the same as it was –with the Bank remaining exposed to the performance of the business/assets and that the cash it has paid out will have returned to the Bank by way of the discharge of the previous CLNs. Quite apart from the fact that there will have been costs involved (including the costs of administering the company and/or funding its further development) it has not been proved that this is, in fact what happened (i.e. any direct link between a defaulted CLN and the new loan), whilst in relation to the new borrowers they provided little or no security for the loans and had no genuine or legitimate commercial business to generate funds to make repayment (as addressed in Section R below) – so the making of those loans did result in loss being suffered, as addressed in Section N below. In this regard each loan should have been considered on its own merits and stands to be considered on its own merits. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">The second example given on behalf of Mr Fetisov is the Bank providing funds to companies in the off-balance sheet structure by making a loan to company X which has fallen due for repayment and the Bank lends money to company Y, which transfers the money to company X, which then repays its loan. It is said that the Bank has suffered no financial loss as the money will have returned to the Bank and the debtor has simply been changed from one off-balance sheet company to another.  Quite apart from the Shareholders having been unable to prove all the links within the chain (the reality is far more complicated than this simplistic example), this example ignores all the other reasons that have already been addressed as to why “balance sheet management” is inappropriate, why each of the loans should not have been made and why it was not in the interests of the Bank to do so, the fact that more and more (larger loans) are needed to service interest and principal (in each case to companies where lending was neither justifiable nor justified), and the fact that at some point (as occurred) the music stops and the Bank faces a mass of defaulted loans. The Bank’s actual loss is addressed in Section N below.  I am satisfied that this is another reason why “balance sheet management” is not reasonable, or in the best interests of the Bank, and is in fact not in good faith and dishonest, as it not only exposes the Bank to the risk of financial loss, but actually results in financial loss to the Bank. </p>

It was not undertaken in an effort to restructure non-performing loans on the Bank’s books (the same not having been shown), nor did it involve arm’s length borrowers. Its purpose was not for the Bank to take over underlying assets/collateral for its own benefit through off-balance sheet structures so as to salvage the maximum value from any such failed loans/investments or with the aim of avoiding or reducing the risk of greater losses to the Bank – such lending did not fit that bill, nor were the loans properly considered and addressed, and in any event  it was ultimately for the Shareholders’ benefit. Nor was “balance sheet management” properly used to undertake (necessary) treasury activities or for holding and developing interests in real estate investments; or to avoid the immediate crystallisation of substantial losses or to avoid the Bank’s funders enforcing against failed investments and/or for holding and collecting in underperforming retail loans (all as alleged by the Shareholders). </p>

The reason for this is that much of the Shareholders’ riposte to whether they caused, procured or agreed the Loans and Transactions or deliberately or recklessly acquiesced in and failed to question or prevent the making of each of the Loans and Transactions is to the effect that the Loans and Transactions were arranged by the Bank’s management, and managed by the Bank’s management, for the benefit of the Bank as part of “legitimate” “balance sheet management” for the benefit of the Bank. Thus, Mr Yurov (in submissions adopted by Mr Fetisov) submits that, <span style="font-style:italic">“The Loans and Transactions were arranged by the Bank’s management in order to enable the off  balance sheet network to perform the functions which the Bank required of it in the course of the Bank’s business.

The position is that these Loans and Transactions were for the benefit of the Shareholders, with the offshore network of companies being used (ultimately) to transfer assets into the Shareholders’ family trusts.

Unless what was taking place was simply a monumental, careless, dereliction of duty on the Shareholders’ part in approving loans without proper justification on a regular if not universal basis (which is not suggested by the Shareholders) the only reasonable explanation (and inference) for such approvals is that the Shareholders were personally causing and/or procuring and/or agreeing the Loans and Transactions, and for their own benefit.

Whilst his evidence in this regard is hardly consistent with the conduct of someone who was prepared to back-date and falsify documents or approve a loan seemingly unaccompanied by any materials (as addressed in Section E.1.3), if there is any grain of truth in Mr Yurov’s evidence he must have been aware of the Loans and Transactions and what they were for. </p>

In addition, I am also satisfied that the reason why the Shareholders rely upon the involvement of other Bank employees or directors, namely to submit that because others in the Bank were aware of the use of “balance sheet management” (whatever precise meaning may be ascribed to that by the Shareholders) that shows that such activities either were, or were “generally understood” to be lawful and proper, is a false premise, and does not follow.  </p>

Second, Bank employees may well have breached their contracts and/or directors may have breached their duties, and acted dishonestly by reason of their involvement in “balance sheet management”. However, their knowledge is not attributable to the Bank, and does not in way exonerate, excuse, or diminish the Shareholders’ breaches of duty and/or dishonesty. Further, it would have been open to the Shareholders to have brought Part 20 proceedings against other wrongdoers (as both Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov did against Mr Worsley, before settling the same, and as Mr Yurov did against Mr Iskandyrov before abandoning the same). </p>

As the Bank identifies, the funds were made up principally (but not exclusively) of distributions from the single successful business venture, WR/RCP, which the Shareholders acquired (and later funded) with loans from the Bank (the Shareholders never invested any of their money - as Mr Fetisov admitted in evidence). The amounts received and the reason for certain receipts is in issue but it is not disputed that the Shareholders did receive personal benefits from WR/RCP as companies beneficially owned by the Shareholders, and it is agreed, for example, that Mr Yurov received US$7,348,000 in August 2011 into his personal account at Bordier in connection with WR/RCP (though Mr Yurov’s case is that this was a distribution of profit by dividend whilst the Bank submits (based on Mr </p>

Mr Popkov’s unchallenged evidence is that, in November 2010, the Shareholders used US$25 million of the funds lent to Moscow River by the Bank (following approval by the CC, chaired by Mr Yurov) to invest in a residential development, Barkli Plaza, near the Kremlin.  In June 2012, Moscow River sold the property at a profit. Under the loan agreement it was obliged to pay 10% of the sale proceeds to the Bank. In fact more than US$1 million was transferred to Kuri Hills (which was transmitted to the Shareholders’ accounts at Bordier) and US$9 million to Serpoint, a Shareholder company, of which US$8.65 million also ended up in the Shareholders’ Bordier accounts via Kuri Hills.  </p>

This is made all the more difficult by the labyrinthian network of offshore companies and the impossibility of following the track of the money in many cases with the result that the experts have had to make assumptions that may or may not be correct. In circumstances where the Bank does not bring a tracing claim and none of the claims depend on establishing the fact (still less ascertaining the precise routing and quantum) of any personal benefits I do not consider that there is any utility in addressing such matters further in this section in the context of personal benefits – as appears above there were undoubtedly personal benefits and the identification of yet further personal benefits does not advance any of the pleaded issues.

B.V. Taking into account the patent erroneous assumption that the Bank is a related party with the aforementioned borrowers, the first of the criteria used by the Working Group should be considered wrong. The second criterion can hardly be deemed substantiated – its application would imply a widespread ban on the Bank and its related parties and subsidiaries from concluding asset transactions with the residents of an entire country that is a member of the European Union and ranks first in terms of the volume of investments in Russia’s economy. Finally, the last of the aforementioned grounds looks particularly strange in light of the fact that the working group did not request information from the Bank during the audit regarding the ultimate beneficiaries of Crylani Trading Ltd. and Oldehove Trading Ltd.” </p>

Accordingly these statements were knowingly false when made. The obvious inference, which I draw, not least given the inherent improbability of Mr Pospelov taking such active steps to deceive the CBR without the knowledge, direction and approval of the Shareholders, is that this was all done, at the instigation of, and with the knowledge of the Shareholders, to conceal from the CBR their ownership of their “Personal Companies” that had borrowed very large sums from the Bank (and which in the case of Priangarskiy would continue to borrow very large sums from the Bank).

The CBR was always sceptical about the Bank management’s positive reports, because we never felt that we could trust Mr Yurov, who in his dealings with us acted non-cooperatively (refusing to provide complete and comprehensive information on the Bank’s activity and not taking into account the recommendations of the CBR). Those concerns were enhanced because, for example, as part of control over the implementation of two of the biggest projects being funded by NBT loans (the development in the Black Sea at Gelendzhik and the timber plant in Siberia) our local offices reported on rather slow progress with the developments in contrast to the reports of management of the Bank that the projects would generate income very soon.  </p>

It did not mention (but clearly should have mentioned) the admitted “Personal Companies” (Willow River, RCP, SiberianKD, Business Group, Priangarskiy, Taransay or Moscow River) nor any of the other Borrowers.

It is not disputed that these are all untrue statements. They are also untrue statements being made by Mr Pospelov, the Chairman of the Management Board, and Mr Yurov’s own case (as reflected in his Defence) is that Mr Pospelov was aware of the balance sheet management exercise and that the Shareholders’ interest in the “Personal Companies” was known to each of the CEOs at all material times. Accordingly these statements were knowingly false when made. The obvious inference, which I draw, not least given the inherent improbability of Mr Pospelov taking such active steps to deceive the CBR without the knowledge, direction and approval of the Shareholders, is that this was all done, at the instigation of, and with the knowledge of the Shareholders, to conceal from the CBR their ownership of their “Personal Companies” that had borrowed very large sums from the Bank (and which in the case of Priangarskiy would continue to borrow very large sums from the Bank). In this regard it is apparent, as I have found, that the Shareholders knew of the use of such (fake) UBOs, and the purpose of their use.</p>

The list of fake UBOs and associated false statements are identified at paragraph 144 of the Bank’s Closing Submissions and featured the likes of Mr Scheffel and Mr Worsley’s gardener.

That is so whether or not the CBR suspected what was going on, or indeed whether or not it was actually deceived. It is clear, however, not least from the contemporary documentary evidence, that the CBR was deceived – otherwise it would not have continued to seek the information it did, and the 2014 Audit Report would not have been in the terms it was (nor would it have been necessary for the Bank to continually provide false information when asked for information concerning ultimate beneficial ownership). </p>

The Shareholders’ case also lies uneasily with (if not is actually inconsistent with) Mr Yurov’s contemporary beliefs as set out in Mr Yurov’s June 2015 memorandum and in his Affidavit that if the CBR had known the actual position it would have revoked Bank’s licence (which is the very reason given for submitting false accounts in the first place). Finally, I would only add that much of the Shareholders’ submissions are based on the (false) premise that the offshore companies were Bank Companies (and presumably that the CBR knew this) when in fact, as I have found, they were Shareholder Companies, beneficially owned not by the Bank but by the Shareholders, something that on any view was concealed from the CBR, and the world, to the very end. </p>

The largest elements (identified on page 36) were “<span style="font-style:italic">Loans to large corporates</span>” (c. RUB 39 billion) and loans “<span style="font-style:italic">to individuals</span>”. As is apparent from Mr Zavadsky’s evidence, as at 31 December 2013, about RUB <span style="text-decoration:underline">40 billion</span> was outstanding from the companies owned by the Shareholders (including c. RUB 9 billion from companies the Shareholders now admit to owning such as Willow River/RCP). Pages 36-38 set out an appraisal of the quality of the loan portfolio, with the majority of corporate loans said to be “<span style="font-style:italic">Standard loans</span>”, defined as “<span style="font-style:italic">representing loans without any indicators of impairment and thus representing the best level of credit quality</span>”. The accounts recorded that: “<span style="font-style:italic">Included in loans to corporate customers as at 31 December 2013 are RUB 11 290ms of loans to </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">unrelated</span><span style="font-style:italic"> off-shore companies for the purpose of buying and selling securities…</span>” (emphasis added).

As Mr Zavadsky explained, that figure did not include <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">any</span> loans to the Borrowers, only including transactions such as loans to TIB Holdings (i.e. one of the companies in the Bank’s own ownership structure, and a related-party transaction actually approved at the AGMs). The accounts identified the Bank’s subsidiaries. None of the Borrowers was identified as a Bank subsidiary, despite the Shareholders’ present case that they all were. It is common ground that the loans to Willow River and RCP were and remained at all times around US$110 million (at least RUB 3 billion), so it is impossible that the related-party lending figures in the accounts included these, or the other personal companies’ borrowings.</p>

In circumstances where it is not suggested that Issue 23 gives rise to any separate cause of action it would be disproportionate to address whether the Bank was in breach of the Instructions on any specific date. For the purposes for which breaches of the Instructions are relevant (in particular balance sheet management and the misleading of the CBR) I am satisfied that the pleaded issues are wide enough to cover such allegations and that (as found in Section I.2) Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov knew perfectly well that the N6 standard was being evaded by the Bank and that all the Shareholders cannot but have been aware that if the Bank’s lending had been properly recorded the Bank would have been in serious and persistent breach of  N1 and N6 standards.  That the Bank was in persistent breach of the N6 standard is evidenced by the calculations at Appendix B to the Bank’s Closing Submissions, the methodology of which I accept. This demonstrates that at every relevant year end the Bank’s N6 ratio was exceeded in relation to the loans to the Borrowers and all categories combined, and I consider that the overwhelming likelihood is that this would also be true at any particular time within the years.  </p>

Whilst I have borne in mind the observations of the parties as to each expert, ultimately I consider that each was doing their best to provide the Court with independent expert evidence. The differences between them largely arose out of genuine uncertainty as to the position under Russian law. </p>

It was common ground between the parties that when faced with conflicting expert evidence of foreign law, it is appropriate to look at the relevant sources of law. The court is not confined simply to accept either one witness or the other. This is reflected in D<span style="font-style:italic">icey, Morris &amp; Collins </span>at paragraph 9-17: </p>

The claim was for wrongfully causing the bank to enter transactions, including two loans to borrowers who stopped servicing their loans after the bank was taken over by the DIA. The appeal court referred to RCC Article 53 and JSCL Article 71, and found that the three-year civil limitation period had been properly applied. Dr Gerbutov made the point that, although the case was decided in accordance with RCC Article 53 and JSCL Article 71, this was not inconsistent with it being a labour claim under RLC Article 277. However, he accepted the judgment did not mention the RLC and that in relation two of the directors (the head and deputy head of the Management Board, appeared to be employees of the bank), the court applied the three-year limitation period established by the civil code despite them apparently having employment contracts.

I mean the provisions of Article 53, 53.1 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, an emphasis that these relationships do not lose their labour law character and remain the labour law ones, at least to a great extent, as is clarified in the resolution of the plenum, is appropriate and timely, since the court practice could feel a pressure from the current discussion over the civil code reform and make a step towards a refusal from application of the labour code when considering relevant disputes.” </p>

Professor Maggs considered that, because of the principle of Russian law prohibiting competition against claims, Sovcomflot cannot bring claims against Mr Skarga otherwise than on the basis of their employment contracts and under the Labour Code, and similarly NSC cannot bring claims against Mr Izmaylov on any other basis. Professor Sergeev disagreed: he cited in his report of 8 May 2009 eleven Russian cases as examples of cases in which a corporate director-general had been held to be liable otherwise than under the Labour Code, and considered that Mr. Skarga and Mr. Izmaylov might be liable under Russian law under the Civil Code for non-contractual liability. I do not consider that on examination these cases provide support for Professor Sergeev’s opinion. Seven of the cases are shareholder suits, and another two are claims brought by a joint-stock company against another company and not against a director-general. In none of the cases was any reference made to an employment contract between the director-general and the company, and Professor Sergeev accepted that sometimes a director-general is not an employee, although it is relatively unusual for him not to be employed. The cases cited by Professor Sergeev were all decided in the Arbitrazh Courts, which deal with commercial disputes and not disputes concerning individuals, such as employment law disputes. Moreover, Professor Maggs’ views seem to me to be supported by a decision of the Federal Arbitrazh Court dated 24 June 2004 in the case of Hotel Sportivnaya. As I understand the report of this decision, the Court considered that an employer can bring against an employee only a claim of a contractual nature. Professor Sergeev accepted that he could cite no precedent for an employer making a claim under article 1064 of the Civil Code. I conclude that such a claim would offend against the principle that Professor Maggs identified and would not be permitted.” (c)<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In his first expert report in these proceedings Dr Rachkov distanced himself from the idea that there is a principle against the competition of contractual and non-contractual claims in Russian law: </p>

As a further exception to the general principle, it is possible to establish tort liability regardless of the existence of a contract between the relevant parties where the damage in question was caused outside the sphere of the performance of the contractual obligations and/or exercise of contractual rights. For example, I am aware of a case in which the court imposed tort liability on the landlord on the basis of Article 1064 CCRF (regardless of the contractual arrangements for lease existing between the parties) for damages suffered by the lessee as a result of a fire accident that occurred due to violation of fire safety rules by the landlord and its contractor that performed repair works in the premises (the latter and the landlord were held jointly liable). In those circumstances, the claim in tort was not precluded by the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties because the facts giving rise to the harm occurred outside that contractual relationship. As I have said, this is however an exception to the usual principle that in a contractual relationship contract law takes precedence and excludes a claim in tort.” </p>

The fact that there are cases where Russian courts have applied the RLC, and in particular the one-year limitation period, in claims against employed directors is consistent with Dr Rachkov’s view that the claimant is entitled to choose to bring its claim under either the RCC or RLC. None of the cases relied on by Dr Gerbutov establish that the claim can only be brought as a labour claim. I accept that in <span style="font-style:italic">Astapov</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Security Organization Credo</span> the court appeared to reject the application of a three-year limitation period even despite it being contended by the claimants. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the claims in those cases were civil claims, rather than simply labour claims in which the claimants sought to apply a different limitation period. </p>

It could only ever apply to the present defendants by analogy. However, in my judgment Resolution 21 does not assist with the issue of whether a claimant can elect to bring a civil claim. It simply provides guidance on how Russian courts should approach claims made under RLC Article 277 and says nothing about whether a claimant is barred from bringing a claim under the RCC and/or JSCL. Whilst I accept that some Russian commentators, including a member of the Supreme Court’s academic advisory board, regard Resolution 21 as reasserting the primacy of the RLC over the RCC, ultimately I accept Dr Rachkov’s evidence that these views are not supported by the text of Resolution 21 itself. </p>

The two cases relied on by Dr Gerbutov arise in that context. I was not shown any Russian cases applying the same principle to claims against directors under RCC Article 53 and JSCL Article 71. As I understand the judgment of Andrew Smith J in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust</span>, it accepts the principle exists where contractual claims compete with claims under RCC Article 1064 (the Russian general tort provision) and Article 1102 (the Russian unjust enrichment provision). At paragraph [129] the Andrew Smith J noted that Russian lawyers differ on whether it is possible to bring a claim based directly on the RCC without relying on the RLC. At paragraph [139] he held that in view of his other conclusions nothing turned on the point, but he accepted Russian law would not allow the RLC regime to be circumvented in this way. It is not clear to me that Andrew Smith J was intending to find that the principles against competition of claims extends to a context such as the present, but to the extent that he intended to do so, any such finding is not binding upon me, and I prefer the evidence of Dr Rachkov.  </p>

It argues that this demonstrates the implausibility of employment relations between a company (which enters employment agreements through its executive body) and members of its Supervisory Board. The Bank also relies on the fact that, when applying for a UK visa for his wife, Mr Yurov described himself as “self-employed”. It suggests that this reflects the reality of how Mr Yurov saw himself as the dominant shareholder. In support of its argument, the Bank also relies on a number of cases and academic commentary cited by Dr Rachkov. </p>

Therefore, I do not consider they take the argument very far. Similarly, many of the other authorities relied on by Dr Rachkov concerned Supervisory Board members who did not enter into contracts at all, failed to establish a labour contract evidentially, or entered civil (rather than labour) contracts (see: <span style="font-style:italic">Plast-Rifey v.

As to the guidance given by the Kemerovo regional court in its Overview of court practice dated 15 March 2007, the appeal referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">Anatoliy Polevik v ZAO Kuzbass Cell Communication</span> appears to have been decided on the basis that the lower court erred by not checking the relationship between the company and members of the Supervisory Board.

The fact that Supervisory Board member is not on that list is not decisive. As to the letters sent by the Russian ministries for Health and Social Development; Finance; and Labour and Social Protection, it is common ground that they have no normative value under Russian law. In any event, it appears to me that the letters address the specific competences of the relevant government departments. I am not convinced that they establish a general rule that individuals cannot be employed as members of the Supervisory Board. Nor am I persuaded that the outcome of the 2014/2015 Russian tax proceedings regarding the status of payments made to Mr Yurov as chairman of the Supervisory Board establishes such a rule. </p>

Dr Rachkov referred me to cases where a lawyer was hired by a company about to enter bankruptcy in order to assist in preventing the bankruptcy. These appear to have been attempts to gain the benefit of a priority under Russian insolvency law. Dr Rachkov accepted that none of the cases he relied on involved the reclassification of a contract with a member of a Supervisory Board. In my judgment, the present case is not comparable to the cases cited by Dr Rachkov. Once it is accepted that under Russian law a company is entitled to employ a member of its Supervisory Board, I find that there is no reason to reclassify Mr Yurov’s employment contract as a civil law one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Bank submits that Articles 53 and 71 require the Shareholders to have acted in the (best) interest of the Bank, as well as in good faith and reasonably. Dr Gerbutov’s view is that this is an inaccurate characterisation of Articles 53 and 71. His view is that in the context of Articles 53 and 71, the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">“act in the interest”</span> is not used as a synonym for “in good faith and reasonably”, but instead simply means “on behalf of the company or in capacity as an officer of the company”. He maintains that the obligation under Articles 53 and 71 is simply to act in good faith and reasonably. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider that anything turns on this debate given that both parties accept that the Shareholders were required to act in good faith and reasonably. Further, both parties accept that Resolution 62 establishes rebuttable presumptions of bad faith, one of which being where a defendant should have been aware that his actions were not, at the time when they were taken, in the best interests of the legal entity (paragraph 2(5)) which I consider is particularly apt in the context of the use of “balance sheet management” (including, in particular, to mislead the CBR). Thus, something that is not in the best interests of the company is likely in any event not to be an act in good faith and/or reasonably (and so contrary to Articles 53 and 71). However, had it mattered, I consider that <span style="font-style:italic">“in the interests of the company”</span> does not simply mean “on behalf of the company” but also encompasses what is in the best interests of the company. Whilst it is in a different context (employment) the Bank also points out that the Shareholders promised in their employment contracts to act exclusively in the Bank’s best interest.  </p>

If members of the board of directors (one or several) having possibilities directly, but beyond their competence, to influence decisions to be made by the general director in respect of the company actually realize such possibilities to the detriment of the company, they must be liable jointly with the director who is to be brought to the liability for the caused losses as a result of the actual implementation of the decision of so-called “shady” directors”. </p>

When deciding whether to provide a loan, the head of the Bank must establish whether the borrower is capable of servicing the loan and returning it by the deadlines established by the agreement. These facts are established based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of the financial position and activities of the borrower and the reliability of the documents that it submitted.” </p>

The court held: “Furthermore, the courts found that in this case, there is no causal link between the decisions taken by the board of directors and the consequences in the form of the Company's failure to generate profit from its operations because the said decisions did not make it compulsory for the Company's General Director to enter into sale and purchase contracts for the assets. … One should note that the sale of properties belonging to the Company per se did not adversely affect its operations.

In contrast the Bank submits that this principle does apply in the context of the present case and, for example, where the companies concerned are Cypriot shell companies with nominee directors and no genuine independent “executive bodies”. As I have addressed and found, the evidence does show that the companies in the offshore network were beneficially owned and controlled by the Shareholders (who I have also found were acting together in procuring the Loans and Transactions).  I was not addressed at a granular level of detail in terms of every individual contract and its terms, but there can be no doubt that the whole of the structure of the offshore network was designed so that binding instructions could be given by the Shareholders through the nominee UBOs to the corporate service providers (facilitated by Mr Worsley) so as to control all companies in the offshore network for the benefit of the Shareholders (as also evidenced by the measures in place should an individual nominee UBO go “rogue”). In such circumstances I am satisfied that the Shareholders (who themselves acted together in relation to the Loans and Transactions) are to be treated as a “group of persons” and as such “affiliated persons”, and I so find. </p>

In this regard the presumptions in Resolution 62 paragraphs 2(1) and 2(5) would also apply as evidence of the director’s bad faith. </p>

Whilst this does mean that the Shareholders would not fall within the definition of a “beneficiary” for this purpose, the absurd consequences identified by the Bank (for example a director procuring a US$50 million loan to a shell company owned and controlled by him and then using that US$50 million to settle his own personal debts) are, I am satisfied, well catered for by other principles including the “group of persons” test (in the context of Article 81 to 84) and the obligation under Articles 53 and 77 including to act in good faith, and the associated presumptions.  </p>

In this regard, and by way of example, notwithstanding that Article 82 requires disclosure of a director’s interest in the transaction to the company’s external auditor, it was the unchallenged evidence of Mr Zavadsky that none of the loans at issue (including those to Willow River/RCP) were accounted for as related party lending in the Bank’s IFRS accounts. </p>

In relation to the Bank Charter, the Shareholders also failed to comply with their obligations as Supervisory Board directors in numerous respects including in failing to write off debts in good faith, failing to establish and/or implement effective internal controls and approved the Bank’s audited accounts knowing them to be false. </p>

The Bank failed to report loans properly for the purpose of CBR Regulation 254-P, and the Bank would have been in breach of the N6 ratio if loans had been properly reported (as addressed in Sections I.2 and I.7 above). I am satisfied that the Shareholders were complicit in this and acted unlawfully in this regard. This resulted in breaches of the obligations established by Article 53(3) of the RCC, the new Article 53(3) and Articles 71(1) and 81-84 of the JSC which also apply to the Shareholders as labour law obligations (see Section M.9.1 above), and as such the Shareholders breached their labour law obligations in that regard. </p>

Dr Rachkov suggested that prior to the adoption of Article 172.1 of the RF Criminal Code (i.e. before 2 August 2014), a director’s actions related to the falsification of the company’s accounts could have been punished in accordance with Article 201 of the RF Criminal Code, however, the matter was not explored in any detail, and I do not consider that the Bank has established, to the requisite standard, that a criminal offence was committed.   </p>

His evidence was that the objective part of the crime provided for by Article 201 of the RF Criminal Code is the use of managerial functions (by actions or inactions) against the legitimate interests of this company that caused considerable harm to rights and legitimate interests of citizens or companies or to interests of the society of the state protected by law.

This last point is reinforced by the fact that it is not appropriate to infer that the debt had no value (it may be obvious but even following a default the Bank’s loss on the lending will depend on the prospect for future recovery and the value and enforceability of available collateral, and what reserving is necessary and made). Mr Yurov’s own evidence was that the value of the Stivilon debt could not be assessed as zero and a default on a loan did not mean an “<span style="font-style:italic">immediate loss</span>”.

In this regard, assume that that the Bank has a non-performing loan to Borrower A of £1,000; and that A is an individual who is entirely and irretrievably unable to pay, so that the Bank has provisioned the loan as to 100%. On the Shareholders’ premises, this represents an actual, incurred loss to the Bank of £1,000. Now assume that A successfully deceives the Bank into handing over to him £1,000 in cash, which A uses (as he planned all along) to settle his original debt. When the Bank discovers the fraud and sues him, A’s defence (like the Shareholders’ in this case) is that the Bank has suffered no loss because it had already lost £1,000; and its loss remains the same after the fraud. That cannot be right. The position would be no different if the fraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly obtained the money and passed it to A (whether as a conspirator or a benevolent bystander) so that he could repay his debt. </p>

What subsists, is the loss caused by the fraud not the original lending.

On the defendants’ argument, although neither SR nor X could raise as a defence that funds obtained by its fraudulent behaviour had been applied to reimburse the bank in respect of an LC issued in favour of itself, each could do so if the funds were applied to reimburse the bank in respect of an LC issued in favour of the other, with the consequence that to that extent the liabilities of both would be cancelled.

I believe that to embark on a trial to determine whether, and if so to what extent, sums received by SR from discounted LCs resulted in the discharge of liabilities of DCL, or connected companies, to the bank would be like entering a jungle without a route map. During this trial a spotlight was shone on certain aspects of the unsatisfactory affairs of Mr Stojevic’s and Mr Alon’s companies. Transparency was not their characteristic. To try to fathom the extent to which the use of the proceeds of the discounted LCs led to the reduction of liabilities by DCL or connected companies to the bank would be an exercise of a different magnitude, because it would involve examining inter-company dealings in relation to LCs issued in favour of beneficiaries other than SR — and that is what I describe as entering a jungle. In referring to the lack of a route map, I have in mind the difficulty which I foresee in attempting to discern where in the jungle the exercise should begin and end. Take the defendants’ two examples of payments to SR Prague in August 1999. They focus on certain events in a wider web of dealings. It is not obvious why those events, and not other surrounding dealings between the various parties, should be taken into account as being not too remote or why the “first in, first out” approach at the suggested dates should be taken for determining the amount of the bank’s loss. If I had been in doubt where the line of remoteness should be drawn, such considerations would have strengthened my inclination towards a narrower rather than a broader approach.” </p>

The position would be the same if Loan B were used to repay some or all of the principal of Loan A. That would benefit Borrower A, rather than the Bank, unless or to the extent that the Shareholders established that the Bank would not otherwise have received any such repayment from Borrower A.

So, for example, if both Borrower A and Borrower B were “balance sheet management” vehicles, such that the Shareholders would (all other things being equal) be liable in respect of both loans if they were never repaid, it could never be a benefit to the Bank, for the purposes of giving credit in its claim in respect of Loan B, that part of Loan B was shown by the Shareholders to have been used to repay Loan A. The only effect of such a repayment would be to reduce the Shareholders’ liability in respect of Loan A (which would be a benefit to the Shareholders, not the Bank). It might extinguish that liability if Loan A were thereby fully repaid. But I am satisfied that it would not give rise to any arguable benefit to the Bank for which it would have to give credit in respect of Loan B, all of which would remain lost. </p>

The Bank submits, rightly in my view, that the end position is that the loans clearly were <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">not</span> circular, because the loans were cash payments, and the principal on them (around US$750 million) has not been repaid.

The evidence is in fact to the contrary, as already addressed, with the only candidates before the Court being Stivilon and StroyEcologia and such case was not made out factually even in relation to them. The reality, I am satisfied, is that there was leakage on a massive scale with monies not coming back to the Bank, and when the music stopped, the Bank faced a loss of circa US$750 million on the loans that had been made in breach of duty, which I am satisfied represents its loss recoverable from the Shareholders.  </p>

So, for example, where money is coming back as a payment of interest directly to the Bank from another borrower, that receipt of interest is something that the Bank was entitled to under the promise made by the borrower owing the interest. When the Bank received it, it was clearly a collateral matter to the breach of duty and the loan that was caused by the breach of duty from which the funds were ultimately sourced.

The simple answer is that it does not. It is not a receipt by the Bank. It is a receipt by a separate legal entity. A benefit to another entity is not a benefit to the Bank. This is true of all the entries in the Table under Category (3) i.e. those in relation to Erinskay and Baymore, LBCS, Mourija, StroyEcologiya and SiberianKD. But even if the benefit had been to the Bank (which it was not), the benefit would have been pursuant to a contract and as such collateral – and the reality is that there would be, and were, a whole series of such contracts operated for a myriad of reasons including the assignment of debts, netting agreements, the purchase of shares and the like.

Yet this point is said to carry a US$90 million credit. If a litigant was allowed to pursue such points in closing that had not been properly foreshadowed on the pleadings and expressly addressed by both experts this would be trial by ambush of the worst sort. I do not consider that such matters are properly pleaded and as such they cannot properly be pursued in closing.

It increased to RUB 4.225 billion on 18 March 2009 (the additional portion bearing interest at 9 percent), and was reduced to RUB 3.35 billion on 30 July 2010 (the reduction being from the notes that paid the slightly higher interest rate).  If, for simplicity, one assumes simply an interest rate of 9 percent, that means that by 22 December 2014, interest payments on the loan had amounted to about RUB 1.94 billion. It is said that the Bank therefore paid out a total of RUB 4.225 billion, but it has received payments of principal (RUB 0.9 billion) and interest (RUB 1.94 billion) because of the loan. It is said that to award damages on the basis of the loss of the outstanding principal, without taking into account the payment of interest, would overcompensate the Bank, so that the actual loss is RUB 1.4 billion. </p>

None of this has been done, and this is not a split trial of liability and quantum with points of principle being dealt with first and quantum later. Any matters of quantum should have been pleaded and proved at this trial. I consider that there is force in these submissions. I simply do not have before me the requisite evidence in the form of loan documentation as varied from time to time and evidence of sums received and associated calculations. The position would be made even more complex as the sums received by way of interest may in fact be from another (wrongfully obtained) loan from the Bank so that interest received on the Oldehove loan would not be a benefit to the Bank at all.  Additionally, had Mr Yurov been right about his Circular Credit point (which he is not for the reasons given) he also could hardly say monies were used to pay interest and that they also returned to the Bank. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Aside from such matters, which mean that it is far too late to raise such a plea in closing, there are also objections to the submission itself. First the Bank was, after all in the business of lending and had many customers (both savers and borrowers). If this money had not been lent to Oldehove it could have been lent to others on no less interestbearing terms (and indeed potentially to borrowers that were a better credit risk) either at the same rate (if the imputed loans were on commercial terms) or at a higher rate (if, as the Bank alleges, they were not). Mr Yurov submits that such a position is not open to the Bank on the facts. It is said that the Bank’s case is that it did not have the capital to make loans at all, and it is said that nor is there any evidence that it did in fact use its assets profitably in the relevant period. It is also said that if a claim had to be made under the Labour Code, lost profit is not recoverable. These are very high level submissions that ignore the fact that very considerable sums were being deposited into the Bank by savers, and had money not been consumed in the offshore network and dissipated (including to the Shareholders) it could indeed have been lent on commercial terms. It is also not a claim for lost profit it is an alleged credit to be given. Yet further, an alternative way of looking at the interest receipts is that they were just a good proxy for the true loss to the Bank of the time value of money on its principal loss i.e. even if it were otherwise appropriate to credit off such sums there would be an entitlement to pre-judgment interest in an equivalent amount to that which it is said ought to be credited. </p>

It was asserted that the proceedings had the potential to significantly inform matters in issue in these proceedings, <span style="font-style:italic">“including the circumstances surrounding the Trust’s request for rehabilitation, the calculation of the bailout request, the date on which key individuals became aware of the of-balance sheet structure, the use of bail-out monies and the extent of the Trust’s losses” </span>(the “Alleged Issues”) and seeking disclosure of the Russian Claim Form in the proceedings. Steptoe &amp; Johnson UK LLP on behalf of the Bank responded pointing out that the Russian Claim Form sought recovery of damages equating to losses incurred by the CBR in respect of monies that it injected into Bank Otkritie in the period between September 2017 and August 2018, several years after the events in issue in this action. It was said the Claim Form referred exclusively to the management and operation of Bank Otkritie (which is not party to this action) and that there was no reference to the Bank or to any of the impugned loans the subject matter of this action. It was also noted that Byrne &amp; Partners’ letter had not identified a single issue in the Agreed Facts and Issues that it was said the Russian proceedings might confirm. Steptoe &amp; Johnson confirmed that they had reviewed the Russian Claim Form and confirmed that it was irrelevant to any issue in the action and so did not fall for disclosure by the Bank pursuant to its continuing duty of disclosure. </p>

It was again asserted that it was relevant to the issues in the case, albeit that once again no attempt was made to tie such assertion to the Agreed Facts and Issues. The letter also drew attention to the fact that they had recently become aware that Trust Bank and Otkritie Financial Corporation PJSC (“Otkritie FC”) were pursuing a claim against Boris Mints and other members of the Mints family in the Commercial Court (the “Mints Proceedings”) in which allegations of dishonesty are made against representatives of Trust Bank and Otkritie Bank including Mr Vadim Belyaev  and Mr Evgeny Dankevich of Bank Otkritie. It was submitted that I should be cautious in relation to the evidence adduced for and on behalf of the Bank in circumstances where the majority of the Claimant’s witnesses were current or former employees (some of them, such as Mr Popkov and Ms Dolenko, senior employees) of Otkritie Holding JSC and/or Otkritie Bank. In a letter from Byrne and Partners reference was made to the fact that in many cases the Court was being asked to accept the credit given by Otkritie for Bank assets taken onto its own balance sheet, under the ultimate direction of the same individuals and it was submitted that the allegations of dishonesty made by Otkritie against its own senior management reinforced Mr Fetisov’s submissions at trial that the Court should not treat Otkritie’s dealings with Bank assets as a true, fair or independent valuation of those assets.  </p>

It was said that the new owners of the Bank were alleging dishonest conduct against its former owners and the owners of the Otkritie entities which it was said were the individuals who instigated this action against Messrs Yurov, Belyaev and Fetisov, and it was suggested that the matters raised in the letter were <span style="font-style:italic">“highly relevant to the reliability of the witnesses and the evidence adduced by Trust Bank”.</span> This was followed up by a yet further letter the same day referring to Russian press reports that the Bank was seeking to have its claims against its former shareholder Otkritie Holding recognised by the Arbitration Court of Moscow through an initial bankruptcy procedure in order to protect its position as a creditor.

The argument of Mr. Skarga and Mr. Izmaylov is that they are entitled to rely upon their contracts of employment to limit liability because article 15 specifically permits this, and that their contracts of employment should be interpreted as excluding liability for loss of profits because the wording of clause 6 of Mr. Skarga’s contract and the comparable provision of Mr. Izmaylov’s contract reflect that of article 188 of the 1971 Labour Code and of article 238 of the new Labour Code. </p>

First, as I have said, Mr. Skarga and Mr. Izmaylov rely upon it to restrict their liability for intentional wrongdoing or dishonesty directed against Sovcomflot or NSC, and the relevant provisions of their employment contracts are not to be interpreted as applying in these circumstances. Secondly, article 15 does not, in its general application, allow a contractual provision to exclude liability for intentional breach of contract because article 401(4) of the Civil Code provides that “An agreement concluded in advance for eliminating or limiting liability for the intentional violation of an obligation is void”. Although Professor Maggs considered that this applies only to contracts governed by the Civil Code and not to the employment contracts, which are governed by the Labour Codes, this does not mean that article 15 is to be understood to allow contractual exclusions or limitations of liability where there is intentional wrongdoing. <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Thirdly, I accept the evidence of</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Professor Sergeev that under article 71 of the Civil Code liability can be excluded</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">only by reference to another law and not by reference to a contractual provision.</span> Since article 71 is a more specific provision and specific norms take precedence over the general ones, liability under article 277 cannot be excluded contractually. Accordingly, while the measure of compensation under article 71 generally is determined by reference to article 15 and article 15 generally allows contractual exclusions of liability, this is displaced by article 71 ‘s more specific and narrower regime.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is clear therefore, that Dr Rachkov agrees in principle with the finding of Andrew Smith J although he also gives a further reason. Dr Rachkov was not cross-examined about this aspect of his evidence and his agreement with the finding of Andrew Smith J that a director cannot by contract limit his liability under Article 71. If, as has occurred, a submission was going to be made along the lines of that at paragraph 355(c) of Mr Yurov’s Closing Submissions, I consider that Dr Rachkov should have been cross-examined in relation to this evidence, and absent cross-examination his evidence stands unchallenged. In any event, and quite apart from Dr Rachkov’s evidence, I am satisfied, based on the language of Article 71, that members of a supervisory board etc are liable to the company as a result of their culpable actions or inactions unless other grounds for and scope of liability are established in federal law, with the result that it is not possible under Russian law to exclude liability for intentional wrongdoing, in the context of a civil claim, by contract, and I so find. </p>

One form is intent, the other form is negligence and intent can be direct or indirect one, as I explained in the case to which I referred in my first report.  In that particular situation, the person should have known because she was smart enough and professional enough to understand what the consequences are but, in fact, the direct or indirect intent are distinguished in the doctrine or in the court practice in a bit different way, so the difference is that in case of indirect intent or you may call is recklessness, the tortfeasor does not want the negative consequence to occur but is indifferent on whether or not they occur.

Accordingly, had it been relevant (and as appears below it is not), I accept Dr Rachkov’s evidence that under Russian law indirect intent exists where the person does not want the negative consequence to occur but is indifferent as to whether they will occur. This recognises both a recognition of the possibility of harm, and an indifference as to whether that harm occurs, which I am satisfied is the requisite subjective intent for indirect harm in Russian law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Thus (and although Mr Willan was reluctant to accept the example for obvious reasons), I am satisfied that “balance sheet management” caused harm to the Bank (and that the Shareholders knew that) not least because what was being done was an administrative offence and not in the best interests of the Bank (as I have found). That offence is committed and harm suffered <span style="text-decoration:underline">as soon as </span>balance sheet management is carried out. The commission of an administrative offence is harm, and that harm has already occurred, and does not depend on the Bank getting “caught”. Equally the Shareholders knew the commission of the offence was going to occur but were indifferent to it. They did not want the Bank to commit an administrative offence, but it had to happen – just as in the “striking employee” example. I also consider that “balance sheet management” itself inflicts harm on the Bank in additional senses: first because exposing the Bank to the risk of licence revocation is itself harm (contrary to Mr Willan’s submission), secondly because falsifying accounts results in the Bank suffering harm (again whether or not such falsification is discovered), thirdly evading the N1 and N6 standards results in the Bank suffering harm (again the risk of licence revocation) and fourthly the Bank is harmed by the very fact of  “balance sheet management” as it causes the Bank financial losses as I have found (having rejected, amongst other matters, the “circularity” argument), and the Shareholders knew each of these aspects of harm but were indifferent to them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is also a further separate basis on which intent has been established – as I have found the Shareholders took assets out of the Bank, and through the myriad of companies in the offshore network transferred such assets into companies controlled by them (and ultimately even into their own family trusts). As recognised by Mr Willan, this is harming the Bank because the Shareholders were taking the Bank’s assets and treating them as their own, with the Bank being worse off and the Shareholders being better off. Furthermore, putting such assets into personal family trusts is also inconsistent with any contemporaneous intention to return such assets.  </p>

Such civil claims are subject to a 3-year limitation period, and as identified at Section M.2.5.1 above it is the practice of the Arbitraz courts to apply the 3-year limitation period to civil claims against directors who are also employees. It is common ground that the claims against the Shareholders are not time-barred if a 3-year limitation period applies. Accordingly, all of the remaining factual and legal issues in relation limitation are academic. I will, however, address such issues for completeness in circumstances where I heard full argument on such matters. </p>

The original Claim Form was issued on 12 February 2016. However, as originally issued, the Claim Form did not include claims under the Labour Code. On 8 April 2016, the Bank issued separate proceedings under the Labour Code (“the Second Claim Form”). Pursuant to CPR 17.1 the second Claim Form was amended to include claims for breaches of Articles 232, 233, 238 and 244 of the Labour Code (“the Amended Second Claim Form”). On 14 October 2016, the parties reached an agreement, recorded in a consent Order of Knowles J, the effect of which was that the Bank had permission to amend the Claim Form in the main action so as to add the Labour Code claims in the main action, and that such amendment was made on the agreed basis that, insofar as the Labour Code claims did not arise out of </p>

I am satisfied that this is so, and more generally that the essence of the Labour Code claims is indeed that the conduct already alleged in the existing claims gives rise to liability under the Labour Code with both sets of claims being based on precisely the same fraud and set of impugned transactions, quite apart from the fact that, as recorded at Issue 29 of the Agreed Facts and Issues, the obligations established by Article 53(3) of the RCC and Articles 71(1) and 81-84 of the JSC Law applied to the Shareholders whether as director’s duties or as labour law obligations, without distinction.  </p>

If this is tested by the purpose of the requirement (as identified by Colman J in <span style="font-style:italic">BP plc v Aon</span>) the Shareholders were not thereby placed in a position whereby they would be obliged after the expiry of the limitation period to investigate facts and obtain evidence of matters which are completely outside the ambit of, and unrelated to those facts which they could reasonably be assumed to have investigated for the purpose of defending the unamended claims. On the contrary, those facts are all intrinsically linked, and indeed contemporaneously addressed together in, for example, the June 2015 memorandum and its focus on balance sheet management (the very focus of the original claim). </p>

The contracts provide that if a demand is sent the sums become due the following day. Of course, it would then be known that the sum due had not been paid.

The question of knowledge of breach of duty by the Shareholders is addressed in due course in Section P4.4 below in the context of Issue 65.2. Suffice it to note, however, at this point, that, upon examination, this has not been made out either. </p>

However, I am satisfied that it was not until Mr Worsley’s documents were obtained in late November/December 2015 that the opaque web offshore companies could be penetrated and the Shareholders’ breaches of duty in such respects known – before that there was much suspicion but no hard facts as to such ultimate beneficial ownership.

It is readily apparent from the evidence that it inevitably took considerable time to investigate matters. In this regard, and as already noted, it was some time before there was a meeting with Mr Worsley in February and it was not until November/December 2015 that the necessary documentation was obtained from Mr Worsley which revealed the true position (albeit, ironically, the Shareholders dispute what that documentation shows and whether it gives rise to any wrongdoing on their part).</p>

This is most relevant to Issue 67 (as addressed below), but also forms part of the context of the difficulties that the new administration was having in relation to investigating matters when assessing whether, despite such wholesale destruction of electronic data immediately before the commencement of the investigation (and no doubt to impede or thwart such investigation) the DIA had prior to 12 February 2015 (or indeed any relevant subsequent date) sufficient knowledge of the fraud, the harm suffered and the wrongdoing of the Shareholders (even leaving aside the findings already made above about the lack of knowledge of irrecoverable loss and lack of the knowledge of the particular wrongdoing of the Shareholders (only gained following access to Mr Worsley’s documentation).</p>

It is equally clear that this was actioned.

In particular, emails held on the accounts of the First to Third Defendants (the “Primary Defendants”) and other senior executives (including Mr Iskandyrov, Ms Balkan, Ms Sidorova, Mr Pospelov, Mr Postnov, Mr Popov, Mr Vartsibasov, Ms Karalkina, Mr Kazakov, Mr Kuznetsov) had been systematically deleted.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">

This in itself tells the lie to the suggestion that the administrators had knowledge of the same at any earlier time, and further supports the conclusion that it was not until a later date (in fact after November 2015, and the Bank’s settlement with Mr Worsley, that the Bank acquired information in relation to the family trusts. Indeed, the requisite documentation in relation to the Shareholders’ Isle of Man trusts was only sent by Mr Worsley to Mr Popkov on 18 December 2015.    </p>

The following day Mr Popkov became a member of the Bank’s Supervisory Board and was employed as an advisor to the CEO of the Bank. The contemporary correspondence soon thereafter in July shows that Mr Worsley and Shareholders were still undecided as to whether even to disclose the Shareholders’ beneficial ownership to the Bank (evidencing that the administrators did not then have such knowledge otherwise such discussions would be neither necessary nor would such discussions make any sense).

Perhaps unsurprisingly a number of years later, he could not even recall seeing it. There is no suggestion (and it was not put to Mr Popkov) that the information was passed to the CBR by anyone on investigation team. Once again at this stage the administrators did not have the requisite knowledge of harm or of harm attributable to the Shareholders – as already addressed that came much later. Certainly,  Ms Dolenko was not herself of the view, at the end of January 2015, that there had been “asset diversion” to the Shareholders stating, when this was put to her, that <span style="font-style:italic">“No, this is not the case” </span>(and it not put to Ms Dolenko that such answer was untrue).

The email contained a spreadsheet of assets. It is clear that at this time the view being taken by Mr Popkov was that assertions from ex-Bank employees needed to be verified by documentation, and that at this stage there was no knowledge of actual losses or actual wrongdoing by the Bank, but rather assumptions that monies had been lost or siphoned off as well as assumptions as to whom loans were associated with (though again without actual knowledge thereof). The need for matters to be verified was stressed by Mr Popkov in his contemporaneous email to Ms Dolenko:-  </p>

If, contrary to my findings, the harm was known before November/December 2015, I am satisfied that the factors I have identified were not dependent upon the will of the Bank and were outside its control and amount to exceptional circumstances whereby there are valid reasons why the claims were not brought in time (on this hypothesis), and the Court should restore the limitation period and allow the claims to be brought (if, contrary to my findings) they are otherwise timebarred (Issue 67). I have no doubt that a Russian court would reach the same conclusion given the wholesale destruction of electronic data, and concealment on the part of the Shareholders which I am satisfied was designed to thwart, or delay any claim against them, and which dictates that the claims ought not to be time barred on the applicable principles. </p>

In this regard it is submitted on behalf of Mr Fetisov that in relation to the assets concerning the Fetisovs it may be better to defer the question of remedy until after judgment has been given as to whether the transactions can be challenged under s.423.  </p>

The fact that Mrs Yurova and the children live permanently in the UK and she held an investor visa allowing the family to reside in the UK whilst Mr Yurov commuted between there and Moscow are not strong reasons for the house being registered in her <span style="text-decoration:underline">sole</span> name. It is the family home (of which Mr Yurov too is an integral part) and I see no reason why 50:50 ownership (consistent with Russian law and how Mr Yurov believed assets were owned) would not achieve precisely that.  The property was purchased in 2012 when (as addressed in Section F.2.5.3) the offshore network had been set up, and the Shareholders were already not acting in the best interests of the Bank or in good faith as I have found, and I am also satisfied that they knew that. In such circumstances the obvious inference, which I draw, is that the assets (which derive from Mr Yurov whether from his salary or routed as described above) were put in Mrs Yurova’s sole name to protect Mr Yurov’s 50% beneficial interest/share from creditors in the event of legal action being taken against him in respect of his wrong doing in the future, and that Mr Yurov retained a 50% beneficial interest and beneficial ownership. In this regard I bear well in mind the presumption of advancement but I am satisfied that the burden upon the Bank has been discharged in this regard. I do not consider that it matters whether such 50% beneficial interest is held on a common intention constructive trust as opposed to a resulting trust. I do not consider there is anything in the Yurov’s intentions and relations that leads to the beneficial interest being held on trust for Mr Yurov being anything other than 50%. </p>

Whilst there is some evidence from a website that if a greater sum is invested the application is processed faster, I did not find the explanation convincing, and I do not consider that this was the reason for Mrs Belyaeva investing £5 million. First, such an explanation is not supported by any documentation demonstrating such a gift, and any larger investment would surely require <span style="text-decoration:underline">the same</span> documentary proof of gift yet there is no similar memorandum of deed of gift in relation to the remaining £3.8 million. Nor, tellingly, is any such explanation proffered in either of Mr Belyaev’s or Mrs Belyaeva’s witness statement (as it surely would be if that explanation had been true given that such £5 million investment, and the reason for the same, was in issue). Nor is there any evidence in support of their evidence about what they were allegedly told by their British solicitors that if they invested £5 million they would be granted leave to remain within 3 years or to the effect that there was no reason for the gift of a larger sum to be evidenced in writing (which, in of itself, seems unlikely advice to give), and in such circumstances, I reject the explanation given. </p>

In the absence of any other credible explanation, and given the backdrop of the knowledge of the Shareholders of their wrongdoing, and the risk of the Bank’s collapse, in 2014 (including as from June 2014 in the context of Mr Worsley’s 17 June email to them), the obvious inference, which I draw, is that the £3.8 million (which came from Mr Belyaev’s Bordier bank account) was transferred by Mr Belyaev to Mrs Belyaeva to protect Mr Belyaev’s 50% interest in such monies from creditors in the event of legal action being taken against him in respect of his wrong doing in the future, and that Mr Belyaev retained a 50% beneficial interest in such monies, and I so find. In this regard I again bear well in mind the presumption of advancement but I am satisfied that the burden upon the Bank has been discharged in this regard. Accordingly, I am satisfied and find that Mr Belyaev retained a beneficial interest in 50% of the additional £3.8 million) i.e. £1.9 million, with the same being held on resulting trust for him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that Erinskay and Baymore were, indeed, pure “balance sheet management” companies that were not associated with any underlying business and owned no real property, and were the two largest such companies. The nature of the balance sheet management has been addressed in Sections G.3.1 and G.3.2 (balance sheet management), and Section M (Russian Law) and further reference is made in this Section to particular “balance sheet management” companies. I have found that the Shareholders acted dishonestly, as well as unreasonably and not in the best interests of the Bank, in relation to “balance sheet management”, the accounts and misleading the CBR. Equally in relation to the individual Loans and Transactions (and associated pattern of behaviour) I am satisfied that these involved multiple and repeated breaches of the Shareholders’ duties, such Loans not being reasonable, or in the best interest of the Bank or in good faith, such lending being done without appropriate scrutiny, due diligence or disclosure, being (as the Bank notes) waved through the Credit Committee (often by absentee ballot in circumstances where the contemplated requirements for such a ballot do not appear to have been met) without any appropriate scrutiny, due diligence or disclosure of personal interest, coupled with the inappropriate extension of loans as repayment deadlines approached without any disclosure of the Shareholders’ personal interests or benefit to them.   </p>

As the Bank puts it, and as I am satisfied was the case, their very <span style="font-style:italic">raison d’être</span> was the falsification of the Bank’s accounts and the deception of the CBR and other third parties. This was achieved through a combination of a pretence that Erinskay and Baymore were owned by outside investors who, in reality, were Mr Worsley’s “UBO nominees” installed as a front to conceal the real owners of the companies (the Shareholders as I have found), the manipulation of the companies’ accounts which were “corrected” using fake deals to generate a profit and create the misleading impression of the companies conducting a real business; and generous loans from the Bank on uncommercial terms, with no collateral or genuine means to repay, each of which was advanced with the express approval of at least one of the Shareholders. I am also satisfied that the Shareholders, and each of them, knew of all such matters. </p>

Furthermore, REPO’ing OFZ securities on the Bank’s account would have been cheaper than REPO’ing the same securities on behalf of the companies because the Bank could deal direct with the market, unlike the companies. Therefore, a “switch” fee of between 0.5% to 0.7% per trade was payable by the companies (which caused a significant leakage of funds from the Bank).  </p>

Instead, cash was lent to Erinskay and Baymore to enable them to buy and repo bonds – as a result of which significant extra costs were incurred. Certainly, there was no legitimate commercial rationale for their use, or the transactions they entered into – as would have been obvious to any compliance department at a third party bank. As Mr Worsley asked in June 2012, <span style="font-style:italic">“Look at it [from] a compliance perspective at Standard Bank: Why on earth does BC [Black Coast] take cash, buy bonds from a private source, then repo those bonds to get cash back and take market risk….?” </span></p>

This was graphically acknowledged by Mr Yurov in the document he sent to Mr Belyaev and Mr Fetisov in June 2015 that I have referred to and quoted at length, Erinskay and Baymore being among “<span style="font-style:italic">a few dozens of foreign companies”</span> established<span style="font-style:italic">, “in order not to record previous years’ losses from banking operations in its report to the CB”</span> and as was also stated a <span style="font-style:italic">“decision was made to start submitting false accounts to the CB…”    </span></p>

Erinskay and Baymore were incorporated by Mr Vassiliades on 11 and 12 October 2011 respectively, on the instructions of Mr Worsley.  Erinskay was seemingly “owned” by Mr Laws through Serendale Holdings Ltd (“Serendale”), a BVI company incorporated on 16 September 2011. He was later replaced with a Mr McBean. Baymore was “owned” by Mr Chadwick / Mr Rowe through Haverson Holdings Ltd (“Haverson”), another BVI company incorporated on 16 September 2011. Mr Rowe’s “ownership” came later. These companies were not controlled by the Bank (as the Shareholders allege) but by the Shareholders. When the music stopped post collapse of the Bank, monies did not return to the Bank, and the Bank had to serve demands, issuing proceedings in the Russian courts, and seeking to enforce the resulting judgments, to little or no avail. </span>

Thus, Mr Laws was (through Serendale) the “nominee UBO” of Erinskay from the date of incorporation. On 21 September 2012, his “beneficial interest” in Serendale was transferred to another recently incorporated BVI company, Dramcon, nominally owned by Mr Worsley (through Compass Nominees Ltd).  Mr Worsley held the shares in Dramcon on trust for Arlingham,  one of the Shareholders’ personal vehicles. Less than a month later, on 18 October 2012, yet another BVI company was interposed in the ownership structure: Lupin Group Investments Ltd (“Lupin”), in whose favour Compass declared a trust over its shareholding in Serendale. Mr Worsley directed Lupin to be “owned” by Mr McBean, through Delta Nominees Ltd. The Shareholders’ ownership of Erinskay remained unchanged (albeit it was now held through Brora, which eventually formed part of their personal trust structures).  On 19 June 2013, Ms Fotiou (the Cypriot-level nominee shareholder of Erinskay) was replaced by Ms Alexandrou. The chain of ownership up to the Shareholders was maintained by a fresh Deed of Trust in favour of Serendale.   </span>

It contained an additional lie in referring to the first loan agreed on 24 April 2012 and stating that <span style="font-style:italic">“Erinskay … performs obligations under the loan agreement on time”</span> – an impossible statement given that the report was prepared on the very day the first loan was agreed and the first tranche was advanced two days later, so there could be no question of historic performance (and of course it was subsequently serviced by further “balance sheet management”).  </p>

The reality was that the business of Erinskay was kept in-house in Columba. As Mr Davidson’s diagrams show, the loan proceeds were used to buy and then sell Russian government securities, with the cash being transmitted across the offshore network (with some US$3 million ending up at Kuri Hills, from which some US$900,000 was paid (via other Shareholder companies) to Mishcon de Reya (“Mishcons”) Mr Yurov’s solicitors in his personal litigation against Mr Kolyada (Mr Yurov now admitting that he <span style="font-style:italic">“knew that the Bank was providing money to fund my defence of the Kolyada litigation</span>”).

Mr Yurov’s purported justification, however, also shows (as I am satisfied was the case) that Mr Fetisov and Mr Belyaev knew of this misuse of Bank funds, and in due course were to benefit from the same (when the Court released monies in December 2014 which went via Kuri Hills to their Bordier accounts). Mr Yurov admits that he was obliged to account for the legal costs to the Bank but has never done so – as addressed in Section C.3.1 above, his justification based on an alleged set-off in relation to Otkritie does not bear examination as the monies belonged to the Bank, not Otkritie. </p>

The outstanding principal on the Erinskay loans is loans is US$55,050,574 and RUB 3,760,000,000, whilst that on the Baymore loans is US$58,010,242 and RUB 3,350,000,000. Whilst Mr Yurov seeks to submit that much of the lending “returned to the Bank” (based on work done by Mr Davidson) such an exercise was not demonstrated on the facts, and a key flaw in such submission is the failure to distinguish between the Bank itself and other entities. It is also (falsely) premised on the purported distinction between Bank and Shareholder Companies which I have rejected. </p>

In purporting to dispose of the bonds, Erinskay and Baymore avoided having to pay margin calls (that would have resulted in a default), while the Bank evaded capital adequacy rules (which required it to mark to a falling market) by concluding forward agreements obliging Erinskay and Baymore to repurchase the bonds for the same price in six months. Equally it cannot possibly be said that the conclusion of the derivative contracts was in the Bank’s interests – it plainly was not. Their effect was that the Bank would have to pay Erinskay and Baymore if the bond market rose, whereas if the market did not rise the debt to the Bank would be owed by worthless shell companies.   </p>

As the Bank points out, Erinskay and Baymore <span style="text-decoration:underline">sold </span>their portfolio of Russian government bonds on the relevant exchange and the Bank <span style="text-decoration:underline">purchased</span> an equivalent amount of bonds from the exchange. The consequence is that the Bank gave, and Erinskay and Baymore received, valuable consideration for the bonds, which the Bank acquired under transactions that were <span style="text-decoration:underline">separate</span> from the loans. In such circumstances the Bank is not obliged to give credit for any subsequent appreciation in the value of, or income earned on, the bonds – these are collateral matters – and such sums are not required to be taken into account. The position would be the same if (for example) losses had been suffered whilst the Bank continued to hold the bonds – any such loss could not be placed at the Shareholders’ door. </p>

LBCS was incorporated in Cyprus on 22 February 2010; its nominee shareholder was Mr Zacharoulis. The shares were held on trust for the Shareholders personally, as the Shareholders well knew. In this regard, the administration of LBCS was transferred to Vassiliades in September 2011, with the Letter of Engagement<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">“to act for ourselves and always upon our instructions and or authorization”</span>) and accompanying Deed of Indemnity signed personally by each of the Shareholders.

As with other Borrowers, such ownership was subsequently concealed behind “nominee UBOs” supplied by Mr Worsley. Indeed on 15 July 2013 (so around the time when the loans to LBCS were made, each of the Shareholders as <span style="font-style:italic">“[b]eneficial owner”</span> of LBCS signed a letter of instruction to “transfer” their beneficial title to Tactio (which was, of course, another Shareholder Company). The following day, “title” was transferred (again on the written instructions of the Shareholders), to Seilwood Investments Ltd (“Seilwood”), a company held by Mr Chadwick who was another of Mr Worsley’s UBOs – thereby concealing the ultimate true beneficial ownership of the Shareholders of LBCS. </p>

LBCS was required to use the funds for the purpose of “<span style="font-style:italic">purchasing securities</span>”. Once again there was no collateral, and the interest rate was very low. It was approved at CC meeting on 19 June 2013 which was chaired by Mr Yurov. There was no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interests in LBCS and there was a similar format to those that had been prepared for Erinskay and Baymore (as already addressed) – and as usual the false impression created was that this was a genuine, arm’s length, third party borrower which, as Mr Yurov of course knew, was untrue (not least given his involvement in the various transfers of ownership already identified also involving the other Shareholders).  The report contained blatant lies including <span style="font-style:italic">“LB Collection Services Ltd does not have a current card file of unpaid documents to bank accounts, unfulfilled obligations to the budgets of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Cyprus, as well as overdue debts to employees on wages”</span> and purported to address the (allegedly) satisfactory financial position of the company,  <span style="font-style:italic">“… the financial position from the point of view of most indicators seems to be satisfactory, financial indicators are at a sufficient level in relation to standard values and are not inferior to similar financial institutions - non-bank institutions that are comparable in size and nature of business …”</span>. All untrue and positively misleading. As with Erinskay and Baymore (and Mourija) Mr Yurov’s approach (hardly consistent with his duties) was not even to give the loan independent consideration, he denied needing to know whether and how the borrower was going to be able to repay the loan and he accepted that he did not in fact know how that was going to happen. He accepted that the “balance sheet management” borrowers Erinskay, Baymore, Mourija and LBCS could only comply with their obligations under the repo transactions (fund the margin calls and then buy back the securities) if they were given more money to do so from the Bank or other such companies. </p>

There is nothing to suggest that these were other than shell companies used as part of the offshore network – this was not commercial lending on LBCS’s part. To further a pretence that LBCS was funding the transfers from its own purported trading activities some of the cash was first recycled by purchasing and then repo’ing bonds. There was no good reason for any of this activity which I am satisfied was simply designed to obscure.  1476.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>No sooner had the funds been received by Drenville, Lemford and Seilwood then they were transferred on to other companies owned by the Shareholders, including from Drenville to Beadon (which bought bonds from SiberianKD), Dunemor (which bought a portfolio of loans from Biznesaktiv (Mr Davidson cannot trace the funds beyond that)), Taransay, Haverson and Brean, and from Lemford to Mefrito (who bought shares in a real estate unit fund from Fintailor (Mr Davidson cannot trace the finds beyond that)), whilst Seilwood issued loans to Nikilin (which purchased a promissory note issued by Zosimal from LLC Belt (Mr Davidson cannot trace the funds past Belt)). The likes of Biznesaktiv, Fintailor and Belt are “Category (3)” type companies (addressed in the Bank’s Points of Loss document), as to which Sections N.2.6 and N.2.6.1 are repeated. In terms of tracing as to where money ended up, I do not consider it appropriate to draw inferences that go beyond the expert evidence before me.

Drenville did not provide any collateral for this loan.

Associated questions were put to Mr Allen in cross-examination. It is said that Taransay has repaid all the funds which it received from LBCS with full interest and the Bank has not lost as a result of the payment (and indeed received interest). It is said the position would have been no different if Taransay had borrowed funds from a third-party bank instead.  </p>

This is hardly an attractive submission, as whether or not any benefit could be realised,  the Shareholders had increased their share in the Bank, and as such benefitted, through the use of the Bank’s own money. However, no separate claim arises out of the benefit itself. 1490.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In terms of other parts of the first LBCS loan, Mr Davidson has shown that RUB 531.2 million of the first LBCS loan via various offshore companies ended up with SiberianKD, which then used it to repay a loan to the Bank (i.e. misapplying the LBCS loan proceeds for the purpose of discharging a liability of a company admittedly owned by the Shareholders.  In addition some RUB 145 million of the first loan was used to purchase the rights of assignment of loans made by the Bank to retail borrowers.  In this regard, Mr Davidson tracks US$12 million issued to Erinskay, Baymore and LBCS as having been received by Biznesaktiv, which was further used by Biznesaktiv to acquire a retail portfolio with a face value of RUB 3,526.7 million m from the Bank. The Bank points out that the as a net result of this transaction, the Bank lost a retail portfolio with a face value of RUB 3,526.7 million (the consideration of RUB 713.6 million being paid to the Bank from the Bank’s own funds). There is no evidence as to the value of the loan portfolio but neither is there any evidence that it was worth only a fraction of its face value. </p>

These, in turn, were recycled through the Bank Winter scheme, whereby Black Coast “returned” the bonds on 9 September 2013, only to get them back four days later (and not traced further). It is difficult to see any purpose for all the various transfers other than to mislead both the Bank’s auditors and the CBR (the transactions are considered further in relation to Black Coast (Section R.6)). Such matters, which fall within Category (4) of the Bank’s Points of Loss Table, are in any event collateral to the Bank’s loss (LBCS’s outstanding liability to the Bank). </p>

It is the Bank’s case that the proceeds were then deployed not for any legitimate business of Mourija’s (not that Mourija had any legitimate business), but for the personal benefit of the Shareholders through refinancing liabilities originally incurred to enable them to purchase Mr Kolyada’s stake in the Bank, and to fund a capital injection into the Bank itself.

The stated purpose of the loan was <span style="font-style:italic">“replenishment of working capital, purchase of the bank’s promissory notes” </span>and the Bank was entitled to require early repayment if there was an Event of Default (cl. 3.6), including a breach of Mourija’s obligation to use the loan for the stated purpose (cl 8.1(b)).

There was no proper basis for such repeated deferment of not only principal but also interest – i.e. unlike normal commercial arms-length loans Mourija was not even required to service the loan on a regular and ongoing basis. Such amendments were approved at CC meetings on 9 February 2011 (chaired by Mr Yurov); 22 February 2012 (chaired by Mr Fetisov); 20 June 2012 (chaired by Mr Yurov); 6 February 2013 (chaired by Mr Yurov); and 28 February 2014 (chaired by Mr Yurov and attended by Mr Fetisov).

Mr Yurov submits that the latter is a more natural way to look at it, as in order to link the Mourija funds to the payment for the CLNs Mr Allen splits the funds into a payment of US$ 31.6 million (the total sum paid for the CLNs) and one of US$ 4.4 million (the remainder, which he acknowledges went to EWUB) whereas there is no factual basis for such split and, having regard to the timing, the EWUB payment was made on 11 March and the CLN payment on 12 March, so the Bank would have had to predict on 11 March that it would need US$ 31.6 million on 12 March for the CLNs and set that those funds aside, only sending the remaining US$ 4.4 million balance as part of the EWUB scheme. </p>

At one point he even went so far as to say that he did not even “<span style="font-style:italic">recognise TIBI and the role it is claimed to have played in these transactions</span>”, which I am satisfied was untrue. </p>

The terms were otherwise materially the same as the first loan. Some RUB 535 million was, in the event, drawn down. It was approved at a CC meeting on 27 October 2011 that was chaired by Mr Yurov, and again there was no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interests in Mourija.  The subsequent life of the loan followed a similar pattern to that of the first loan, with extensions of the principal repayment date (ultimately to 14 November 2017) and the interest schedule was revised, with a significant proportion of the interest being deferred until the end of the extended term.  The amendments were approved at a series of CC meetings which were all chaired by Mr Yurov (on 20 June 2012; 30 October 2012; 27 February 2013; and 21 October 2014).  There is an example of Mr Yurov’s involvement in authorising the creation of a false and backdated record of the CC meeting on 30 October 2012. In this regard, on 8 November 2012 he was asked by Mr Postnov to <span style="font-style:italic">“instruct the secretary of the Bank’s Credit Committee to include the decisions in accordance with the attached drafts in the minutes of the committee meeting held on 30/10/2012”.</span>  The second item to be “inserted” into the minutes concerned the extension of the second Mourija loan.  Mr Yurov candidly acknowledged that he <span style="font-style:italic">“…agreed to include this into the minutes of the Credit Committee. That’s my signature”.</span> In this regard I understood him to be accepting that there was, in fact, no discussion of the Mourija loan at the 30 October 2012 meeting (with the consequence that, on his own evidence he was involved in knowingly falsifying what purported to be a record of the meeting). After questions from the Court, Mr Yurov said this to Mr Pillow: </p>

Filenta was the owner of an office building at 5 Spartskovskaya Street in Moscow, which was an office building occupied by the Bank as its head office (the premises). In September 2012, Filenta borrowed RUB 3.59 billion from the Bank. The credit facility was approved by the CC, chaired by Mr Yurov. The proceeds of the loan were used to repay the indebtedness of SiberianKD and Wave. In July 2014, the debt was converted into US$, as a result of which Filenta owed $103.5 million to the Bank. The conversion was approved by the CC, chaired by Mr Yurov with Mr Fetisov recorded as voting in favour <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> (but this is not admitted by Mr Fetisov). In September 2014, Filenta’s liability was transferred to LLC5. This was approved by the CC, chaired by Mr Yurov with Mr Fetisov recorded as voting in favour <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> (but this is not admitted by Mr Fetisov). The day before LLC5 assumed the obligations of Filenta, the mortgage agreement over the premises was terminated by mutual consent of the Bank and Filenta. In late October 2014, LLC5 transferred its interest in Filenta to Delharem Holdings Ltd. The premises were transferred by Filenta to the Bank pursuant to an agreement dated 20 November 2014 (varied on 22 December 2014) for the issue of shares to Filenta in exchange for title to the premises. </p>

The Shareholders’ interest in Filenta was originally held through their own vehicle, TIBI. On 4 May 2009, TIBI “sold” its 100% shareholding in Filenta to Crylani for RUB 2.06 billion (TIBI itself had only spent about RUB 942 million on the acquisition, according to the spreadsheet attached to Mr Fetisov’s “hidden assets and financings” email to Mr Eggleton on 14 October 2008).   This was part of an effort made, I am satisfied, with the knowledge and approval of the Shareholders in the second half of 2008 and early 2009, to inject as much cash as possible into TIBI to enable it to discharge its obligations to EWB/Donau (see further Section R.12 below). The purchase by Crylani of the shares in Filenta was funded through an entirely circular transaction whereby TIBI repaid a loan to Crylani and the funds were then transferred by Crylani back to TIBI as consideration under the Filenta SPA.

So far as the Crylani loan is concerned, no tracing link can be established because the purchase of shares in Filenta was funded with cash transferred by TIBI itself on 6 May 2009 in “repayment” (the source of these funds of TIBI has not been ascertained but I accept that it is likely to be the Bank itself, through either EWB or Donau). In relation to the LLC5 loan, and as demonstrated by Mr Davidson’s analysis, this was in fact itself the product of a multi-step refinancing of an earlier “repayment” by Crylani of some RUB 3.2 billion of its loan from the Bank.  Mr Davidson accepted that the funds supposedly repaid by Crylani, or a substantial part of those funds, in fact end up being owed to the Bank by LLC5. Crylani then used the proceeds of its loan from the Bank to inject cash into TIBI </p>

In January 2011, it loaned money to LLC5 to buy Filenta from its previous owner, Crylani; the loan was secured by a pledge over the Building. In May 2012 (apparently in response to a CBR direction), it refinanced the loan to LLC5 with a new loan directly to Filenta. That loan was due to expire in August 2012. The Bank granted a one-month ‘bridge’ which in effect discharged the loan with funds sent to Filenta via other companies, before issuing a new loan to Filenta for the same amount in September 2012. The overall effect of these transactions was neutral; they had no net effect on the Bank’s financial position. At each stage the funds left and returned to the Bank within a short period, usually a matter of days. </p>

There was no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interest in Filenta or LLC5 (as there clearly should have been), nor of the real purpose of the loan which was to discharge the liabilities of SiberianKD and Wave (themselves being the latest in a series of steps to refinance, ultimately, TIBI’s liabilities including to the entity Donau). Instead, the CC resolution recorded the purpose of the loan to be <span style="font-style:italic">“payment to Brenworth Finance Ltd under agreement dated 10 July 2012”</span> (which whilst literally true, was in reality seriously misleading because, as Mr Davidson demonstrated, Brenworth was just a vehicle for the onward transmission of the funds to SiberianKD and Wave). </p>

Subsequently, the “preliminary agreement” was cancelled (so as to give an apparent justification for a movement of cash back to Brenworth).

There is no evidence that the CC considered what would have been obvious matters to be considered before agreeing to such a change (such as the financial standing of LLC5). Of course the reality was that LLC5 had no real business activity, no revenue stream and its only asset, aside from a small sum in cash held in an account at the Bank, was its interest in Filenta – which was subsequently sold to two other offshore companies owned by the Shareholders – Delharem and Estrenor   – in exchange for promissory notes of no value.  Again, there was no good reason for the CC to make the resolution <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span>. Contrary to any normal banking transaction, the decision was made to permit the transfer of the liabilities to LLC5 before execution of the pledge agreement – so that the Bank was exposed to a risk of a default with no collateral. </p>

At a further CC meeting on 20 October 2014 (chaired by Mr Yurov), unanimous approval was given to a guarantee being issued by Filenta in respect of LLC5’s liabilities under the (novated) loan.  Once again there was no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interest in Filenta or LLC5. On 20 November 2014, the Bank entered into an agreement (varied on 22 December 2014) to issue shares to Filenta in exchange for title to the Premises, the value of which was ultimately stated to be RUB 1.38 billion.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the latter point, there are a number of answers. The first is that this point was not, I am satisfied, pleaded, as it should have been if such a point was to be advanced. This is not a technical pleading point for two reasons – first it is clear from points that the Shareholders did plead in relation to quantum (but are no longer in issue) that they (rightly) recognised that it was necessary specifically to plead any alleged credits. The second point (which follows on from the first) is that one of the reasons why it is necessary to plead such points is that the Bank would have been entitled to, and would have wished to, adduce expert <span style="text-decoration:underline">valuation</span> evidence. It would be prejudicial and unjust were the Shareholders to be allowed to pursue such a case at this stage, not least in circumstances where there is a considerable difference in the figures relied upon by the parties based on such limited valuations as are before me. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second, and fundamental point, is that the Bank would not, in any event, be obliged to give any credit. It is common ground that the Premises were transferred to the Bank pursuant to an agreement dated 20 November 2014 (varied on 22 December 2014) for the issue of shares to Filenta in exchange for title to the Premises. As the Bank rightly points out, this constitutes neither a recovery nor unrealised collateral, but a separate transaction involving a transfer of the Premises for valuable consideration. Thus, any benefit is collateral. The fact that subsequently the shares were rendered worthless, following the Bank’s collapse, makes no difference to the point of principle. Moreover, there is no principled basis on which the transfer of the Premises (by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Filenta</span>) in exchange for shares in the Bank should reduce the liability of the new borrower (<span style="text-decoration:underline">LLC5</span>) under the novated loan agreement.  </p>

This simply shows that any alleged benefit is collateral. In any event Mr Davidson’s own evidence is that the LLC5 loan proceeds are traceable ultimately to TIBI’s repayment of its debts, including to Donau, but not to the purchase of the Premises, and the “<span style="font-style:italic">end position</span>” in relation to the LLC5 loan is that the “<span style="font-style:italic">principal balance outstanding on the loan, net of repayments made, is USD 90.1m</span>”<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span> and Mr Davidson does not say that credit should be given for the value of the Premises. </p>

Thus, the Bank took 19 percent of the shares onto its balance sheet (the maximum amount below the affiliation threshold) and Gofra retained the remaining 51 percent. Mr Iskandyrov confirmed that it was ‘absolutely correct’ that this split was put in place to avoid formal affiliation and to preserve the Bank’s capital. The Bank impugns this transaction, ‘the Gofra Transaction’, but it was an entirely intra-group transaction, which transferred shares from the Bank’s subsidiary to the Bank itself.

As the Bank rightly points out, this transaction would make no sense if Gofra was owned by the Bank itself as, on that basis, the Bank would have been purchasing 19% of Stivilon from itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">It is common ground why the Bank’s purchase of an interest in Stivilon had to be limited to a 19% stake.  If the Bank bought 20% or more of Stivilon, then issues would have arisen in relation to affiliation and consolidation. Mr Zavadsky explains that IFRS require a partial consolidation of the accounts of the Bank and those of any company in which it owns 20% or more of the shares.</p>

It is clear on the evidence, however that Gofra was beneficially owned <span style="text-decoration:underline">by the Shareholders</span>.  In this regard Gofra was incorporated in Cyprus in April 2007 and was part of the offshore network transferred to the management of Vassiliades in 2011. On 2 September 2008, Mr Drozdov sent an email to the Shareholders attaching a series of corporate structure diagrams for “Non affiliates”.  One of these diagrams shows that Gofra was a wholly owned subsidiary of a company called Jermanta Limited. Gofra was similarly shown as a subsidiary of Jermanta in charts sent to Mr Worsley in 2010.  Jermanta was another company transferred to the management of Vassiliades in 2011.  In December 2011, each of the Shareholders personally signed indemnities declaring themselves to be the beneficial owners of both Gofra and Jermanta.  A document dated 2 August 2013, sealed with the Gofra corporate seal, identifies the Shareholders as the beneficial owners of Gofra. Whilst the Bank’s 2010 audited accounts suggest that Gofra became a Bank subsidiary in May 2010 this is inconsistent with the documents referred to above, and I am satisfied that they reveal the true position.  At the time at which Gofra actually held the interest in Stivilon, it was owned by the Shareholders personally through Jermanta. However, the point is academic as, by May 2010, Gofra had ceased to have any interest in Stivilon (as the Shareholders’ 51% interest had been transferred from Gofra to Elis Trade). </p>

As I have found, all of these companies were Shareholder companies. In that regard in relation to Elis Trade, both the 2008 and 2010 corporate structure diagrams show that Elis Trade was a subsidiary of a Cypriot company called Nomiranta Limited. Nomiranta was, in turn, also a company beneficially owned by the Shareholders. Thus, on 19 September 2011, the nominee shareholder of Nomiranta, Mr Clerides, signed three separate Deeds of Trust confirming that he held the 1,000 shares in Nomiranta for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Shareholders</span> (428 shares for Mr Yurov and 286 shares each for Mr Belyaev and Mr Fetisov).

As already noted, the CC protocol recorded that the leasehold rights to the land were in fact worth RUB 6 billion, but this figure was unjustified and made no sense given that, only a year earlier, Gofra had disposed of 51% of Stivilon at a price that implied an overall value for the company of only RUB 1.45 billion.

I am in no doubt that the Shareholders must have known that Stivilon was not generating revenue of its own and that its interest obligations would have to be, and were, serviced through (inappropriate) “balance sheet management” loans (often through complex schemes such as money being routed to Black Coast so it could make the interest payment on behalf of Stivilon (as to which see the email from Mr Butylkov of Columba to Mr Worsley and others dated 11 March 2014). Mr Yurov, in his witness statement sought to create the impression that Stivilon was servicing the interest repayments from its own funds: “<span style="font-style:italic">It appears from the [DIA Report] that Stivilon successfully serviced its indebtedness to the Bank at least until April 2015… and it appears that Stivilon was financially stable until at least 2014”.</span>  Stivilon had no commercial income, and as such I do not consider it was apt to describe it as “<span style="font-style:italic">financially stable</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">After the making of the initial Stivilon loan there was also a subsequent history of the approval of deferments of interest. Thus, on 22 June 2012, the Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to Supplementary Agreement No. 25 so as to defer a portion of the interest payable by Stivilon, the amendment being approved by the CC on 20 June 2012, with Mr Yurov acting as chairman and voting in favour of the amendment. The minutes do not provide any commercial rationale as to why the Bank should agree to defer a substantial portion of the interest (merely containing a description of the amendment), and it is difficult to see what that rationale would be (so far as the interests of the Bank are concerned). On 7 March 2013, the Loan Agreement was amended again to extend the date for repayment of the principal by three years to 7 March 2016, being approved by the CC on 27 February 2013 with Mr Yurov again acting as Chairman. Again, there was merely a description of the amendment in the minutes without any attempt to explain any commercial rationale or justification for the Bank deferring repayment of the loan for a further three years and it is again difficult to see what that rationale would be (so far as the interests of the Bank are concerned). The effect of the amendments was simply to benefit the owners of Stivilon, either in terms of reducing interest or deferring when the principal of the loan would have to be paid back. Faced with the minutes Mr Yurov’s attempts to distance himself from the decisions even went so far as to say that the CC document was not <span style="font-style:italic">“authentic”</span>. I accept, however, the unchallenged evidence of Mr Popkov that the CC documents in the bundle accurately represent what was on the Bank’s files. </p>

This was a project that was a long way from fruition and its prospects remained speculative. In his oral evidence, which I accept, Mr Mylnikov explained that the Bank had tried to auction the land at a substantial discount to the appraised market price but nobody wanted to buy it. In such circumstances it is questionable whether there even was a readily ascertainable market value, still less in excess of the figure at which the Bank took over the leasehold rights to the land.  </p>

Equally, the Shareholders’ reliance on funds transferred back to separate entities not the Bank (i.e. Category (3) transfers) are irrelevant to any issues of loss or quantum, as are any funds transferred to the Bank but under separate transactions (i.e. Category (4) transfers) – which are collateral matters irrelevant to any issue of loss or quantum.

There is nothing inherently wrong with fiduciary lending. However, the Bank says that the essential purpose of the Black Coast scheme was for the Bank to provide a large amount of cash to Black Coast in a way that could be disguised in the Bank’s audited accounts. This involved the Bank purchasing a substantial amount of Russian government bonds and then lending them, via Bank Winter, to Black Coast so that it could use them to raise funds by means of repo transactions.  The Bank says the transactions with Bank Winter were organised in such a way that the Bank could falsely represent to the auditors and the CBR that it was still the owner of the Bonds, that they were held by Bank Winter in the Bank’s custody account, and thus that they were an asset on the Bank’s balance sheet. In this regard the Bank has commenced proceedings against Bank Winter in Austria in relation to this scheme in which it asserts that Bank Winter was an active and knowing participant in such a deception, that Bank Winter knew that Mr Worsley was not the UBO of Black Coast and that the proceeds of the securities borrowed and then repo’d by Black Coast were not used to finance any genuine real estate project, but to refinance other back-to-back transactions and for other “balance sheet management” purposes. </p>

However as the Bank rightly points out there is no expert evidence purporting to link these payments with the funding of the Gelendzhik project and indeed no evidence that Gelendzhik was ever funded via EWUB. Mr Davidson did not consider Back Coast in his Issue 3 report and there is no evidence from him that the money received by TIBI (beneficially owned by Shareholders) was “returned” to the Bank by means of a refinancing of any loan made to or in connection with the Gelendzhik project. By way of riposte, Mr Yurov (in his Reply to the Bank’s Points of Loss document) relies on Mr Allen’s tracing evidence of the Black Coast lending and his conclusion that it went to refinance the EWUB portfolio. However, that goes no further than to show the payments identified above. Mr Yurov also relies on Mr Iskandyrov’s evidence and certain documentary evidence which it is submitted show that the Black Coast lending was planned from the outset to finance Stivilon, using the Bank Winter fiduciary lending scheme, and that that is what happened. </p>

In any event the point would ultimately take the Shareholders nowhere even if it could be proved, given that  Stivilon was not a Bank project but rather one that would (if ultimately profitable) have benefitted the Shareholders and Stivilon (through Black Coast) being ultimately beneficially owned by the Shareholders. Accordingly even if it was funded through the Bank Winter fiduciary lending, this would just be another way the Bank’s money was used for (inappropriate) lending for the Shareholders’ benefit.</p>

The standard form of the Master Agreement contains detailed provisions in relation to the collateral to be supplied by the borrower (cl. 5 and the Schedule). Between 7 and 30 September 2011, Bank Winter issued to Black Coast four “Confirmations” pursuant to the Master Agreement setting out the terms of four separate securities lending transactions in respect of Russian government bonds with notional values of US$100 million, US$16.5 million, US$50million and US$8.5 million.  These Confirmations provided that the bonds were to be returned by Black Coast in September 2013 and that the provisions relating to collateral in the Master Agreement were “not applicable” (i.e. Black Coast would not be providing any collateral to Bank Winter). </p>

This was also an umbrella agreement pursuant to which individual repo transactions could be made. As already noted Black Coast then proceeded to repo US$150 million of bonds with Alfa Capital. In consequence, and as Mr Worsley noted in an email to <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Shareholders</span> on 16 May 2012, this left Black Coast exposed to potential margin calls: <span style="font-style:italic">“We must therefore take into account the possibility that we would need to take funding from NBT, get it into Black Coast’s account at NBT, and send from there to Alfa Bank”</span>. Black Coast received the proceeds of these repos (about US$136 million) in its account on 19 September 2011. US$124 million was then transferred from Black Coast’s Piraeus Bank account to TIBI (a company beneficially owned by the Shareholders personally) on 13 and 20 September 2011.

Given the lack of reaction to such letter, Mr Fetisov reverted to saying he paid it little attention, <span style="font-style:italic">“I probably paid very little attention to this email, skipping through first three or four lines, if that, understanding that's not my cup of tea and I would not be going regardless, and that's really it.

On 27 December 2012, a meeting took place between representatives of the Bank and the CBR (attended by Mr Yurov, with Mr Pospelov and Mr Vartsibasov who had been copied into the emails above and who therefore clearly knew the bonds were not in the Bank Winter custody account).  It is clear from the minutes that there was a discussion about whether Bank Winter was a suitable institution to hold US$175 million of Russian government bonds on behalf of the Bank. A number of statements set out in the minutes (coming from the Bank) were untrue. In particular, contrary to what was stated, the bonds were not held by Bank Winter in the custody account. When asked about such matters Mr Yurov conveniently denied any recollection of the meeting before saying, <span style="font-style:italic">“I have my doubts I was there.” </span>I have no doubt he did attend and did not disassociate himself from what was being said.

By a letter to Deloitte’s Moscow office dated 25 March 2014, Bank Winter set out a summary of the Bank’s accounts with Bank Winter.  In relation to securities accounts, the letter simply stated, <span style="font-style:italic">“See attachment”</span>. The attachment consisted of an account statement showing Russian government bonds with a nominal value of US$61.5 million held in the Bank’s account.

This is the loss suffered by the Bank arising out of the Bank Winter Transaction. I reject the Shareholders’ submission that the Bank has suffered no loss. It is necessary to follow through all the transactions concerning the bonds with Bank Winter including that on 13 September 2013, and that transaction does not amount to a break in the chain of causation or mean that the loss is caused by that transaction rather than the initial Bank Winter Transaction. The loss suffered flows from the initial (wrongful) Bank Winter Transaction which was the direct and immediate cause of the loss. I have already addressed why the evidence does not demonstrate that the Bank Winter Transaction was designed to lend Stivilon funds (and in any event the Shareholders’ submission ignores the fact that all loans to Stivilon were for the benefit of the Shareholders as ultimate beneficial owners, as were the transactions involving Black Coast, of which the Shareholders were also the ultimate beneficial owners).   </p>

The change was implemented by the Shareholders’ signing “transfer” documents in their capacity as the beneficial owners of the “transferred” companies. The net result was to transfer the shares to a BVI company, Tranaro Holdings Ltd (“Tranaro”), which was itself held by Mr Laing on trust for Brora, one of the Shareholders’ BVI vehicles.  Then in September 2014 it would appear that a further “restructuring” was carried out when Yeleran came to be nominally owned by Dianthi – the entity through which the Shareholders owned other companies, including Willow River, RCP and Black Coast – and Tranaro’s shareholders became Ushant Investments Ltd and Mr Tunmer, another appointee of Mr Worsley’s.  </p>

For no apparent commercial reason (other that no doubt an inability to pay, or a desire not to have to arrange other loans to pay) only 1/3 of the interest was required to be serviced on an ongoing basis with the principal and 2/3rds of the interest being due on 1 February 2013. StroyEcologiya was obliged to use the loan proceeds exclusively for the purpose of replenishing its working capital and/or its statutory activities. StroyEcologiya’s only asset was the lease over the Glukhovo land. However it is clear that relevant planning approvals had never been granted by the local authority and (even in 2015) there were still ongoing legal proceedings concerning title to the land with a “<span style="font-style:italic">high likelihood that third parties’ title to part of the Project land will be recognised</span>”. On any view there was no proper justification for the value of the land used and Yeleran had purchased its stake in StroyEcologiya for US$18.5 million, which would imply a valuation of US$30 million for 100% of the share capital.</p>

At a CC meeting on 24 November 2010 (chaired by Mr Yurov and attended by amongst others Mr Fetisov)  it was unanimously decided not to exercise the Bank’s right to require early repayment under cl. 9.4 despite an established breach by StroyEcologiya of the terms of the first loan in failing to secure a construction permit by the contractual deadline (this was only two months after the CC again chaired by Mr Yurov extended an additional credit facility of RUB 60 million to StroyEcologiya: see below).  </p>

Despite StroyEcologiya’s history of breaches, lack of liquid assets, and fictitious “profits” to cover up real losses, the terms of the loan were further varied in favour of the borrower (and the Shareholders) pursuant to a resolution of the CC (chaired by Mr Yurov and attended amongst others by Mr Belyaev) on 23 January 2013. The same pattern of inappropriate variations continued with the extending of the date for repayment by two years to 2 February 2015, the granting of a generous extension for the payment of interest (and deferring a significant proportion of it until 2 February 2015), the causing of the Bank to refrain from exercising its contractual right to early repayment; and the (yet further) extension of the deadline for obtaining a construction permit – all to the benefit of the Shareholders. There is no evidence whatsoever of any proper due diligence being conducted by the Bank in respect of the project or the borrower’s prospects of repaying or servicing the loan in relation to any of the CC meetings, and indeed Mr Yurov could not recall seeing any documents by way of due diligence or credit reports or risk memoranda. </p>

Self-evidently (at best) this was a speculative investment as it assumed that the project would be completed (and StroyEcologiya had not even obtained a permit to start the work). It is difficult to see how the investment could be in the Bank’s best interest. It was in reality a cash injection for the benefit of the Shareholders’ company, with the contract being signed by Mr Fetisov without any declaration of self-interest. Mr Fetisov accepted that this was a “<span style="font-style:italic">big deal</span>”, and that “<span style="font-style:italic">possibly</span>” it had been agreed with Mr Yurov and Mr Belyaev. I have no doubt that such a substantial investment (for the benefit of the Shareholders), would have been discussed and agreed between them. This very investment, of course, is inconsistent with the suggestion that StroyEcologiya was the Bank’s project or that StroyEcologiya was a “Bank Company”. Prior to this the Bank’s relationship with StroyEcologiya was purely that of lender/borrower. </p>

Mr Yurov submits that the Bank should give credit for this figure. However, this was an historic figure and so of course did not take into account the current economic crisis and the lack of interest in the land by developers. The valuation pre-dates the severe economic crisis in Russia which took place in 2014. As such I do not consider that it is a reliable guide or reference point in relation to values post such crisis, which is the relevant period for the purposes of evaluating recoveries.  </p>

The purpose of the loan was described as follows “<span style="font-style:italic">The Borrower shall utilize the Loan exclusively for the following purposes: working capital replenishment, repayment of loans, buyout/ redemption of own promissory notes, provision of loans</span>” (see clause 2.3).

Mr Fetisov was keen to attempt to distance himself from this loan as with many others, memorably claiming (for the first time in cross-examination) that he had not been in Moscow when it was approved driving rally cars in Eastern Russia. This rather missed the point that as it was approved <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> he could have been anywhere. This new evidence was inconsistent with the fact that only days earlier it had been agreed by Mr Fetisov’s lawyers that, <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr Fetisov was also present and voted in favour of the loan”</span>. I am quite satisfied that Mr Fetisov gave his approval well knowing that a company he beneficially owned was receiving a loan that was to be used for “balance sheet management” purposes. </p>

There was no attempt to justify the commercial rationale for such changes or why they were in the Bank’s best interests. Given that the proceeds were not even used for the Priangarskiy project, any suggestion relating to Priangarskiy would not have worked. The reality, I am satisfied, is that these amendments (like the original loan) were not in the best interests of the Bank.  </p>

This was, selfevidently, in no one’s interest other than the Shareholders, the other Shareholders no doubt having been consulted in that regard (as it would make no sense for one Shareholder to act unilaterally in this regard). I am quite satisfied that Mr Yurov’s oral evidence in which he claimed that the management of Business Group had approached the Bank with a request for an extension was untrue, there is no documentation in support as one would have expected there would be, and in any event, Business Group was nothing more than a shell company, and most certainly did not have any independent managers. Mr Fetisov’s evidence was that he was not in Moscow when this extension had been approved, but he could, of course, have approved it from wherever he was. The effect of the amendment, and the associated lengthy extension, is that none of the principal of the Business Group loan was ever paid back.  </p>

For loans to be approved for the benefit of the Shareholders without proper declaration of the Shareholders’ interest in Priangarskiy was not in the best interests of the Bank – there was an obvious conflict of interest that needed to be recorded and considered. </p>

Such amendments were clearly not in the best interests of the Bank, but were clearly to the benefit of the Shareholders. Whilst Mr Fetisov claimed in his crossexamination that this extension had been requested by the “director” of Priangarskiy, there is no other evidence of that, and the extension clearly benefitted the Shareholders and not the Bank.  The consequence is that none of the Priangarskiy loans had fallen due by the time the Bank collapsed. Whilst some security was provided (including a worthless guarantee from its parent (shell) company Business Group, also owned by Shareholders) it was not adequate, and the Bank’s loss as of 30 April 2017 was RUB 1,586,320,353 after giving credit for all recoveries.  </p>

In fact this admittedly Shareholder company was only ever used for balance sheet management (telling the lie to the alleged distinction between Bank and Shareholder companies).

I raised the matter with Mr Vartsibasov (whose later role at Columba I describe below). He told me that he had decided to involve SiberianKD in the Bank's bond trading because he needed to transfer some bonds off the Bank's balance sheet as a matter of urgency, and SiberianKD was the only company available which had a satisfactory credit rating at the time. I was not consulted about the loan in advance and was annoyed when I found out about it.

SiberianKD also received funds borrowed by LBCS  and LLC5. There can be no doubt that the Shareholders knew that SiberianKD was being used for “balance sheet management”.  There can be no doubt that both Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov knew this. Thus, for example, on 28 December 2011, Mr Iskandyrov emailed Mr Fetisov and others (copying Mr Yurov) referring to the need to finance the discount on the bonds position and suggesting the use of <span style="font-style:italic">“existing companies”</span> LBCS, <span style="text-decoration:underline">SiberianKD</span>, Wave and TIB Equities.

Mr Allen’s figure for the outstanding principal net of recoveries is RUB 1.7 billion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no evidence before me as to whether there are likely to be future recoveries. Nor is there any pleaded case in that regard. When Mr Mylnikov was asked about the settlement agreement in cross-examination Mr Mylnikov stressed that the Bank did not have the underlying documents actually evidencing the entitlement to the mortgage payments and that Belenfield was a shell company that was entirely unable to collect the debts itself and the settlement agreement placed that burden on the Bank. If the point was to be raised I consider that as the credits to be given against outstanding balances were within Expert Issue 1, the time to deal with any alleged credits was in Mr Davidson’s reports but he did not address credits on the Belenfield transaction at all. There is no evidence before me that would justify the conclusion that there will be future credits to be credited against the sums claimed. </p>

This further tells the lie to the suggestion that Wave and Alliance Development were Bank Companies.

The overwhelming likelihood, I am satisfied, is that the Shareholders would also have known that KPMG were being deceived (given their own knowledge of the companies’ beneficial ownership and why it was important that auditors and the CBR should not become aware of the true position).   </p>

In its original terms it was a RUB 2 billion (RUB 1.881 billion drawn down) at the low interest rate of only 6% per annum, initially for only two months, until 10 October 2011, with interest payable at the end of the term. Wave was obliged to use the funds “<span style="font-style:italic">for the purpose of replenishment of its operating capital</span>”. As is common ground there was no collateral. It was approved at a CC meeting on 9 August 2011, which was attended by Mr Belyaev (chaired by Ms Cherkasova) and, once again, there was no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interests in Wave as there should have been. Whilst Mr Belyaev admits attending this meeting, he portrays matters as if there was a genuine commercial decision being made, when the reality was (as Mr Yurov accepts) that such approvals were “<span style="font-style:italic">largely a formality</span>” (said by reference to “Bank Companies” but clearly apposite in the context of what were actually Shareholder companies).  The terms of the Wave loan were undoubtably favourable, and indeed Ms Podstrekha’s evidence was that in the light of the favourable terms of the Wave loan (including the absence of any collateral or a loan feasibility study), she could not imagine that Wave was a “<span style="font-style:italic">real, genuinely independent company</span>”.

The amendments were approved at a series of CC meetings on 6 October 2011, 7 December 2011, 5 December 2012 and 10 December 2013, all of which were chaired by Mr Yurov and the last one attended by amongst others Mr Fetisov. As was par for the course, there was no disclosure at any of these meetings of the Shareholders’ interests in Wave. There does not appear to have been any credit or risk report or any other due diligence (for his part Mr Yurov had no recollection of the same). Mr Belyaev suggested that the loan was not “<span style="font-style:italic">extended</span>” as this would lead to a higher level of credit risk provision on the Bank’s balance sheet (which did not occur). However, the loan clearly was extended repeatedly so if this should have led to a higher level of credit risk provision it was a failing not to recommend extension only against such a provision (or to reject the application for an extension due to the associated consequences for the Bank). </p>

It is then submitted that no loss was caused to the Bank as it is characterised by the Shareholders as merely (in economic terms) a transfer from a parent company to two of its subsidiaries. However this entirely misses the point. First, the effect of the loan was that Wave was indebted to the Bank in the amount of the loan, and remained so indebted, in the amount of the loan. That loan has never been paid back to the Bank – as such the Bank has suffered a loss in that amount. What Wave did with the monies under separate transactions is collateral. Secondly, and in any event, the payment to an entity other than the Bank (even if a subsidiary of the Bank) is not payment to the Bank and does not stand to be accounted for as such. Companies have separate legal identities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">The Bank’s claim, on the facts that are common ground, is a straightforward one. In March 2014, the Bank transferred a substantial quantity of Russian government bonds to a company called Edenbury Trading Limited (Edenbury Trading) which was, pursuant to an agreement dated 7 March 2014, to act as “custodian” of those bonds in behalf of the Bank. The CC, in a meeting on 11 March 2014, chaired by Mr Yurov but also attended by Mr Fetisov, approved the appointment of Edenbury Trading to provide <span style="font-style:italic">“depository and brokerage services”</span> to the Bank.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">Edenbury Trading was in fact beneficially owned by the Shareholders personally (confirmed by inter alia signed declarations provided by the Shareholders at the time) and, although it was a shell company incorporated in Bermuda, in order to deceive the CBR, fictitious documentation was created to suggest that it was a genuine bona fide business and had premises and employees. </p>

That was however a fiction as the bonds had been transferred away as part of an elaborate “balance sheet management” scheme. Thus, when, following the Bank’s collapse, the Bank wrote to Edenbury Trading requesting the return of the bonds, there was no response and the bonds have not been returned.  Mr Yurov himself accepted that he had <span style="font-style:italic">“not any idea”</span> where the bonds have gone. The Bank therefore claims compensation the market value of the bonds as at 31 December 2015, namely US$89 million.  I am satisfied that this represents the Bank’s loss. </p>

I have already addressed in Section N.2.6.1 why, if the Shareholders had wished to advance the various matters now advanced, they should have been properly pleaded and then expressly addressed by both the experts in relation to Issue 3. It is inherently unsatisfactory for Mr Yurov to seek to pick and choose bits of evidence that it happens was given, when the matters were not fully or properly explored by the experts – which is unsurprising given that the points now sought to be raised were not properly pleaded out. I consider the Bank was right to categorise Edenbury as a particularly egregious example in this regard and for the reasons it gives. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.04in">The reason why Edenbury is a particularly egregious example is because the experts never explored whether monies lent to Edenbury flowed through various companies including Maxfield and then passing those monies to Eligmur and from Eligmur to Maxfield again and then to Edenbury and from Edenbury back to Maxfield and then from Maxfield to Granbay and Granbay to Senworth and Senworth to Barnsten and so on – none of the experts attempted to show or establish what was actually happening through the documents and the bank statements and the underlying agreements that are described as netting agreements and loans and contributions to share capital. Yet this point is said to carry a US$90 million credit. As I have already concluded in Section N.2.6.1 if a litigant was allowed to pursue such points in closing that had not been properly foreshadowed on the pleadings or expressly addressed by both experts this would be trial by ambush of the worst sort. I do not consider that such matters are properly pleaded and as such they cannot properly be pursued in closing.   </p>

That being the case the Shareholders have failed to prove such matters. In any event the general points already identified in Section N.2 (such as in relation to consideration being given for every contract in the alleged chain) would still apply. The long and the short of it is that Edenbury Trading has not returned the bonds to the Bank, and accordingly the Bank has suffered loss in the amount claimed. </p>

Edenbury Investments was a company in the offshore network with a nominee UBO purporting to be its owner (in this case a Mr Turk), but in reality, I am satisfied, another company beneficially owned by the Shareholders themselves. On 27 March 2014, a new shares certificate for Edenbury Trading was issued showing that the new shareholder was TIBH (the Cypriot holding company that was part of the structure through which the Shareholders held their interest in the Bank itself).   </p>

It appears that the Edenbury Transaction was the scheme by which Edenbury Investments would repay Aton/Barnuz – in short bonds owned by the Bank were used to repay Aton the US$91 million but in such a way whereby it was possible to present to the CBR that the Bank still owned the bonds (and accordingly there is some similarity to the Black Coast transaction as it could be presented to the CBR that the Bank still owned those bonds). It is important to note that the evidence is that the debt to Barnuz was a real debt to an independent third party that had to be paid by transferring real value.   </p>

Then there was a “Custody Account Statement” initially produced by Edenbury Trading on 12 March 2014 which showed the bonds in Edenbury Trading’s custody account. The Bank’s official records thereafter showed that the bonds continued to be held in this custody account. False documentation was then prepared purporting to show that Edenbury Trading was a genuine business providing depository services. There is also a further agreement dated 12 March 2014 by which Edenbury Trading was to loan the bonds to Edenbury Investments for one year – the bonds being used to pay off Edenbury Investment’s debt to Barnuz. As Edenbury Investments was itself a Shareholder-owned company it can properly be said that the settlement of that debt was a benefit to the Shareholders.  </p>

There is some material available as to how the bonds were transferred away, specifically a PowerPoint presentation sent by Ms Petrova to Mr Worsley on 27 February 2014; and an excel spreadsheet emailed to Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov by Mr Worsley on 28 July 2015. The Shareholders’ attempted “tracing exercise” in relation to Edenbury showed the bonds and their sales proceeds ultimately disappearing into a series of question marks (where the trail goes cold at a stage of companies that appear to be associated with Aton, which is consistent with the Bank’s case that the purpose of the transaction was to discharge Edenbury Investments’ liability to Aton/Barnuz). More recently Mr Yurov has sought to follow the proceeds through a further series of entities as already noted, but I do not have expert evidence to assist me, and I am simply not in a position to make findings in relation to what is, in any event, an unpleaded point. Of course even had the exercise been demonstrable, any ultimate return to the Bank would be collateral, being based on a series of independent transactions, and so of no assistance to the Shareholders in any event. </p>

Mr Yurov acknowledges that there was substantial fiduciary lending through EWUB and VTB known as Donau, that the Bank was required to reduce the latter by November 2008 and that it was decided to structure asset-backed securities (in the form of LPNs) and to use the funds to reduce the lending. Mr Yurov characterises Oldehove and Crylani as SPVs used as “wrappers” for the issue of the LPNs with them receiving lending from the Bank via TIBI and using the loan funds to purchase the shares in the companies which owned the properties from TIBI. The LPNs were issued backed by pledges over the properties and the shares in the property holding companies. The LPNs were issued to TIBI, TIBI sold them to the Bank for the face value of the loans and used the funds to pay EWUB to repay the interbank lending issued by the Bank so it is said the funds returned to the Bank and that the overall effect was to repackage one form of lending (interbank/fiduciary lending) with another (LPNs secured against property interests). It is said that this did not change the Bank’s net financial position and that the Bank has not suffered a loss. It is also said that the Shareholders were not involved in the making of the Loans or Transactions, and that the totality of their involvement was that Mr Yurov chaired two CC meetings which discussed Oldehove and Crylani 3 and 5 years after the event, and that these meetings did not cause any loss and if any loss was suffered it would have been caused by the original transaction, with the Bank having failed to prove any causal link between the Defendants and the loss claimed.</p>

First it is clear that the Shareholders knew of, approved, and were responsible for all that occurred (and that they acted in breach of duty in that regard). Secondly the Shareholders’ stance ignores (and denies) the fact that TIBI, Oldehove and Crylani were all beneficially owned by the Shareholders, and most fundamentally of all, in the context of loss, it ignores the fact that the loans to the Shareholder companies Oldehove and Crylani have not been repaid and there is some RUB 4,156,460,408 (US$72,941,089 at 30 April 2017) outstanding in relation to Oldehove, and some RUB 3,442,108,340 (US$60,405,033 as at 30 April 2017) outstanding in relation to Crylani.

Whilst they used finance from the Bank to purchase holdings in real estate assets, namely Pokrovka and Degunino (Oldehove) and Veshnyaki and Perevedenovsky (Crylani), they were not operating companies and the proceeds of the loans from the Bank were not invested in the underlying projects. Rather, most of the proceeds were routed to the Shareholders’ other companies – principally, TIBI and used for their personal benefit in the refinancing of TIBI’s debts to Donau and EWB that had been accumulated for a variety of reasons (all involving the Shareholders) including funding personal loans to the Shareholders, the acquisition by TIBI of the properties themselves together with their refurbishment and other “<span style="font-style:italic">bad assets</span>” that ended up on TIBI’s balance sheet. Shareholders’ interests in the transactions were never disclosed.</p>

They also were specifically asked to authorise the Oldehove and Crylani loans in December 2008, and clearly did so. They knew that TIBI (their company) was used to hold (in Mr Fetisov’s own words) “<span style="font-style:italic">hidden assets and financings</span>” which is a reference to the loans made by the Bank through Donau and EWB, which were then used by TIBI<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>for onward lending to the Shareholders personally and to acquire and refurbish the Degunino, Veshyaki and Perevedenovsky developments.  TIBI’s balance sheet included some RUB 3.4 billion of what Mr Drozdov called (in correspondence with amongst others the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Shareholders)</span> “<span style="font-style:italic">bad assets</span>”. As explained in spreadsheets these, and other, loans could not be taken onto the Bank’s balance sheet: the reasons included violation of the CBR’s requirements and the extensive provisioning that would have been required. By the second half of 2008, it had become clear that the inter-bank facilities at Donau and EWUB had to be paid down or reduced, and that TIBI required a large amount of cash to do so. Consequently, a plan was conceived to inject about RUB 7.8 billion of the Bank’s funds into TIBI, with the explicit objective being to “<span style="font-style:italic">close and hang on the bank all the costs on the purchase of the houses (RUB 4.3 billion) </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bad assets (RUB 3.4 billion). TIB Inv will close Donau for a corresponding amount</span>”.

Another example is the manipulation (if not outright falsification) of Oldehove’s accounts by falsely inflating “<span style="font-style:italic">property revaluation gain</span>” in order to “<span style="font-style:italic">improve profit from operations</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">make Q2 profitable</span>” (following which the relevant management report was sent “<span style="font-style:italic">to be signed by the director of the company</span>”).

The spreadsheet also showed a RUB 56 million loan to Mr Eggleton himself. However, there was also a list of loans with comments as to whether they could be included on the Bank’s balance sheet. An example put to Mr Yurov was a loan of RUB 1.1 billion by TIBI to the Yaposha group in relation to which the commentary reads, “<span style="font-style:italic">Unstable financial situation, assumes provisioning of min 21%”</span>. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Mr Fetisov agreed that this meant there was a “<span style="font-style:italic">certain likelihood</span>” that the accounting value of the assets represented by these loans would be 21% lower if the Bank had made the loans than if they were accounted for as “cash or cash equivalents” (and thus the value of this asset was inflated by 27% by reason of the EWB scheme). There were numerous other impaired assets, the value of which was artificially inflated on the Bank’s balance sheet, and many of the items would have to have been written off completely (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.</span>, 100% provision). Amongst the “<span style="font-style:italic">[u]nacceptable assets</span>” were loans to the Shareholders from MC Trust and TIBI (total of RUB 1.25 billion) which could not be included on the Bank’s balance sheet because of “<span style="font-style:italic">N6, N9, N10.1</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">[F]acilitation payments</span>” made by TIBI in the form of “<span style="font-style:italic">non-returnable personal loans (Drozdov, Kuznetsov, Dikusar, Pavliuchenko)</span>” which would amount to a “<span style="font-style:italic">100% loss</span>” and various other “<span style="font-style:italic">[b]ad assets</span>” including those that were “<span style="font-style:italic">realised in order to reduce the reserves of NBT</span>” in 2003, 2004 and 2007. </p>

First, the effect was that they acquired the properties (through TIBI) and retained them (through Oldehove and Crylani) at the expense of the Bank without contributing any of their own funds. Secondly, their company (TIBI) would be discharging its liabilities to Donau using the Bank’s own money supplied through the circuitous and artificial route of supposed asset sales by TIBI. Thirdly as the valuation of the assets had to match the amount of cash required for TIBI it would almost certainly need to be (falsely) high, and fourthly the “<span style="font-style:italic">bad assets</span>” that had to be refinanced included loans made to the Shareholders personally, as well as other loans to their companies, which were now going to be “hung” on the Bank’s balance sheet.

First, Mr Fetisov’s written evidence that he “<span style="font-style:italic">was not personally involved in the Oldehove Transaction</span>” and that it “<span style="font-style:italic">fell outside my area of responsibility</span>” as is his evidence that he had only “<span style="font-style:italic">limited knowledge of the Crylani Transaction itself at the material time</span>”.

The money was immediately transferred to TIBI in transfers disguised variously as loans, consideration for shares in two other Shareholder companies (Royston and Morledge) and an assignment of “loans” previously made to those companies. The amounts paid to, and the resulting windfall to, TIBI is summarised in the Table in Section E of Schedule O/P to the Bank’s Closing Submissions. The effect was that TIBI got a multiple of what it had paid for the equity in Royston and Morledge <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> a separate payment for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">debt</span> of those companies – i.e. double-dipping – the object of which was to extract as much cash out of the Bank as possible, so as to enable TIBI to ‘unload’ Donau.  </p>

The net outcome of this “refinancing” was to shift debt (after converting it to US$) onto the books of LLC5 – of which some $90 million (of principal) remains outstanding.

The Shareholders submit that it was a Bank investment project held for the Bank off balance sheet (i.e. that the Bank, an investment/retail Bank, had chosen to diversify into a joint venture with the Ginza Group a Russian restaurant operator) and that the Shareholders had no personal interest in it. The Bank submits that quite apart from the inherent improbability of such an activity on the part of the Bank, the Shareholders’ submission is demonstrably false and that in fact the Shareholders were the majority owners of the holding company for the Yaposha Group. In such circumstances the question of ownership is addressed in some detail below.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>1875.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>However, by way of overview, the Yaposha Group was made up of numerous entities, including (1) Yaposha CITY, incorporated in Russia; (2) Yaposha Investment Ltd (“YIL”), incorporated in Cyprus; and (3) NRT Holdings Ltd (“NRT”), also incorporated in Cyprus. NRT is the immediate parent company of the operating companies in Russia, including Yaposha City.</p>

One of these offshore entities was a Cypriot Holding Company called Ginza Holdings Limited (“Ginza Holdings”). Whilst (perhaps deliberately) the name of the company suggests that it was part of the Ginza restaurant group, Ginza Holdings was in fact acquired by NRT in July 2010 and thereafter became part of the offshore network held for the benefit of the Shareholders.</p>

I am satisfied that this 19% stake in NRT (which was recorded in the Bank’s audited accounts), was the Bank’s only interest in the Yaposha companies with the Shareholders holding their continuing personal interest in NRT through layers of holding companies, nominee shareholders and directors and “nominee UBOs”.  The fact that senior Bank employees were involved in matters including the restructuring of ownership and debt and the like is yet another example of the Shareholders using Bank employees for their own purposes.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As addressed in due course below, the Bank lent very large sums to the Yaposha companies in a series of loans, in relation to which there was (as usual) no disclosure of the Shareholders’ interest in the Yaposha companies and the loans were documented and accounted for as arm’s length commercial transactions. There was a lack of adequate security. It is also notable that the loans to YIL were clearly made for “balance sheet management” rather than for genuine purposes associated with the restaurant business. In the event the business ultimately failed, and when the Bank collapsed, a sum of over RUB 4 billion was owed by the Yaposha companies. Yaposha is therefore an example of a Shareholder project that ultimately failed (and so was accordingly abandoned by the Shareholders under the pretence that it was a Bank project). I have no doubt that the Shareholders would have claimed it for themselves had it represented a continuing profitable business.</p>

In September 2008, structure charts emailed to <span style="text-decoration:underline">all three</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Shareholders </span>by Mr Drozdov (who at that time was responsible for running the offshore network) showed <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Shareholders</span> as the beneficial owners of 60% of NRT through Tactio. Apart from the inherent improbability of the “<span style="font-style:italic">very accurate</span>” Mr Drozdov having got matters so fundamentally wrong as to ownership, this information did not provoke any howls of protest from the Shareholders. Given the clarity of the information Mr Belyaev even went so far as to resort to the obvious untruth that he deleted all of Mr Drozdov’s emails without reading them – a matter already addressed above in Section C.3.2.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">An initial structure diagram sent to Mr Worsley in December 2009  shows a current holding structure for NRT whereby it was owned (a) 40% by Ginza Holdings; (b) 19% by Elis Trade; and (c) 41% by a company called Zosimal. There is also a proposed new structure for NRT whereby it would be owned (a) 40% by Ginza Holdings; (b) 19% by RSGR Management/YIL; and (c) 41% by RHT Management.  Ginza Holdings originally had other owners but, in July 2010, its entire share capital was sold to NRT in a deal to which the Shareholders were parties with the result that Ginza Holdings came to be a Shareholder company as is shown by a letter from Mr Vassiliades to the Cypriot police and the indemnities signed <span style="text-decoration:underline">by the Shareholders personally</span> in which they declared themselves to be the beneficial owners of Ginza Holdings.  Documents prepared in 2013 show that Ginza Holdings in due course had a “nominee UBO” inserted (Mr Creasey) rendering the ownership structure (deliberately) more opaque, in the usual manner. Elis Trade was also a Shareholder company, as addressed previously (including in Sections F.2.4.3, F.2.5.2 and R.6 above). YIL was another company in the offshore network. It was incorporated by Mr Vassiliades on 22 July 2010 with a Ms Jacqui Lowe (seemingly the owner of a primary school in Zimbabwe) being its purported owner and another of the “nominee UBOs” recruited by Mr Worsley to conceal the Shareholders’ beneficial interests. It appears that at some point she was replaced by Mr Creasey as the nominee UBO of YIL (which was, or became, the parent company of Ginza Holdings). </p>

The Russian LLC called Zosimal was a subsidiary of Nikilin Investments Limited (itself also a Shareholder company).  It was employed in some of the “balance sheet management” schemes. The Cypriot Zosimal was incorporated in 2005 and formed part of the offshore network.

At this stage, the Bank itself had no ownership interest in the Yaposha Group at all. The evidence is also that prior to the loans in respect of which the Bank claims, Yaposha was one of the projects being funded through the EWB scheme, as is clear from Mr Fetisov’s email about “hidden assets” on 14 October 2008 and its attachments showing that there was over RUB 1 billion of lending by TIBI to the Yaposha group.

TIBI (which was, of course a Shareholder company in the holding structure of the Bank) entered into a loan agreement with NRT dated 24 November 2008 by which TIBI lent NRT US$21.1 million. The term of the loan was until 23 November 2012.  This loan was secured by way of a pledge over the share capital in Yaposha CITY.  Given that involvement of TIBI in the EWB scheme, it is likely that this loan was funded via the EWB Scheme.  On 11 December 2008 the loan was assigned by TIBI to the Bank by way of an assignment agreement.  The assignment of the loan to the Bank was approved by the CC on 24 November 2008.  The meeting was chaired by Mr Yurov and no disclosure was made of the Shareholders’ interest in NRT (at this stage it appears they had a 60% interest in NRT). There is no evidence of any due diligence considering whether it was in the Bank’s best interest to take over this loan (as there clearly should have been). By an “Additional Agreement” dated 23 November 2012, the Bank agreed to extend the date for repayment until 23 November 2015. There is no evidence of any justification for the same, or consideration whether the same was in the Bank’s best interests.  The loan had not been paid back at the time of the Bank’s collapse.   </p>

The loan proceeds were used for the purchase by YIL of shares in NRT from Ginza Holdings. Thus, the loan funds were being advanced by the Bank to enable one Shareholder company to purchase shares in NRT from another Shareholder company – this was all part of a “balance sheet management” scheme facilitating the individual Yaposha companies to service their loans with the Bank’s own money (as is also shown in a PowerPoint presentation sent to Mr Worsley on 18 September 2013).   </p>

The reality is shown by the contemporary documents. As early as January 2012 Mr Yurov and Mr Fetisov were copied on an email chain in which Ms Rusakova of Yaposha reported that:<span style="font-style:italic"> “It is also obvious that the company does not have its own funds to independently finance the interest on the loans… If it does not get an overdraft, the company has no choice but to declare default…”.</span> Once the continuing stream of loans secured without declaration of the Shareholders’ obvious conflict of interest dried up Yaposha went bust. Whilst Mr Fetisov claimed during the course of his cross-examination that Yaposha just experienced cashflow difficulties after Christmas because of seasonal trading variations and had revenues of over US$100 million there is no independent evidence of either (and of course the latter does not even mean the business was necessarily profitable), and in any event the evidence is clear – Yaposha needed a constant stream of loans to service its debt, and when they stopped it defaulted. </p>

Mr Yurov submits that far from supporting the Bank’s claim they go to undermine it. It is submitted that the making of the Loans was very much in the interests of the Bank in that the Shareholders ensured that the Bank received full payment for distressed CLNs (in circumstances where they could, it is said, fairly have paid the Bank what is said to be the going rate of 34%), the Loans were not on “soft terms” but were commercial, the Loans were very well secured, and the Bank received substantial interest on the Loans each year. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Yurov’s submissions rather miss the point. There is no doubt that Willow River and RCP were different – they related to valuable Russian retail properties leased to genuine third party businesses including Billa, a German owned supermarket chain operating in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia who paid significant sums in rent. The key point, however, is that the<span style="font-style:italic"> modus operandi </span>of the Shareholders was similar to the other projects and other borrowings, with WR/RCP set up, administered and operated in the same way as the other offshore companies. WR/RCP (in contrast to other projects) were successful and made the Shareholders rich (albeit it was the Bank’s money being used to make them rich), and they chose to receive the rewards in a manner designed to conceal the benefits they received. They also approved amendments which were selfevidently in their interest rather than the best interests of the Bank, all the more so as the Bank’s collapse became imminent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Shareholders were also remarkably coy about WR/RCP being set up and operated for their benefit (consistent with the stance in relation to the offshore network generally). For example, Mr Yurov, in evidence, claimed to have little recollection of the specifics of the transactions, nor as to how much rent the portfolio produced. He and the other Shareholders clearly should have declared their interest in WR/RCP before approving loans (see section M.8.4) and equally clearly did not do so. The Shareholders’ coyness is, however,  understandable – they had employed exactly the same techniques with WR/RCP as with the other companies beneficially owned by them to conceal their interest – the only difference is that on this occasion the project had come good, and so they reaped the rewards (via a remarkably circuitous route for which there would have been no need had they not concealed their beneficial ownership). The reality was that, as with the other offshore companies, there was nothing in the documentation on the Bank’s files revealing their ownership, and as already addressed in Section I.3.3 positive lies had been told to the CBR as to beneficial ownership. To the very end, Mr Yurov would not accept that telling the CBR that Mr Laing, who ran a travel agency, was the beneficial owner of Willow River was a lie.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Turing first to the acquisition of the Portfolio, this can be broken down into four stages. The first involved the lending of US$125.5 million to RTM. The Portfolio was initially owned by a Russian group known as RTM. In March 2008, the Bank lent RTM US$125.5 million through the issue of CLNs via TIBE and CRR BV.  RTM’s liabilities were secured on the Portfolio, valued as of 30 November 2007 at US$185 million. Between 2008 and 2009, the Bank sold 1,133 CLNs into the market, retaining the remaining 267 CLNs. The second stage was the acquisition of defaulted CLNs when, in 2009, RTM defaulted and TIBE re-acquired most of the now-distressed CLNs with further loans from the Bank, including via Oil Group. TIBE then transferred the CLNs to Sapkont (another Shareholder company) and Sapkont transferred them to Costells (another Shareholder Company as Mr Fetisov admitted in cross-examination), along with US$12 million in cash.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The position therefore, as of August 2010 was that Costells, a Shareholder company  held the majority of RTM’s debt, which was secured on the Portfolio and which had been purchased using loans made by the Bank to other Shareholder companies – indeed this process was accurately described by Mr Fetisov in his first witness statement where he stated,  <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr Yurov, Mr Belyaev and I decided that we would instead attempt to acquire a controlling majority of the RTM bonds ourselves. Between 2009 and 2010 we therefore set out about buying them up through corporate vehicles (the precise details of which I cannot recall). We did so using loans provided on commercial terms by the Bank.” </span>Such an approach was, it will be recognised, similar to (and also involved the use of Oil Group) in relation to the acquisition of the Amelside Comnet CLNs in respect of the Glukhovo (StroyEcologiya) project.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The third stage was that the acquisition costs were refinanced with further loans to Shareholder companies. Whilst it is not clear precisely how the refinancing took place (and Mr Fetisov challenges various assumptions made by Mr Allen) it appears that the loans from the Bank used to finance the purchase of the CLNs by TIBE and Oil Group were then in turn partly re-financed using further loans to other Shareholder companies,  including (says the Bank) Jermanta and Business Group, Willow River and RCP themselves  and StroyEcologiya.

In December 2010, Vorsa sold the Portfolio to WR/RCP for US$112.5 million, financed by loans from the Bank  secured by: (a) mortgages over the Portfolio; and (b) a pledge of 75% of the shares in WR/RCP. The Shareholders thereby became the ultimate beneficial owners of the Portfolio and WR/RCP became entitled to the rental income therefrom (which averaged US$22 million per year between 2011 and 2013 and which was used in part to service the interest on the WR/RCP Loans). </p>

Mr Worsley and Mr Laing, of course, actually held their interests on behalf of the Shareholders, as did the other “nominee UBOs”. In common with the other offshore companies, the precise ownership structure of WR/RCP changed over time and the precise details do not matter. However, given that WR/RCP were producing money it was necessary to create a route to pay money to the Shareholders personally.

Mr Fetisov was in charge of this process for the Shareholders; and Mr Worsley undertook negotiations on their behalf. Not content with reaping the rewards of any such sale the Shareholders wished to ring-fence themselves on any associated liability on sale warranties, and so the proposed sale was going to involve interposing the Bank between WR/RCP and the purchasers so that the Bank would be the party giving the warranties to the purchasers and thereby taking the financial risk associated with the same – <span style="font-style:italic">“(“Summary: 1) NBT will be the seller to you, and will stand behind the warranties…”</span></p>

US$20.6 million was then transferred from Selsea to Kuri Hills’ account at Bordier a few days later. This just seems to have been regarded as a convenient (concealed) way of transferring money to Kuri Hills (ostensibly owned and controlled by Mr Worsley) and then on to the Shareholders’ Swiss Bank accounts. Indeed, upon receipt, Mr Worsley immediately moved US$7.3 million, to Mr Fetisov, US$7.3 million, to Mr Yurov and US$5.9 million, to Mr Belyaev, in each case to their own private bank accounts at Bordier. The only possible purpose for this elaborate  series of transfers is to conceal the very fact that the monies were going to the Shareholders personally. As the rental income received on the bank accounts of WR/RCP significantly exceeded the amount required to service the WR/RCP Loans, Mr Worsley regularly swept surplus cash from those companies, via Kuri Hills, to the Shareholders’ Swiss bank accounts at Bordier. This whole approach is redolent, I am satisfied, with ensuring that the Shareholders’ ownership of, and benefit from, WR/RCP was concealed. I am also satisfied that the Shareholders cannot but have known about receipt of these moneys and their origin (indeed Mr Worsley would inform Mr Yurov of these transfers by text or WhatsApp). </p>

As is readily apparent, any lease payments were very much less than the handsome profits that Shareholders were taking for themselves year on year. Furthermore in times of volatility it would, self-evidently, be in the Bank’s best interest to be paid in hard currency. It also ignores the fact (strongly relied upon by the Shareholders) that the Bank had security worth very much more than the amounts outstanding. This was, and was obviously, nothing other than the softening of the loan terms for the benefit of the borrower (and so the Shareholders) as a result of which there was an obvious conflict of interest.  To suggest otherwise is as brazen as it is misconceived. </p>

The consequence of the release of the pledge (benefitting only the Shareholders) was that the shares in WR/RCP could be transferred without the Bank’s knowledge or consent. Indeed this was what the Shareholders sought to do in 2015 through the proposed sale to the PhosAgro group owned by the Guriev family. The Shareholders were only successfully prevented from doing so by an injunction granted by Burton J on the Bank’s application in late January 2016 once this scheme had been revealed by the disclosure of documents by Mr Worsley in late 2015.  It is clear that this was not an arm’s length commercial sale but one designed to put WR/RCT beyond the Bank’s reach, with the buyers’ English solicitors (Brown Rudnick) stating that <span style="font-style:italic">“[t]his is not a normal commercial deal and that seems to be lost on their friend at Mishcon [the Shareholders’ then English solicitors]” </span>{D6/155.1/1}.
