	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell Navigation Corporation (“Springwell”), the effective claimant in these proceedings, was, at all material times for the purpose of this litigation, the investment vehicle of the Polemis family, who owned and operated a large Greek shipping fleet.  By its counterclaim, Springwell makes various claims against a number of companies within the JP Morgan Chase Group (collectively, and individually, where precise designation does not matter, referred to as “Chase”), in respect of mark to market losses which arose on Springwell’s emerging markets investment portfolio following the Russian financial crisis, and default by the Russian State on certain of its financial obligations, in August 1998.  Springwell also makes claims against Chase in respect of events which occurred after the Russian default.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the 1990s, Springwell had invested very heavily in emerging markets, acquiring, through Chase, a portfolio of debt instruments with a face value of over United States dollars (“$” or “dollars”) 700 million.  In particular, during 1997 and 1998, Springwell had built up substantial investments in Russian bonds or instruments referenced to Russian bonds in the nature of treasury bills.  These instruments included instruments referred to as “GKO-Linked Notes”, which were short-term structured (i.e. derivative) instruments, issued by one of the Chase entities.  These GKO-Linked Notes were referenced to underlying short-term, non-interest-bearing bonds, denominated in roubles, quoted at a discount to face value, and issued by the Russian Federation, which were known as “GKOs”, an acronym for their full Russian name, Gosudarstvenniye Kratkosrochniye Beskuponniye Obligatsio.  The GKO-Linked Notes embedded forward contracts for the conversion of the GKO rouble proceeds into dollars.  Springwell had invested very profitably in GKO-Linked Notes since April 1996.  However, as part of the measures imposed in Russia during the crisis, the referenced GKOs on Springwell’s outstanding GKO-Linked Notes defaulted and were restructured.  Springwell’s other investments, not only in Russia, but also in other states of the former Soviet Union and Indonesia, were also heavily marked down in the aftermath of the crisis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first category of Investment Claims is based upon an alleged advisory relationship between Chase and Springwell, which, Springwell contends, imposed an obligation upon Chase to advise Springwell as to what investments were appropriate for Springwell, having regard both to the particular characteristics of individual investments and the balance of the portfolio as a whole.  The thrust of Springwell’s complaint is that the portfolio of emerging markets investments, which it held as at 17 August 1998, was one which no reasonable advisor could have advised Springwell to have held.  Springwell contends<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>See paragraph 246 of Springwell’s Re-re-re-re Amended Defence and Counterclaim (“RADC”).</p>
	      </authorialNote> that, if Chase had acted in accordance with its contractual, tortious and fiduciary duties, then, in August 1998, Springwell would not have held the portfolio it in fact held.  Instead, it contends, Springwell would have held a portfolio which was well-diversified, predominantly in liquid and low-risk investments, and structured in such a way that there would have been no appreciable risk that the capital value of individual investments, or the portfolio as a whole, would be substantially reduced (for example, by having to sell into a falling market).  It contends that Springwell’s portfolio would have included time deposits and/or gilts, T-bonds, and other blue chip bonds, together with other fixed-income investments, possibly including emerging markets investments, and managed funds;  all of which would have been held variously for income, liquidity and capital preservation.  It further contends that, if the appropriate advice had been given, the portfolio would not have been leveraged<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	      </authorialNote> to such an extent that Springwell could be exposed to substantial margin calls or would have been forced to sell into a falling market.  In such circumstances the Russian and Asian financial crises would have had no, or no substantial, effect on the value of Springwell’s holdings and/or they would not have caused any or any substantial loss to Springwell, because it would not have been required to sell any holdings to produce cash.  Springwell complains that, in fact, because of Chase’s breaches of duty, as a result of the Russian financial crisis:</p>

Springwell also contends that the existence of a fiduciary relationship between it and Chase also prevents any such reliance by Chase.</p>

Springwell contends that, as a direct result of what Chase told it, it regarded such notes as conservative, cash-equivalents.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell’s case on causation and damage in respect of its investment losses is that the Russian default massively reduced the value of Springwell’s investments and threw the portfolio into negative equity, and as a result, Springwell had to enter into the 1999 Term Loan with Chase on 15 January 1999.  Springwell claims damages calculated by reference to the value of its investments as at that date, as compared with the portfolio it says that it should have had as at that date, had Chase advised it properly.  It contends that any later increases in the value of any of the investments which Springwell retained, are irrelevant in the light of legal authority.  </p>

It contends that the Shipping Losses Claim is a foreseeable consequence of the matters giving rise to the Investment Claims, and, in a sense, is an alternative to the usual claim for interest.  Springwell claims that the loss of the use of the investment funds, which should have been in its portfolio, is not represented by an interest rate, but rather by the profits which those funds would have produced through the purchase of new ships.  It contends that Chase knew that that was one of the most typical uses to which any surplus funds Springwell had would be put and that Chase knew it to be Springwell’s intention so to apply such funds.  </p>

It included the allegation that Chase had acted dishonestly in selling investments to Springwell which it knew to be unsuitable.

Springwell counterclaimed for damages and compensation arising out of Chase’s alleged failure properly to advise it in relation to its emerging market investments.  The counterclaim also included the allegation that, for about a year, Chase had acted dishonestly in mis-selling Springwell certain investments, knowing them to be unsuitable.  These claims in fraud and dishonesty were persisted in for six years, but (save to a limited extent in respect of the Post-Default Claims) were abandoned shortly before the start of the trial.

Chase had The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., London Branch of the bank (i.e. CMB) and CIBL (a locally incorporated subsidiary with a banking licence).  Chemical Bank had Chemical Bank, London Branch of the bank and Chemical Investment Bank Limited (a locally incorporated subsidiary with a banking licence).When the merger of the two banks took place The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A merged into Chemical Bank which then changed its name to The Chase Manhattan Bank.

The effect of the merger was that only one London branch of the merged banks remained, namely CMB, and this entity held both a banking licence and was SFA-regulated.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Like many Greek family-owned shipping businesses, that of the Polemis family was not incorporated under a single structure.  As at 1986, the principal management company was Polembros Shipping Limited (“Polembros”), but that company did not own the assets of the business.  The principal assets consisted of vessels owned by one-ship companies, which vessels were managed by Polembros.  Freights and disbursements were handled by Wintersea Maritime Corporation (“Wintersea”).  All of these companies, which were owned by the Polemis brothers and their mother, loosely formed the Polemis Group.  As was again typical for many Greek family-owned shipping businesses, the Polemis Group was run in a relatively informal manner, and did not keep formal records such as audited accounts (except for a short period prior to 1980 when accounts were produced in connection with loans obtained from Chase).  Basic book-keeping records necessary in order to monitor and control the income and expenses of the shipping business were maintained by SP and AP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As the shipping business expanded, the need arose for the performance of a treasury function within the Polemis Group.  By 1986/7 the shipping business was generating funds which were not immediately required as working capital for the Polemis Group’s business and, because it was not following such a high expansion policy as in earlier years, the profits of the shipping business were not necessarily required to be deployed immediately in the acquisition of additional tonnage.  Accordingly, such funds needed to be managed, and invested, until such time as they might be required for the purposes of the shipping business or, as AP described, the private use of the Polemis family.  Springwell was thereby introduced as an additional Polemis Group company in 1986 to carry out the treasury function and at all relevant times (viz. from 1986 to 1998) it operated as the investment vehicle of the Polemis Group, as described, for example, by an employee in the Chase Shipping Department in a senior officer approval memorandum (“SOAM”) dated 7 August 1992.  Springwell was incorporated as a Liberian company by articles of incorporation dated 17 March 1986.  Its directors were originally George and Andriani Mitsakos (the uncle and aunt of SP and AP, who have since died) and John Baxivanos (“JBAX”), an employee of the shipping business, but these were effectively nominees for AP, SP (and their mother) who controlled Springwell at all material times and were the beneficial owners of its issued share capital.  Mrs Polemis played no part in relation to the business.  Springwell had no employees.  SP had some involvement in the management of Springwell up until about 1990, but thereafter, from 1990 to 1998, it was common ground that the management of Springwell, in the sense of decision making about its investments, was largely AP’s alone.  He ran Springwell principally from London where he lived during the relevant period.  SP did, however, carry out some important, but limited, administrative functions in relation to Springwell.  He maintained detailed records of all the trades and transactions, which are the subject of these proceedings, and calculated and recorded yields on each individual investment.  After the Russian default, SP took over the principal management of Springwell and its claim against Chase.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the 1960s the Polemis family shipping business was run by LP and his brothers, from New York and London.  The business had opened an account with Chase in the 1950s and established a relationship with the bank.  The banking requirements of the shipping business, which consisted of operational accounts for the day to day running of the fleet, and loan facilities for the purchase of ships, were provided by Chase in New York.  In the late 1960s, SP worked for a time in the family shipping business in New York with one of his uncles.  In 1971 LP died unexpectedly and SP moved to London in 1972 to work in the family’s office in London.</p>

The fleet was, at all material times, a combined tanker and dry cargo fleet.  Polembros had its own bank account for day-to-day expenses such as rent and salaries, at a branch of Barclays Bank plc, close to the Polemis Group offices in London W1.  However from 1974 to 1998 all of the Polemis Group’s principal shipping accounts were opened with Chase in New York, London, Jersey and Piraeus;  in particular, operating accounts were opened with Chase for the receipt of freights and payments from the shipping business.</p>

Chase had financed the original transfer of these vessels to the Group from the old family business in 1974.  By 1977, and after taking advantage in particular of developments in the North Sea, the fleet had expanded to seven vessels.  Chase had also financed the purchase of one of two second hand tankers bought in 1974 and a further two in 1977.  The Polemis Group was successful and profitable.  Over the period 1980 to November 1986, the Group expanded rapidly, buying cheap second-hand ships with only limited finance so that the fleet grew from six to 23 vessels (with an average age of 16 years) over that time.  In large measure, the fleet expansion was undertaken by the Polemises for cash.  Only limited finance was taken out to assist in the purchases being made.  In 1983, a loan was arranged with Bank of America in connection with the purchase of one vessel, and in 1985 and 1986 two more loans were arranged with Chase.  Otherwise, the fleet was generally debt free.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the early days, the Polemis fleet was an old fleet, comprising aged tankers and other vessels.  The brothers specialised in acquiring and operating vessels which were close to scrapping age, and they did so very successfully.  Their acquisitions were thus generally of a low capital value, which they could make with cash.  The Group did purchase one new tanker, the Neptune Dorado, during the 1980s.  This vessel was ordered in 1983 for delivery in 1985, and financed by Chase through a term loan for just over $ 12 million repayable over 10 years.  AP arranged the finance for this newbuild and generally dealt with any finance required for the ships.</p>

He had no formal training in finance.  SP was born in 1944, educated in Greece and also attended university in the USA, gaining a Bachelors degree in 1967 and a Masters in 1970.  In 1974, AP worked for a short time in the Piraeus office of the Polemis Group.  In 1975, AP moved to London and joined his brother, SP, working in the London offices of the Polemis Group which were based in South Audley Street, W1.  Between 1975 and 1994, the brothers shared an office at South Audley Street.  In 1994, the offices moved to Park Street, W1 and the arrangement whereby the brothers shared an office did not continue.  Between 1975 and 1996, both AP and SP were based in London.  But, between 1981 and 1985/86, SP spent a large proportion of his time in Brazil, where he built up a successful relationship with Petroleo Brasileiro SA (“Petrobras”), the Brazilian state oil company, the Polemis brothers having identified that there was a need in Brazil for ships capable of offshore loading in similar fashion to the successful operation in the North Sea.  The Polemis Group chartered its first vessel to Petrobras in about 1981 and dealings with Petrobras expanded rapidly from then onwards, so that, in 1983, the Polemis Group opened an office in Brazil.  During this time, SP developed and managed the Group’s Brazilian contacts and business operations.  </p>

The Brazil office was closed after 10 years of operations in 1992 which, effectively, marked the end of the Petrobras business for the Polemis Group too.</p>

There was, however, no formality in the division of responsibility between the two brothers.  Initially, and during the very early years, AP’s role was on the technical side of the business and he was involved with the running of the fleet, operations and repairs, and SP concentrated on the commercial side of the business, chartering, sale and purchase and building up contacts.  However, after SP turned his focus to Brazil in 1981, AP took on more of the responsibility for the management of the shipping business of the Polemis Group in London and Piraeus.  </p>

This was that, as Springwell’s portfolio became larger and more concentrated in Russian securities, CMB itself, irrespective and independently of the role of JA, became subject to a duty to warn Springwell of the risks inherent in the Russian concentration in its portfolio and the need for greater diversification.  Mr. Hapgood pointed out that Springwell had never identified, let alone pleaded, a date when CMB assumed a responsibility to advise in such a way.  Mr. Hapgood complained that such a case was not only not open to Springwell on its pleadings, but also was inconsistent with the manner in which Springwell had formulated its closing submissions on the evidence.</p>

I also agree with him that, during the course of the trial, there was a significant shift in Springwell’s case, so that the primary focus at the close of the case was on an alleged advisory relationship on the part of the Chase Shipping Department and subsequently the Private Bank, CMB.  I also agree with him that the unnecessarily prolix nature of Springwell’s pleadings does not make it easy for even the diligent reader to appreciate precisely what case is being made in this respect, and indeed many other respects.  However, I do not accept his submission that it is not open to Springwell (whether on the pleadings or given the way in which it presented its case) to contend that CMB itself had separate advisory responsibilities to Springwell beyond those discharged, either on its behalf through JA, or by JA on behalf of CIBL or CMIL, or to contend that these obligations arose or changed over time.

Under the general advisory claim, what is alleged is that, because there was an “advisory relationship”, every time that JA offered an investment for sale to Springwell, he was obliged to give, and was implicitly giving, advice as to the suitability and risk characteristics of that investment, both on its own and as part of Springwell’s overall portfolio.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="19">

	      </authorialNote>  It appears to be said that this was so even if it followed an express request by AP to find a particular type of investment, for instance GKO-Linked Notes, or to find investments that met particular requirements, for instance as to price.  Indeed, as damages are sought for a failure to advise Springwell to sell investments, it appears that Springwell’s case, at its highest, is that JA was obliged to give, and implicitly gave, ongoing and updated advice as to the merits of retaining every investment which Springwell had previously purchased.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, the Courts have, on many occasions, sought to define the circumstances in which one party will owe a duty of care in tort giving rise to a liability in economic loss.  Such cases, as the present, are often “quasi-contract” cases, where the relationship between the parties is said to be one of, or akin to, contract, and where the contractual and tortious analysis is essentially the same.

This is not to disparage the value of and need for a test of liability in tortious negligence, which any law of tort must propound if it is not to become a morass of single instances.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:-0.57in">“35.<marker name="tab"/>There is a tendency, which has been remarked upon by many judges, for phrases like ‘proximate’, ‘fair, just and reasonable’ and ‘assumption of responsibility’ to be used as slogans rather than practical guides to whether a duty should exist or not.  These phrases are often illuminating but discrimination is needed to identify the factual situations in which they provide useful guidance.  For example, in a case in which A provides information to C which he knows will be relied upon by D, it is useful to ask whether A assumed responsibility to D:  <span style="font-style:italic">Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners </span>Ltd [1964] AC 465:  <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Eric S Bush</span> [1990] 1 AC 831.  Likewise, in a case in which A provides information on behalf of B to C for the purpose of being relied upon by C, it is useful to ask whether A assumed responsibility to C for the information or was only discharging his duty to B:  <span style="font-style:italic">Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</span> [1998] AC 830.  Or in a case in which A provided information to B for the purpose of enabling him to make one kind of decision, it may be useful to ask whether he assumed responsibility for its use for a different kind of decision:  <span style="font-style:italic">Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</span> [1990] 2 AC 605.  In these cases in which the loss has been caused by the claimant's reliance on information provided by the defendant, it is critical to decide whether the defendant (rather than someone else) assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the information to the claimant (rather than to someone else) or for its use by the claimant for one purpose (rather than another).  The answer does not depend upon what the defendant intended but, as in the case of contractual liability, upon what would reasonably be inferred from his conduct against the background of all the circumstances of the case.  The purpose of the inquiry is to establish whether there was, in relation to the loss in question, the necessary relationship (or ‘proximity’) between the parties and, as Lord Goff of Chieveley pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</span> [1995] 2 AC 145, 181, the existence of that relationship and the foreseeability of economic loss will make it unnecessary to undertake any further inquiry into whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability.  In truth, the case is one in which, but for the alleged absence of the necessary relationship, there would be no dispute that a duty to take care existed and the relationship is what makes it fair, just and reasonable to impose the duty.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:-0.57in">36.<marker name="tab"/>It is equally true to say that a sufficient relationship will be held to exist when it is fair, just and reasonable to do so.  Because the question of whether a defendant has assumed responsibility is a legal inference to be drawn from his conduct against the background of all the circumstances of the case, it is by no means a simple question of fact.  Questions of fairness and policy will enter into the decision and it may be more useful to try to identify these questions than simply to bandy terms like ‘assumption of responsibility’ and ‘fair, just and reasonable’.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Morgan Crucible Co plc v Hill Samuel &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1991] Ch 295, 300-303 I tried to identify some of these considerations in order to encourage the evolution of lower-level principles which could be more useful than the high abstractions commonly used in such debates.”</p>

Thus Mr. Brindle submitted that, even leaving aside the circumstances in which JA was introduced to AP, and the role of the Private Bank, the width of the advisory activities which JA held himself out as performing, and actually performed, during the subsistence of the relationship, was “sufficient to crystallise advisory obligations on their own”.  He accepted that the extent of any advisory obligations assumed was always a fact-sensitive enquiry and that there can be different types or degrees of advice;  thus he accepted that a bank which gives a client an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> piece of investment advice once should not be taken to have assumed the role of a general investment advisor.  He helpfully identified the Court’s task as follows:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“It is critical, therefore, to assess the width of the advisory activity which a party holds itself out as undertaking.  There is a spectrum of possibilities.  At one end there will be an ad hoc piece of advice in response to a specific request with no expectation by either party of a further request or of further advice to come.  At the other end a party will hold itself out as advising and willing to advise on an on-going basis both on particular investments and on the general composition of a client’s portfolio as a whole.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="31">

I also had the advantage, in my own time as well as in court time, of hearing the contemporaneous audio transcripts of many of his telephone conversations with JA during which they discussed what products JA had on offer, and what investments Springwell should make.

Although, with rare exceptions, he was courteous in his discussions with JA, the tapes showed that, at all times, AP was in charge of the conversations, and dictating their direction.  He was domineering and, to some extent, opinionated.  He would pump JA for information, interrupting JA when AP did not want to listen any more, and would move on to another topic, when he decided to do so.  By the time of the recorded conversations, he came across as sophisticated and knowledgeable about emerging markets investments and familiar with the jargon used by JA.  Obviously his knowledge was not as extensive as that of JA, but he never gave the impression of a man out of his depth or one who was unable to cope with the topics under discussion.</p>

Apart from being entirely fluent in English, he was highly articulate, and unfailingly charming and courteous.  At times he was emotional about the fact that he had, as he saw it, been instrumental in the loss suffered by Springwell.  But both in his long witness statements, and in cross-examination, he had a marked tendency to argue his case, rather than give evidence, and to put a spin on documents, and shift his ground, or change his evidence, when he perceived it to be advantageous to Springwell’s case.  He also had a tendency to take issue on matters which reflected badly on Springwell’s case, even where he had no knowledge of the underlying evidence, or where the contemporaneous documentary evidence flatly contradicted his oral testimony.  </p>

Although this was not surprising, in some respects, given the passage of time, what was nonetheless notable was his apparent ability, when he thought it necessary to support his case, suddenly to give definitive evidence on matters on which he could not possibly have been in a position to do so.  AP’s evidence was also demonstrably untrue in some areas.  Yet, when the untruth was pointed out, his usual reaction was not to accept his mistake, but rather to dissemble and to try to argue his way out of the problem.  On other occasions, however, he frankly accepted in cross-examination evidential points that were wholly at odds with the evidence in his witness statements or with allegations made in Springwell’s  pleaded case.  </p>

He clearly did not have the depth of knowledge, either of the market, or of economic or political issues, that was displayed by some of the expert witnesses.  Indeed, at times he came over as somewhat superficial in his approach.

What was said was that, at all times between October 1997 and August 1998, JA acted dishonestly in selling investments to AP which he knew were unsuitable.  As I have described, that claim was not, in the event, proceeded with.  However, Springwell also alleged against JA a parallel allegation that he acted in breach of fiduciary duty, in particular, in consciously taking advantage of AP, when selling instruments to Springwell between October 1997 and 1998.

I have already briefly referred to the Polemis Group’s banking relationship with Chase in the years from 1974 to 1986.  During the 1980s, the Polemis Group placed excess funds on time deposit with Chase and also with a variety of other banks (who offered better rates) such as Guinness Mahon, Bank of New York, the London branch of Banco do Brasil, Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America.  Indeed the Polemis brothers maintained a relationship with Banco do Brasil for many years and purchased Petrobras bonds through this bank in 1993.  Thus, whilst Chase was the principal bank with whom the Polemis Group maintained a banking relationship during this period, it was clearly able to, and to a certain extent did, maintain dealings with other banks.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the mid-1980s the Polemis brothers were active traders in foreign exchange (“FX”).  My finding is that their activity in the FX field was not limited to currency transactions entered into for the purposes of hedging currency exposures connected with the shipping business, but included transactions that had a pre-dominantly speculative purpose ( i.e. entered into for the purpose of making profits, rather than purely as an adjunct to a commercial transaction).  AP was principally involved and it was mainly he who arranged the purchases, but SP was certainly aware of the currency activities and was involved himself in some FX speculation during 1985.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Chase extended a FX line of $ 22 million to the Polemis Group from at least 1982 to enable the Group to take delivery of foreign exchange contracts.  This facility was fully cash collateralised by delivery of funds under the transactions.  In addition, Chase held $ 3 million cash collateral as protection against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations under FX forward contracts entered into by the Polemis Group.  An internal Chase SOAM dated 21 February 1983 recorded that the Polemis Group traded a FX volume of $ 383 million with Chase during 1982.  Although SP’s evidence was that the main reason for these activities was the shipping business’s need for foreign currencies other than dollars, my conclusion is that, in fact, a substantial driver for the activity was profit generation.  As Mr. Christoph Auer (“CA”), a junior relationship manager in the Chase Shipping Department at the time (who subsequently, in 1987, became the relationship manager for the Polemis Group until early 1988), recalled, the Polemis Group's shipping business was largely dollar-based, so that the foreign exchange trading, certainly on the scale on which it was conducted, cannot be explained away as simply an exercise to hedge exposure that might have arisen as a result of the Group’s shipping operations.  Nor can it be explained away as a short period of temporary speculation as the FX speculation appears to have continued over the three-year period 1982 to 1985.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, during the calendar year 1984, AP engaged in foreign exchange currency speculation, selling dollars in the forward markets and buying DM, Sterling and Yen.  In any event, Chase appeared to have regarded these activities as speculation on the Polemis’ part, since concern was recorded in a SOAM of 7 November 1984 as to the Polemis brothers’ speculative tendencies as evidenced by these foreign exchange losses, with the comment that it was assumed however that:</p>

It was further recorded within Chase that the brothers’ propensity to speculate in the FX market had not only resulted in a cash loss of $ 7.5 million in 1984 but had also exposed a side to their characters that Chase considered “diametrically opposite” to their conservative investment strategy in the shipping markets.  By 1986, the brothers had, for whatever reason, ceased this foreign exchange speculation and their foreign exchange credit line was accordingly reduced from $ 25 million to $ 10 million.  In late 1986, the Chase Shipping Department began to market interest rate swaps to its customers, including the Polemis Group, as protection against future increases in dollar interest rates on their shipping loans, but AP did not purchase any.</p>

As CA stated in his oral evidence, which I accept, the FX trading in tens of millions of dollars at that date (more than 20 years ago) must be seen in the context of the ship repair loans which were measured at the time merely in hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Further, the losses of over $ 7 million can be compared with the value of the entire fleet at the time, which was only about $ 49.2 million, and with the estimated liquidity of the Polemis Group, which, according to Chase, was some $ 25 million.</p>

The relevance of this evidence of these early FX transactions, conducted through Chase, is that it shows a clear willingness on the part of AP and SP, even at that early stage, to accept substantial risk, in the pursuit of profit, in the financial markets.  It also shows a considerable financial sophistication on their part.  It goes some way to undermine the suggestion, put forward as part of Springwell’s case, that Chase knew the Polemis brothers to be totally risk averse and conservative in their investment dealings, and were unsophisticated when it came to dealings in the financial markets.  Historically, that was not the picture that had been presented to Chase.</p>

CA was the junior relationship manager at the time, although EM maintained the primary relationship with the Hellenic customers.  In 1986 Springwell was holding its cash surplus from the Polemis shipping business on time deposits with Chase.  Its accounts were held within the Shipping Department at CMB.

ECP was identified by the Shipping Department as a suitable alternative to cash for members of the Hellenic Group.  ECP at the time consisted of debt instruments issued in the international money markets by companies with good credit ratings to finance their short-term credit needs.  Chase had seen that, because its deposit rates were not particularly competitive, Hellenic Group customers had moved their money deposits elsewhere.

Apart from his business relationship with AP whilst EM was with Chase, EM had also been on social terms with AP in London, dining and playing tennis with him on a regular basis.  He came to give evidence reluctantly, in somewhat unusual circumstances which are not necessary to rehearse, but which cast considerable doubt on the reliability of some of the evidence which he gave in his witness statement.  He was obviously, on the one hand, keen to help Springwell and AP;  but, on the other hand, apparently keen not to offend Chase, his former employers, which went some way to explain his initial reluctance to attend court to give evidence.  I found him to be an unsatisfactory witness whose evidence was vague and confused, and shifted during the course of the trial.  At times he was evasive.  His evidence was often directly contradicted by what others said.  He appeared to have wanted to use his witness statements as a means of brokering a settlement between Chase and Springwell.  However, despite his concerns not to offend Chase, I formed the impression that he was prepared to shape his evidence in a manner that he thought might improve Springwell’s case.  Contrary to Mr. Brindle’s submissions, I would not characterise him as an independent witness.</p>

Moreover, it was clear that the introduction was not considered by the parties at the time to be a defining moment in their relationship when their legal rights and liabilities would be articulated or established.  This is supported by the absence of any written memorandum recording the introduction, let alone any written advisory agreement.

There was no need or wish on the part of Springwell at the time of the introduction to equip itself with such an investment advisor.  The Polemises were experienced and sophisticated businessmen.  They had dealt for many years with Chase without (even on Springwell’s case) ever having had an “advisory relationship” for any other purpose.  Thus, for example, they had speculated extensively in foreign exchange without considering that they needed an advisor.  They had placed their money on time deposit without considering that they needed an advisor.</p>

These marketing efforts were directed through the Shipping Department, both before and after the introduction of ECP.  ECP was, in fact, a relatively benign product, which was being presented as an alternative, but akin to, time deposits.  There was absolutely nothing in those circumstances to make Springwell consider that it suddenly needed, or to cause Chase to consider that it was suddenly being asked to provide, general investment advice.</p>

Anything that was said was far too uncertain to form the basis of a contract for the provision of investment advice.

In the course of that selling activity, no doubt, it was anticipated that JA would be making recommendations and, in that sense, “advising” AP what to buy and, no doubt, informing him of the prices and details of the assets within that class which were available.  Indeed, I find as a fact that he did make such recommendations, or give such advice, during this early period of selling ECP to Springwell.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But even if the word “advice” or “advisor” was used by EM in the context of his introduction of JA, it could not reasonably have been understood by AP – at least at this early stage - as creating an ongoing advisory relationship of the extensive nature alleged by Springwell, whether with CIBL or with CMB.  All that Springwell was being offered, through AP being given access to JA, was the provision of an alternative product to time deposits.  Moreover, such personal recommendations, or advice, as AP was being given by JA – at least at this early stage – about the products that CIBL, by JA, was offering to sell (mainly ECP), has to be viewed, in my judgment, as no more than the recommendations of a trader to a buyer as to what was available, on what terms, and perhaps also as to the respective merits of the products on offer, given the requirements of the particular client.  It may well be that, theoretically, in such circumstances, a low level duty of care would arise on the part of the salesman not to make any negligent misstatements, or even to use reasonable care not to recommend a highly risky investment without pointing out that it was such, but a low level duty along those lines is worlds away from the wide duty of care that was pleaded or relied upon as having arisen at this early stage.  In Mr. Brindle’s words, it was at the lower end of the spectrum.  Thus the notion that, in the context of the trading relationship at this early stage, as a result of the manner in which JA was introduced to AP, CIBL and/or CMB, by JA had either an obligation to ascertain Springwell’s investment criteria, or to give wide ranging advice, for example, about portfolio diversification or concentration issues, or in relation to the general composition of the portfolio as a whole, is one that, in my judgment, simply does not reflect the reality of the position.  </p>

As I have already said, there was nothing in the express terms of Springwell’s opening account documentation that could give rise to the existence of any contractual obligation to advise as to appropriate investments in the manner alleged.

However, their evidence was only of very limited value to the current issue, not only because the alleged advisory relationship was said to have arisen when Springwell was a client of CMB’s Shipping Department, rather than of CMB’s Private Bank unit, but also because both experts accepted that, whether an advisory relationship existed in any one case, was ultimately a matter of fact depending on the particular circumstances of the case and what particular services had been offered to the customer.  The evidence, not surprisingly, showed that there was no universal regime, and that different banks did things differently.  Moreover, it was also apparent from Mr. Saunders’ evidence, which I accept, that, in the late 1980s, the private banking sector was undeveloped in the UK, and that many changes have been made since then, imposing stricter regulatory requirements.</p>

The evidence also showed that EM was very keen to ensure that he, and the Shipping Department, retained the benefit, for their own remuneration purposes, in respect of their notional share of any income generated for Chase in respect of Springwell’s purchases.  For that reason, and no doubt from a personal status point of view, given his long social acquaintance with AP, and the sort of person EM was, EM would have wanted to convey the impression to AP that he, EM, remained in charge, was keeping in touch and remained the principal relationship contact for AP within Chase.  Moreover, EM, as the person notionally responsible for Chase’s exposure to the client, whether simply as counterparty to a sale and purchase transaction, or, subsequently, when EM moved to the Private Bank and AP started leveraging Springwell’s purchases, as a provider of credit facilities, would have necessarily wanted, at least at a general level, to know what investments Springwell had indeed purchased.  This would have been important, in the interests of CMB, for general banking purposes:  i.e. for marketing purposes, for reporting purposes, for the purposes of building up a picture of assets, subsequently (when the purchases were leveraged) for CMB’s own credit control purposes, and, more generally, because a relationship manager would have been interested in what its client was doing.  To this extent, and in a very loose sense, the investments could be said to have been monitored or supervised by the Shipping Department.  </p>

RC’s evidence was to the effect that JA informed RC and EM from time to time of what AP was buying, or had bought, via internal reports.  RC did not know what was going on in relation to the detailed workings of the relationship between Springwell and the ECP desk, but he did receive notification of the purchases of ECP that had actually been made.  This, in my judgment, was entirely consistent with the role which I have described in the previous paragraph.</p>

I also reject the suggestion that anything that AP was told about the role of the Shipping Department, could have led him to believe that Springwell’s purchases were being vetted or filtered in advance by the Shipping Department, or that CMB was thereby assuming a responsibility to advise Springwell in relation to such investments, in the terms pleaded.  I conclude that much of AP’s evidence was an attempt, <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span>, to bolster Springwell’s case in circumstances where the contemporaneous evidence, both as to AP’s own conduct and that of Chase, both at the time following the introduction to JA, and, indeed, when EM subsequently moved to the Private Bank, is inconsistent with any such analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, AP’s recollection of the circumstances of the introduction of JA (not surprisingly, as it was over 20 years ago) was, as I have already found, extremely weak.  I consider it highly unlikely that he would have had any better, more specific recollection of some other meetings or discussions.  Moreover, his evidence, both written and oral, as to these alleged representations went considerably further than Springwell’s pleaded case at paragraph 100 of the RADC, which to me indicated some flavour of unreliability.  It was also, in important respects, contradicted by EM’s evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, EM’s evidence about the alleged monitoring and supervisory function was confused.  Despite what he had said in his witness statement, in cross-examination he emphatically contradicted Springwell’s case that there had been an agreement at the outset that EM would be supervising Springwell’s purchases through JA in advance of their actually being made or that that was his function in the period whilst he was head of the Shipping Department, and before he moved to the Private Bank.  EM was adamant that he would not have been supervising the purchase of ECP.  He emphasised that he had far more important things to do by way of managing CMB’s substantial credit exposures to other shipping clients and “getting money into the bank”, rather than supervising the FX and other transactions of shipping clients, such as Springwell, which did not, during this period, have open credit lines with CMB.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="53">

Significantly, there is not a single reference in any of the numerous other documents disclosed by Chase, which suggests that either EM, or anyone else in the Shipping Department, was telling JA what to buy for Springwell, or discussing in advance with JA, whether in detail, or otherwise, new investment opportunities, before they were offered to Springwell.  Thus, other than the SOAM referred to above, there is no document within Chase which supports the existence of such a function being carried out by the Shipping Department.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, I conclude on the evidence that, during the relevant period from 1988 to 1990, AP never for one moment thought that he had the benefit of an investment advisory relationship with the Shipping Department.  Thus, for example, AP never placed an order through EM, nor did he suggest that he ever discussed any individual product, let alone any question of the portfolio as a whole, with EM.  There is no documentary record of any such discussion.  That was not particularly surprising, since AP’s contacts with EM were largely social.  Nor did he remember ever having mentioning the supposed arrangement to RC, who became the relationship manager in early 1988.  Never, at any stage during this period, did AP receive a single report, document, review, analysis or other evidence of this supposed supervisory and advisory function from the Shipping Department.  He was never asked, and he certainly never asked, to identify Springwell’s investment criteria.  Thus, looked at in terms of the reliance factor, it is difficult to see what evidential basis there was to support any reasonable belief on the part of AP that the Shipping Department was exercising this alleged supervisory and advisory function in the extensive terms pleaded in the RADC.  He knew that JA was the product specialist and that neither EM nor anyone else in the Shipping Department had particular knowledge about any product that was being offered.  When AP was asked who it was he thought was undertaking this supposedly vital function, he was unable to give any coherent answer at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The contemporaneous documents show the Shipping Department, during this period, trying to market further products, to Springwell, beyond those which AP was buying through JA.  Thus, for example, in early 1988, when RC took over from CA as relationship manager to the Polembros Group, a memorandum dated 31 March 1988 from RC to file, copied to EM, records that RC had met with both AP and SP at the Polemis Group’s office on 10 March 1988.  The purpose of the meeting was “to formally reintroduce” RC as the new Relationship Manager on the account and it is clear that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss all aspects of the banking relationship between Chase and the Polemis Group (including Springwell).  Among other matters discussed, under the heading “Deposits”, was the issue of participating deposits.  RC recorded the discussion as follows:  </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The writer raised the issue of “Participating Deposits” as an alternative to straight deposits but whilst Adam was interested, they felt they had found an even better alternative in ECP.  They now have a direct contact with our ECP traders and have received at least LIBOR on their purchases to date.”</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">The same document records, under the heading “Liability Hedging”,  that RC had been quoting AP on interest rate swaps and caps as a way of hedging their floating rate debt, but that AP did not feel the time was right.  The memorandum also records, under the heading “New Loan Opportunities”, that the brothers considered loan rates too high at 1%;  that AP had pushed to retain the 5/8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> % spread on future loan business;  and that RC had assured the Polemises that Chase would be as aggressive as possible in bidding for any future loan business.  There is nothing which suggests that there was any discussion of Springwell’s investment criteria or aims, the state of its portfolio, the need for diversification, or any of the other type of topics that one might have expected a new relationship manager would raise at his first meeting with clients who had the benefit of an investment advisory relationship with the Shipping Department in the terms alleged or even more limited terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first place, from the contractual perspective, I find that anything that was said by EM was too vague and uncertain to form the basis for an investment advisory contract in the terms pleaded, or even in some modified, less onerous terms.  There is no suggestion, for example, that CMB would be giving active investment advice to Springwell, or that CMB would be reviewing the portfolio as a whole, or advising on diversification.  Second, it is difficult to find the evidential foundation for any duty of care being owed in tort in the extensive terms alleged or even more limited terms.  It is not alleged by Springwell that the Shipping Department was, prior to any of these conversations, Springwell’s investment advisor.  JA was already subject to the supervision of his own superiors, as AP no doubt understood.  Yet that did not create an advisory relationship.  In my judgment, in the context of the relationship in 1987-1988, there is no reason why supervision by the Shipping Department (even if EM did make a general statement to the effect that the Shipping Department would be supervising JA’s activities), nor a description of JA “as part of the team” (even if such an expression had been used), should make any difference or suddenly change the relationship into a full advisory one.  Had AP wished for the benefit of an investment advisory service from the Shipping Department, (and, on the evidence, my conclusion is that, at that time, he did not) then that would have been a matter to resolve by contract.  In the context of a formal banking relationship, Springwell could not, in my judgment, reasonably have obtained, or expected to have obtained, the benefit of such a service simply as a result of informal chat between AP and EM.  The absence of any written investment advisory agreement is,  to my mind, a strong indicator against the existence of any contractual or tortious duty of care, notwithstanding that there was no regulatory requirement at that time for any such agreement to have been in writing for a client such as Springwell.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, the contention that not only did JA have a duty of care, but also the Shipping Department had an obligation to supervise and control the alleged relationship, with its own distinct duty of care, is inconsistent with Springwell’s pleaded case that EM knew that AP relied “entirely upon JA to advise him as to what investments were appropriate for Springwell…”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="56">

EM became the Head of the Hellenic Group within the Private Bank.  In June 1990, EM invited FS to move across to the Private Bank to join him as EM’s assistant.  FS knew the Bank’s London-based Greek customers and had worked for EM in the Shipping Department, and accordingly in August 1990, FS moved to the Private Bank as an assistant to EM.  In 1990 those Hellenic customers whom the Bank thought might be interested in broadening their relationships beyond purely shipping (or who had already done so) were asked if they wished to move with EM to the Private Bank.  If they did wish to do so, then the Private Bank took responsibility for the overall day-to-day administration of the customer’s relationship with CMB.  Thus, Springwell’s account, along with those of several other Greek shipping customers, was moved from the Shipping Department to the Private Bank on or about 20 August 1990, when it appears that a Private Bank current account was opened for Springwell.  </p>

As such, in respect of such dealings, they were not subject to the SFA Rules, but were subject to the Grey Paper regime and the London Code of Conduct.

Both CMB and CIBL were listed money market institutions.  Listed money market institutions were regulated by the Bank of England in respect of this exempt business and were required to comply with the Grey Paper and the London Code of Conduct.  The first versions of these were published in April 1988.  At first, listed money market institutions were required to send notice to customers that certain transactions fell within the wholesale counterparty regime each time a transaction of that nature was entered into, to submit quarterly returns to the Bank of England of certain wholesale transactions and to maintain lists of wholesale counterparties.  This was modified on 29 September 1989 to a requirement only to give periodic warnings and to maintain lists of wholesale counterparties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its opening and closing written submissions, Chase sought to rely upon a wholesale counterparty notice, which it contended had been sent in a letter to Springwell dated 22 March 1990, in which CIBL notified Springwell that, under the provisions of section 43 of the Financial Services Act 1986, CIBL had been accepted as a listed money market institution and that certain transactions with Springwell, as specified, would be exempt from the provisions of that Act.  Thereafter, Springwell appeared with other clients in a “List of wholesale counterparties” maintained by CIBL.  However, Springwell did not admit that it had ever received this document.  Chase sought to contend that this wholesale counterparty notice significantly restricted the regulatory protection available to Springwell in respect of the transactions concerned, in particular by excluding the operation of the SFA rules.  But the letter was not pleaded by Chase, was not relied upon in Chase’s oral opening, was not cross-examined upon or referred to during the trial and was not relied upon in the Agreed List of Issues.  </p>

In any event, Springwell was subsequently classified as a non-private customer, so the early wholesale counterparty classification, if it occurred, is of extremely limited relevance to the issues in dispute.  That is not least because what is in issue is whether CMB or CIBL owed contractual or tortious duties of care, rather than any regulatory obligations under the relevant legislation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following account of the growth of emerging markets trading in the 1990s is largely taken from the description in appendix 13 to the first report of Alexandra McLeod-Wilson, Chase’s expert in the debt of emerging market countries.  As she described, the market in Less Developed Country (“LDC”) debt trading started in a small way in 1984, only a few years after the Latin American debt crisis of 1982.  However, little progress was made on restructuring the underlying bank debts at this time and the market remained sporadic, with low levels of liquidity.  The catalyst for change was the announcement in 1989 of a Brady Plan for Mexico, named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.  In order to create a lasting restructuring, the Brady Plan incorporated three main elements:  (a) debt forgiveness;  (b) restructuring which was conditional upon a programme of economic reform;  and (c) the transformation of debt from bank loans into new tradable instruments.  During the 1990s, the Brady programme became used as a template for restructuring defaulted sovereign loans into bonds over the next eight years.  LDC countries, which became known as "emerging markets", converted $ 160 billion of their defaulted debt into newly issued bonds.  Each restructuring was slightly different.  Mexico was followed shortly by Venezuela in 1991, then Argentina in 1993, Brazil and Poland in 1994, Ecuador and Bulgaria in 1995 and Russia in 1997, to name but the major countries.  The issuance of a large pool of readily tradable Brady bonds prompted the growth of the investor base in emerging markets, with significant amounts of the debt being transferred from bank balance sheets to investment portfolios.  The term “Brady bonds” came to be applied to restructured debt more widely (i.e. not only to debt issued under the Brady programme), as well as to uncollateralised bonds issued under a Brady programme.  Brady restructurings opened the way for emerging markets countries, and corporates from within those countries, to access the international capital markets.  </p>

Eurobond new issuance from emerging markets countries grew from $ 7.8 billion in 1990 to $ 133.2 billion in 1997.  The volume of debt traded grew nearly tenfold during the period 1992 to 1997, from $ 734 billion in 1992 to almost $ 6 trillion by 1997.  As volumes increased, so in general did liquidity and trading blocks.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as Chase was concerned, the expansion of the availability of different types of emerging markets debt generally was mirrored by a similar increase in sales of emerging markets paper by Chase to its customers as demand, particularly among the customers of the Private Bank Hellenic Group, grew exponentially during the 1990s.  The internal Private Bank memoranda from early 1991 record an exponential growth of the LDC client base and a concomitant increase in the Private Bank’s income generated as a result of LDC sales.  The LDC sales income was split as to 50/50 between IFI and the Private Bank, an arrangement about which EM frequently complained as being inequitable (on the grounds that the Private Bank administered the relationship with these clients) but which nonetheless continued to at least August 1998.  The sale of LDC paper, over the relevant period, was extremely profitable for Chase.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the late 1980s, JA had started selling a wider range of credits, including debt instruments issued in LDC, but which subsequently became known as “emerging markets”.  This had brought him into contact with Nick Cournoyer (“NC”), who was Head of the London Debt Arbitrage Group in London until 1991, and part of Chase IFI in London.  He reported to KOD.  NC concentrated on selling emerging market debt instruments, which was very much a nascent business at the time.  In 1990, NC asked JA to join the London Debt Arbitrage Group, which was subsequently re-named the Developing Countries’ Capital Markets Group (“the DCCM Group”), and then IFI, (as previously defined).  JA moved to that group in July of that year and JA remained working at IFI thereafter at all relevant times.  The move meant that he began to sell Springwell predominantly emerging markets debt, a more specialized asset class, in a market which, as I have already described, expanded rapidly in the 1990s.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He had a wide customer base with differing requirements.  In order to be an effective salesman, it was important for him to try to understand each customer's own requirements, so that he could give them investment ideas or proposals which fitted with those requirements.  Particularly as the emerging markets business expanded in the 1990s, there were very many products which were potentially available.  It was not in his interests, nor in his customers' interests, to offer products to his customers in which they would have no interest or which he did not think fitted their objectives.  It was a very competitive environment, and customer contact was an integral part of the business.  That necessitated a close evaluation of each customer's own objectives and preferences, and their risk profiles.  He explained that an effective salesman would develop a very keen sense of his customers' preferences, as an ongoing process throughout the relationship, from the initial discussions, through to reaction to particular proposals and the feedback from particular transactions.  He further explained that the need to understand a customer's objectives and preferences was fundamental to the role of salesman, because, if he, as a salesman in Chase, was unable properly to assess a customer's needs, and the customer became dissatisfied with what it had purchased, it<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>would not be JA’s customer for long, as there was always a host of other institutions in the City which could take his place.  By proposing what he considered to be good investments which fitted with their objectives, he enabled his customers to make informed choices as to what they wanted, which, in the long run, was profitable for both his customers and for Chase.  It was not always simply a matter of his presenting his ideas to customers;  sometimes customers would also come to him asking for prices or availability on particular instruments.  His role as a salesman was thus both pro-active and re-active.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In identifying buying opportunities for his customers, JA would source products in both the primary and secondary markets.  On a new issue, if Chase (i.e. the Investment Bank) were the lead manager, the syndicate and capital markets teams at Chase who ran the transaction would usually give a presentation to the sales team to introduce the transaction, giving all details relating to its credit structure and size.  So far as secondary market sales were concerned, the assets which JA sold to customers were either purchased by Chase’s traders directly from the market or sold from the market-making book.  Chase acted as a market maker in emerging market debt and had traders (called “flow traders”) who operated a market-making book.  These traders would typically buy and sell assets on a short term basis.  JA would sometimes be aware of the assets on the market making book and could sell these on to his customers.  Some traders would produce information sheets to be circulated around the sales team, such as corporate or sovereign “Axe” sheets, which contained details of particular holdings which were available to be sold, or which the trader wanted to buy.  Similarly, JA would also be aware of the prices in the market itself, as he had access to the market prices on the screens on the trading floor.  If an asset was not on the market-making book, JA could always obtain a specific price from one of the flow traders for an acquisition directly from the market.  In such a case, the trader would purchase the asset and JA would simultaneously sell the asset on to his customer.</p>

The market-making book was comprised of short term positions operated by the flow traders for the purpose of making a market.  The proprietary book was different.  Chase as an institution also made investments on its own behalf and this included investments in emerging markets debt.  The proprietary traders were entirely separate from the flow traders and from the salesmen.  They purchased and sold investments on Chase’s behalf, in the pursuit of whatever long term or other strategy had been determined by those responsible for Chase’s own investment management.</p>

He was generally interested to glean what the proprietary traders were doing, as such information might be relevant for the purpose of his own proposals to customers, but this was not information which was made available to him as a matter of course.  He would pick up information on a thematic basis, that the proprietary traders were going long or short in a particular country, or perhaps that they were interested in a particular bond.

As already explained, new issues in which Chase was involved would be introduced to the sales team by those running the transaction.  This would typically involve a presentation, during which the salient aspects of the issue would be explained and salesmen would be given the opportunity to ask questions.  They would also be provided with the relevant documents to enable them to understand (and in due course to market) the products, such as the information memoranda, the term sheets and the prospectuses.  Otherwise, it was a matter of JA’s staying close to the market and keeping updated on relevant developments.  There were various sources of information which JA would make use of.</p>

The research provided information on the political and economic climate in the emerging market countries as well as information on specific bonds.  JA would read this research to gain information about the markets.

Every morning, the sales staff, the flow traders and the researchers would have a meeting, to share market information and monitor trade ideas.  In the afternoon, JA would commonly participate in a telephone conference call with traders, researchers and the sales teams in London and New York.  The calls were led by the head of the Research Group and during them the various teams would provide updates on market developments, sales and new issues.  In addition to the morning and afternoon meetings, the sales staff, traders and researchers communicated frequently throughout, exchanging prices and market information.  The trading floor at Chase was an open plan room.  JA sat next to his fellow sales staff and in close proximity to the flow traders and the researchers.  In later years, relevant information was also exchanged with IFI through Bloomberg’s messaging services.</p>

If these were buying opportunities, he would generally set out the instrument’s issuer, its yield, risk-rating (if available) and its maturity date.  If available, he would then attach the relevant information memoranda and/or updates for each investment mentioned on the coversheet.  If they were selling or switching opportunities, he would give the customer brief details of why he thought it was a good idea.

He would obtain multiple copes of presentations about new issues and would be provided with the relevant documentation, such as the prospectus, the information memorandum and/or the term sheet.  He would, as a matter of course, send them out to his customers.  The prospectuses and other materials were professionally prepared documents, which contained the relevant information about the investment products and their terms.  The sending out of this documentation was, so far as JA was concerned, an important element of the marketing of the investments.  He would have, literally, a stack of prospectuses and, as a matter of routine, he would mail them to his customers.  When he then spoke to his customers, normally on the telephone, JA would generally discuss the ideas which he had already included in the preceding fax.  The purpose of the fax was to enable the customer to see in black and white what it was that he was proposing and to read the documentation which was included.  The customer would then often already have decided whether or not it wished to proceed with one or more of the ideas before they spoke.  It might also have questions which JA would seek to answer, if he could.  He would also be able to obtain an up-to-the-minute price from one of the traders, which he would then pass on to the customer.  If the customer decided to proceed, the deal would be agreed there and then on the telephone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">JA’s practice was not, however, in any way rigid.  Whilst he would commonly seek to present ideas by fax and then follow that up by telephone, there were many other exchanges during the day, depending on the wishes of the customer and the circumstances at the time.  Customers would telephone JA to originate deals, or ask for prices or other information.  Equally, there did not have to be a fax on every occasion before JA would telephone customers.  For example, if there was a relevant development in the market, he would, as a matter of course, telephone his customers and inform them of it.  And, even when the call did follow a fax, the conversation might range beyond the particular ideas which he had included.  The sending out of a fax was a useful sales tool, which enabled the customer to give some consideration in advance to the ideas, but it was only part of his day to day conduct as a salesman for Chase.  The selling of emerging markets investments was a dynamic process, which involved meeting customers’ differing requirements, often at times of fast-moving market events.  There was therefore no easily defined pattern to how JA went about his job.</p>

The conversations varied depending on what the customer wanted and on the circumstances at the time but the overall context was the same throughout:  he was the Chase salesman and the customer was interested or potentially interested in buying assets from JA or in selling assets to him.  They would talk about particular products, about countries, about markets and about relevant developments.  Many of his conversations would concern factual matters:  such as prices, terms, market developments and the like.  Many of JA’s customers also wanted to know what he thought, for instance about particular products or countries, or about how JA or Chase thought that the market would move, or what were the best opportunities at any particular time.  JA would pass on his view or whatever the Chase house view was at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, for example, if JA included in a fax two investments in a particular country, and a customer wanted to buy one of them, it might ask him which of the two he preferred.  He might say that he preferred investment A over investment B because it had a better credit risk, or a better yield for the same credit risk, or a shorter or longer maturity.  Or if a customer wanted to diversify into different countries, he might say that he thought that country A had greater potential than country B.  He did not make decisions for the customers.  They would decide, having heard his opinion, what to do.  The emerging markets business was awash with opinions.  Chase would produce research documents, which were regularly sent out to customers.  These contained the views of researchers on precisely the same matters (i.e. products, countries and markets).  Other investment banks would produce their own research publications and there were also many different views expressed in the financial press.  Customers would also be able to tap into the views of the other salesmen and the traders at Chase and their counterparts at the other investment banks.  Many people involved in the market had views, often differing views, but it was the customers who decided what they wanted to do.</p>

Thus, although he and JA met from time to time, their dealings were generally conducted over the telephone.  As with his other customers, JA would send to the Polemises faxes with investment opportunities and associated documentation.  He would also have sent out to them, hard copy prospectuses or other such documentation as a matter of course.  Although he did not retain the faxes which he sent to his customers, examples in the evidence supported his account.  The fax would then have led to a discussion on the telephone and AP would have decided whether he wished to go ahead with one or more of the proposals, whether he did not, or whether he wanted to consider the matter further.  Particularly in the latter years, JA tended to speak frequently with AP, and, in general, their conversations on the telephone were similar in content to the conversations which JA had with other customers.  There would be a telephone call, either from AP ringing up to see what JA had on offer, or from JA to AP, informing the latter of what was available.  JA would describe the securities available, they would talk about developments in the market, about prices, about particular bonds and about anything else which was relevant to the buying and selling of the investments.  JA would, if he thought it appropriate, give his views, for example on whether he thought a particular bond was a good buy for Springwell, or a good sell, whether it might pay to wait, whether the price might go up or down, or whether there was likely value in any particular country.  In discussing the relevant terms and merits of investments with AP and making recommendations, JA was, I conclude, in one sense, giving advice, although the legal consequences of him so doing in relation to this period, I consider below.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I find as a fact that, in Springwell's case, one notable feature of JA’s dealings with AP, was that a critical driver of Springwell’s investment objectives was the desire to be fully invested, and to be fully invested in emerging markets – and, if possible, to increase the size of those investments with leverage.  AP emphasised that he did not wish for his funds to be held on deposit but wanted them invested, where the returns were greater.  He frequently asked JA for prices and availability of emerging markets investments and he sought to prevail upon JA to source more and more investments of the type in which he was interested.  This was particularly the case with GKO-Linked Notes.  On occasions he complained that Springwell was not investing “aggressively” and, indeed, that JA was not giving him enough ideas or showing him enough emerging markets investments.  What this meant in practice was that AP rarely had to make the decision whether, in principle, Springwell should or should not make investments.  Nor did he have to decide whether, in principle, Springwell should make further investments in the emerging markets.  (Of course, whether, Chase should have advised him that those were decisions Springwell should have been making, is one of the issues in this litigation.)</p>

The strategies available to customers were “conservative”, “balanced” or “aggressive”.  In October 1990 Springwell invested an initial $ 5 million, and, in November 1990, a further $ 5 million was invested.  There was a quarterly management fee of 0.5% on the whole portfolio and Springwell’s investment objectives were stated as “Balanced”.  Regular monthly portfolio statements were supplied to Springwell, showing the performance of the portfolio and details of the investments contained in it.  In addition, the IMA relationship manager, would pay quarterly visits to the customer, usually together with the portfolio manager, to report on the performance of the customer’s IMA.  Springwell invested a further $ 20 million in aN IMA with the New York branch of CMB in November 1991, which was the subject of a formal Corporate Investment Management Agreement, which likewise provided for management fees and portfolio statements.  It gave wide discretionary powers to CMB to invest and included a hold harmless provision in the following terms:</p>

Chase was the lead manager on the issue.  Springwell purchased a substantial tranche of $ 40 million of the Petrobras paper (approximately 16% of the issue) using a $ 15 million loan facility from the Private Bank, secured on investment grade assets, to do so (“the Investment Grade Facility”).  The facility was secured on the existing $ 10,300,000 IMA which was at that time held in, and managed by the Private Bank in London, and also secured on securities held by CIBL.  The secured credit facility letter (“the Facility letter”) and the memorandum of deposit (“the Memorandum of Deposit”) were both signed on 30 July 1991 by SP.  He signed the Memorandum of Deposit in two places, his second signature acknowledging that Chase had advised him to take independent legal advice regarding the contents and effect of the Memorandum of Deposit.

Many of the Hellenic clients bought substantial amounts of the Petrobras bond:  in total perhaps 30 to 40% of the total issuance, no doubt partly because Petrobras was well known as a good credit risk in the wider Greek shipping community.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> The evidence did not support that contention.  The Polemis Group had had a long-standing relationship with Petrobras through the shipping business and had been shipping Petrobras oil around the world for many years.  AP and SP knew a great deal about the company, Petrobras, and Brazil, through their business dealings and SP’s family connections.  I find that they were confident that Petrobras was a good credit risk.  They were both extremely eager to acquire a large investment in the Petrobras issue, and ultimately were delighted to have purchased $ 40 million of the bond, using leverage to do so.  Indeed they wanted to subscribe for more of the bond.  This was not really disputed by AP in evidence.  JA was away on honeymoon at the time of the Petrobras issue.  Paul Charman (“PC”) who was Head of Emerging Markets Group at IFI in London from 1992-1996 gave evidence that, whilst JA was away, AP rang the sales desk and PC had a short conversation with him, </p>

It was obvious from AP’s oral evidence that AP understood the concept of leverage, and its correlative risks from his shipping experience and that he was extremely enthusiastic about the idea of obtaining leverage from Chase to purchase a larger proportion of the Petrobras, given that the cost of leverage was lower than the increased return on the asset that leverage produced.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="60">

At about this time he first met AP socially and they started playing tennis together once a week.  He also met SP socially.  Although they were not particularly close in the mid-1980s, his friendship with AP, in particular, grew over time.  In 1986/87 he used to organise lunches for members of the Greek shipping community at BoNY and they would also all regularly meet once a week at the Clermont Club in Mayfair.  By virtue of his relationship with AP, Springwell opened an account with BoNY in about 1986, investing initially in time deposits and then in loan participations.  SPAP also knew EM socially.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 1991, after being made redundant by Bank of New York, SPAP was recruited by EM to work in the Private Bank.  When SPAP moved from BoNY to CMB, Springwell closed its account at BoNY and transferred its funds at BoNY to CMB.  Effectively, SPAP was recruited by Chase for the benefit of his contacts with the Greek shipping community, with a view to assisting EM in bringing new business into Chase from that community.  SPAP began his employment on 3 June 1991.  He worked as an assistant to EM and reported to him.  Although described as a relationship manager, he was not the relationship manager for Springwell.  He remained employed by CMB until June 1993, although he was working out of CMB’s Piraeus office, in Greece, from March 1993 onwards.  Such involvement as he may have had with Springwell occurred over a very short period of time and, certainly so far as AP was concerned, does not appear to have involved much interface between the two.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I did not find SPAP’s evidence credible.  I formed the impression that he was partisan towards Springwell’s case.  I found him to be extremely vague in some important respects (perhaps not surprisingly, given the passage of time) but then apparently able to recall other aspects with apparent, but unconvincing, certainty.  He was not able to provide any proper explanation as to why the Petrobras purchase, of all Springwell’s purchases, should have been considered inappropriate, given the strength of the quasi-sovereign issuer and the Polemis’ long history and familiarity with Petrobras.  I reject his evidence that he instituted and operated a system under which sales made by JA to Hellenic customers had to be pre-approved by the Private Bank.  I conclude that he exaggerated the role of the Private Bank in the selling process.</p>

On the contrary, as already mentioned below, such documents as referred to the role of the Private Bank were to an entirely different effect and are inconsistent with the system alleged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Third, I do not find SPAP’s evidence, to the effect that he had been very surprised and concerned to learn of Springwell’s purchase of Petrobras in August 1991, that he regarded it as “wholly inappropriate”, and that was why he had set up the system, to be credible evidence.  SPAP<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>was the officer at the Private Bank in London, who signed the internal CMB form requesting the Private Bank’s credit department in New York to grant the credit facility of $ 15 million which enabled Springwell to purchase so much of the Petrobras issue.  Although, in his oral evidence, SPAP denied that he knew that the facility was intended to be used for the purchase of the Petrobras issue, I find it highly unlikely that, in circumstances where the proposal was dated 18 July 1991, and the actual purchase was on 2 August 1991, he would have made the facility request without having asked the client the purpose for which it was intended.  Moreover, it is clear that SPAP knew about the intended Petrobras purchase at the time of the loan application, since, in a memorandum to EM dated 1 July 1991, he reported that “Springwell had committed … a sizeable amount for Petrobras”.  This also undermines the assertion that he did not know the purpose of the facility.  Moreover, SPAP’s subsequent conduct was wholly inconsistent with any earlier concerns about the Petrobras purchase.  For example, in a proposal for Springwell’s initial margin forward facility of $ 40 million, dated 12 March 1992, he wrote that “During 1991 Springwell invested in $ 297MM (face value) of LDC paper and was one of the driving forces behind Chase’s Petrobras deal by committing $ 40MM to the transaction.”  If he had genuinely considered that the original purchase was “wholly inappropriate”, it is extremely unlikely that he would have relied on it in this way in support of a new credit facility.  There were other examples of inconsistent conduct in the documents.  Finally, if SPAP had had any real concerns, it is surprising that they were not shared by his superior, EM, who, the contemporaneous documents show, was delighted with the $ 71 million of Petrobras sales to Private Bank customers, such delight being tempered only by his regret that the Private Bank was not allocated a larger share of the income.</p>

The expertise as regards the relevant investment products lay with CIBL.  The Private Bank, and in particular SPAP, had no expertise in such products.  EM and SPAP had no expertise in investment management for clients.  It is therefore difficult to see what the utility would have been of a system whereby trades entered by CIBL should have been subject to a further layer of approval by SPAP or EM.</p>

However, when the Margin Forward Programme was created by the Private Bank credit department in April 1992, as another means of leveraging purchases of emerging markets assets, but with the security under the MFA, entered into between CIBL and Springwell,  being the emerging markets assets themselves, rather than the investment grade assets, Springwell’s use of the Investment Grade Facility declined as its use of the MFA facility increased.  However, I find that AP’s enthusiasm in the early days to increase Springwell’s leverage under the Investment Grade Facility foreshadowed his desire for increased leverage under the subsequent MFA facility.</p>

However, the evidence, both documentary and oral, does not support such an extreme case as AP sought to present.  Although EM, at the Private Bank, clearly regarded Springwell as a source of substantial future profits and increased business, and, no doubt, was keen on these grounds to accommodate Springwell’s desire for increased leverage, I conclude that AP himself was insistent that Chase should increase his leverage facilities on Springwell’s investment grade credit line and increase the advance rate to 90% and that such increases were indeed sought at his instigation.  </p>

The bulk of the groups business is done through Chase and, for all intents and purposes, Chase is the group’s main Bank.  The bulk of the group’s liquidity is with Chase.  The movement of funds is done through Chase.  The safekeeping of the securities is with Chase.  Therefore, although the recommended 10% margin might be an insufficient level of cushion in a similar borrowing situation and, in particular, in a low interest rate scenario as the present one is, clearly, the Bank should feel very comfortable to consider an exception in its policy.  This is due to the fact that Chase, in general terms, has total control on the group’s assets.  Furthermore, due to the fact that the competition, mainly the major Swiss banks us well as Morgan and Citibank, have made serious efforts recently to make inroads into these kinds of groups, it is imperative to consider making exceptions to our credit policies for certain situations.  In fact, we know that Swiss Banking Corporation has offered a credit facility for similar types of securities with a margin of 10% to a well-known name in the Greek shipping community.  What is of even more concern, about this facility is not only the fact that the spread is ¼% versus our ½%, but our competitor is also advancing 25% against LDC paper type of collateral.</p>

They told GG that the client was insisting on getting higher leverage on his IMA and that they were under substantial pressure from the client.

Revised conditions were finally approved by GG and the New York Credit Department on 18 December 1991 subject to the facility being reviewed after three months and subject to requirements for documentation and internal controls being put in place to monitor the margin position and the pledge of the IMA collateral.  A facility letter dated 20 December 1991 from Chase to Springwell, signed by FS for Chase and by AP for Springwell (on 23 December 1991), confirmed the $ 100 million credit limit and set out the terms and conditions for the facility, including the various margin maintenance rates and the close out rates which differed depending on the type of security being considered.  By a further memo dated 30 December 1991, GG set out his instructions in relation to the monitoring of the Springwell account and put the burden on the Private Bank, London (with the assistance of London Sales) to ensure that it stayed within the guidelines in relation to collateral and margin maintenance, rather than the Private Bank in New York who had control of the IMA collateral.  In order to facilitate this, GG gave instructions for the New York IMA unit to send portfolio reports daily to the Private Bank London, which, in turn, was to prepare a collateral control report on the total Springwell position which would be sent to GG in New York daily.  In addition, a full report was to be sent to GG once a week.  By 6 February 1992 $ 69 million of the $ 100 million facility approved in December 1991 had already been drawn by Springwell.

The credit officer is going to ask, ‘Okay, is Polemis good for 20 million?’  He does not know if Polemis is good for 20 million or 10 million or 50 million.  I have to tell them.  Then he is going to ask me the next question,  ‘What kind of advance shall we give him?’  He might say  ‘50 per cent’ and I say, ‘No, I do not think 50 per cent is -- it is too high, 50 per cent’.  He might say  ‘Why?’, ‘Because, you know, I am not sure how he is going to react, he is trading for the first time’ -- I am talking about the beginning of the trading relationship;  okay?  So this discussion is taking place between the relationship manager -- that is why the relationship manager signs first.  Do you see any credit memo without a relationship manager's signature?</p>

The role did not involve any role in the selling process itself.  The role was more limited, involving the provision of funds for completion and the monitoring of collateral values for credit purposes.  I refer in particular to the Memorandum from BS dated 6 August 1992 (with its attached programme) and the special conditions for Springwell’s credit approval in September 1992.  Accordingly, I regard the evidence of EM and SPAP, to the extent that they sought to suggest that, during this period, the Private Bank was acting as an investment advisor to Springwell, or discharging investment advisory responsibilities to the latter, because the Private Bank operated as a “filter” on sales to Hellenic Group customers, as exaggerated and incorrect.  </p>

It is not necessary for me to decide what the effect (if any) of these particular confirms were, as they were not relied upon in Chase’s pleaded case, since they do not relate to any of the transactions which form part of Springwell’s claim.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In early 1992 Chase developed a margin forward programme (“the Margin Forward Programme”) in relation to emerging market investments (in the internal documentation often referred to as “LDC paper”) which enabled the purchaser to leverage against the security of the emerging market debt instrument which it was seeking to purchase, rather than (as previously, under the Investment Grade Facility) against the security of other assets, that were required to be of investment grade quality.  The programme was developed in a context where Chase’s competitors were providing a similar dedicated product for the provision of leverage on emerging markets assets, governed by the terms of a margin forward agreement, and were targeting Chase’s Hellenic Group customers who, at that stage, were permitted to leverage emerging markets investments only under the Investment Grade Facility.  It was clear from the evidence that EM and others in his team at the Private Bank were very keen for this programme to be instituted, not only because it would meet the Private Bank’s concerns about the severe encroaching competition, but also because the provision of leverage under the programme would generate additional income for the Private Bank.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Under the terms of a Master Forward Agreement (“MFA”), customers agreed to purchase emerging markets securities from Chase forward, i.e. at a future date (the settlement date), but at the current spot price.  The customer would pay a percentage of the purchase price of the instrument up front (the “haircut” or “downpayment”) and the sale was effected only on the settlement date, when the customer paid the balance of the purchase price, together with the financing charge (or alternatively, agreed to rollover the financing and thus continue the lending).  The settlement date tended to be the next coupon date.  At that point, CIBL would transfer title to the instrument to the customer.  </p>

The eligibility requirements were carefully set out and circulated, so that only clients and instruments which satisfied the relevant criteria would be admitted to the programme.  Only three, or four, of the Hellenic clients qualified initially, and Springwell was one of these.  The detailed criteria for margin forward trading LDC paper were set out in The Chase Manhattan Private Bank Credit Guide, an internal guide for the Private Bank Credit department.  This stipulated, amongst other things, what units within Chase could trade LDC paper with customers and what criteria customers had to meet in order to trade.  It stated that all LDC paper for customer spot and forward purchases had to be approved for trading by the DCCM Group, with no exceptions.  The Credit Guide also set out requirements as to the facilities allowed to customers, line monitoring requirements, margin calls and documentation requirements, as well as credit approval and credit reporting requirements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Margin Forward Programme operated as follows.  Each customer within the Hellenic Group which traded under an MFA was allocated an individual approved credit line, up to which it was permitted to trade.  This was a proportion of the Hellenic Group’s overall allocation under the Margin Forward Programme.  The permitted line up to which a customer was allowed to trade was pre-approved by the Private Bank credit department, and usually GG would give approval for a credit line after conversations, normally with FS, as to the amount of trading a particular Hellenic customer wished to do.  Alternatively, and throughout the material time, it was always open to a customer to trade using cash.  If the Hellenic Group customers were up to their maximum overall allocation under the programme, then an increase for one customer could only be done if another customer within the Hellenic Group took a smaller line, in order to keep overall limits within the allocation for the group.  When the demand warranted it, an increase in the overall limit for the group might be sought to accommodate the increased trading.</p>

On the realistic assumption that it always had net assets over £5 million, then it would never, strictly speaking, have qualified as a private customer, and so would never have been entitled to the benefit of the regulatory obligations imposed on firms in respect of private customers.  Nevertheless, as was explained by Mr. Saunders, a high net worth individual operating through a private investment company would in practice be regarded as a private customer, for whom a non-private customer letter would be appropriate under the SFA Rules, in the event that the customer wished to trade in areas such as the emerging markets, so as to confirm that the regulatory obligations were not owed in relation to trading in that area.</p>

These documents comprised an Experienced Investor Questionnaire (“EIQ”) and a letter setting out the terms of business applicable to the client’s “Dealing in Developing Country Securities” (“the DDCS Letter”).  The EIQ was a necessary document for compliance purposes, but GG was clear that he would not have based any credit decisions solely on that document.  If a customer failed to sign a DDCS Letter, GG would not let that person trade LDC paper.  In addition, the Private Bank Credit Guide identified four required characteristics of customers eligible to trade in LDC debt:  (1) sophistication;  (2) capacity to withstand loss;  (3) prior experience;  and (4) not looking to Chase for advice.  </p>

I find as a fact (to the extent to which it was not common ground) that JA explained the commercial and practical aspects of the MFA to AP, but did not explain, or point out, the effect or detail of the relevant legal provisions of the MFA as set out above.  I find that it is likely that AP would have cast his eye over the agreement, but would not have read it in any detail.  I reject as incredible AP’s evidence that, had he had explained to him, or appreciated, the provisions relating to Springwell’s status as a sophisticated investor, or the acknowledgment that it did not expect Chase to be responsible for advising it as to the investment merits of any Transaction, he would not have signed the MFA on Springwell’s behalf, as being inconsistent with its pre-existing relationship as “had already been made with [EM]”.  Apart from the fact that I have concluded that no such arrangement was made with EM, I find that AP was simply not concerned with the content of contractual documentation during the entirety of his relationship with Chase.  I do not accept that, had either JA, or FS, or indeed other Chase employees, tried to explain to him the detailed meaning or effect of particular clauses in the MFA (or indeed the other contractual documentation), he would have listened to them.  His attitude was that, provided he understood the critical commercial terms so far as he was concerned, namely, what it was going to cost him to borrow, how much he could borrow, and what assets could be leveraged, he simply was not interested in the detail of the individual clauses.  </p>

Thus he suggested in evidence that, had he read the MFA, he would have gone through the document, given Chase his comments and negotiated the terms of the clauses.  That strikes me as wholly unreal speculation.  AP’s main complaint was that he relied upon JA’s recommendations in making his (AP’s) decision as to what investment to make, and that it would have been impossible for him to have run the portfolio without JA’s advice;  he said that he certainly would have objected if he had been told that the terms of the MFA meant that JA could no longer give advice to Springwell.  But the relevant clauses of the MFA (and, indeed, the other contractual documents) did not in any way prevent JA from giving AP recommendations or advice;  all they said, consistently, was that Springwell could not hold Chase responsible for advising it as to the investment merits of any transaction and that Chase was not Springwell’s investment advisor.  But there was nothing to suggest that AP was ever concerned about the question of the legal liability of Chase as an advisor.  AP himself said that it never entered his mind that there might ever come into existence circumstances in which he might want to sue Chase in respect of JA’s advice.  He suggested in evidence that he would never have agreed to have given up such a right.  My conclusion is that, had it been explained to him that the effect of the clause was that he would be unable in the future to sue Chase in respect of JA’s advice, that would have made absolutely no difference whatsoever to his wish to sign up to the MFA programme and to be able to leverage Springwell’s emerging markets purchases more effectively.</p>

Apart from the fact that neither Springwell nor AP had any relationship with Geneva, it was clear from his evidence (and, indeed, that of JA), that what AP (and other Hellenic clients) really valued was his ability to access the trading floor at IFI directly, and to deal person to person with JA, thereby affording Springwell access to real time information and keener pricing.  The transcripts show AP’s recurring impatience to buy paper and to make immediate investment decisions.  The notion that AP would have rather dealt through a Geneva Private Banker, who would have given him investment advice, but not permitted AP to have had any direct access to the trading floor (which process necessarily would have been much slower and would not have resulted in AP having current pricing information), than sign up to the MFA and its exclusion clauses, I regard as unreal.  </p>

I conclude that Chase would not have permitted Springwell access to the leverage afforded by the Margin Forward Programme, had AP refused to sign the MFA;  nor would Chase have been prepared to have negotiated the removal or amendment of the provisions whereby Springwell acknowledged that it was not relying on advice from Chase and that it was a sophisticated investor.  Moreover, it is inconceivable, in my judgment, that AP would have chosen to terminate his existing and successful trading relationship with Chase, in circumstances where Chase was insisting on Springwell signing the MFA without any amendment to the relevant provisions, simply because of the issue that Chase was refusing to accept legal liability in respect of advice, which was an issue that had never entered his mind in the past.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Between April 1992 and September 1997, when the MFA was replaced by another market standard document, the GMRA, Chase provided leverage to Springwell in many transactions in respect of the latter’s purchase of emerging markets assets under the terms of the MFA.  For that purpose CIBL provided confirms in accordance with the standard form annexed to the MFA.  In the same way as Springwell had previously signed the confirms under the original Investment Grade Facility, it duly signed the confirms under the MFA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was no dispute on the evidence as to the manner in which the confirms and other transaction documentation was provided.  As explained by AP, multiple copies were in fact provided to Springwell.  Either on the day he had agreed the transaction or the next day, he would receive the documentation by fax from Chase in London.  He would go through it and check that it contained the information that JA had given him about the transaction.  Two or three days later, further copies of the transaction documentation would be sent by Chase New York to Springwell in London.  At least from 1996, copies would also be sent to Piraeus.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, there was no dispute on the evidence as to the circumstances in which Springwell came to sign the documentation.  The confirms were not promptly signed and returned on receipt.  Instead, AP would allow a backlog to build up, and Chase would eventually arrange to bring round a batch of further copies, which would be signed in one sitting and handed back to Chase.  They would be signed in London, rather than Greece, usually by George Vakirtsis (the Polemis Group Head of Accounts in London), purportedly in the name of JBAX, a nominee director of Springwell, who resided in Greece.  There was no dispute, however, on the evidence that these gentlemen played no part in Springwell’s decision making or business, which was conducted entirely by the Polemises, and in particular, AP.</p>

However, as I have said, it was not in dispute that Springwell did in fact sign copies of the MFA confirms.  The documents contain frequent manuscript notations and marks, which show that SP and AP carefully checked and reviewed at least the financial terms of the transactions.  </p>

The letter also set out terms of business applicable in respect of Springwell’s “Dealings in Developing Country Securities”.  According to the date stamp on the copy disclosed by Springwell, the 1992 DDCS Letter was received by it on 1 December 1992.  It does not appear to have been signed and returned to Chase.</p>

It also stated that Springwell was purchasing all emerging markets paper on an execution only basis and was not looking to Chase for advice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were two versions of Springwell’s 1993 EIQ in evidence.  The first version is signed by EM, although there is no date next to his signature, and also either by another Chase officer, who has dated his signature 8 May 1993, or again by EM himself, who was unclear whether the second signature was his or not;  the actual position matters not.  The second version is identical in every respect, save that EM has this time dated his signature 11 June 1993, and the second signature does not appear.  In his oral evidence, AP sought to suggest that the version of the EIQ bearing the date 8 May 1993 was backdated so that it preceded a subsequent DDCS letter dated 28 May 1993.  However the point was not put to EM, the author of the document, or to any other Chase witness.  In any event the allegation is an irrelevant one, since, even if the document had been backdated, EM did not suggest that he had changed his views about what was said in the EIQ between 8 May 1993 and 28 May 1993.  Thus, in his oral evidence, he confirmed that he would not have signed the EIQ without going through the document to check the answers which had been filled in by his subordinate;  he confirmed that the statement that Springwell was “a sophisticated investor involved in a broad investment product range” who had “traded extensively in LDC debt for well over 3 years” was “absolutely accurate”;  he further confirmed that, as set out in the form, AP was fully aware of the speculative nature of the investments and must “absolutely” have known of the identified risks attached to it.  However, in relation to the statement in the EIQ that Springwell was purchasing all emerging markets paper on an execution only basis, and was not looking to Chase for advice, he regarded that statement as being “a little bit stretched”, although not so stretched that he felt unable to sign the document as Springwell’s Relationship Manager.</p>

Finbarr, because he was in the shipping department before and because of the relationship we had with Chase -- we did all the closes with Chase and Chase would always pay for all the ships -- it was actually Finbarr, instead of somebody from our office, who was in all the closings.  He was the one who would make all the payments.  He had power of authority from us.  He would make all the payments.

He accepted, when pressed in cross-examination, that he did not explain paragraphs 4 or 7 of the Letter to AP and appeared to accept that AP would not have read the letter, although in reality it was clear that he had no actual memory of the meeting at all.

He was clearly not in good health and was nothing like as articulate or impressive as many of his superiors.  He appeared unwilling to accept that on any level Chase might have been giving advice to Springwell, which I found unrealistic.  His principal functions, even after he subsequently became Springwell’s Relationship Manager, were administrative and clearly he was a reliable administrator, who was valued and trusted by AP, in that capacity.  Indeed, AP had considerable respect (and subsequently sympathy) for FS.  But AP would have been well aware that FS’ functions were mainly administrative and that he was not a high flier.   I found FS to be an honest witness who did his best to assist the court, even though in many respects his recollection was poor.</p>

Springwell clearly had potential liabilities to CIBL under the MFA and I do not consider that it would have troubled AP in the slightest that its assets (mainly those which had been purchased under the programme, and were in any event held by Chase) stood as security in respect of such liabilities.  </p>

Despite some unfortunate passages in transcripts of later telephone conversations with JA, I do not consider that FS was in fact the type of person who would have presented a document for signature to a client, knowing that the client would not sign it if he read it.  I do not consider that FS was sharp or dishonest, which is what this allegation implies.  In particular, I do not consider that FS would have been foolish enough to have attempted to pull the wool over the eyes of a client as astute as AP.  Whatever AP’s general propensity not to read documents, there was every risk that he might read something as short as the 1993 DDCS Letter.</p>

Again, it was on CMB writing paper, but signed on behalf of CMB, CMIL and CIBL (by then under its new name of Chase Manhattan Bank Plc).  This letter was also signed and returned by way of purported acceptance by Springwell.

Classification as a non-private customer was a necessary pre-condition, laid down in New York, for participation in the programmes.  Another necessary requirement was the signing of the relevant confirmations and legal agreements.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I conclude, that by sending the letters, CMB, CIBL and CMIL made it clear to Springwell that, in respect of transactions otherwise subject to the rules of the SFA, Springwell was not entitled to the regulatory protections available to a private customer.  They also confirmed that they were not undertaking any obligation to Springwell to advise as to suitability or to take steps to enable Springwell to understand the nature of the risks involved in any transaction which Springwell chose to conclude.  On the face of the documents, by signing the latter two letters, Springwell purportedly agreed to these terms.  Furthermore, in such manner Springwell also purportedly agreed and represented that it placed no reliance at all on Chase and further that it was itself able to evaluate the merits and risks associated with the instruments it purchased.  I accept that it was only on this basis that Chase was willing to conduct business with Springwell in the way which it did.  The issue which I have to decide, in the light of the defined Key Issues, however, is whether, in all the circumstances, Chase is entitled to rely on the assurances purportedly given by Springwell.  I address this issue as part of my conclusions in relation to the legal analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell began to invest in emerging markets products in the very early 1990s, and its portfolio held at Chase grew exponentially as the 1990s progressed.  From 1990 to mid-1991 these were mainly concentrated in Mexican and Brazilian investments.  From mid-1991 to 1994 Springwell made further investments in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.  Until 1994, Springwell also maintained an account at Banco do Brasil through which it also purchased emerging markets investments up to an amount of approximately $ 35 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By 1991, Springwell already had a significant portfolio of emerging markets instruments, primarily in Mexico and Brazil, in what were the very early days of the market.  Thus, as an example of the extent of Springwell’s emerging market portfolio,  as at 21 February 1991 Springwell’s safe custody account  comprised $ 54.5 million LDC paper at CMB New York and $ 65.2 million LDC paper at CIBL, London, a total of $ 119.7 million.  The investments purchased included mainly Latin American instruments.  Latin America was the centre of the emerging markets business in the early 1990s, and, as AP described in his oral evidence, the Polemis brothers, and in particular SP, had extensive experience in Brazil through the shipping business, so they felt comfortable in that market.  In his evidence, AP stated that the idea of emerging markets investments was attractive to him because of the rate of return on the investments which was better than had previously been available.  The fact that, in 1991, when Springwell had $ 100 million invested in emerging markets, the Mexican Brady bonds had just been issued and Brazil was still in default on foreign currency bank debt, shows how early in the development of emerging markets trading Springwell was involved.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="79">

By the mid-1990s, I find that the Polemises had indeed become highly experienced investors in the emerging markets.  As I have described, they had been involved at the inception of the market and developed their portfolio as the market developed.  Following the Petrobras issue in 1991, Springwell continued to buy Brazilian instruments, including Brazilian government ‘C’ bonds, which were restructured defaulted loans.  It also purchased a number of other Petrobras bonds </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From mid-1991 to 1994 Springwell made further emerging markets investments in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela in keeping with the growth in volumes traded in the market generally;  thus, from mid-1991 to the end of 1994, the Springwell portfolio trebled in an improving market.  In Springwell's portfolio, Mexican assets declined both in absolute and percentage terms during this period.  It appears that the Mexican assets in Springwell's portfolio were replaced by Brazilian, Argentinean and Venezuelan instruments as these countries completed their Brady restructurings.  These countries would have presented better yield opportunities than Mexico at that time.  Further, the increase in the leverage sought by Springwell over the same period contributed to the expansion in the profits and the reinvested profits in turn caused the portfolio to expand further.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, various emerging markets investments were also made by Springwell through their account with Banco do Brasil, London branch.  This account had been opened in the late 1980s.  The Polemis brothers had a connection through the wife of the branch manager.  They had initially placed $ 2.5 million on time deposit, which, over time, they increased to $ 35 million.  In addition, further emerging markets investments were made through Banco do Brasil:  $ 5 million of a Banco do Brasil bond issue was bought in May 1992 and two Petrobras bonds (in sums of $5 million and $15 million) were bought in 1993.  SP, rather than AP, was responsible for these investments and his evidence was that he believed they were both solid companies.  The Banco do Brasil relationship ended in 1994 when the account was closed and the bonds still held at that bank were transferred to Chase.  This demonstrates the Polemis brothers’ ability to invest in emerging markets investments through banks other than Chase, as well as their experience in this market.</p>

By March 1994, less than three years later, Springwell had increased its forward margin line up to $ 350 million.  This was almost 45% of the total existing allocation to the Hellenic Group clients of $ 785 million at that time.  By December 1995, the credit line had increased to $ 440 million, and by June 1997 to $ 500 million.  In 1998, there was an application afoot to increase the line to $ 600 million.  Requests for forward credit line increases were made on the following dates:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject this suggestion.  The contemporaneous documents and other evidence show that it was AP, during the whole period, who was the driving force behind the requests for increases in the leverage facilities so that he could, potentially, generate greater returns for Springwell.  I have no doubt that he was well aware that the use of leverage increased the risks on the portfolio, because of the possibility of margin calls, and that, ultimately, the finance would have to be repaid to Chase.  I find that, notwithstanding his careful strategy of maintaining a low level of borrowings in relation to the Polemis shipping fleet, when it came to Springwell’s portfolio, he was extremely keen to maximise the use of leverage so as to maximise returns.  Indeed, at one stage the Private Bank was complaining that AP would not do a trade unless he could leverage it to the hilt.  On another occasion AP complained that one of the reasons he did not want to purchase further emerging market investments from Merrill Lynch was that it would not allow him to leverage as he wanted to do.  The later transcripts of his telephone conversations with JA also show that his focus was on the enhanced returns that leverage made potentially available.  He considered his “liquidity” (i.e. the amount of funds that Springwell had potentially available to invest) as being the leveraged amount, and he regarded investments not financed as representing money lost.  </p>

In around 1993, on KOD’s promotion to co-Head of Global Markets, he took over as Head of Emerging Markets and then as Head of IFI.  He retained a very senior position in these departments, including being a Member of Chase’s Senior Committee until he left Chase in 2003.  JJ was clearly a highly intelligent and experienced banker.  Although JA did not have a direct reporting line to JJ, but rather JA reported to his immediate superiors, who reported in turn to JJ, JJ did have a lot of contact with JA, as a senior salesman, and received frequent reports from him.  JJ summarised his assessment of Springwell’s approach to emerging markets investments as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The expansion in leveraged emerging market purchases by Springwell was not peculiar to Springwell, as there was a rapid and dramatic expansion of emerging markets business generally within the Hellenic Group customer base and beyond.  However, it is clear from the speed with which the expanded credit lines were utilised by Springwell that AP had a real enthusiasm for expanding the profitable enterprise in which Springwell was engaged.  The notion that he was a passive participant in the grant of ever-increasing facilities, or that JA was the driving force behind such increases, is simply not consistent with the commercial reality, as I find it to have been.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence shows that the frequent requests by the Private Bank to the Credit Department to increase the facility were clearly as a result of pressure exerted by AP.  I conclude that the expansion of the leverage in the Springwell portfolio was a deliberate decision on AP’s part, in line with Springwell’s investment objectives.  I also find that AP was motivated by the profitability of the leveraged emerging markets investments.  These profits were re-invested by way of coupons and capital gains and the Springwell portfolio thus expanded exponentially during this period.  Contrary to Springwell’s allegations, the evidence showed that the expansion in the Springwell portfolio cannot be attributed to shipping profits alone, or even in the main.  I find AP to have been astute and shrewd in his dealings where leverage was concerned, as with everything to do with his portfolio.  He was a skilled negotiator, who, perfectly legitimately, used his position as a large, profitable and valued customer within the Private Bank to obtain the best financing terms available, such as lower downpayments and higher advance rates.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, for example, in connection with the increase in Springwell’s forward credit line from $ 40 million to $ 90 million in September 1992, SPAP, in a memorandum to KOD dated 24 September 1992 which sought an increase in the forward line for all Hellenic customers, wrote that the Private Bank was:</p>

I conclude that any pressure and urgency to accommodate the request is likely to have come from Springwell in order that it could continue trading emerging markets paper on margin.  Thus, in his memorandum, dated 25 September 1992, in support of Springwell’s application, SPAP stated that Springwell was the group’s most important customer and that Springwell was heavily marketed by the competition.  The memorandum continued:</p>

Other tactics employed by AP to obtain increased leveraged facilities included statements that he was intending to increase Springwell’s IMA investments with Chase.  There was, of course, absolutely nothing wrong in the deployment of such tactics, but they accurately paint the picture of a shrewd businessman using his commercial position as a means of driving a hard bargain for better terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the hearing, Chase produced graphs showing the growth in the overall limit of the Hellenic Group’s margin forward line from April 1992 to November 1993, and the proportion of the Hellenic Group’s margin forward line taken up by Springwell.  The graphs show that the Hellenic Group’s margin forward line increased rapidly.  Starting at $ 100 million in April 1992, it had doubled to $ 200 million by January 1993.  Two months later, by March 1993, the line had doubled again to $ 400 million.  It continued to increase rapidly to November 1993, by which time it had doubled again to $ 800 million.  What is striking is not only the speed with which the line increased, reflecting the clear appetite for leverage under the Margin Forward Programme within the Hellenic Group, but the proportion of that line taken up by Springwell alone.  The graphs show that, during the April 1992-November 1993 period, Springwell never utilised less than about one third of the overall line.  This demonstrates not only that the Hellenic Group as a whole was keen to participate in this market, but also shows Springwell’s appetite for leverage.</p>

The demand for emerging markets paper among the Hellenic clients of the Private Bank was fuelled by the availability of the programme.  By 1994, the total global Margin Forward Programme had expanded to a line of credit of $ 1.3 billion in the two years since its introduction in 1992, and the forecast was for the global programme to grow to $ 2.5 billion over the following twelve months.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence clearly showed that GG had a firm but sensible style of credit risk management.  He was an extremely effective credit officer for the Bank, not rigidly inflexible, but always careful and prudent to look out for the risk areas and to manage that risk in the best way possible in the Bank’s interests.  It was his job to be conservative and cautious with the Bank’s money.  It was his job to be a prudent foil to the relationship side of the Private Bank such as FS and also a counterbalance to the salesman on the desks such as JA.  As GG himself remarked in cross-examination, “I have been a prophet of thirteen of the last nine country problems”.  An internal credit audit report produced in May 1995 endorsed the high quality of GG’s credit risk management and stated that he had been extremely effective in managing and controlling credit risk in respect of the Margin Forward Programme.  In relation to the operation of the Margin Forward Programme in London, the report stated:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, Springwell’s participation, from an early stage, in programmes of this type, showed an ever-increasing sophistication on the part of AP and SP, and an ability to negotiate commercial terms relating to the leverage facilities.  The perception of Chase, both in the Private Bank in London and New York, would have been of Springwell as an aggressive and sophisticated client, well able to employ tough negotiating tactics to achieve its commercial ends.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, as relationship manager at the Private Bank, EM was clearly responsible for the overall relationship between Springwell and Chase, irrespective of, and additional to, the contractual relationships that came into existence as a result of Springwell purchasing specific products or services from CMB or CIBL.  In that sense it could fairly be said that the Private Bank’s relationship with Springwell was an “umbrella” type of relationship that could potentially have given rise to obligations beyond those contained in the specific contractual relationships between Springwell and the specific product groups.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, I find that the Private Bank credit department, in consultation with EM as relationship manager, put into place certain conditions as to gross credit lines and limitations on the construction and geographical spread of the portfolios of members of the Hellenic Group in relation to emerging market investments, as described above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, I find that EM was a very active relationship manager, so far as Springwell and other Hellenic Group clients were concerned.  For example, I find that, as KOD explained, on frequent occasions he would ring her up, as JA’s superior in IFI, and complain to her that JA/IFI had breached or violated various credit or portfolio limits, not only in relation to Springwell, but also in relation to other Hellenic clients.  (Her evidence was, in fact, that these complaints were not well-founded.) I also find, as again KOD described, that EM was very concerned to know from a marketing point of view what had been sold to Springwell, and was constantly ringing up to find out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixth, I find that the internal memoranda and other evidence shows that EM, far from being concerned, from Springwell’s perspective, about the suitability or otherwise of  the emerging markets investments that Springwell was buying, was far more concerned to ensure that a greater percentage of the income generated by Springwell’s purchases was received by his department.  Thus the contemporaneous documents demonstrate that EM was a whole-hearted and enthusiastic proponent of the emerging markets assets sales business conducted between the Hellenic Group clients and the Investment Bank.  His regular monthly reports within the Private Bank repeatedly expressed delight at the level of sales and the consequential income accruing to Chase, and the Private Bank in particular.  In none of those reports did EM express any concern at all as to:  the nature of the selling process;  the conduct of the Investment Bank;  the role of JA;  the ability of the Private Bank to undertake supervisory responsibilities;  the type of instruments being sold;  or any consequential concentration issues within any customer’s portfolio.  Instead, (and save for complaining that the Private Bank was not obtaining a sufficiently large share of revenue) his reports are universally positive and uncritical.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Seventh, I find that EM was, as relationship manager, and as KOD described, in general terms “supervising” the account as between Springwell and CMB.  But to the extent that EM and the Private Bank were exercising a monitoring or supervisory role in relation to the suitability of Springwell’s purchases, I conclude that they were doing so in the context of discharging the credit control responsibilities of the Private Bank, and of being the person, or unit, within Chase who, or which, was responsible for the relationship with the client, and who, or which, would take the blame if the client failed as a Chase counter-party.  EM graphically described in his oral evidence the responsibilities which he had in this respect.  EM stated in his written evidence that, after the start of direct dealings between JA and AP, he continued to monitor and supervise what was going on and held himself out as doing so;  and that he did this because he regarded Chase’s role as a fiduciary role which involved,<span style="font-style:italic"> inter alia</span>:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… looking after the interests of the customer and ensuring that the customer did not do anything which was not in its own interests which involved conducting thorough due diligence on investments to ensure that they were appropriate”.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">I reject this evidence in so far as it sought to suggest that the Private Bank during this period was doing so in the context of an investment advisory relationship with Springwell, or of discharging (or purporting to discharge) its obligations under such a relationship to ensure that Springwell received the pleaded type of advice as to the composition of its portfolio or the appropriateness of its investments.  Moreover, I reject his evidence that EM, or the Private Bank in London, were “ensuring that the customer did not do anything which was not in its own interests” or were “conducting thorough due diligence on investments to ensure that they were appropriate”.  There was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that EM, or his department in London, was conducting “thorough due diligence on investments to ensure that they were appropriate” for Springwell’s portfolio as part of an investment advisory function.  My conclusion on the evidence is that, provided the credit functions were properly managed, EM had no role in approving individual purchases by Springwell from JA, or in respect of wider issues such as the overall balance of Springwell’s portfolio.  As to the individual purchases, EM accepted in evidence that he had had no background or expertise in emerging markets at any stage in his career, and therefore was not in any position to discharge a role in second-guessing what JA had offered and sold Springwell.  Moreover, the only time during this period that country concentration was raised as an issue, was in the context of a credit approval in January 1993.  There was no evidence that EM took any other steps to monitor or concern himself with concentration issues, and KOD confirmed that none of his complaints concerned such issues.  In fact, the country concentration issue was monitored as part of the credit process in New York.  His views as to whether the Private Bank was discharging a “fiduciary role” are inadmissible, but, in any event, they are not supported by the evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Eighth, as with the earlier period when EM was in the Shipping Department, there is no documentary material showing that EM, or the Private Bank, ever held the Private Bank out to Springwell as offering the service of general investment advisor, or of wealth manager, or ever held it out as discharging this function.  Thus, there is no evidence that AP ever placed an order through EM, or any evidence that he ever discussed any individual product, or the portfolio as a whole, with EM.  Nor is there any evidence that, during this period of EM’s presence at the Private Bank, AP received any reports, reviews, analyses or other investment advisory materials in relation to his portfolio of emerging markets paper or general, or specific wealth management advice, whether from EM or anyone else.  In general, therefore, I found EM’s evidence in this area to be exaggerated and unreliable.</p>

In effect, from March 1994, FS became Springwell’s relationship manager.

The “product specialists”, access to whom was permitted to eligible Private Bank clients only, included JA (IFI), Sewanyana Kironde (Investment Management Geneva) and Mark Haines (Capital Markets – financing), among others.  There was some debate before me as to whether a structure chart produced in the summer of 1994 before MF arrived in London and entitled:  “The Chase Hellenic Team:  Team dedicated to XYZ Company”, which included JA and the other specialists referred to above in a box at the bottom of the page, unconnected by any lines to the Private Bank boxes at the top, showed that JA was indeed part of something called “the Chase Hellenic Team”, and/or was supervised by the Private Bank.  The chart showed MF at the top of the page, with direct lines linking him to boxes marked “Private Banking and Investment”, “Shipping” and “Piraeus”, which respectively contained the names of Private Bank department employees and Shipping Department employees (or, in the case of “Piraeus”) a blank.  There was then a gap, below which there were boxes showing the various product specialists, including JA, and MF as a derivatives specialist.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence of MF was that, at most, there was a dotted reporting line running up from JA to MF, JA’s principal and day-to-day reporting line being to JA’s IFI superiors in New York.  MF’s evidence, which I accept, was that he saw his role as partially supervising JA, in the sense that, although the personnel in the Private Bank would not have had the skills to supervise JA’s emerging markets activities, if, for example, JA had tripled Springwell’s credit lines and invested the entire portfolio in Venezuelan securities, MF would have intervened and telephoned JA immediately.  Thus there might, in a loose sense, as this chart suggests, have been some sort of “Chase Hellenic Team” in the sense of employees from CMB or CIBL who were involved in the provision of services or products to the Hellenic Group, or the operation of the Margin Forward Programme, but that fact in itself does not, in my judgment, really assist in the determination of the issue as to whether the Private Bank, through JA or otherwise, had a duty of care to give investment advice in the terms pleaded.  </p>

JA described it to FS on 22 December 1994 as “the biggest meltdown…in emerging markets’ history”.  A period of instability followed, as the peso continued to lose 50 percent of its value in the succeeding months and contagion spread into other Latin American countries.  As a result, spreads on Mexican par and discount bonds widened and the price of bonds fell sharply.  Thus spreads on Mexican par and discount bonds increased from about 250 basis points (“bps”) on 8 December 1994 to over 600 bps between December 1994 and January 1995.  They then fell slightly before widening to about 800 bps by March 1995, when the  Government announced a $ 50 billion loan for Mexico.  Spreads then began to fall until May 1995, when they levelled off at between 450-500 bps.  Spreads on other Latin American par and discount bonds followed a similar pattern.  </p>

JA had discussed Springwell’s exposure in a conversation with FS on 3 January 1995.  FS had called him because he had been reading about the Mexican crisis in the papers and was concerned to check whether his clients had been badly hit.  JA told FS that there had been a big devaluation in Mexico and the markets had been in turmoil, that some of his clients were sitting on some “pretty substantial” losses, and that one had “got hurt” because of his peso exposure.  JA remarked that AP, however, was “in good shape”, because “he doesn’t have any Mexico because it never yielded enough”.</p>

AP also recalled in his oral evidence that he and JA felt that that the Tequila crisis was a “good opportunity to buy something cheaper”.  The evidence shows that Springwell then invested heavily in Mexican and other Latin American securities.  Thus, on 22 February 1995, Springwell bought a $ 3 million face value Mexican bond (Pemex FRN) at 93.75 on leverage, and thereafter applied very large sums of money from other maturing bonds on the acquisition of further Mexican securities over the next weeks and months, some at quite substantial discounts to par, which necessarily reflected the greater risk in the investment.  By 31 July 1995, the proportion of Mexican assets in Springwell’s portfolio by face value had risen from about 13% in December 1994 to about 30%, or $ 140.57 million.

In his witness statement JA stated that, after the Tequila crisis, AP often expressed regret that Springwell did not invest enough in the Tequila crisis and made it clear that he wanted to look for similar situations elsewhere, so that he could take advantage of other periods of volatility.  Although, in his witness statement, AP sought to imply that the Tequila crisis had had little, or no, impact on Springwell’s trading strategy, that no-one had described it as a crisis to him at the time and that the pattern of Springwell’s purchases did not change, I find this difficult to accept, since Springwell started and continued to invest significantly in Mexico shortly after the crisis struck, which was a significant change in the pattern of its trading.  Further, the implicit suggestion that no-one at Chase informed AP of the scale of the crisis at the time, I also find on the evidence to have been unlikely.  </p>

Springwell signed by way of acceptance ML’s letter setting out this classification.  On 26 August 1997, the lending at ML was similarly transferred onto a repo programme, under a GMRA, which was the standard form leverage document for repo transactions.  The letter was signed by way of acceptance by JBAX on behalf of Springwell.  During the course of the relationship, ML recorded its assessment of Springwell’s investments objectives and of the understanding and sophistication of the Polemises.  In summary, the assessment of ML was very similar to that of JA and Chase.  Thus in 1995 ML classified Springwell as an expert, with a very good risk knowledge.  In a detailed client review in 1997, and after AP had met several senior managers of the bank, ML again concluded that AP was an expert investor:</p>

It is correct that the transcripts record AP discussing with JA certain recommendations that ML have made to him and asking for JA’s views about those recommendations.  It is also correct that JA, in a telephone conversation with the in-house investment advisor to another Hellenic client, bragged that he also “sort of managed” Springwell’s ML portfolio as well as that at Chase.  However, the evidence also showed many examples of investments having been bought without any reference to JA and, indeed, examples of investments being either bought, or not bought, through ML <span style="text-decoration:underline">against</span> JA’s recommendations.  Many of the purchases made by AP from ML were entirely unknown to JA and there are examples on the transcripts of telephone calls between JA and AP, where AP tells JA that he has made a particular purchase or sale at ML, in the absence of any prior discussion with JA.  If, as he strongly contended, and the internal ML detailed client review reported, AP did not act on the basis of ML’s recommendations, then Springwell’s decision to make such purchases could only have been taken on the basis of AP’s own assessment, even though this is something which, according to Springwell’s pleaded case, he was “never in a position to do because he lacked both the information and expertise to do it”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="82">

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">ML marketed similar types of product to Springwell, including GKO-Linked Notes, as Chase did.  The principal reasons, it appears from the evidence, that the relationship with ML did not flourish as much as the relationship with Chase were that:  (a) ML required a fixed measure of geographical concentration for leveraged purchases which irritated AP;  and (b) they also made the mistake on occasions of trying to sell him assets over par, rather than the “cheap” and “distressed” assets that he consistently sought from JA.  This is relevant to Springwell’s claim that Springwell had an extremely conservative attitude to risk and that, had Chase advised Springwell as to the dangers associated with geographical over-concentration for leveraged purchases, Springwell would have acted differently.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">AP would use his relationship with ML as a lever for his transactions with Springwell, and vice versa.  For example, he would ring up and compare prices that each bank respectively had on offer.  ML also, on occasions, provided AP with market information, in addition to their recommendations.  For example, in 1997, it sent AP a lengthy 40-page report on the Russian Banking System, which AP told JA that he had read and found interesting.  Again, this is indicative of AP’s sophistication and ability to make decisions on his own as to what investments to make.</p>

It is clear from the evidence, including the transcripts of their telephone conversations, that, during the period when Springwell was building up its portfolio in Russian securities, JA and AP had wide ranging discussions about what AP should buy and the nature and terms of the relevant securities.  I find, as was accepted by Mr. Hapgood on behalf of Chase, that JA gave recommendations to AP about such investments;  I also characterise those recommendations as “advice”.  But I also find that the decision whether, and how much, to invest, was invariably taken by AP himself.</p>

The trip was organized by Chase and similar trips had been arranged for other markets.  The formula was that Chase traders would travel to a particular country with a group of key investors to meet with local policy officials, analysts and others involved in the financial markets.  Chase’s guests would attend a number of seminars with these experts and also spend time socializing with each other.  The purpose of the trip to Russia was for select institutional and large private investor clients of Chase to become more familiar with the Russian markets.  Around twelve or so Chase customers, including AP, attended the visit to Russia, including two other Hellenic clients.  The trip was not just focused on Russian government issues, but also focused on the banking system generally.  There were meetings with representatives from the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance among others.</p>

He said that he had enjoyed the visit to Russia and, having visited it, became more comfortable with the idea of making Russian investments, because he had gained a sense of the normality of everyday life in Russia which he had not known before the visit.  </p>

After this, and beginning with the start of the Asian crisis marked by the fall in the Thai baht on 2 July 1997, the market began its downward trend.  Although AP was reluctant to accept the word “spectacular” in relation to the profits he had made over the period, it is clear that his portfolio had, to his knowledge, been extremely profitable, and in fact, he used the word “spectacular” himself a few days later in evidence to describe the profits made during this time.  However, the corollary to this bull market was of course that yields had been falling and prices rising, which meant that AP was finding the existing emerging markets countries of Latin America and Brazil expensive.  </p>

He clearly, at this time, understood the point that, in order to attract capital, it was necessary for Russia to offer higher yields, because of the risks of investing in Russia.  That was, as he recognised, consistent with his earlier experience in investing in Brazil.  He clearly appreciated that, despite the greater risks involved, the market was keen to invest in Russia because of the high yields being offered.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, Sovereign Russian debt instruments available to international investors at relevant times during the 1990s primarily fell into three categories:  (a) restructured debt of the former Soviet Union;  (b) new sovereign dollar-denominated Russian Federation debt;  and (c) local currency Russian internal sovereign debt (initially off-limits to non-resident investors, but subsequently made available via the S-Account regime).  There was also a range of corporate and sub-sovereign Eurobonds which were issued during 1996 and 1997.  The reports show, in effect, that Russia opened its doors to the international capital markets in 1996, through the combination of allowing foreigners access to the GKO market and the issue of the first sovereign Eurobond in November 1996.  Throughout the period to the Russian default in August 1998, these two sources of international capital remained important to Russia.</p>

The bonds were initially restricted to Russian resident accounts and were not available to offshore investors.  Although GKOs financed a small part of Russia’s deficit in 1993 (about 0.1% of GDP), gross issues were increased significantly in 1994 and the market in GKOs took off between 1995 and 1997.  </p>

JA gave evidence that GKOs were attractive to his clients, because they offered a higher yield and a shorter term than treasury bills from many other emerging market sovereigns;  his view was that, in the context of emerging markets investments, sovereign paper was perceived to be a better quality credit risk than corporate paper;  further, his view was that, because GKOs were denominated in roubles, rather than in foreign currencies, that reduced the perceived risks of government default still further.  In order to avoid the restrictions in relation to offshore ownership, a number of Russian and international banks developed  pass-through, or derivative structures, whereby GKOs were held by a nominally Russian structure, which in turn issued participation rights to offshore investors, or via similar “grey” structures, allowing foreign investors to own them indirectly.  These derivative structures either provided outright exposure to domestic rouble denominated debts, or provided such exposure, combined with a deliverable or non-deliverable currency hedge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, after intense lobbying from foreign investors, the rules were changed in 1996 to allow direct participation by non-residents in the GKO market.  Initially, this was done by a complex system involving placing dollar deposits at the foreign subsidiaries of the Russian Central Bank (“CBR”) for a guaranteed return in dollars.  The effective dollar returns from this scheme were quite high and the scheme was profitable for foreign investors.  The next stage in the process was a CBR order of 26 July 1996 enacting a regulation which, for the first time, allowed non-residents to invest directly in the GKO markets.  This was done through “S-Accounts” held with authorised Russian banks.  The S Account regime was an integral part of the mechanism devised by the Russian authorities for non-resident investment in GKOs and the repatriation of funds realized from these investments.  An investor would sell dollars for roubles which would be credited to the S Account and used to buy GKOs.  Repatriation of the balance on the S Account initially required entering into a 6-month forward contract with an S Account bank.  The waiting period was subsequently reduced and by early 1998 all restrictions on capital outflows were lifted.  However, many non-residents still sought to hedge their currency exposure with large Russian commercial banks.  </p>

The evidence showed that feedback from Chase’s emerging markets salesmen suggested that there was strong customer interest in structured (i.e. derivative) notes, which would have allowed customers exposure to the GKO market without directly investing themselves;  it appeared that, in such a manner, investors felt that they could avoid many of the operational, legal and documentary complications associated with the S Account regime;  further, many considered themselves better off investing through large financial institutions rather than directly, should problems develop in the future.  </p>

The position changed in June 1997, when Springwell started to buy Notes hedged with one of two Russian private banks, namely Imperial Bank and Inkombank.  From November 1997 onwards, Springwell also bought Notes hedged with two Russian state-owned banks, Sberbank and VTB.  The precise details of the purchases of the impugned Notes are set out in Appendix I to Springwell’s closing submissions.</p>

Many of the Russian laws and regulations are new and untested, are unclear and imprecise in their drafting and contradict other laws.  Legal acts may be enforced retroactively and Russian authorities may change their interpretation of existing legal acts and lack judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting the applicable rules.  Russian laws and regulations are not always consistent with market practices, resulting in ambiguities, inconsistencies and anomalies.  For example, the documentation for a forward contract or option contract with a Russian counterparty by means of a Reuters/Swift confirmation may be inconsistent with the Russian legal requirements for following certain signature formalities for financial agreements and may affect the enforceability of such contract.</p>

As a result, JA’s general practice was that he sent the sample documentation (which was essentially a blank trade confirmation, with the associated terms sheet and risk disclosures) to all of his customers to whom he intended to introduce the GKO-Linked Note product.  Subsequently, he would telephone the customer to whom he was  introducing the GKO-Linked Note for the first time, and go through the various risk disclosures.  I accept that he adopted this practice in Springwell’s case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the case of Springwell, the confirm usually bore the same date as the trade date, although the fax annotations on some of the documents  apparently show that some of them were faxed after the settlement date;  the confirm stated that a GKO-Linked Note “has been issued by [CMSCI] to [Springwell] (the “Customer”) on” a stated date, which was the settlement date, which was usually 4 or 5 days after the trade date;  in addition to the commercial terms of the Note, the confirm recorded the obligation of the Holder to pay the Consideration Amount on the settlement date, and that upon receipt of that payment CMSCI would fax a copy of the Note to <span style="font-style:italic">“</span>the Holder” for signature.  Because each of the Failed Notes was leveraged, “the Holder” was CMB, and it was thus CMB who was to pay the Consideration Amount;  the confirm also recorded (as quoted above) that, because of the financing, the non-transfer/ non-assign provisions were to be waived because the Note was to be sold by Springwell to CMB, and subsequently re-sold to Springwell, and that it was agreed that “in furtherance of the foregoing” the Note was to be issued to CMB.  Although the precise position was clear from this wording, the previous statement that the Note “has been issued by [CMSCI] to [Springwell] (the “Customer”)”, was incorrect in the sense that the Note had in fact been issued to CMB, albeit at the direction of Springwell, which, having acquired the contractual entitlement to the issue of the Note to itself at the trade date, was on-selling the Note to CMB under the financing arrangements.  Mr. Brindle sought to make something of this point, but in my view it was irrelevant to the issue of Springwell’s awareness of the relevant provisions of the GKO-Linked Note documentation.</p>

My conclusion is based not merely on the transaction documents that do exist in relation to Springwell but also on the fact that Chase retained spreadsheets for tracking both the returned confirms, and the sending out of copy Notes, and had a process for the chasing up of signatures.  Further, shortly after JDM took over in early May 1998, the team re-faxed all outstanding documents and pressed for completion of the various formalities.  After the Russian default, an audit was done of the documentary process and the conclusion was that it was largely complete.  Indeed, JDM’s spreadsheet sent in early September recorded that Springwell had only one outstanding unsigned trade confirm.  </p>

Indeed, AP admitted in evidence that he had signed at least two Terms and Conditions sheets, and risk disclosure statements sheets, in the name of JBAX, despite the fact that Springwell’s pleaded case, supported by AP’s statement of truth,  stated that they had been signed by JBAX.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="91">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Shortly after the break-up of the Soviet Union, its foreign commercial and sovereign debt went into default as the issuer of record (i.e. the Soviet Union) had ceased to exist.  There were prolonged negotiations between the Russian government and a committee of the commercial creditors of former Soviet entities (called the London Club) aimed at the restructuring of these obligations, during which the Russian government agreed to accept all Soviet liabilities, in return for ownership of all Soviet assets.  During the course of these negotiations, several types of defaulted debt were actively traded, including defaulted obligations of Vneshekonombank (“Vnesh”), the Soviet Union’s state-owned foreign payments agent.  Agreement on the restructuring of the Vnesh bank debt was reached in 1996, which led to the defaulted loans being converted into “Prins” and “Interest Arrears Notes” or “IANs”, which were issued in December 1997.  As the names suggest, Prins were restructured principal obligations and IANs were restructured interest obligations.  From about June 1996, Prins and IANs had been traded on a when/if (“w/i”) basis side-by-side with the original Vnesh bank loans.  These w/i obligations appear to have been traded quite heavily in the market, especially in the months approaching December 1997.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were a number of differences between Prins and IANs.  Prins were loans maturing in 2020.  They had a settlement period of 10 days and paid interest partly in cash and partly in IANs.  Accrued interest was included in their price until it was paid, at which point Prins traded at an ex-dividend price.  IANs were bonds maturing in 2015.  They were cleared by the Euroclear system and settled in three days.  </p>

The evidence showed that Springwell’s strategy was to average down:  to acquire Prins at ever-cheaper prices in the anticipation that there would be a substantial market rally, which would allow it to sell its Prins at a considerable profit.  </p>

However, AP was reluctant to sell, and did not do so because prices had not appreciated to the levels at which he wanted to sell.  Instead, Springwell continued to buy Prins into late July and August 1998 as prices fell very low, such that its last two purchases of Prins in August 1998 were at 29¾ and 29 respectively.  By 17 August 1998, Springwell held Prins and IANs with a total purchase cost of $ 87,050,000.  </p>

These bonds have been fully serviced since their issue.</p>

I accept JA’s evidence that this was a major development in emerging markets business.  Its first sovereign Eurobond, issued in November 1996, was for $ 1 billion, with a yield of 9.25% and a maturity date of November 2001 (“Russia 9.25% 2001”).  Its yield was only slightly higher than similar types of Brazilian sovereign Eurobonds trading at 8.92% or Mexican bonds trading at 8.710% on the same day.  While the market value of these bonds fell dramatically in the aftermath of the Russian crisis of 17 August 1998 by almost 75 %, they never defaulted and were paid in full at maturity in 2001.  Half a dozen or so other sovereign Russian Eurobonds were subsequently also issued, either as part of restructurings or to raise further capital.  Likewise, although prices of these bonds also fell in the aftermath of the Russian default, they recovered steadily thereafter and none of them defaulted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell’s October 1997 Indonesian investments were made against the backdrop of what has become known as the Asian crisis, which primarily affected domestic currencies and financial markets, initially in Thailand and subsequently in other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.  On 2 July 1997, Thailand allowed the baht to fall, provoking a burst of selling in the currency markets which spread quickly to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.  AP was aware of this, and the resulting volatility in Asian markets, as he accepted in cross-examination.  He discussed it with JA on 16 July 1997, when he agreed with JA that he knew what had happened with the Asian currencies, saying “it<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>started with Thailand and then it went to Indonesia”.  He went on to ask JA if he sensed any “trouble ahead”, saying that “we want a little bit of trouble” because Springwell had liquidity of $ 200 million.  I accept that, right from the start of the Asian crisis, AP was anticipating market trouble which would provide him with an opportunity to spend Springwell’s considerable liquidity at low prices.  AP was evasive about this when asked about it in cross-examination, but he appeared to accept that he had a strategy with JA to “look at opportunities”, observing that “I always wanted to buy something at – when the prices are low”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In about September 1997, a year after the merger between Chase and Chemical Bank, the emerging markets leverage programme was changed from a Margin Forward Programme to a repurchase (“repo”) programme under the terms of which CMB agreed to provide, by means of purchase and repurchase contracts between it and the customer, the financing arrangements for the securities which the customer was purchasing from CMIL.  Thus if, for example, Springwell wanted to make leveraged purchases, it would agree to purchase the relevant security from CMIL and, pursuant to the GMRA, then immediately sell it to CMB under a repo contract pursuant to which Springwell was obliged to buy it back from CMB at a future date.  The underlying purchase of the bond from CMIL (or other Chase entity) was a separate transaction from the repo contract, albeit related in the sense that the agreement to purchase the underlying security might specifically (as with the GKO-Linked Notes) refer to the repo arrangements.  This made it necessary for all clients to sign a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (“GMRA”).  The transition to the GMRA standard form applied to all clients and occurred in October 1997.  All new leveraged transactions after 3 October 1997 were carried out under GMRAs rather than under the previous Margin Forward Programme.  As part of the transition, all outstanding transactions which were previously leveraged under the MFAs were rebooked as transactions under the GMRAs.  The GMRA was a standard form market document issued by the Public Securities Association in New York, although subject to English law and jurisdiction.  The GMRA between Springwell and CMB was signed, in the circumstances set out below, by JBAX on behalf Springwell and by FS on behalf of CMB and was dated 22 September 1997.</p>

The evidence, which was not really in dispute on this point, was that JA said that the GMRA was an industry standard document, that Chase was moving from the MFA Programme to the Repo Programme and that there was no substantive difference for Springwell in the commercial effect of the new arrangements, save that the GMRA would ultimately be better for Springwell because of the possibility of cheaper financing.  It was common ground that the GMRA Relevant Provisions were not pointed out to AP or explained to him, either in the course of these conversations or subsequently.</p>

Neither AP nor FS had any recollection of any such discussion, although FS maintained in cross-examination that he would have said that the Letter was a re-issue of a letter previously signed and the need for it arose because of the Chemical merger.  Certainly nothing was said to AP about the presence or effect of the Relevant Provisions.  AP did not see a copy of the 1997 DDCS Letter until the start of the US Proceedings.  As with the 1993 DDCS Letter, he maintained in his witness statement that, if he had had its provisions pointed out to him, he would not have signed the 1997 DDCS Letter.  For similar reasons as those set out above in relation to the earlier letter, I reject his evidence that he would not have signed the 1997 DDCS Letter, if he had appreciated that it contained charges over Springwell’s assets and the Relevant Provisions relating to advice, non–reliance, treatment as a Non-Private Customer and sophistication.  </p>

It was FS who actually took the GMRA and DDCS letter round to the Polembros offices in Piraeus that day, after office hours.  FS gave the GMRA and the DDCS letter to SP, who, as he accepted in evidence, had the opportunity of reading them, but did not do so.  AP had already told SP that the documents would be brought to the office by FS and that AP had given his approval for them to be signed, so FS did not think that SP was expecting an explanation.  Because SP was relying on the fact that AP had told him that the documentation FS was bringing round could be signed, SP assumed that “everything which needed to be discussed … had been discussed” between AP and FS, and, on that basis, accepted that he was not looking to FS for an explanation of the documents and did not criticise him for not giving one.  After about 20 minutes of pleasantries, during which FS explained that the documents were those which AP had forewarned SP that FS would bringing round, SP called JBAX into the room to sign the documents.  JBAX did so, without reading them, and left the room.  It was common ground that no explanation of the documents was given by FS to JBAX.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have set out the chronology in some detail, as it is the necessary context in which to consider Springwell’s case, as developed in argument and in evidence at trial.  The principal focus of its argument was that, whatever the position in the early years, by 1996, and through to 1998, as Springwell’s portfolio grew larger and larger, increasingly concentrated in Russia, and leveraged, (a) CMB, the Private Bank, whether acting by its own staff and/or (Springwell’s primary original case) through JA, and, or alternatively, (b) CIBL, and then CMIL, acting by JA, were, or came, under a free-standing duty of care, at the least to warn Springwell of the risks inherent in the Russian concentration in its portfolio, and to advise it to diversify its emerging markets portfolio, either by investing in different countries within the emerging markets sector, or by diversifying out of emerging markets into other sectors and assets.  Springwell also maintained its wider argument that the Private Bank and, or, alternatively, CIBL, and then CMIL, at all times remained under a duty to provide general investment advice in the wide terms pleaded in the RADC.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Logically I find it appropriate first to consider the actual conduct of, or role played by, JA over this period.  His conduct or role, as I state above, is one of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether Chase owed a duty of care to Springwell to provide investment advice.  Thus, any determination as to whether the Private Bank, or CIBL/CMIL, whether because of what JA was doing, or irrespective of what he was doing, assumed a responsibility generally, or specifically, to advise Springwell has to be seen in the context of what JA was doing in practice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Brindle’s submission was that Chase (through the activities of JA) held itself out as advising and willing to advise on an on-going basis both on particular investments and on the general composition of Springwell’s portfolio as a whole.  He submitted that it was not really necessary to distinguish between the roles of the different Chase corporate entities because AP simply looked to “Chase”.  He relied, in particular, on the evidence of discussions between JA and AP, as contained in transcripts of their, often very lengthy, telephone conversations during the period from May 1997, as well as on JA’s and AP’s own evidence.  He also relied on evidence from others within Chase, as well as the expert evidence, to support Springwell’s primary case, that Chase had an obligation to advise Springwell in the wide terms pleaded in the RADC or advanced in argument.  He contended that, because (as he submitted) Springwell could not be categorised as “an execution-only customer” for the purposes of Appendix 42 to the SFA Rules, the necessary corollary was that Chase had an advisory relationship with Springwell.  </p>

But, he submitted, none of that was inconsistent with JA’s role as salesman:  salesmen frequently express their views and make recommendations;  they do not thereby, and without more, assume advisory duties of care in respect of their opinions, let alone a more general positive duty to give advice.

They would have sales meetings every day, so that in the morning, when they walked in, they were updated about the ebbs and flows of the market, not just the fundamentals, but what sort of pricing dynamics were driving it, what new issues were coming in or out, so that we would have informed salespeople.  So that the value added was something that we were channelling as opposed to anyone independently coming up with their own ideas and we did not know what people were saying all around the world.  We really wanted to channel people's conversations in a way that we thought reflected the information that we were giving them.  Then of course they would digest that and come up with their own ideas about what would make sense for their particular client.

In order to be able to do so, the customer must know of the investment before approaching the firm.  This is evidently the case, for example, when a customer places an order for a specific equity.  However, in the case of a derivative, before being able to describe a transaction as execution-only, a firm must be able to demonstrate that the specific investment was chosen by the customer.  Where standardised products exist, such as exchange contracts, <span style="text-decoration:underline">or contracts which match those dealt in on an exchange</span>, the question to be addressed is whether or not the customer chose that product himself or had it suggested to him in response to a request to achieve a particular end.  On the other hand, in respect of an OTC derivative, it is unlikely that a firm will be able to effect or arrange a transaction without either it or another person having given advice to the customer.  Where a firm specifies the size of a contract which it is prepared to effect or arrange, this may not, of itself, prevent a transaction from being execution-only.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were a variety of personal opinions expressed by the Chase witnesses as to the meaning of the expression “execution-only”.  Some considered that the service of a salesman, making recommendations as JA did, amounted to an “execution-only service”.  Others regarded execution as the job done by the back office, with the result that JA was not an execution only salesman, as he did more than execution, but that did not mean that he was an advisor.  The variety of responses demonstrated that there was no consistent or universal view as to the appropriateness of those words as a description of a salesman’s conduct.  Thus, for example, although the Emerging Markets experts were agreed as to the role of a salesman, even they disagreed on the application of the phrase “execution-only”.  Mr. Ian McCall (Springwell’s Emerging Markets expert) thought that, if a salesman gave recommendations, the transaction could not be execution only.  On the other hand, Ms Alexandra McLeod-Wilson (Chase’s Emerging Markets expert) was of the view that such transactions were execution only.  The divergence of views may have reflected the “Potential problems” identified in the Notes, to which I have referred.</p>

Nor did I find the views of the various Chase witnesses, or the experts, as to whether JA’s role could or should be categorised as “execution-only”, either for the purposes of the SFA Rules, or more widely, of any real assistance to the issue which I have to decide, namely whether Chase owed a common law duty of care to advise in the terms pleaded or advanced in argument.  This is because I do not accept Mr. Brindle’s argument that, if Springwell could not be categorised as an execution-only customer (because it was receiving personal recommendations from JA), it necessarily followed that Chase and Springwell owed advisory duties, with all the incidents of a fully-fledged common law duty of care.  </p>

But whether, given the terms of the financing and MFA confirms which referred to individual transactions as “execution-only”, some or all of such transactions were nonetheless “execution-only” transactions within the sort of arrangements envisaged in Note 9, does not seem to me to be a useful issue to decide, since the only consequence would possibly be that some limited rule obligations applicable to non-private customers would have been avoided.  The issue for my determination is not whether any particular transaction did or did not fit within a certain description given in Appendix 42 to a set of rules.  The issue is whether there was a duty of care, given the terms of the confirmations, and the other contractual documentation.</p>

However I find that, at all times (save in relation to relatively few and unimportant instances, where, largely for practical reasons, a decision was taken by JA, e.g. to roll over a particular investment), AP retained control over the decision-making and all decisions as to whether to initiate trades were taken by him on Springwell’s behalf.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But this factual conclusion as to what the evidence showed that JA was doing, namely giving advice, in the sense that I have described, tells us nothing about what, if any, obligations were in fact owed by Chase, whether by CMB (i.e. the Private Bank) or by CIBL/CMIL, to Springwell arising out of the conduct of JA in relation to its emerging markets portfolio.  Still less does it inform us as to the extent of any such duties of care as were owed.  In order to decide whether the advice given gave rise to obligations that went beyond the normal recommendations or “advice”, given in the daily interactions between an institution’s sales force and a purchaser of its products, so as to import obligations of the type owed by a fully-fledged investment advisor, one needs to look at all aspects of the objective evidence of the relationship between the parties.  For this reason, I found the use of the term “advisory relationship” ambiguous;  one has to be clear whether the term simply refers to a situation where A gives advice to B in the context of a commercial relationship;  or whether the term necessarily connotes the existence of an obligation on the part of the provider of the advice to take reasonable care and/or to give advice about certain matters.  I have accordingly avoided expressing my conclusions by reference to the existence, or otherwise, of an “advisory relationship”.</p>

There was also not much dissension between the parties as to what was <span style="text-decoration:underline">actually</span> being done, or not being done, by the Private Bank during the period.  The real issue between the parties was whether, as Chase contends, the Private Bank, during the relevant period, was simply engaging in the marketing of various products (funds and investments) to Springwell, trying at the same time also to ensure that its products matched the client’s needs, but without ever undertaking a general  advisory responsibility or obligation, or whether, as Springwell contends, the Private Bank (whether through JA or its own officers) was indeed advising, albeit (as Springwell contends) wholly inadequately, and had accepted an obligation to advise as to what securities Springwell’s portfolio should be invested in;  as to the diversification of Springwell’s portfolio as a whole;  and, in particular, as to the diversification of the emerging markets portfolio.</p>

During the 1990s, various efforts were made by the Private Bank (wholly independent of JA’s activities) to market other products to Springwell, mainly managed funds (i.e. funds managed on a discretionary basis by the Private Bank or one of its affiliates).  In his oral evidence, AP said that he appreciated that this was marketing, and he accepted that, after EM left, he knew that no-one at the Private Bank (in particular, neither MF, FS or SG) was either discharging the role of supervising JA’s activities or of advising Springwell.  His case, as developed in his oral evidence, was that after EM’s departure from the Private Bank, JA effectively “was left by himself”, and was playing the most important role, including that of relationship manager and private banker, and “running almost everything”.  This, however, was difficult to reconcile with any separate advisory role being discharged through the Private Bank’s own personnel.  But Springwell’s case, particularly as advanced by Mr. Brindle in argument, was to the effect that the Private Bank’s officers saw themselves as owing a duty to advise Springwell in relation to its investments, including as to asset allocation and diversification, but wrongfully failed to discharge that duty.  The tension between AP’s evidence and the way in which the arguments as to the role of the Private Bank were presented, and the manner in which they varied over time, reflected a weakness in Springwell’s case.</p>

They show that Springwell had experienced major volatility, event risk and corporate default by the end of 1995, nearly three years prior to the events of the Russian default.  He also later had experience of the Indonesian crisis and the fall out from the Asian crisis.  Despite this, AP built up Springwell’s portfolio of emerging markets assets through leveraged purchases and purchases of distressed emerging markets debt.  This pattern continued through to August 1998, and indeed beyond the date of the Russian default.</p>

The bond was held in the name of CIBL, with Chase Manhattan Trustees Ltd (“CMTL”) as trustee.  The evidence showed that Chase’s Hellenic Group customers invested heavily in this bond.  Springwell was one of the Hellenic Group who invested in Synkro, purchasing a $5 million face value holding on 6 April 1993 at a price of 95%.  In early October 1995, Synkro advised bondholders that it would not be able to redeem the bond, though it appears to have remained current on coupon payments up until this date.  A number of Hellenic Group bondholders were unhappy about the prospect of losing their money on this bond and lobbied to obtain reimbursement from Chase.  The essence of their complaint was that CMTL should have given bondholders more information prior to the bond’s default, particularly as to certain collateral waivers related to a US acquisition by Synkro.  RC recalls, however, that AP was “… not first in the queue” when it came to lobbying Chase for compensation and was much calmer in his discussions than many other Hellenics.</p>

By late January 1997, Synkro had made a restructuring proposal to bondholders.  Under this proposal, new notes would be exchanged for defaulted notes at 50 cents in the dollar;  the new notes paid 12% interest semi-annually.  This still represented a substantial loss to investors, which the Hellenic clients pressed Chase to make good.  On 16 January 1997, SG discussed Synkro’s restructuring proposal in a meeting with a representative of the Hellenic bondholders, who were claiming to be extremely dissatisfied with the proposed settlement.  SG proposed to his superiors a goodwill gesture to Hellenic clients that would result in a total 70-75 cents in the dollar recovery for the Hellenic clients, which would cost Chase $4 million in total.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In April 1997, it was agreed within Chase that a special zero coupon note, the “G-Note” would be offered to all customers who had bought the Synkro bond.  The net effect of the Note was that a subscriber could purchase $100,000 of the G-Note, which was due to mature in three years, at a cost of $63,000, thereby enabling the subscriber to recoup an additional part of its losses on top of any returns on the restructured Synkro bond.  </p>

Five days later, AP discussed the offer with JA, who said the net effect of the G-Note proposal, taken together with the restructured Synkro bond, would be that clients would get back the equivalent of 70 cents in the dollar on their original Synkro investment.  AP also discussed the G-Note with FS on 10 September 1997.  The evidence showed that AP was satisfied with Chase’s resolution of the issue.</p>

Moreover, Chase made customers aware that the G-Note offer was nothing more than a goodwill gesture, as the correspondence between Chase and Springwell showed.

He moved to the Private Bank in March 1996 to become head of the Hellenic Group within the Private Bank.  He was based in New York but would make trips to London and Greece as the business required.  On taking up his new position he found that the Private Bank's capabilities had grown considerably since he had left CMB in 1986 when CMB's international customers did not use the Private Bank to invest their money to any great extent.  By the time he returned, however, the Private Bank had a much larger customer base, and offered a wide range of investment options, both directly and indirectly (through products developed in other areas of the Bank).  He explained that he discovered that customers of the Hellenic Group had been active investors in emerging markets products for a number of years by the time he joined in March 1996, and it did not surprise him that emerging market investments were a very popular product for the Hellenic Group of customers.  He explained that he was responsible for those Hellenic Group customers who dealt with CMB in New York and Switzerland, as well as those in London.  His role did not involve day to-day contact with the customers, as that was the job of the relationship managers.  He did, however, have ultimate responsibility for:  (a)<span style="font-size:8.5pt"> </span>customer satisfaction;  (b) any Private Bank credit exposure and (c) the profitability of the Group.  He explained that, if, additionally, the Private Bank was the department within Chase that had the greatest credit exposure to a customer, then it was also responsible for the one-obligor management for that customer:  whichever department had the greatest exposure was given this role, which entailed obtaining a credit allocation for all that customer's facilities, in all the different areas of the Bank, and ensuring that it knew the customer's total exposure, and that this was accurately reported.  </p>

He described how AP’s conversations with him were overwhelmingly focused on his investments, far more than on the shipping business, and that AP told him on many occasions that he made far more money from his emerging markets investing than from the shipping business.  SG was aware from these conversations that AP dedicated a great deal of his time to managing Springwell's investment portfolio, and contrary to the allegation in paragraph 35(b) of the RADC, formed the clear impression that AP had a keen interest in investment and the management of Springwell’s portfolio.  From his conversations with AP, he regarded AP as an experienced and sophisticated investor, with a great deal of knowledge about the bond markets, and the instruments that Springwell was investing in.  He explained how AP would express his views on the markets, bonds, prices and investment opportunities, and that he never appeared out of his depth, or lacking in knowledge and understanding of these topics.  He also had several conversations with SP in relation to the Synkro issue, which gave him the impression that SP was well-informed about both the Synkro situation, and Springwell’s investments generally.  He never doubted that both AP and SP were sufficiently sophisticated to understand, and purchase, emerging markets paper, and to understand the risks associated with such activity.  This view had been reinforced by his experience with dealings with the Polemis brothers in relation to the Grupo Synkro issue.</p>

The evidence showed that SG tended to stress the need for diversification to all of his customers, including Springwell;  that when he arrived at the Private Bank in 1995, Springwell had an IMA account invested in assets other than emerging market assets, but AP was unhappy with the returns from that investment;  that AP regarded taking money that could be invested in emerging markets, and investing it in other, lower returning assets, as costing him money, rather than protecting him;  that in discussions with AP, SG would usually tell him that the various funds and products Chase offered represented sound diversification options, and that diversification, so as to avoid concentration of risk, made good sense;  but although AP would normally express polite interest in the funds put to him in discussions with SG and FS, and would usually be positive, and give the impression that he was open to suggestions and interested in what SG had to say, he was usually non-committal and SG sometimes got the impression that he was giving AP a message which AP did not want to hear.

AP’s response, however, to SG’s diversification suggestions was to say that he did not make enough money in investing in anything other than emerging markets assets.  The evidence showed that AP was deeply resistant to any measure of diversification which detracted from his trading in emerging markets.  Faced with such an intractable client, SG’s evidence was that he took a practical course:  to start slowly and attempt to make AP comfortable with the concept of diversification, to open the door to the idea, and then to take it from there.  He hoped that, once AP saw the track record in the alternative investments, he would be amenable to further investments.  </p>

There are two elements to introduce diversification:  one is to get the client to even think about it;  and then, secondly, to introduce it.  Now it is highly unlikely and unrealistic to go to a client and discuss diversification among asset classes and then perhaps suggest some alternatives and then assume that the client is going to leap – you know, not only go to the water and drink, but jump in.  It is highly doubtful.  You introduce the client in a, if you will, conservative fashion.”</p>

Instead, SG took the view that AP should be using his realisable cash, whether from shipping or from the maturity of instruments in the portfolio, to make such investments.  (It was common ground that the portfolio did throw off a lot of cash, particularly with the maturity of short dated instruments such as GKO-Linked Notes.)  Despite SG’s best efforts, AP preferred to invest most of his available cash in further emerging markets instruments.</p>

Nor did the Private Bank ever advise that there was a need for immediate and substantial diversification <span style="text-decoration:underline">out of</span> the emerging market asset class on the express grounds that the undiversified portfolio Springwell had in emerging markets was very high risk, highly concentrated in Russia and (as Springwell contended) dangerously exposed to loss.  Mr. Brindle submitted that those facts were not merely relevant to the issue of breach of duty, but were also relevant to the issue of the existence of any duty of care.  He submitted, in effect, that the starkness of the situation with which the Private Bank was faced, namely a client with an increasingly large exposure in emerging market debt securities, concentrated in Russia, and the knowledge that AP was relying on the recommendations of JA, imposed an obligation on the Private Bank to give urgent and clear diversification advice.</p>

Thus on 16 April 1997, at a meeting between SG, FS, Hank Gooss (who was head of the Investment Management Group in New York) and AP, Hank Gooss was introduced to AP to discuss the possibility of Springwell re-investing in an IMA.  This was in addition to the $5 million investment in the MSF which had already been mooted.  Despite apparently agreeing to the idea at the meeting, AP later decided not to pursue the IMA.  An internal memo in about June/July 1997 recorded that Chase was continuing to suggest that further diversification should be considered and that the current proposal put to AP at that time was an equity based IMA which AP had agreed he should strongly consider.  A note of a conversation on 16 July 1997 between JA, FS and SG recorded that SG was meeting AP for dinner that evening and was going to try to “collar” AP into a European equity IMA and further how AP was always difficult to pin down, despite the fact he appeared enthusiastic about diversification ideas initially.</p>

Indeed, this was a point used by AP at the time to justify his refusal to diversify.  SG made clear that he himself did not have such a number in mind at the time.  His focus was not on an ultimate optimum portfolio balance;  it was on trying to introduce the concepts to AP and to give him the experience of and comfort with alternative investments to be able to develop a more diversified portfolio.</p>

Finally, after some prevarication by AP, the IMA for the $13 million investment in the MSF was signed on behalf of Springwell on 15 May 1998.

The reasons for my primary conclusion, that no duty of care existed, can best be summarised by reference to what I regard as the relevant, or arguably relevant, factors pointing to or against the existence of such a duty, and by reference to my conclusions on the arguments raised by the parties in relation to such factors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">By the 1990s, AP had shifted his focus to the emerging markets, a more specialist asset class.  Obviously, when Springwell purchased its first emerging markets asset, AP had had no prior experience of such a purchase.  However, it was a development from what he had already been doing with Chase.  Further, investment by investors (other than banking and other large financial institutions), in emerging markets was in its infancy at the time and, indeed, the Polemises had, through their shipping business, as much, if not more, experience than most others in the emerging markets, in particular in Brazil.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, and whatever the position was as regards AP’s early emerging markets purchases, he rapidly acquired vast experience in that asset class.  Springwell’s portfolio grew with the explosion of the emerging markets business in the early 1990s and AP was at the forefront of emerging markets debt investments.  Throughout this period, he acquired personal and direct experience of the volatility of the markets, for example through the Tequila crisis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Certainly, by the mid-1990s if not long before, AP was a hugely experienced and sophisticated emerging markets investor.  He had by that stage a very lengthy track record, involving the purchase of large amounts of debt over several years.

Thus, although Springwell may not have maintained computer records of its investments, nor have had computer programmes to monitor and analyse its investments, nor have had access to Bloomberg or other sources of pricing information, nor have had an in-house specialists to assist AP, the reality was that AP and SP paid scrupulous attention to Springwell’s investments.  Thus AP kept a detailed daybook, in which he maintained detailed records on the day of purchase, of the individual investments purchased, including yields and maturity dates;  likewise SP kept meticulous investment ledgers, based on the confirms sent out by Chase, recording in detail (albeit sometimes well after the trade dates) records of prices, and other relevant terms and aspects of the investments.  He also calculated and recorded yields and returns.  The Polemises were clearly highly numerate, so I do not regard it is significant that these records were maintained in manuscript form rather than on a computer.  Moreover, they received and scrutinised the confirmations sent out by Chase and often raised queries and identified errors in those documents, no matter how minor the error.</p>

The transcripts show that, although AP may have had no appetite to trawl through the research material in any great detail, he certainly read some of it, if only superficially, from time to time, and was always keenly aware about the commercial terms (price, yields, maturity dates etc.) of the investments JA had on offer.  He was definitely not an innocent abroad.</p>

Thus, the Polemises were content to sign similar contractual documentation, and to make similar representations, to those which they signed with or made to Chase.  For example, Springwell signed and accepted non-private customer letters with ML, prior to the signing of the 1997 DDCS Letter with Chase.  Springwell also signed and agreed to a GMRA with ML prior to signing the same form of document with Chase.  After the Russian default, Springwell and/or other Polemis Group companies signed documentation with SBL and with the Argo Fund confirming their sophistication and experience in emerging markets and their awareness of the risks.  Likewise those other banks and institutions, on material similar to that which was available to Chase, characterised AP, Springwell and other Polemis Group companies as expert investors.</p>

But, in context, it is a strong pointer against the existence of any such duty.  Although it was common ground that at the relevant time there was no regulatory obligation upon Chase to record the terms of any investment advisory agreement, or advisory obligation, in writing (at least in relation to a client such as Springwell), the absence of any written agreement recording such a relationship, between substantial commercial parties, where the investment activity involved complicated transactions, involving huge amounts of money over many years, is surprising (to say the least), if indeed such a relationship existed.  The narrative shows that it was Chase’s habitual, albeit not invariable, practice to record the terms of its contractual relationships in written documents;  the IMAs were examples.  If Chase had assumed such a responsibility, one might have expected that not only would it have defined the scope of its duties in a written document, but also put in place an appropriate, agreed fee structure for the investment management/ advisory services it was providing.  One also would have expected such advice to have been provided to Springwell by an investment advisor, rather than a salesman, but Springwell argued that that point went to the question of breach, rather than the existence of a duty of care.  </p>

He relied upon the evidence of Chase’s private banking expert, Mr. Saunders, in this respect, who said that:</p>

Mr. Dicker expressed the view that a client of a private bank could become an “advisory client” by “default” and did not accept Mr. Saunders' view that the absence of a signed advisory agreement strongly suggested that no advisory relationship was intended.  But Mr. Dicker’s view was clearly based on his experience that a client would in fact sign a written contract including an obligation on the part of the bank to provide advisory services, as part of the initial account opening procedures.  Indeed, when, in cross-examination, the Springwell opening account documentation was put to him, and he was asked, as a market professional, whether, if there had been an advisory relationship at that date, he would have expected to see a very great deal more by way of documentation of it, he replied that he certainly would have expected a lot more than what he had been shown.  </p>

Indeed Mr. Brindle in his closing submissions, when dealing with a question from the Court about the absence of a written advisory agreement, realistically accepted that the absence of an agreement in 1995-1996 would be surprising “as by that time parties were sufficiently used to the concepts that had been introduced [in the regulatory rules]”, but submitted that as the picture had to be looked at at the start of the relationship in 1987, the position was different and its absence was not surprising.  However I have already held that no advisory obligations were assumed by Chase at the time of Springwell’s introduction to JA;  it is the absence of any agreement throughout the period of the relationship that I consider indicative.  </p>

There was never any discussion between Chase and Springwell as to whether any of the former’s alleged advisory obligations were limited to advising as to the suitability or otherwise of ECP or emerging market investments, or whether CMB/CIBL/CMIL’s advisory obligations extended to advising Springwell generally about asset allocation within a global portfolio.

Thus, when, for example, the alleged advisory agreement is supposed to have terminated in January 1999, no mention was made by AP of this fact, nor was there any recognition of the fact in correspondence between the parties.  Likewise, when Springwell was facing substantial mark to market losses in August/September 1998 in the aftermath of the Russian default, no complaint was made by AP or SP at that time that breaches of Chase investment advisory obligations were the cause of Springwell losses.  Such matters are not, of course, in any way decisive, but the fact that no articulation of the existence of the alleged advisory agreement or obligation was made, until such a very late stage, may justifiably be regarded as counter-indicative of its existence over the previous many years.</p>

He also went to great lengths to source and present investment opportunities to Springwell.  He provided AP with information about the market, prices and the securities which were available.  Although, no doubt, as JA’s business relationship with AP became more established and the portfolio grew in size, their dealings became more frequent, the nature of the relationship did not, in my view, change over time, contrary to the argument propounded in evidence for the first time by AP as part of Springwell’s case that JA’s role changed from being initially that of a pure salesman to subsequently that of an investment advisor.  It may well be that AP came over time increasingly to value JA’s advice, as AP saw the substantial profits that Springwell was making in its emerging markets investment portfolio.  Likewise, as the size of the portfolio increased, no doubt it became necessary for AP to talk to JA more frequently.  </p>

But AP himself (like many other substantial investors at the time in emerging markets) was a great enthusiast for Russia, as became particularly evident in July and August 1998, not merely, or predominantly, because of the often bullish views he had received from JA, but rather  because of the substantial returns the Russian market appeared to provide to Springwell.  It was AP’s desire for profit, I conclude, which drove the percentage of Russian investments in Springwell’s portfolio to about 50% by August 1998.  </p>

For example, he relied on JA to provide accurate prices when he asked;  he relied on JA to inform him as to the availability of particular bonds or particular issues;  he relied on JA to effect his instructions to buy or sell instruments.  He also clearly valued JA’s views and opinions, and the process of talking things through with JA.  He frequently asked for JA’s views.  He also frequently (though certainly not invariably), made decisions which were in line with JA’s views and recommendations.  However, he also ignored JA’s views on many occasions and made decisions which went against JA’s views.  </p>

I reject the suggestion (made by AP in evidence, although not in the RADC) that he simply rubber-stamped JA’s suggestions.  AP is and was clearly a man who made his own decisions.  The evidence demonstrated that he had a dominating and manipulative personality, and was a shrewd and sophisticated operator, who, even if he did not have an enthusiasm for, or an in-depth understanding of, the fine detail of certain aspects of some the products under discussion, showed himself to have a keen appreciation of their commercial terms and potential, whether for loss or for profit.  He may not have bothered to have familiarised himself with some of the more abstruse points relating to the Russian economic and political situation, but he was well aware of the risks (and potential returns) that a market such as Russia might afford.  He was also clearly well aware of the cost and impact of leveraging Springwell’s portfolio, under Chase’s financing programmes, and the difference between the terms on offer at Chase, and at rival institutions such as ML.  </p>

Reliance on its own, even if established, does not necessarily give rise to an advisory relationship, with consequential duties of care.  Nor does the fact that JA was, no doubt, extremely keen to make profits for Chase and that this may have been influencing his enthusiasm to recommend Russian products, predicate that a duty of care arises.

AP was aware that JA operated separately from the Private Bank.  I cannot accept the suggestion that AP ever understood JA to be Springwell’s investment advisor.  There was never any reference to JA as such by AP, and certainly the transcripts of the telephone conversations do not suggest that AP viewed JA in that capacity.  The reality was that they would communicate with each other when Springwell needed to buy or sell something, or when investments were maturing and needed re-investment, or when JA wanted to sell something to Springwell.  It was in that context that JA would advise AP.  The absence of the indicia of any advisory relationship as referred to above also supports my view.</p>

My conclusion is simply that, in the circumstances of this case, the fact that JA, in his capacity as a salesman, may have been giving advice or expressing his views as to particular strategy or diversification within Springwell’s emerging markets portfolio, or even making general comments as to the desirability of diversification of the portfolio outside that asset class (as exemplified in some of the passages quoted above), upon which Springwell relied in reaching its decisions, does not amount to an assumption of responsibility on the part of CIBL or CMIL, so as to bring into play the full range of obligations of an investment advisor, as contended for by Springwell.  The function of a salesman giving advice, recommendations and information, and, in that sense, in providing a value-added service to clients, who will then make their own decisions as to whether and what to buy or sell, is entirely consistent with the role not only of an emerging markets bond salesman in the financial world, but, indeed, with that of any salesman in ordinary life.

Thus Springwell’s case was that AP was an unsophisticated and conservative investor, who was not, himself, in a position to evaluate the appropriateness of any investment, but who relied entirely on JA, without himself subjecting anything to critical scrutiny, to advise him what was appropriate;  and further that JA, and others at Chase, were fully aware of this dependence.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="100">

I have also already expressed my conclusions above as to the sophistication of Springwell, as an investor.  In my judgment, none of the alleged, or established, personal attributes of Springwell, or AP, as an investor, or the fact that Chase were making substantial profits out of Springwell’s dealings with CMB and the Investment Bank would begin to justify a displacement of the capacity in which JA acted, so as to give rise to the alleged extensive duties of care, or, indeed, any more limited duty.</p>

It is, perhaps, realistic to acknowledge that my conclusion on this point is probably coloured by the terms of the Relevant Provisions in the contractual documentation.  But, attempting to look at the point in isolation from the effect of the contractual documentation, I conclude, nonetheless, that the fact that JA was giving advice in his capacity as a salesman did not give rise to the extensive duties of care, on the part of CIBL and CMIL, alleged by Springwell.  On any basis, the capacity in which he was acting is, in my judgment a strong pointer against the assumption of any responsibility, or legal obligation, to give general investment advice.</p>

I do not consider that, as a matter of law, CMB had legal responsibility for the conduct of JA, as an employee of CIBL or CMIL, who, as AP well knew, worked in the Investment Bank and separately from the Private Bank.  However, even approaching the question on the wider hypothesis that CMB did have legal liability for the conduct of JA (on the basis that he should be regarded as part of the so-called Chase “Hellenic Team”, or, as Mr. Brindle submitted, that the Private Bank and the Investment Bank should be regarded as operating as a joint enterprise in the provision of JA’s services), for the reasons expressed above in relation to CIBL and CMIL, I conclude that no general investment advisory obligation was imposed on CMB, simply by reason of the fact that JA was making recommendations and giving advice throughout the relevant period in his capacity as a salesman.  </p>

In my judgment, no free-standing obligation to advise (in the sense of an obligation that was separate from the activities of JA), whether in contract, or based on a common law duty of care arose by virtue of CMB’s role as a Private Bank, its actual conduct over the relevant period, or the circumstances with which it was faced, namely a client with an increasingly large exposure in emerging market debt securities, concentrated in  Russia, who was engaged in an extensive trading relationship with the Investment Bank.  I come to that conclusion both in relation to Springwell’s broad case that CMB had a duty to give general investment advice in the wide terms pleaded or to provide “wealth management” services, and also in relation to its case of more limited scope, namely that, in the circumstances with which it was faced in 1996-1998, it had a duty to give advice about the pressing need for diversification, whether within the emerging markets class, or more generally, across a wider asset class.</p>

I have also already rejected Springwell’s case that the Shipping Department assumed any common law responsibility, or obligation, to advise Springwell, either arising out of the circumstances of JA’s introduction to AP, or because of what occurred during the period until 1990, when Springwell’s account was with the Shipping Department.  I now have to consider the alternative way, or ways in which Springwell put, or developed, its case, namely that CMB assumed a responsibility to advise Springwell, because of what occurred during the period 1990 to 1998, and, in particular, in response to the change over time in the composition and size of Springwell’s emerging markets portfolio, the fact that it became increasingly highly leveraged, and the ever-increasing concentration in Russian securities.</p>

Thus, for example, there was no clear identification of precisely what duties were owed at any particular time, or the specific date upon which it was alleged that CMB had assumed legal obligations to Springwell.  The latter point was particularly important given that the shape of the portfolio had evolved over a number of years, with the first Russian investment having been made in 1996.  This lack of clarity reflected the fact that Springwell’s primary case has always been that the advisory relationship was provided by Chase (without regard to precisely which corporate entity, whether the Investment Bank (CIBL or CMIL) or the Private Bank and the Investment Bank acting in combination) acting through JA.</p>

It is surprising, to say the least, if AP genuinely considered that Springwell was entitled to the benefit of an investment advisory service from the Private Bank, that he made no complaint to MF or FS about the absence of any such service, since AP was more than able to articulate any dissatisfaction with the services that were provided by  Chase.  Indeed, in September 1994, at the time when MF took over from EM, AP was vociferously expressing his dissatisfaction with the one advisory service that Chase was in fact providing, namely the discretionary IMA.</p>

I disagree.  Had MF thought for a moment that the Private Bank had an existing and general advisory obligation to advise Springwell on diversification and asset allocation, I have little doubt that he would have taken steps to have put such a service in place, with the utilisation of appropriate modelling tools for portfolio management, such as benchmarks, risk profiles and asset allocation principles.</p>

As I have already mentioned, Mr. Brindle strongly relied on the proposals for diversification which SG made to AP after he took over as head of the Hellenic Group in 1996, which I have summarised in the earlier narrative section of this judgment, as demonstrating the recognition on the part of the Private Bank of an obligation to give general investment advice as to diversification and other matters.  It was common ground, both on the pleadings, and on the evidence, that the Private Bank’s diversification proposals were made by way of a marketing presentation, soliciting investments in specific products, but were not put forward by SG as part of a strategy of diversification or in order to bring about a restructuring of Springwell’s portfolio.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="101">

The evidence clearly showed that, in the case of Springwell, as with many other Hellenic Group clients, there was a triangular relationship structure between the Shipping Department, the Private Bank and IFI, which had been operating for several years in order to meet the needs of the Group.  Thus, as described by SG and others, the Private Bank managed both the one-obligor credit approval (if the Private Bank had the largest credit exposure), and the Private Bank's own credit exposure, through its credit process.  It also managed the client relationship, and would introduce product specialists as needed.  IFI, through JA (or another such product specialist) had primary responsibility for fulfilling the customers’ requests for emerging markets paper, and the Shipping Department met their ship financing requirements.  All three departments worked together.  The diversification proposals made to Springwell in my judgment reflect that relationship operating in practice.</p>

The reality was that Springwell had, of its own volition, with AP’s increasing appetite for the substantial returns that investing in emerging markets afforded, adopted a strategy of concentration in emerging markets, and, in particular, in Russian debt instruments.  AP was, throughout, pointedly dismissive of the diversification proposals of the Private Bank personnel.  In my judgment, in those circumstances he cannot lay the responsibility, at the Private Bank’s door, for his own decisions to continue to invest so substantially in risky markets, by asserting that the Private Bank had some free-standing, over-arching duty of care to speak out and advise him urgently to diversify a substantial amount of the Springwell portfolio.</p>

Thus they agreed that the fact that a particular private bank might offer particular services did not mean either that every other private bank must do so, or that every client is automatically a recipient of such services.  As Mr. Saunders explained, what is  now seen as the “full range of services” was in fact offered by only a handful of private banks in the early 1990s.  He made the point that the principal distinction was between a discretionary and a non-discretionary client.  If a client wanted to maintain control over his assets (and therefore was a non-discretionary client), he could either be an “advisory” client, who received and paid for advice from the bank in relation to his investments, or a “non-advisory” client who did not.</p>

Mr. Saunders was in no doubt that there would be no private bank advisory content within such a structure, and that the role of the private bank would be, and was in his experience, solely that of custodian and banker.  His evidence was that a private bank could never properly assume an advisory responsibility when it had no control over, or even knowledge of the particular trading between the client and the product specialist.  Mr. Dicker did not have any experience of such a relationship in his bank, and took the view that such a relationship would give rise to general advisory obligations, but accepted that the difference in views of the experts on this aspect of this case was one which merely reflected their respective and different practices and experience.  </p>

If so classified, he would be sent a non-private customer notification.  The significance of such a notification, as Mr. Saunders understood it, was that it confirmed that the bank had no liability for advice as to suitability or any obligation to provide information, even if the relationship was otherwise an advisory one.  His evidence confirmed that, in sending the DDCS letters to Springwell, Chase acted consistently with market practice as perceived and understood by Mr. Saunders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have, in coming to my conclusion that no free-standing duty of care was owed by the Private Bank, taken into consideration the handful of internal Chase documents dated in 1994 and 1995 that referred to Chase or the Private Bank as “trusted financial advisor” and upon which so much time was spent in cross-examination.  These documents did not pass between Chase and Springwell, nor did they reflect the terms of anything that was said at a meeting between Chase and Springwell, or of anything that otherwise passed between the parties.  Nor, when viewed in their context, do they, in my judgment, reflect a recognition or acceptance by the Private Bank that it indeed owed investment advisory obligations to Springwell.  (Still less could they be relied upon as a recognition of any investment advisory duty on the part of the Investment Bank, since the documents were not generated by JA or within the Investment Bank.) I agree with Mr. Hapgood’s submission that the evidence showed that the term was used within the Private Bank for no real purpose other than as an internal marketing slogan for a short period of time.  I do not consider that their mere existence can change the analysis of the Private Bank’s relationship with Springwell, particularly when one takes into account, on the other side of the scale so far as internal documents are concerned, other internal Private Bank documents such as, for example, Chase’s “Private Bank Credit Guide”, “The Product Summary” in respect of LDC debt sales to customers of the London Private Bank, the EIQ, and the audit report on the Private Bank of May 1995.  The first three of these emphasize that the eligibility requirements for trading in emerging markets debt instruments include the requirement that the client is not looking to Chase for investment advice, and an acknowledgement in the contractual documentation that such was the case.  As I have already said, if that acknowledgement had not been given, I have no doubt that Springwell would not have been afforded access, or been allowed to have continued access, to the Investment Bank’s emerging markets sales desk or to the various financing programmes.  The audit report in relation to the Private Bank of May 1995 was a very detailed document which contained an extensive review of LDC sales activity to Private Bank customers.  There is not a single mention at any point in the document of investment advice or the performance of any such role on Chase’s part.</p>

The existence of an underlying contract (e.g..  as between solicitor and client) does not automatically exclude the general duty of care which the law imposes on those who voluntarily assume to act for others.  But the nature and terms of the contractual relationship between the parties will be determinative of the scope of the responsibility assumed and can, in some cases, exclude any assumption of legal responsibility to the plaintiff for whom the defendant has assumed to act.  </p>

Thus I accept the submissions made on behalf of Chase that the contractual documentation, whether taken at a straightforward contractual level, or looked at more widely, as an indication as to whether any common law duties of care arose, showed that the parties specifically contracted upon the basis of a trading and banking relationship which negated any possibility of a general or specific advisory duty coming into existence.  </p>

Thus I accept that the contractual documentation presented a consistent, and commercially coherent picture;  namely that Springwell’s trading through the Investment Bank, whether in emerging markets instruments or otherwise, was not intended to give rise to, or impose upon the Private Bank or the Investment Bank, investment advisory obligations or responsibilities, either in relation to the particular securities purchased or sold, or more generally, in relation to Springwell’s financial position in the light of its emerging markets portfolio;  in other words, that the relationship between Springwell and the Private Bank, and between Springwell and the Investment Bank, was one where neither the Private Bank nor the Investment Bank had an obligation to give any investment advice, and, moreover, was one where, <span style="text-decoration:underline">even if any such advice was given</span>, Springwell acknowledged that the Chase entities had no responsibility for any such advice, (a) because Springwell acknowledged that it had not relied upon any such advice in making its investment decision, and (b) because it had agreed that the Chase entities were not liable for any loss caused as a result of any investment decision by Springwell (save in the case of gross negligence or wilful default.)  </p>

I agree with him that, on every occasion on which the parties came to document their contractual relations, and for whatever purposes, they agreed that Chase was not required to give any advice, was not to assume investment advisory obligations or responsibilities, and that Springwell acknowledged that it was relying on its own judgment in entering into the transaction.  The documentation extends over a lengthy period of time, all of which was to the same effect, and is, in my judgment, inconsistent with the alleged, or any, advisory duties of care, of whatever scope.

	      </authorialNote>  In that case, there were various claims in misrepresentation in relation to an Information Memorandum (a SIM) provided by the defendant to the claimant.  There was also a claim in respect of an alleged general duty of care to give advice.  This was notwithstanding the fact that the Information Memorandum had contained clauses to the effect that its content had not been independently verified and that the defendant accepted no responsibility in respect of it.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="107">

Toulson J rejected the notion that they were exclusion clauses and saw them as defining the nature of the relationship between the parties, with the result that there was simply no question of any general advisory duty.

The foundation for liability for negligent misstatements demonstrates that where the terms on which someone is prepared to give advice or make a statement negatives any assumption of responsibility, no duty of care will be owed.  Although there might be cases where the law would impose a duty by virtue of a particular state of facts despite an attempt not ‘to assume responsibility’ the relationship between GSI either as arranger or as vendor would not be one of them.

There are a number of other cases which strongly support the approach that contractual provisions such as those found in the present case prevent the coming into existence of any general duty of care to advise.  One of these is <span style="font-style:italic">Peekay Intermark v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="110">

	      </authorialNote>.  This case related to a GKO-Linked Note issued by the defendant bank.  In summary, the second claimant had invested in emerging market instruments with the defendant bank since 1997;  the first claimant, Peekay, was the second claimant’s investment vehicle.  The salesman telephoned the second claimant to see if the first claimant wished to purchase the note.  She described the nature of the investment to him in terms which suggested that the note was structured in such a way that it gave the investor a proprietary interest in the underlying GKO.  Nor did she explain to the second claimant that, in the event of a default, investors would have no control over the manner in which the investment was liquidated.  The contractual documentation sent to the customer stated the correct position, but the second claimant did not read it before he signed and returned it.  The claim, in misrepresentation, succeeded before the judge, but the judgment was overturned in the Court of Appeal.  I shall return to the detail of the judgment in another context, but it is important to note that the focus of the judgments in the Court of Appeal was on the need for commercial certainty between parties in commercial transactions such as this, and of the significance of the contractual documentation.  As was said by Moore-Bick LJ<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="111">

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“One of the factors that distinguishes the present case from those to which I have referred so far is that the true position appeared clearly from the terms of the very contract which the second claimant says it was induced to enter into by the misrepresentation.  Moreover, it was not buried in a mass of small print but appeared on the face of the documents as part of the description of the investment product to which the contract related.  It was accepted that a person who signs a document knowing that it is intended to have legal effect is generally bound by its terms, whether he has actually read them or not.  The classic example of this is to be found in <span style="font-style:italic">L’Estrange v Graucob</span> [1934] 2 KB 394.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Court held that by confirming that he had read and understood the Risk Disclosure Statement and returning it with his instructions to make the investment, the second claimant offered to enter into a contract with the defendant on behalf of Peekay on those terms and that offer was accepted by the defendant when it implemented his instructions.  As a result it was part of the contract between them that Peekay was aware of the nature of the investment it was seeking to purchase and had satisfied itself that it was suitable for its needs.  In those circumstances, since it had not been suggested that the defendant misrepresented to the second claimant the effect of the documents, it was not open to Peekay to say that it did not understand the nature of the transaction described in the terms and conditions.  Accordingly, Peekay could not assert that it was induced to enter into the contract by a misunderstanding of the nature of the investment derived from what the salesman had said about the product some days earlier.</p>

The company had retained the defendant bank as its banker and as its financial advisor:  it was common ground that the bank had by contract been engaged as financial advisor, on terms set out in a copy of its standard terms and conditions, and that the account was advisory, rather than discretionary management, which meant that the bank advised on investments but was not authorised to trade without express instructions.  The employee of the bank whose advice was being criticised was a general investment advisor, not a salesman, nor a specialist in emerging markets.  However, albeit that the bank was the claimant’s financial advisor, the terms and conditions also included the equivalent of a SFA non-private customer notification (whether that was strictly necessary or not), which confirmed that the customer had been categorised as a non-private customer, and the regulatory obligations to advise on suitability or to give risk warnings were being excluded.</p>

There was no Non-Discretionary Management Agreement in existence and no contractual duty, in my view, owed to Valse, the client, as to the suitability of the portfolio as a whole.  The bank is, essentially, under an obligation to carry out the client's instructions and may not refuse to do so simply on the grounds that the instructions may conflict with an agreed investment objective.  The client is the master of the account;  the investment objectives are his servant and must be adapted to meet the client's trading decisions.

The allegations go wider than those of misrepresentation and collateral undertaking.  The principle, on which DSS founds itself here is contained in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Barclays Bank plc v Khaira</span> [1992] 1 WLR 623, <span style="font-style:italic">Cornish v Midland Bank plc</span> [1989] 3 All ER 513 and <span style="font-style:italic">Box v Midland Bank Ltd</span> [1979] 12 LI Rep 391.  In short, a bank negotiating and contracting with another party owes in the first instance no duty to explain the nature or effect of the proposed arrangement to that other party.  However, if the bank does give an explanation or tender advice, then it owes a duty to give that explanation or tender that advice fully, accurately and properly.  How far that duty goes must once again depend on the precise nature of the circumstances and of the explanation or advice which is tendered.  [Counsel for the claimants] accepted:  that BTCo and BTI did in the present case owe a duty to take reasonable care not to misstate facts in any of the relevant meetings or letters.  DSS alleges that explanations and advice were tendered which went beyond the mere statement of facts, and that BTCo and BTI owed correspondingly broader duties.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In its pleadings and submissions, Springwell mounted an extensive attack upon Chase’s asserted entitlement to rely upon the contractual documentation as negating a duty of care and sought to circumvent the effect of the contractual documentation, which it signed or which it received.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="121">

	      </authorialNote>  That attack was based not merely on the wider grounds of the various equitable and other defences, which Springwell invoked to avoid the effect of the Relevant Provisions, but was also based upon specific arguments as to the alleged narrow construction and limited extent of the relevant terms and representations.  In broad terms, these arguments took three forms:  i) attempts to place a narrow construction on the Relevant Provisions;  ii) attempts to undermine terms which take the form of representations;  and iii) attempts to avoid the documents altogether, through various equitable and other defences.  All these arguments were, to a certain extent, related.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before dealing with Springwell’s construction and avoidance arguments, it is, as Mr. Hapgood submitted, instructive to identify certain general features against the backdrop of which Springwell’s attempts to circumvent the contractual documentation fall to be considered.  First, the contractual documents were written contractual agreements, concluded between commercial parties which I find were of equal bargaining power.  The Polemises were not parties at a disadvantage.  On the contrary, they were highly experienced and astute businessmen who were well versed in concluding commercial contracts and who were fully capable (if they bothered to read the relevant terms) of understanding both the significance of agreeing contractual terms and the meaning and effect of the terms which they agreed.  If they required legal advice, they were fully capable of taking it.  They did not need to deal with Chase.  They had access (which, on occasions, they utilised) to other financial institutions, from which they could have purchased similar products to those sold to them by Chase, if they had not been prepared to accept the terms or the prices which Chase was offering.  Second, the case put forward by Springwell is not a case of a single supposed mistake, affecting one, or a small number of, documents.  Springwell’s case in effect involves scrapping terms contained in numerous documents, including the confirms, all of which presented a consistent pattern of non-acceptance on the part of Chase of legal responsibility for any advice that might have been given.  Most of the documents were signed on behalf of Springwell by way of acceptance of their terms in the knowledge that the documents were contractual documents.  Third, the contractual documents were not exceptional or unusual.  They were, for the main part, ordinary standard form documents of the sort which might be expected to pass between a bank and its customer in this area of activity.  Some of them were industry standard documents (such as the GMRA).  Most of them were no longer than a few pages in size, with clear terms.  Fourth, as I have already held above, the contractual documents were significant documents from Chase’s perspective, because they confirmed the basis upon which Chase was prepared to trade with Springwell.  Thus absent, for example, the DDCS letters, there would have been no trading at all.  Fifth, Springwell and the Polemises were not unfamiliar with this sort of contractual documentation.  It mirrored contractual documentation which Springwell or the Polemises had signed with other banks.  Thus, for example, Springwell had signed non-private customer letters and a GMRA with ML before it signed the 1997 DDCS Letter and the Chase GMRA.  Sixth, this is not a case in which Springwell seeks to avoid documents on the basis of some active misrepresentation about their contents.  Its avoidance arguments are effectively premised on Chase’s alleged failure to point something out to Springwell, in circumstances where it is alleged there was an anterior duty to do so.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before dealing with these points, I repeat my finding that these standard form letters, produced within the Chase compliance department, were highly significant letters, which were intended to reflect both the classification of clients as non-private customers, as a non-private customer for all emerging markets dealings, and, following on from that classification, the understanding and agreement of the parties that, neither the Private Bank, nor the Investment Bank had any obligation to give investment advice, either generally or in relation to any specific investments, or to consider the client’s particular financial circumstances or investment objectives.  They also contained the representation by the client that he had independently, and without reliance on the Chase entities, made his decision to acquire the relevant investments, and the exclusion of any liability on the part of the Chase entities for loss by the client.  This was confirmed by the evidence of Mr. Saunders, who said that, in the market at the time, the purpose and effect of a non-private customer letter was to confirm the absence of any advisory responsibility in the areas covered by the notice.  I also conclude that they were contractual documents setting out the terms and conditions on the basis of which the Private Bank and the Investment Bank were prepared to deal with Springwell.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in"> In relation to CIBL/CMIL, Springwell submitted that, on their true construction, the DDCS Letters only applied in respect of subsequent transactions in which CIBL/CMIL was “dealing <span style="text-decoration:underline">for</span>” Springwell, whereas in fact the Investment Bank only “dealt <span style="text-decoration:underline">with</span>” Springwell (i.e. as principal).  Thus Mr. Brindle argued that the DDCS Letters expressly, in paragraph 5, recognised a distinction between “dealing <span style="text-decoration:underline">for</span>” someone and “dealing <span style="text-decoration:underline">with</span>” them and that the distinction between dealing for and dealing with is also recognised in a number of the SFA rules.  He submitted that “dealing for” someone encompasses dealing as their agent, viz. buying and selling on their behalf;  “Dealing with” someone encompasses dealing as principal, viz. buying and selling to them;  thus the effect of the introductory words of the DDCS Letters (“when dealing for you”) was clearly to limit the Letter’s scope to any “activity of CIBL when dealing for” the client.  Once it was appreciated that the DDCS Letters are addressing “the activity of CIBL/CMIL when dealing for” the client as agent, a number of its provisions especially in Paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 make ready sense.  He submitted that, in contrast, the factual position was that, throughout its dealings with Springwell, CIBL/CMIL dealt with Springwell as principal, but not for it.  He referred to Chase’s pleadings and JA’s evidence to point out that Springwell’s transactions were always with a Chase entity;  thus Springwell was not buying from third parties and Chase was not playing a brokerage role for Springwell.  Accordingly, it followed that the standard form wording of the DDCS Letters did not address dealings of the sort which Springwell had with CIBL/CMIL and the Letters were inapplicable.  He submitted that there was no warrant for any generous construction in Chase’s favour, as the language of the Letters was clear.  They were standard form letters which would have been applicable to those customers for whom CIBL/CMIL dealt as agent and there must have been some such customers because of the language in Paragraph 4 (referring to placing orders), in Paragraph 5(d) (referring to other firms with whom client orders are placed) and Paragraph 7(a) (referring to “transactions effected on your behalf”).  Thus the Letters were not applicable to Springwell’s dealings with CIBL/CMIL.</p>

That was because Springwell’s claims did not arise out of any activity by CIBL/CMIL in dealing for Springwell,  but rather out of another activity, namely an advisory activity.  Mr. Brindle submitted that dealing and advising were different activities, which was a  point specifically recognised in the drafting of the 1986 Act.  In defining the activities which constitute “investment business”, Schedule 1 to the 1986 Act expressly distinguished between, on the one hand, “dealing” (see  paragraph 12) and, on the other, “investment advice” (see  paragraph 15 of the Schedule) He submitted that distinction was pertinent to the contents of the  DDCS Letters because:  (i) the Letter purported to be a regulatory document – notification to Springwell that it was to be treated as a Non-Private Customer;  (ii) the Letter was headed “Dealings in Developing Countries Securities” emphasising that its concern was with “dealing”;  and (iii) the service which the Letter envisaged CIBL/CMIL providing to the would-be client was a non-advisory, execution-only dealing service.  However Springwell’s claims arose out of advice or failure to advise;  further, the claims were concerned not merely with advice directly related to particular transactions or “dealings”;  the claims were also concerned with advice, or a lack of it, relating to portfolio strategy and structure, to the balance of risk in Springwell’s portfolio as a whole and to an appropriate mix of investments between asset classes;  the language of the Letters was simply inapt to cover such activities.  </p>

No reasonable reader of the 1992 or 1993 Letters, in the position of Springwell, would think that there had to be any further introduction by CMB to CIBL for the terms to apply to future dealings.  Such a reader would correctly assume that the terms applied from the date of the Letter, irrespective of any future introduction.</p>

An investment bank, engaged, as JA was, in the activity of selling emerging markets debt instruments to  Springwell, can, in normal language, be said to be dealing for its customer generally in receiving orders, acquiring investments in order to sell to the customer and selling investments on to the customer, notwithstanding that the actual sale is principal to principal.

In the light of the commercial matrix, on no objective reading of the letters could any reasonable party have considered that their terms were intended to cover not the type of transactions with which Chase and Springwell had for so long dealt and continued to deal, but some entirely different activity, which had never been undertaken, never been suggested and never would be undertaken.</p>

The whole point of the Letters is to make it clear that, in circumstances where CMB is affording Springwell access to the Investment Bank, and Springwell is going to be buying and selling emerging markets instruments through the Investment Bank, CMB is not going to be “required to give you investment advice generally or in relation to specific investments, make any inquiries about, or to consider, your particular financial circumstances or investment objectives”;  that Springwell’s decision to invest has been without any reliance on CMB;  and that CMB is not to be liable for any loss which Springwell might incur arising out of any investment decision taken by it;  see clause 4.

The paragraphs said nothing about any common law obligations to do so.  In other words it submitted that, although the statutory duty to give suitable advice (under SFA Rule 5-31) was excluded, that left unaffected any similar common law duty.  Thus the DDCS Letter only addressed suitability as a matter of regulatory protection.  That, it was submitted, was consistent with the (erroneous) view of the Chase Compliance Department that the Investment Bank was providing an execution-only, non-advisory service, and that all that was required was a classification of the customer as Non-Private in order to prevent advisory obligations coming in, through the back-door of the SFA Rules, into relationships which were otherwise execution-only, non-advisory.  Springwell also alleged that this warning was unnecessary, as Springwell had at all times from the inception of the FSA regime been a non-private customer on account of its assets being in excess of £5 million.  </p>

I agree with Mr. Hapgood that there would have been no commercial purpose in serving a notice to the effect that Chase was not obliged to do under the rules something which it remained obliged to do in some other way (alternatively, that, if that had indeed been the purpose of the letter, it would have said so).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Springwell submitted that, because the second sentence of clause 4 begins with the words “By placing an order”, this “limits the sentence to an activity Springwell did not engage in”.  Springwell referred to the definitions in the SFA rules<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> defining an order as an order to a firm from the customer to effect a transaction as agent, or any other order to a firm from the customer to effect a transaction in circumstances giving rise to similar duties.  Springwell also submitted that, in any event, the words “By placing an order…” qualify the second sentence and the sentences which follow;  to the extent that those sentences seek to limit or exclude liability in respect of advice, they only do so in respect of advice leading to the “placing of an order” (i.e. a decision to purchase);  they say nothing about whether or not Springwell was entitled to rely upon advice to continue to hold investments already purchased or, for that matter, general strategic advice about desirable portfolio shape.</p>

The second sentence makes it plain, and indeed this is its only possible context, that what it is concerned with is the purchase of an instrument by Springwell from Chase.  All the order does is to trigger the making of the representation.  The further argument that somehow the following sentences excluding liability are, because of the circumstances which trigger the representation, restricted to advice leading to the placing of an order, is linguistically (and commercially) unsupportable.</p>

In this context, Springwell submitted that the service contemplated in the Letters was the Investment Bank dealing for Springwell on an execution-only basis;  the Letters did not contemplate that CMB or CIBL/CMIL would give investment advice;  indeed they expressly provide in the first sentence of Paragraph 4 that they have no such obligation, and, in any event, “investment advice” is a distinct activity from “dealing<span style="font-style:italic">”</span>.  That being so, if CMB or CIBL/CMIL chose to give advice and Springwell made an investment decision in reliance on it, there is no reason to regard that as a decision made “in consequence” of any service contemplated in the Letters.  Further, Springwell submitted, even if clause 4 could extend to advice, it could only extend to advice in the context of a purchase;  and that the words were inapt to extend to advice to continue to hold investments <span style="text-decoration:underline">already</span> purchased.  </p>

It is correct that the exclusion clause does not exclude liability for loss arising as a result of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, but that point is irrelevant to the issue whether, in the circumstances, a duty of care arose at all.  Nor can I accept the argument that the exclusion of liability provision does not cover loss arising from the possible giving of investment advice, or the failure to give investment advice.  The service contemplated is the dealing service in all its aspects, including (as is apparent from the terms of the Letters) any possibility of investment advice in connection with dealing, whether connected with a purchase or otherwise, which impacts on an investment decision.  </p>

Springwell submitted ,therefore, that, properly understood, the paragraph did not purport to exclude liability in respect of opinion or advice;  alternatively, and even if “information” could stretch to encompass advice, it would be limited to advice about “any investment or investment opportunity”.  Those words were inapt to cover advice on, for example, the composition or management of a portfolio as a whole or diversification between asset classes.</p>

However, in any event, I conclude that, on the construction of the words used, the exclusion in clause 6 did apply directly to all oral communications made by JA to AP in respect of Springwell’s investments, which could be characterised as “information” or “recommendations”.  That is because, in context, “information” has to be construed as including oral “recommendations”, since written recommendations clearly fall within the description of “information”.  However, in my view the exclusion in clause 6 is not directed at anything other than liability for “information” relating to a particular instrument or investment opportunity.</p>

Mr. Brindle correctly pointed out that the provisions of the DDCS Letters apply to the activity of CIBL/CMIL “when dealing for [Springwell] in such instruments”.  The reference to “such instruments” is a reference back to the first introductory paragraph where “Instruments” are defined as “debt and equity securities of public and private sector issuers<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="130">

Mr. Brindle submitted that three of the assets in which Springwell invested did not  fall within that definition;  namely the GKO-Linked Notes (of which Springwell invested in 42 between 1996 and 1998), the VW RUR Note (of which Springwell purchased $5m in May 1998) and the Ukraine Note (of which Springwell purchased $5m in January 1998).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The relevant factual background showed that there was throughout the 1990s a course of dealing in which CIBL and then CMIL sold emerging markets instruments to Springwell, with no distinction drawn at any stage between different types of instruments or structured instruments (and no reason for any distinction).  Further, by the time of the 1997 Letter, Springwell had already purchased several GKO-Linked Notes from CIBL which were subject to the terms of the MFA:  terms which themselves provided that, in relation to such purchases, Springwell was a non-private customer, which had made its own decision to purchase the relevant instrument, did not expect CIBL or any affiliate to be responsible for advising it as to the merits of any transaction and had not received any advice.  In such circumstances, I accept Mr. Hapgood’s submission that an objective reading of the 1993 or 1997 Letters does not create a distinction between different categories of instrument, where no such distinction had previously been drawn or ever suggested.</p>

Furthermore, although (with the exception to which I have referred), the clauses are expressly stated to apply to financing transactions, since the financing transactions were an integral and necessarily dependent element of each individual purchase transaction, this (as Mr. Hapgood submitted) is a distinction without a difference.  Realistically, a claim against CMB in respect of an underlying purchase transaction could not be separated from a claim in respect of a financing transaction.  Thus, if and to the extent that it is alleged that CMB wrongly advised - or failed to advise - in relation to any instrument purchased under the GMRA, the Relevant Provisions in the GMRA would, in my judgment, provide a contractual defence to CMB in respect of each such allegation.  In relation to an alleged failure on the part of CMB to advise that Springwell should <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> invest in such instruments, I take the view that clause 9(ii) and the first sentence of clause 25 in particular indicate that no positive advisory duty of care was imposed on CMB in relation to Springwell’s trading activity pursuant to the terms of the GMRA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">the only Chase entity which could take advantage of the Relevant Provisions was CMSCI.  CMIL was not a party to the Note.  CMB was a party to the Note but as “Holder”.  The Relevant Provisions could not, therefore affect the claims against CMB and CMIL.  The Notes were contracts between CMSCI and “the Holder”.  “The Holder” was a defined term meaning CMB, and CMB signed the Notes in that capacity.  The representations/warranties made by “the Holder” in Section 6 expressly related to “the Holder” (i.e. CMB) and to its state of mind.  They did not relate to or say anything about Springwell or its state of mind (when it decided to invest in the relevant GKO-Linked Note).  Accordingly, Mr. Brindle submitted that they could not give rise to an estoppel preventing Springwell from asserting that <span style="text-decoration:underline">it</span> relied on advice as to the advisability of purchasing the GKO-Linked Notes or on representations or that <span style="text-decoration:underline">it</span> had such advice or representations given to it;  none of these documents was material to the dealings between Springwell and Chase.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="133">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not agree with the first point.  It is looking at the matter too simplistically to state that the GKO-Linked Notes were merely contracts between the issuer (CMSCI, for all the later Notes) and the Holder, and that the Holder was in fact CMB.  As the GKO-Linked Note confirms make clear, the contract for the issue of the Notes was between the issuer and Springwell, and under that contract Springwell was entitled to have the Note issued in its name.  (Indeed the confirm stated that the Note had been issued to Springwell).  Under the terms of that contract, the issuer and Springwell agreed that, because of the financing arrangements, whether under the MFA or the GMRA, the Note would actually be issued in the name of CMB, which was purchasing the Note from Springwell.  Under each financing mechanism, title was to remain with CMB, until satisfaction of all Springwell’s liabilities under the financing arrangements, when it became theoretically entitled to have the Note transferred into its own name.  If the Note matured before that occurred then no such transfer would take place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Mr. Hapgood’s submission that this has no bearing on the contractual effect of the terms of the Notes.  The reality was that, in effect (whatever the strict legal position), at all times, Springwell was the beneficial holder/owner of the Notes, in that, subject to satisfaction of its financing obligations to CMB under the GMRA, it was entitled to have them issued in its name on purchase from CMSCI, and transferred into its name on repurchase from CMB.  Thus Springwell could only ever make a claim in respect of the purchase or sale of the GKO-Linked Notes subject to the contractual terms of those Notes, whether or not Springwell was named as the Holder when they were first issued.</p>

The terms of the Notes (and the related terms and conditions sheet and risk disclosure sheet) are, however, a strong counter-indicator as to the existence of any duty of care to give general advice.  Whether, and to what extent, Chase can rely on the language of the Notes in relation to Springwell’s misrepresentation claim is considered below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell made various construction points in relation to the confirms, and the statement that Springwell represented and warranted that it had read the Note and understood the terms of the Note<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="134">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>As originally stated in Springwell’s Reply paragraph 139.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  The first point was that the statement was not true (although strictly this is not a point of construction).  This, in my view, is irrelevant, even if it were the case.  The confirm records the basis upon which Springwell agreed to proceed with the transaction.  The second point was that the representations in the Note were made by the “Holder” and not by Springwell, and, therefore, Springwell was doing nothing in the confirms when it stated that it accepted the Notes’ terms.  I have already dealt with this point in relation to the Notes themselves.  The third point was that the statement that Springwell confirmed the acceptance of the terms did not incorporate the terms of the Notes into any contract between Springwell and “Chase”, by which I assume reference is being made to CMB and CMIL.  I do not agree.  In relation to CMB, it was, in any event, a party to the Note contract as Holder;  I see no reason why the terms of the Note should not be incorporated into its contractual dealings with Springwell under the GMRA in relation to the relevant Note;  that is clearly the purpose of the statement.  So far as CMIL is concerned, it may not have been a party to the contracts for the purchase and financing of the GKO-Linked Notes, but clearly it was intended to have the benefit of clause 6(c) in its dealings with Springwell under the terms of the 1997 DDCS Letter, including providing it with the opportunity to purchase GKO-Linked Notes.  In the wider evidential context, moreover, the provisions of the Notes, the terms and conditions and the confirms strongly support the argument that CMB and CMIL had no duty of care to give general or specific investment advice.  </p>

It was too late for her to claim rescission of the agreement;  if she was to obtain relief it must be in damages.  He further held that since the plaintiff’s attention had never been drawn to the provisions of clauses 8 and 9 of the agreement, she was not estopped from relying on the implied condition of reasonable fitness imported by section 8(2) of the Hire-Purchase Act, 1938;  but he held that she was estopped by the receipt, which she had subsequently signed, from complaining of the condition of the car.  He, accordingly, entered judgment for the defendants.  In other words, he appears to have held, on the first point, (although this is not clear from the report) that the statement in clause 9 of the hire-purchase agreement (that the hirer had not made known to the owners the particular purpose for which the goods were required) amounted to a provision effectively excluding or modifying the statutory condition of fitness for purpose set out in section 8(2) of the 1938 Act, and therefore the finance company was not entitled to rely on it by virtue of section 8(3) of the 1938 Act because it had never been brought to the plaintiff’s attention.  But he then went on to hold against the plaintiff in relation to the terms of the delivery receipt.  The plaintiff appealed.  The defendant, by cross-notice, sought to support the actual decision in the defendant’s favour by relying on the provisions of clause 9 of the hire-purchase agreement.</p>

In so far as it was a representation, it could operate only as an estoppel preventing the plaintiff from asserting the contrary, but Mr. Roche expressly disclaims reliance upon it as an estoppel, no doubt for the very good reason that there was no evidence (and it is difficult to see how there could have been truthful evidence) that the defendants believed in the truth of the representation.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">To call it an agreement as well as an acknowledgment by the plaintiff cannot convert a statement as to past facts, known by both parties to be untrue, into a contractual obligation, which is essentially a promise by the promisor to the promisee that acts will be done in the future or that facts exist at the time of the promise or will exist in the future</span>.  To say that the hirer ‘agrees’ that he has not done something in the past means no more than that the hirer, at the request of the owner, represents that he has not done that thing in the past.  If intended by the hirer to be acted upon by the person to whom the representation is made, believed to be true by such person and acted upon by such person to his detriment, it can give rise to an estoppel:  it cannot give rise to any positive contractual obligation.  Although contained in the same document at the contract, it is not a contractual promise.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">There lies the fallacy in Mr. Roche’s contention.  Whether or not the plaintiff made known to the defendants by implication the particular purpose for which she required the car is a pure question of fact as to the state of knowledge of the defendants to be inferred in the light of all the circumstances, including the terms of the contract itself.  On this issue, the rule of construction relied on by Mr. Roche that you cannot imply in a contract a promise, which is inconsistent with an express promise, is irrelevant, for the inference to be drawn from the terms of the contract that the defendants knew the particular purpose for which the plaintiff required the car is not an implied promise, nor is the representation in clause 9(ii) of the contract an express promise.</p>

In that context, Diplock J set out the three elements necessary to found an estoppel by representation, namely:  (a) that there was a clear and unambiguous statement;  (b) that the plaintiff meant it to be acted upon by the defendant, or, at any rate, so conducted herself that a reasonable man would take the representation to be true and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it;  and (c) that the defendant did in fact believe it to be true and was induced by such belief to act upon it.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="138">

As I have already pointed out, all that the Court of Appeal actually had to decide for the purposes of <span style="font-style:italic">Lowe v Lombank</span> (in relation to the first point) was that the false statement in the agreement as to non-notification of purpose was one which fell foul of section 8(3) of the 1938 Act.  Although Diplock J went further than this, and concluded that the so-called agreement had, in context, to be regarded as a representation and therefore satisfy the requirements of an estoppel by representation, the reality, I suggest, is that he regarded the so-called “agreement” as no more than a sham provision of the type shortly thereafter recognised by the Court of Appeal (including Diplock LJ) in <span style="font-style:italic">Snook v London &amp; West Riding Investments Ltd</span> [1967] 1 All ER 518.

The effectiveness of a clause of that kind may be challenged on the grounds that the contract as a whole, including the clause in question, can be avoided if in fact one or other party was induced to enter into it by misrepresentation.  However, I can see no reason in principle why it should not be possible for parties to an agreement to give up any right to assert that they were induced to enter into it by misrepresentation, provided that they make their intention clear, or why a clause of that kind, if properly drafted, should not give rise to a contractual estoppel of the kind recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Colchester Borough Council v Smith</span>.

By confirming that he had read and understood the statement and returning it with his instructions to make the investment Mr. Pawani offered to enter into a contract with ANZ on behalf of Peekay on those terms and that offer was accepted by the bank when it implemented his instructions.  As a result it was part of the contract between them that Peekay was aware of the nature of the investment it was seeking to purchase and had satisfied that it was suitable for its needs.  In those circumstances, and since it is not suggested that the bank misrepresented to Mr. Pawani the effect of the documents, I do not think that it is open to Peekay to say that it did not understand the nature of the transaction described in the FTCs;  and if that is so, it cannot assert that it was induced to enter into the contract by a misunderstanding of the nature of the investment derived from what Mrs.  Balasubramaniam had said about the product some days earlier”.</p>

That confirmation, as it seems to me, operates as a contractual estoppel to prevent Peekay from asserting in litigation that it had not, in fact read and understood the Risk Disclosure Statement.  And, if it had read and understood the Risk Disclosure Statement, it must be taken to have accepted that ANZ would assume that it fully understood the nature of the transaction into which it was entering, was aware of the risks, and had determined that the transaction was suitable for its purposes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Peekay</span>, all three judges were agreed that the provisions in the documentation gave rise to a contractual estoppel which contractually precluded the claimant from making assertions of fact to the contrary.  This was in addition to and distinct from any question of estoppel by representation.  Their reasoning was firmly rooted in, and consistent with, the importance of freedom of contract and contractual certainty.  The particular clauses in that case concerned the question of understanding as to the nature of the instrument.  That has direct relevance to certain of the allegations made by Springwell in the context of its misrepresentation claim.  But the principle extends more broadly and, in my judgment, applies to any other form of contractual statement, for instance as to sophistication or non-reliance on advice generally.  In each case, the parties are contractually free to determine the factual basis upon which they conduct business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">Rix J held (in what was, in effect, a precursor to the <span style="font-style:italic">Peekay </span>analysis) that such a clause was not, as a matter of construction, apt to exclude a claim in misrepresentation, but that it did, as a matter of construction, exclude any claims for breach of collateral warranties.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="158">

All of the relevant terms of the contractual documentation fall squarely within the <span style="font-style:italic">Peekay</span> analysis, as contractual representations (and in some cases, warranties) or “agreements” as to the basis upon which the business was to be conducted.  Thus, for example, where the contract provided that, by placing an order, Springwell represented (clause 4 of the 1997 DDCS Letter)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="160">

	      </authorialNote> that it was a sophisticated investor and that it had independently and without reliance on Chase made a decision to acquire the instrument, that was not a mere statement of historical fact, but a contractual representation forming the agreed and binding basis upon which the parties would transact every future purchase.  The same analysis applies in respect of every clause in every document to which Springwell takes this objection.  The fact that some statements are expressed in the language of representation or acknowledgement cannot, in my view, make any difference to the analysis that the statements give rise to a contractual estoppel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if, contrary to my conclusion, Chase has to rely on estoppel by representation, the three limbs of the test are adequately satisfied to permit it to do so.  Thus, the terms of the Relevant Provisions are clear and unambiguous.  By signing the various documents, Springwell so conducted itself that a reasonable person in the position of Chase would take the representation to be true and believe that Springwell intended that Chase should act upon it.  On my findings of fact, Chase did, at least to a certain extent, believe the representations to be true, and was induced by such belief to act upon them.  At the time the relevant documents were signed, Chase did believe that Springwell was a sophisticated and experienced investor which was fully capable of making, and did in fact make, its own decision on every purchase that it made.  Although Chase knew that JA was giving AP advice (in the nature of recommendations and opinions based on Chase research materials) and that AP relied on such advice in reaching his investment decisions, it knew that AP would in fact always make his own decision as to whether to invest or not.  Further, Chase in fact thought that Springwell did not look to Chase as an investment advisor, and did not consider that Chase was its investment advisor.  Thus the representations in one sense reflected Chase’s own view of the reality.  Certainly it acted in reliance on those beliefs, because it would not have traded with Springwell had Springwell not signed the documents.  But if Chase (contrary to the above view), in order to satisfy the requirements for estoppel by representation, has to show that it did not believe that AP relied at all on any of JA’s advice in coming to his investment decisions, then I conclude that it would fail to establish estoppel by representation.</p>

First, it alleged that there was a positive fiduciary duty to disclose all material facts in the contractual documentation and explain such documentation to Springwell;  this went to Springwell’s allegations that Chase could not rely on the Relevant Provisions in the contractual documentation<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="165">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no need for me to conduct a meticulous rehearsal of the relevant authorities or to repeat the relevant facts relating to Springwell’s relationship with the Private Bank and the Investment Bank.  In the absence of any contractual agreement for Chase to provide investment advisory services to Springwell, or any common law acceptance of an obligation to do so (as I have found the position to be), I do not see how what was essentially a commercial banking relationship between Chase and Springwell could give rise to the extensive fiduciary obligations on the part of Chase contended for by Springwell.  In effect, Springwell relied on the same facts to support it case that Chase owed investment advisory obligations as it did to support the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  Chase may, in its capacity as custodian of securities held for Springwell’s account, have had certain limited fiduciary obligations, but this is a far cry from the wide-ranging fiduciary relationship which Springwell asserted.  AP was well aware that certain Chase entities were counterparties to the transactions in which Springwell was involved, and had their own commercial interest in such transactions.  Thus, the Investment Bank was counterparty to the Sale Transactions, and the Private Bank was custodian and lender.  Many of the contractual documents specifically emphasised that Chase had or might have an interest in the relevant transactions.  AP certainly relied upon, or “trusted” JA’s views, recommendations and advice.  He may have trusted EM, FS and others at Chase.  But the mere fact that one party to a commercial relationship “trusts” the other does not predicate a fiduciary relationship.  The word “trust”, like the word “advice” has a variety of meanings.  In a broad sense, trust is an important element in many commercial dealings.

But the essence of a fiduciary relationship is that it creates obligations of a different character from those deriving from the contract itself.  Their Lordships have not heard in argument any submission which went beyond suggesting that by virtue of being a fiduciary the company was obliged honestly and conscientiously to do what it had by contract promised to do.  Many commercial relationships involve just such a reliance by one party on the other, and to introduce the whole new dimension into such relationships which would flow from giving them a fiduciary character would (as it seems to their Lordships) have adverse consequences far exceeding those foreseen by Atkin L.J.  In  <span style="font-style:italic">re Wait</span> [1927] 1 Ch.  606.

The purpose of that documentation was to define and delineate the basis of the relationship between Springwell and Chase, and the services which the latter was to provide.  The documentation was not, upon my analysis, at any stage attempting to undermine or modify an existing fiduciary relationship.  It follows that I reject Mr. Brindle’s submission that the documents purported radically to change the nature of the relationship between Springwell and Chase, and that presenting documents for signature without drawing the changes specifically to AP’s attention was an abuse of the confidence which AP placed in Chase.

In my judgment, there is no room in the factual context of the present case for the operation of principles analogous to those of undue influence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell also sought to avoid the contractual documentation on the grounds of Chase’s misrepresentation.  This was allegedly based on Chase’s silence or conveyance of half-truths in failing to explain the scope and effect of the Relevant Provisions to AP in circumstances where, Springwell alleged FS knew that AP would not read contractual documents, at least in any detail, before signing them;  and that AP trusted FS not to put before AP, and make him sign, anything that was prejudicial to Springwell without explaining it to him.  In particular, Springwell relied upon the circumstances surrounding the signing of the MFA, the GMRA and the 1993 and 1997 DDCS Letters.  This argument was also heavily dependent upon Springwell’s case (which I have rejected) that Chase had a fiduciary relationship with Springwell, giving rise to extensive fiduciary obligations.  Mr. Brindle relied upon the statement of the relevant principle by Bingham J in <span style="font-style:italic">The August Leonhardt</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="178">

Although it is clear that FS and JA were well aware that AP did not as a rule read documents in any great detail before signing them (and indeed the transcripts show that FS was somewhat concerned about this), an analysis of the circumstances in which the documentation came to be signed, as set out above in the narrative section of this judgment, does not support a case that the meaning and effect of individual clauses or the entire document was misrepresented to AP or Springwell, whether by a partial explanation or silence.  The main reason for FS’ reluctance to go into any detail in his explanations was, I have no doubt, largely based on AP’s obvious impatience with formalities and irritation at being faced with legal documents to sign.  But, as I have described, FS did at least explain the commercial effect of the documents and introduce them in broad terms.  Moreover, given the sheer number of contractual documents and confirmations, and the obvious importance that Chase attached to them, Springwell cannot realistically assert that, in the absence of a full explanation from Chase, it is not bound by any of their terms.</p>

On any basis, he knew that access to the Investment Bank’s trading desk in emerging markets and the Private Bank’s financing programmes was dependent upon his doing so.  Accordingly, for those reasons, I reject Springwell’s case that Chase is not entitled to rely on the Relevant Provisions on the grounds of any alleged misrepresentation.</p>

It would also fail on the basis that, whatever may have been the extent of AP’s comprehension of the Relevant Provisions, he was not “mistaken” as to their terms.  Moreover, as I have already explained, the Relevant Provisions did not prevent JA from doing what he had always done;  giving information, advice and recommendations to Springwell about emerging markets investments, or the state of the market.  All the Relevant Provisions did was to define the Investment Bank and the Private Bank’s trading relationship with Springwell, so that their dealings were conducted on the basis (whether assumed or actual) that no investment advice was being given by any Chase entity for which it could be held responsible.</p>

In other words, the complaint was not really as to the alleged unreasonableness of the terms of the Relevant Provisions, but, rather, as to the circumstances in which Springwell came to sign up to them.  I have rejected Springwell’s allegation that Chase assumed obligations to give investment advice from the date of Springwell’s initial introduction to JA.  I do not consider that the fact, per se, that JA continued to provide information and gave recommendations, advice and opinions to AP, in the way which I have described, meant that it was unreasonable for Chase to have included the Relevant Provisions or to rely upon them.  Nor does the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Firth</span> provide any real support for the characterisation of such standard provisions governing trading relationships in the financial markets as unreasonable;  certainly it does not do so in the circumstances of this case.</p>

Indeed, having reached my earlier conclusions, it is somewhat artificial, to say the least, to attempt to express my views as to what would be the scope of such duties, on the assumed basis that I were wrong in my earlier conclusions.  That is because, necessarily, one’s views as to the scope of any such duties as might be owed on that hypothesis are informed by one’s conclusions as to the nature of the relationship between the parties.  Furthermore, as I have already indicated, the experts were also agreed that the precise scope of any obligations owed depended on the facts of the particular case and the nature of the relationship.  Thus, as Mr. Hapgood submitted, in the absence of some uniform obligation arising out of every relationship, the particular incidents of any duty will depend on the circumstances of the case, rather than on generalities opined in expert evidence.</p>

The obligations that were owed must depend on what one party expressly, or by implication, has asked for, and what the advisor, expressly or by implication, has agreed to provide.  This was not, on any basis, as I have held, a situation where Springwell was asking for, or expecting to receive, extensive general investment advisory services of the type listed above.</p>

Thus, for example, it might be good practice for an advisor to document “an appropriate investment strategy/asset allocation plan”, but it could hardly be said to be a core obligation in itself, particularly if the client does not want such a plan.  Given, in particular, that levels of practice undoubtedly tightened up, in line with increasing regulation during the 1990s, the distinction between a core obligation and a means of practice to discharge an obligation, was an important one.</p>

Initially Springwell pleaded an exaggerated, and wholly incredible, case;  first that, throughout the period concerned, it had two investment requirements, namely capital preservation and liquidity;  second, that  Springwell ought to have been classified as an investor with a “conservative attitude to risk for whom capital preservation and liquidity were the most important concerns”;  third, that, if Chase had not been in breach of duty, it would have classified Springwell as such a conservative investor and would have advised Springwell only to purchase “high quality (investment grade) bonds and commercial paper” (with a small component in other instruments);  fourth, that, if Chase had not been in breach of duty, then Springwell’s portfolio would have comprised, for the most part “gilts, T-bonds, and other blue chip bonds”.  The rationale for the supposed investment objective was that, as alleged, AP knew from the early 1990s, that there would come a time when it was necessary to embark on a substantial ship building programme.</p>

As Mr. Hapgood submitted, the parameters described by Springwell in the US Proceedings, and in the present action until 2006, were stark.  Springwell’s description of itself was that of an investor at the most conservative end of the spectrum, which was interested in the most secure of investments, so as to ensure, as an overriding requirement, that its capital was preserved and that it retained full liquidity at all times.  </p>

However, it remained his objective not to run any “appreciable risk” that the capital value might be reduced.  Springwell also amended its case as to the portfolio which, it was said, Springwell should have acquired.

I agree with him that the likely inference to be drawn is that, when it became clear that Springwell would have to give credit for profits earned on its investments, subject to the returns which it would have received on an alternative portfolio consistent with its investment objectives, it was in Springwell’s interests to suggest a less conservative and higher yielding set of objectives, so as to justify a more aggressive alternative portfolio.  No doubt that approach also reflected the obvious lack of attraction in Springwell’s original pleaded case.</p>

On the contrary, AP remained attracted by the high yields on offer and, indeed, as demonstrated in particular by Springwell’s investments in Prins, Russian volatility was seen by AP as an opportunity for gain.

They were a standard product available in the market, which were purchased in large quantities by many other emerging markets investors.  As the underlying GKOs were sovereign local currency debt, the risk of default was small, and they also had the benefit of good quality local currency hedges.  They easily fitted within Springwell’s portfolio.  There was a vast amount of evidence, expert and otherwise, relating to the alleged unsuitability of the GKO-Linked Notes for Springwell’s portfolio, the risks attached to the Notes, whether AP was warned about these, and whether Chase, through its own proprietary trading book (“the prop book”), became aware of the increasing likelihood of default on the underlying GKOs.  Having reviewed this evidence, I reject Springwell’s contention that the evidence relating to the prop book trading and the other evidence established that Springwell should never have been advised to invest in GKO-Linked Notes, alternatively should not have been advised to invest in the Notes to anything like the extent it was;  alternatively should certainly have been advised in July and/or early August 1998 (at the latest) to reduce as much as it could, and eliminate, if possible, its exposure to the GKO market.  </p>

With a slight degree of hesitation, I have concluded that what it did was sufficient, given Springwell’s trading history, its investment objectives as I have held them to be, the fact that the Polemis’ unencumbered shipping fleet was a factor in overall diversification, and AP’s personality and enthusiasm for trading in emerging markets, including his often expressed reluctance to invest in investment grade assets or IMA type products and his reaction to JA’s suggestions that he should do so.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The articulation of the issues reflects the two ways in which causation was argued;  causation in fact and hypothetical causation, although, in reality, in relation to Chase’s alleged failure to advise, the two arguments merge.  As Mr. Hapgood pointed out, causation is a fact-sensitive enquiry.  Thus, in order to recover in respect of any particular loss, Springwell has to establish, on the evidence, that the relevant breaches of duty on the part of Chase, did in fact cause that loss.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Springwell’s approach to the issue of actual causation was not to establish that any particular decision (whether buy, sell or hold) relevant to the make-up of the portfolio was made in reliance upon any particular alleged breach of duty.  Rather, its approach was to say:  because Chase was Springwell’s investment adviser, because Chase acted in breach of duty in failing to give appropriate investment advice, because AP “relied” in a general sense on JA, and because the Russian default massively reduced the value of Springwell’s portfolio and threw it into negative equity, therefore it follows Springwell’s losses were caused by Chase’s breach.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> The essence of the first way in which Springwell put its case was, in effect, that AP simply “rubber stamped” everything that JA recommended;  that every single operative decision that was made by AP was made in reliance upon some breach or other on the part of Chase.  Thus, in effect, what Springwell contended was that the portfolio should be treated, for these purposes, as something akin to a discretionary portfolio, with the result that it was not necessary to examine the operative decisions made on any individual transaction.  Accordingly, Springwell simply claimed damages for every Russian or Indonesian asset which it held at 17 August 1998, regardless of whether, for example, the decision to purchase was made without any recommendation from JA, contrary to the views of JA, from a salesman other than JA, or for reasons which are nothing to do with anything said or not said by JA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as I have already described, the evidence in fact showed, that far from simply rubber-stamping JA’s recommendations, or, as AP described it in one of the more unconvincing passages of his evidence, from their relationship being akin to the trust that a dog had in his master, it was AP who made the actual decisions.  Of course, as I have explained, AP relied on JA for information, prices and other such materials.  He also frequently sought the views of JA in relation to individual investments.  He clearly valued those views highly.  But AP knew and determined for himself the direction of the portfolio.  He knew how much money he had and how much he wanted to invest.  He knew and determined for himself that he wished to invest in emerging markets.  He decided what yields he wanted, what countries he was interested in and what types of investments he wished to buy and in what amounts, in order to achieve Springwell’s objectives.  He would choose, on occasions between the various different bonds which JA would offer him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus the tapes of the phone conversations do not paint the picture of a man who could possibly be described as a rubber stamp.  Often they show that AP would seek prices from JA and then decide what to do.  On other occasions they show that the actual decision was made entirely separately from JA, or without any input from him.  Sometimes AP would play devil’s advocate in the discussion in order critically to evaluate JA’s views.  There are many examples in the transcripts where AP either ignored what JA said or did the opposite of what he said.  They showed that AP was fully capable of, and did, make his own independent decisions.</p>

Having reviewed the evidence between Springwell’s expert, Mr. McCall, and Chase’s expert, Ms Macleod-Wilson on the topic, I prefer the latter’s analysis that, applying those objectives, there is no reason to suppose that Springwell would have acquired any other emerging markets portfolio apart from the one it did in fact acquire.  As she said, that portfolio was consistent with Springwell’s investment objectives and there was no reliable basis for substituting a different, and inapposite, benchmark return based on an inappropriate global index.  That was because, as JA was able to discern Springwell’s investment objectives, on a day by day basis, it was inapposite to try to gauge different returns by reference to the crude yardstick of a composite benchmark index.  There was no identifiable general benchmark which reflected the returns sought by emerging markets investors such as Springwell.  Moreover her evidence was also to the effect that the level of leverage maintained on the actual portfolio was also consistent with Springwell’s investment objectives.</p>

Thus if SG had strongly advised AP, whether in 1996, 1997 or 1998, to diversify 40% or 20% of the portfolio out of emerging markets into other asset classes, I conclude that AP would not have done so.  On the evidence, I do not believe that he would have reduced the concentration of Springwell’s portfolio in emerging markets assets to any significant extent whatsoever.</p>

AP, who was in charge of his own portfolio, would have made it clear that it was for him to determine what his own investment objectives were and for him to determine what assets he did and didn’t want to buy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">AP was very strongly resistant to any change to the sort of activities in which he at all times had engaged with JA, under which he (AP) was in absolute control of the portfolio, running it for the returns which he earned and for the opportunities which he sought out.  Thus, AP’s reaction to the attempts made, in particular by the Private Bank, to encourage diversification suggest that he would have been wholly resistant to any such advice.  Indeed, SPAP’s evidence was that, even in the early 1990s, AP was being pushed to diversify into other asset classes, but was reluctant to do so.  The evidence showed that for AP, really everything - except emerging markets investments – generated insufficient yield.  His perception of the inadequacies of the returns on the IMAs caused him to close those accounts and showed him to be extremely resistant to investing any more funds in managed accounts.  On his own evidence, equities were out of the question.  The idea that high quality corporate bonds or gilts would have generated a sufficient return to be of interest to AP I find to be fanciful.   Over the period Springwell had earned a sum in the region of approximately $230 million in coupons and capital gains on its emerging markets portfolio;  I do not consider that AP, even if advised to do so, or of the dangers of concentration in emerging markets assets, would have made a significant diversification into other asset classes.</p>

AP knew that diversification was a good thing in principle, and knew that Chase internal credit had a concern about the heavy weighting in Russia.  This made absolutely no difference to him, as he continued to invest in Russian assets, and in particular in Prins, all the way to the default.</p>

Thus, for example, he accepted in evidence that he would not have been interested in any managed funds.  Likewise, in relation to his emerging markets portfolio, he said that he wanted to narrow rather than widen his interests.  AP well knew, for example, the difference between investment grade and non-investment grade, not least because he had an investment grade facility.  He also regularly signalled his objection to investment grade assets, because they were as, he said, “so expensive” and to other better quality assets which gave him, as he said, “shitty returns”.  <span class="CommentReference" style="font-size:12pt">Also instructive in this context were ML’s attempts to sell AP higher-quality assets over par.

Risks in Russia and Indonesia were frequently discussed between JA and AP, and AP received written risks disclosures in relation to, for example, the GKO-Linked Notes.  None of these matters made the slightest difference to him, because he well knew that the risk was the price he paid for the returns he sought.

There is no evidence to support such a case.  Ultimately, as he often said on the transcripts, AP was a buyer, not a seller, and he had a very strong aversion to holding cash.  Indeed, his innate reaction to market volatility was to increase his exposure not to reduce it.  That is what he did in Mexico.  That is what he did in Indonesia.  And that is what he did in Russia in 1998.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should mention that, in the context of the argument on causation, I raised the question whether, irrespective of the views of AP, Chase had a duty to advise Springwell, the corporate entity, that AP’s reluctance to diversify was contrary to Springwell’s interests and that it should consider diversification.  I am satisfied that it would have made no difference even if, for example, Chase had written a formal letter to such effect or spoken to SP.  There was no evidence from Springwell to the effect that the adoption of such a course would have resulted in any change of direction.  SP had delegated to AP all investment decisions in relation to Springwell;  there was nothing to suggest that he would have wished to persuade or influence AP to act differently, even in the light of such a letter.  Moreover, although SP was described by AP as only having an administrative role in relation to Springwell, it was clear that at all times SP himself was well aware of the composition of the portfolio and the manner in which it was invested.  Thus it was SP who received the trade confirms, logged their details and recorded and calculated the yields on each individual investment.  Moreover, even after the Russian default, when SP took over the running of Springwell and the Polemises’ other investment vehicles, the evidence showed him to be keen on a non-diversified emerging markets portfolio.</p>

The basis for this submission was that it was said to be hard to blame AP, in the light of JA’s advice and his strong steer in favour of Russia, and GKO-Linked Notes in particular, for the weighting of the portfolio so heavily in favour of Russia and the particular high-risk Russian and Indonesian investments held, rather than a properly balanced emerging markets portfolio, for example as would have been reflected in the EMBI Global type portfolio suggested by Mr. McCall.  Thus Mr. Brindle submitted that the mix of emerging markets and the particular investment products within any country risk were matters where AP was entitled to, and did, look to JA;  that this was reinforced by the fact that JA knew AP was looking to him on these issues and proceeded to act in a way which he knew that AP would rely upon, as his trusted financial adviser.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr. Hapgood submitted, all of these allegations were in effect part of Springwell’s own case.  Thus it was a necessary corollary of Springwell’s factual case that, during the 10 years or so in which they purchased very large quantities of investments from Chase, the Polemises were guilty of a flagrant disregard for their own interests.  It was Chase’s case, of course (and I have found it to be so), that the Polemises knew very well what they were purchasing and that their portfolio was fully consistent with their true investment objectives.  However, if it were indeed the case that the Polemises accumulated, over several years, a substantial portfolio of hundreds of millions of dollars of emerging markets paper without bothering to understand that the very high returns which they enjoyed were matched by corresponding risks, and without, on their own case, exercising any critical functions in connection with the acquisition of that portfolio, then I agree with Mr. Hapgood that there is scope for a significant reduction for contributory negligence, if that stage in the analysis is ever reached.  In particular, if, contrary to my findings, it were indeed the case that AP allowed himself to act as a rubber stamp, and to exercise no critical faculties in relation to Springwell’s portfolio, then he was grossly negligent, no matter what the disparity between the actual portfolio and his objectives.</p>

In my judgment, if Springwell had succeeded on the way in which it put its claim under Scenario A, I would have regarded 70% as an appropriate deduction, as its culpability on that hypothesis was greater.  If Springwell had succeeded on the way in which it put its claim under Scenario B, I would have regarded 60% as an appropriate deduction.  Likewise, if Springwell had succeeded on its claim that Chase should have advised Springwell to diversify a percentage of its portfolio out of emerging markets, in the period 1996 – 1998, I would also have considered 60% as an appropriate deduction.  On any basis the largest share of responsibility for any losses suffered must fall on Springwell itself.</p>

Mr. Brindle, however, submitted that, even if I were to find that Chase did not assume a general advisory duty towards Springwell, “it [was] clear nonetheless that JA did hold himself out to Springwell as only selecting and recommending investments which were appropriate”.  Thus, he submitted, in those circumstances, and even absent a general duty of care, the necessary implication of JA’s recommending an investment at all was that the investment was appropriate for Springwell.  I do not agree.  Any such duty, even if more limited than the wider investment advisory duty alleged by Springwell as its primary case, fails for the reasons which I have already set out above in relation to the general advisory claim.</p>

Before returning to the Relevant Provisions to explain why, in my judgment, they operate to bar Springwell’s claims in misrepresentation, it is pertinent to identify precisely what Springwell would have to establish to show that the statements made were actionable misrepresentations (whether under the 1967 Act or at common law).

As stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">op cit</span>) (paragraph 6-010), the conventional distinction between statements of fact and statements of opinion does not, by itself, satisfactorily demarcate the line that separates a statement that is actionable from one that is not.

Springwell alleged that these were coupled with an alleged implied representation of fact that JA had reasonable grounds for belief that his statement of opinion or views were true.  Thus, in deciding whether the Relevant Provisions bar any claims for misrepresentation, it is relevant to ask whether their terms are apt to cover expressions of opinion as well as statements of fact.  It is also relevant to consider whether the Relevant Provisions demonstrate that, in the context in which the representations were being made, it was reasonable for the representee to rely on the statements that were being made rather than upon his own judgment.

	      </authorialNote>, the question of what actionable representations, if any, were made by JA, has to be considered by reference to the Relevant Provisions in the DDCS Letters, the MFA (insofar as relevant), the GMRA and the GKO-Linked Notes documentation.  I have already ruled against Springwell’s submissions that the DDCS Letters did not apply to Springwell’s dealings at all, or, alternatively, did not apply to Springwell’s dealings in the GKO-Linked Notes, the VW RUR Note, or in the Ukraine Note (on the grounds that they allegedly did not fall within the definition of “Instruments”).

In my view, the words in context are apt to cover advice given as part of any service contemplated by the letter – which included access to the views of salesmen in emerging markets trading, such as JA.  Likewise, I have already rejected Springwell’s submission that paragraph 6 of the DDCS Letters does not cover any advice actually given.</p>

Having contracted to trade with Chase on those terms, it is not, in my judgment, now open to Springwell to seek to elevate those trading discussions into pre-contractual representations or statements in relation to which it is contended that Chase assumed a duty of care.</p>

I do not have to decide this point in isolation.  It would, in theory, involve an analysis of each and every statement made, to determine whether, in context, it was reasonable to regard it as more than simply a statement of a market view.  But I should perhaps say that the view which I formed, based on the evidence of both JA and AP, was that AP well appreciated that the context in which JA was offering his views and opinions was as a salesman.  It was clear from his answers in cross-examination, and from the transcripts of the telephone calls that AP did not understand JA to be providing an in-depth expert analysis of the economic or political situation in Russia, or the considered views of an investment advisor.  AP appreciated that JA was providing his own day-to-day views, based, in part, on the Chase in-house emerging markets research, and, in part, on his (JA’s) own assessment of the market, gleaned from the financial press and the trading floor.  The transcripts show that AP appreciated at the time that JA was exchanging views with him about often uncertain future events (such as, for example, possible devaluation of the rouble or the likelihood of Russia defaulting on its GKO obligations);  and that, although JA’s views were generally, although not invariably, positive and optimistic about the likely outturn of the Russian economy and the possibility of Russian default, there were more pessimistic views being expressed in the market at the time.  Indeed, a colleague of JA’s at Chase spoke to AP on 26 June 1998, and told him that in his view, there was a 30% chance of Russia defaulting on its financial obligations, but this did not deter AP from buying further Russian investments.  AP himself challenged JA’s views in their conversations, and clearly used JA and the Chase research views which JA was communicating as a sounding board.  But the transcripts show that AP never abrogated his role as the decision maker in relation to which investments were to be made or rolled over.</p>

This evidence ranged far and wide over the macroeconomic landscape of Russia, and the views of erudite economists and market commentators.  Much of the debate as to issues, for example, as to whether the rouble was overvalued or whether the servicing of the debt outstanding in the GKO market was such as to constitute a GKO pyramid, was highly complex and involved detailed consideration of statistical data and publications which were not available at the relevant time.  Thus much of the debate between the experts was based upon hindsight views and analysis.  Both of them were highly intelligent and had an impressive wealth of experience.  Their evidence was extremely interesting and informative, but, at the end of the day, I remain doubtful as to much of its relevance.

Thus  Mr. Kraus’s evidence, in his early reports, was to the effect that, since the “bail out” was not certain, the market generally believed that there was therefore a substantial risk of a major economic disruption, including the risk of a large (“maxi”) devaluation or a sovereign default “at all times after end-October 1997”,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="208">

Many market participants had different perceptions including the perception that Russian default would not happen.  The unanticipated and unprecedented nature of the Russian default was evident from the reports of Ms McLeod-Wilson and Mr. Lopez-Claros, as well as from the fact that Chase itself, and many other financial institution investors, had very substantial holdings of GKOs and other Russian investments at the date of the default.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Chase’s case was that the risk that the rouble would devalue sharply against the dollar, termed in the market a “maxi” devaluation, was considered to be a low risk in 1996, and the same view prevailed until October 1997.  Mr. Kraus and Springwell did not dispute this.  In November and December 1997, the effects of the Asian crisis were felt in Russia as investors lost confidence in emerging markets generally and there was capital outflow from Russia.  As a result, during January 1998, there were rumours in the market of a devaluation, which AP and JA discussed, but the CBR raised its refinancing rates in order to show its determination to defend the rouble, and the rumours proved unfounded.  February to the end of April 1998 saw the market recover and investor confidence return, and the CBR was praised in the market and by the IMF for its steadfast commitment to its policy of defending the rouble by raising interest rates.  As 1998 progressed, during May to the IMF package in July, the risk of a devaluation of the rouble increased, although many, such as Ms McLeod-Wilson, the Chase research analysts, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs considered that such a devaluation was unlikely.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="209">

However, even at that time, a devaluation was by no means considered “inevitable”.  It was only in the last few weeks before default, after the IMF package was perceived to have failed to restore confidence, that there was discussion in the market, as reflected in the Chase published research, about the possibility of default as one of a range of options which the Russian government might consider.  However, AP and JA discussed this possibility in late July and early August 1998, and both took the view, which was reasonable, albeit, with the benefit of hindsight, wrong, that this would not happen.

For example, he accepted that, contrary to his written reports, in January 1998, the view that international support from the IMF or G7 was essential to the survival of Russia was, at its highest, no more than an opinion confined to a minority of market participants, which did not even in fact justify comment in the financial press because it was not sufficiently significant.</p>

These concessions necessarily undermined the picture painted in his reports of an essentially inevitable process towards collapse, with no reflection of the optimism felt by him and others operating in the markets, that Russia’s achievements would not be jeopardised by a failure of Western support.

This contrasts sharply with his opinion, as set out in the joint memorandum with Mr. Lopez-Claros, that by this stage it had become clear that the IMF package had failed and there was a consensus by 23 July 1998 that default or devaluation was inevitable.  </p>

Hindsight interpretation of long term trends may have shown this to be the case, but at the time I conclude that such yield spreads and yields would not have been an indicator to a salesman like JA that his views were wrong.  The experts agreed that there were often short term factors in the market that could cause spreads on such bonds to widen, that were unrelated to the risk of sovereign default or devaluation.  These included fluctuations in risk tolerance, large buy/sell orders, unwinding of spread trades and contagion from events in other markets.  The contemporaneous published views did not support the theory that such yield spreads were at the time clear indicators of sovereign default or devaluation.  Thus, for example, the Chase research article <span style="font-style:italic">Next Week, </span>dated 5 June 1998 reported a tightening of the spread in relation to a 3 June Eurobond;  this had been issued at a premium, so that the spread was about 50bps wider than the spread on the Russia 07 bond, but the spread quickly tightened in after-market trading, so that, two days later, it was trading at a spread to Treasuries 10bps inside the Russia 07 Eurobonds.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as reliance is concerned, if one gets to that stage, it is fair to say that, in a general sense, as Mr. Brindle submitted, AP relied upon JA’s expressed – and frequently positive - views and recommendations about Russia, which no doubt bolstered AP’s desire to take advantage of the substantial returns that were available and his decisions to invest.  But it was clear from the telephone conversations that AP himself was clearly aware of the volatile nature of the Russian market and the risks involved in investing there, and that he was not convinced as to the underlying fundamentals of the Russian economy.  A good example of this is a conversation on 21 July 1998, where AP said to JA “I don’t personally have any faith in Russia”.  AP stated in this conversation that he had built up a position in Prins as a “gamble” in order to take advantage of their volatility and make huge profits when the “life saver” of the IMF package arrived, but that he now realised that gamble had not succeeded and that Russia would require “real improvement<span style="font-style:italic">”</span> in the economy as opposed to the lifesaver of the IMF package.  Thus, as Mr. Hapgood submitted, despite the case advanced to the effect that AP relied on JA’s characterisation of the Russian economy as “good” and not a cause for concern, AP made it clear in this conversation that he had not relied on any assessment to that effect at all, and that he personally had never believed in the fundamentals of Russia but was wishing to make a technical play by effectively buying the rumour and selling the fact.  There are also examples of AP ignoring JA’s recommendations or doing the opposite in some cases, in relation to several of the alleged misrepresentations said to have induced Springwell to buy or to continue to hold investments.  </p>

In other words, submitted Mr. Brindle, AP’s appetite for the GKO-Linked Notes was a product of the way they had been presented to him, and the role AP believed they played in his portfolio as a result (i.e. cash-equivalent instruments), not just the fact that JA had recommended them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first alleged misrepresentation (namely that the hedged GKO-Linked Notes were without currency risk), the contractual position was that the Notes contained a forward foreign currency contract, so that there was in place a rouble/USD hedge and, thus, a contractual protection against rouble devaluation.  The actual thrust of Springwell’s case under this head appeared to be that, in reality, JA represented that AP had absolute protection against any possible rouble devaluation, i.e. that the forwards would in every circumstance convert the rouble maturity of the GKOs into dollars.  My analysis, in their full context, of the particular statements made by JA, which are relied upon by Springwell as constituting the alleged representation, is that they do not amount to the representation pleaded by Springwell.  If one reads through the various telephone conversations between AP and JA, putting the various statements in their context, the clear impression that one is left with is that JA was doing no more than saying that the forward currency hedges, if they paid, removed the risk of currency fluctuations on the GKO-Linked Notes;  in other words, that the currency risks were hedged.  But he was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> promising that, in all circumstances, the hedge contracts would pay out in full, or that the hedge contracts were without any risk whatsoever.  Indeed, in many of the conversations, JA and AP discussed the relative credit quality of the bank counterparties to the hedge contracts, and the fact that the price of a better quality hedge was a lower yield, which demonstrates that AP clearly appreciated that there was counterparty risk in the event of devaluation and that there could not be absolute protection through the use of a forward currency contract in such event.  I accept JA’s evidence that he explained the effect of the forward contracts to AP and the fact that the scale of the risk of devaluation depended upon the quality of the bank providing the forward.  That is entirely consistent with the conversations where such matters were discussed.  Indeed, in cross-examination AP accepted that he appreciated the correlation between risk and yield in relation to the hedge contracts.  </p>

What Springwell alleges is two-fold;  first, that JA referred to the Notes in a certain way;  and second that, in so doing, he, by implication, gave a particular impression as to the structure, risk profile and liquidity of the Notes.  Springwell does not allege that JA made any express representations to such effect.  In his telephone conversations with AP, JA  variously referred to the Notes as:  “short term Russian treasury bills”;  “short dated CDs”, “short dated stuff”, “cash management stuff”;  and “money market stuff” (i.e. short maturities).  Internally within Chase, JA referred to the Notes as “Russian CDs” or “Russian CD stuff”;  and said “GKO is just a generic term for treasury bills”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I do not consider that, in context, JA can be taken as representing to AP that the Notes had all the risk and liquidity characteristics of a time deposit or money market instrument with Chase or another similar Western banking institution, let alone those of a US or UK treasury bond.  He never said so expressly and, in context, I do not think that he can have been taken to have done so by implication.  The relevant context at all times was that JA and AP were operating in an emerging markets environment, not in an investment grade environment, as AP was well aware.  In none of the conversations was JA seeking to explain the characteristics of the Notes.  In using the description which he did, he was, in my view, merely referring to the Notes by way of shorthand identification.  The terms used by JA must be seen in the context of an established trading relationship with AP.  Springwell had purchased its first GKO-Linked Note in early 1996.  By 13 May 1997, the date of the first transcript relied on, it had bought 15 Notes.  Thus the Notes were instruments with which AP was by this stage entirely familiar.  I reject the suggestion that he was unaware of the risks that were attached to the Notes   JA’s evidence, which I accept, was to the effect that he did indeed in general terms explain the outline structure and risks of the Notes to AP.  In any event, the structure and risk characteristics of the Notes were clearly set out in the term sheets.  </p>

So far as the term “cash management” is concerned, again, this cannot amount to a representation as to the risk or security characteristics of the Notes.  I accept Mr. Hapgood’s submission that this was no more than a reference to the use to which Springwell was in fact putting the GKO–Linked Notes in managing its liquidity.  As AP explained in evidence, and as indeed was the case, Springwell had, at least at all relevant times before the default, “tremendous liquidity” in the GKO–Linked Notes.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Likewise, in relation to the third allegation, that JA represented that the GKO–Linked Notes were “conservative and secure investments”, for similar reasons I find that, on a proper analysis of what JA actually said, no such statement in such absolute terms was ever made.  JA certainly considered, and expressed the view that, the Notes were attractive investments for Springwell.  Thus JA certainly believed that, for Springwell, the yield on the GKO–Linked Notes and their short term nature, when balanced against the risk, produced an attractive investment.  However, he never described the Notes as “straightforward”.  Indeed, far from being “conservative and secure”, JA had discussed the risks with AP and AP knew that the Notes carried particular risks.  JA did describe the Notes internally as “conservative” to SG, but this was in the context of a discussion about concentration limits where JA was trying to explain to SG why Springwell had such a large concentration in Russia.  The fact that Springwell  had various Chase hedges was also a factor why JA regarded Springwell’s position as conservative.  In any event, internal Chase conversations cannot form the basis of representations made to Springwell.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, I conclude, on an analysis of what was actually said by JA in the various telephone conversations, that no such express, or unqualified, representations in such terms were made.  The comments set out in Springwell’s schedule under these heads are very selective, and do not convey the full picture of what JA was actually saying.  On a fair reading, the positive comments which JA did make about the various banks and their relative standings, or that the particular investments were “attractive”, were always made in the framework that any Russian bank, however relatively prestigious to its competitors, was subject to the risks attached to the Russian banking system as a whole.  He pointed out that, if there were to be a big devaluation in Russia, there would be serious problems for the Russian banks.  AP, in my view, did not for a moment think, as a result of what JA had told him, that there was no difference between the risks inherent in dealing with Western banks, as compared with the risks inherent in dealing with Russian banks.  He and JA discussed rumours or volatility affecting various banks and, indeed, AP himself raised questions about the possibility of banks failing.  I do not consider that he laboured under the delusion either that the particular Russian banks in question were “secure or conservative” investments in absolute terms, or that they were comparable to investments in a US or western European bank.  I conclude that by 1997 AP was an experienced investor in emerging markets and knew that the systems, structures and institutions of emerging markets countries was not equal to those of emerged or developed countries.  He not only understood the risks inherent in the higher yields of emerging markets generally but was also deliberately seeking distressed corporate debt in Russia.  His investments in Russian Banks followed after Springwell’s attempt to secure significant capital gains through a similar strategy with Indonesian corporate bonds.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The actual factual situation was as follows.  As at 1 January 1998, according to Appendix 12 to Ms Mcleod-Wilson’s first report, Ukraine had a total of $9,553 million outstanding in external debt to non-Ukrainian creditors, which represented 19.3% of Ukraine’s GDP.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Mcleod-Wilson described this $628 million as representing “London Club” or commercial debts, and opined that, for practical purposes, an emerging markets salesman would usually have regard only to London club debt of a country (i.e. commercial debt) rather than to Paris club debt (i.e. multilateral agency debt).  Thus she expressed the view that the figure of $628 million was indeed a “negligible amount” and that, accordingly, viewed in the context of purely commercial debt, JA’s statement was accurate and reasonable.  However, in my view, AP would not have appreciated this fine distinction and thus I conclude that the statement “Ukraine has virtually no foreign debt” was incorrect and could be characterised as a misrepresentation.</p>

I accept Chase’s submission that it was clear from AP’s question to JA as to whether it was a “swap”, that AP did not understand JA’s previous comment to be to the effect that the Ukraine Note was a Eurobond.  In fact, the expert evidence showed that Ukraine did have only one bond outstanding in January 1998.  Although Ms Mcleod-Wilson stated that she agreed with Mr. Kraus that it would be “incorrect to call this an investment in a Eurobond if it was not”, as I do not construe JA’s statement as a representation that the Ukraine investment was in a Eurobond, that point is irrelevant.  He referred to the note as a “bond”, and to that extent the representation was inaccurate as the investment was in fact in a loan note.</p>

The evidence showed that what persuaded him to purchase the Ukraine Note on this occasion, apart from the price and the potential high yield, was JA’s statement that Chase “likes Ukraine”.  That statement was true.  I have no doubt that, had JA recommended this on the basis that Ukraine’s outstanding external London Club/commercial debt was low (and explained what this meant), that Ukraine had other external non-commercial debt, that the Note was a way of taking an interest in a high-yielding Ukrainian debt, and that Chase “liked Ukraine”, AP would likewise have invested in the Note.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore the amount of the investment in the Ukraine Note was the relatively small sum of $5 million.  By January 1998, the evidence showed that AP regarded this sort of sum as loose change, or “bookkeeping”.  AP also confirmed in cross-examination that he was happy to have small amounts invested in higher risk investments, although he purported to limit this to 1.5% to 3% of Springwell’s portfolio.  He had not been put off investing in the first Ukraine structured investment, which Springwell had purchased six months earlier, which was not dollar denominated, and which was highly structured and illiquid.  In relation to this earlier investment, JA had pointed out that the Note “has the capability for you to lose your principal… if there is a maxi devaluation in the Ukraine”.  But AP was sanguine in response, and in agreeing to buy the Note, told JA that the same had applied when Springwell purchased its unhedged GKO-Linked Note at 200%.  Given that the Ukraine Note that AP purchased in January 1998 was much less risky than the first Ukraine investment, and given AP’s admittedly relaxed approach to investments of $5 million or less, I conclude that it is almost inconceivable that AP would not have purchased the Note but for JA’s mentioning it being a “bond”, rather than a note, or but for the statement about external debt</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject this claim.  First, as I have already held there was no fiduciary relationship between Chase and Springwell.  The supposedly excess profits were generated on the sale and purchase of instruments.  By the very nature of the transactions in question, Chase was on one side of the transaction as vendor, and Springwell was on the other as purchaser.  The profitability of the transaction was a matter for each party.  If AP did not like the prices Chase was offering, he could have sought quotes from ML or any other of Chase’s numerous competitors in the market.  The context does not suggest the existence of any fiduciary relationship.</p>

The presentation of evidence and argument was concluded within the indicated time limits.  The written arguments, although perhaps tending on occasions to be overly long, were of invaluable assistance, and I express my gratitude for the assistance which I have received from them.  The use of information technology was highly efficient.  Whilst, with the benefit of hindsight, I consider that it might have been preferable to have tried some key issues as preliminary issues, that is perhaps an easier call to make at the end of a trial, rather than at the beginning.  Finally, and importantly, I should also say that, although this was a hotly contested case, raising difficult, and, at times, unpleasant issues, the clients who participated in the trial process, were unfailingly polite and courteous, not only to the Court, but also to opposing counsel.</p>
