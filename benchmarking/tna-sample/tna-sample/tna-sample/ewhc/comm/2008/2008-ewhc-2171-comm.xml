	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This case concerns an ill-fated collaboration between the parties for the development and manufacture of a new kind of car door latch invented by Jean Pierre Chevalier, the managing director and principal shareholder of the Claimant company (to which I will refer as ALS). ALS is essentially the corporate vehicle Mr Chevalier was then employing for the development of the latch. Mr Joe Toledano was his co-director. He was the financial backer, his background being in the catering industry, but he took little part in the running of the business.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I will refer to the latch which Mr Chevalier invented, as it has been referred to throughout the trial, as “the ULS”, which stands for Universal Latch System. For present purposes, the ULS can be summarised as follows. As the term ULS suggests, the latch is intended to fit into any car door. It is operated by a single motor which is able to perform ‘superlocking’, power closure and power opening, as well as the more usual functions of door latches. In that respect it differs from other latches which perform a wide range of functions such as power closure, but which use more than one motor. It is also much more compact than other premium latches which perform those functions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant (to which I will refer as Honeywell) is (as described in its own hand out prepared in July 2001 for presentation to potential customers for the ULS) a global advanced technology and manufacturing company employing over 120,000 people worldwide with a $25 billion plus annual turnover in 2000. It had experience in the aerospace industry, in sensing and control systems and the automotive industry. For the latter, it produced turbochargers and cooling systems amongst other products, although prior to the collaboration it had no specific experience or expertise in car door latches.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By way of brief overview of the case, the Joint Collaboration Agreement (to which I will refer as “the JCA”) was entered into on 17 May 2001 and terminated by ALS on 11 September 2003 under Article 10.1 for alleged breaches of the agreement by Honeywell. ALS contends that in 28 months of collaboration, the ULS had not advanced beyond the concept development phase and that only 10% of the work necessary for design validation had been completed. This is said to be breach by Honeywell of its obligation under Article 4.5 of the JCA to take all and any reasonable actions without unreasonable delay to manufacture the latch at a competitive cost. ALS makes specific complaints about absence of resources, unauthorised and pointless design changes, excessive time spent on drawing transfer, lack of direction and proper management, development of a rival e-latch to the detriment of the ULS and a number of other matters. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">ALS claims damages by way of lost profits on the basis that if Honeywell had performed its obligations properly, the ULS would have been developed sufficiently to procure nomination from Volkswagen for the new Passat and Jaguar for the new XK during 2003. From that platform, ALS’s forensic accounting expert Mr Mathew-Jones has produced a “loss of a chance” model based on the evidence of ALS’s industry expert Mr Ian Henry, predicting the relative probabilities of ALS capturing substantial shares of the latch market from various motor manufacturers in different parts of the world.  Based on that model as revised by the time of trial, Mr Mathew-Jones assesses loss of profits ranging between £332 million and £457 million. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Honeywell denies that it was in breach of the JCA at all. Its case is that it had no obligation to develop the design prior to the stage of the building of prototypes from soft tools and that any delay before that stage was  attributable in one way or another to Mr Chevalier. More than adequate resources were put in place to develop the ULS, including the employment in due course of a latch expert, Mr Nigel Spurr. Even if there had been delay prior to the first soft tooled build in March 2003 (contrary to Honeywell’s primary case) Honeywell made real and substantial progress with the development of the latch for manufacture between then and September 2003. ALS had seriously underestimated both the difficulties which Mr Chevalier’s design posed and the progress which Honeywell made between March and September 2003. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if Honeywell was in breach, Honeywell contends that ALS’s claim faces insuperable problems both as to causation of loss (because amongst other reasons the Court has to assess the matter on the basis that Honeywell would have been entitled to terminate the contract itself under Article 10.3 of the JCA) and as to whether ALS has suffered any loss at all. The model put forward by Mr Henry and Mr Mathew-Jones is unrealistic and wildly optimistic, given that it was unlikely that Honeywell and ALS would have won the nomination for the Passat or the XK and that the latch market is intensely competitive. The view of that market put forward by Honeywell’s industry expert Mr Brayshaw is to be preferred to that of Mr Henry and, based on Mr Brayshaw’s evidence, Honeywell’s forensic accounting expert, Mr Maher, has put forward a much more realistic quantum model. This shows that even on the basis that the ULS could have achieved a significant share of the market, either it would not have been profitable at all or at best ALS has suffered a modest loss, a few millions of pounds rather than hundreds of millions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first contact between Mr Chevalier and Honeywell was in about September 1999 when Mr Chevalier was looking at Honeywell as a possible supplier of sensors for the ULS. A number of meetings took place between September 1999 and the date of the JCA. Initially Honeywell’s proposed involvement was limited to the sensors and possibly other elements of the electronic sub-assembly. It was at a meeting at Newhouse on 13 January 2000 that Dr Frank Turnbull of Honeywell first voiced the offer that Honeywell might make the whole latch. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> A non-disclosure agreement relating to Mr Chevalier’s intellectual property in the latch was signed by Honeywell on 18 May 2000 and on 25 May 2000, Mr Chevalier sent Honeywell two Zip disks consisting of 71 files of drawings. It appears from a note of a meeting on 20 June 2000 that Honeywell was unable to open the files. This was because Mr Chevalier’s drawings were created in one software package, Auto CAD, whereas Honeywell used Pro Engineer or Pro E, a different software package. The two were incompatible and there is apparently no software available to convert from one to the other, although Honeywell took no steps to investigate that until after the JCA was signed. Equally they did not ask for hard copies of the drawings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further meeting took place at Newhouse on 24 July 2000. Honeywell’s case is that at this meeting Mr Alan Wright of Honeywell informed Mr Chevalier that the ULS was more mechanically complex than anything previously produced at Newhouse. This was denied by Mr Chevalier in his evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further meetings then took place in September and November 2000 at the latter of which Mr Chevalier handed a CD of drawings to Mr Shelley a mechanical design engineer at Honeywell. There was then a period between February and May 2001 during which drafts of what became the JCA were negotiated before a meeting on 17 May 2001 at which the JCA was finalised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 6 July 2001 Mr Tom Cummings, the then project manager circulated an e-mail internally within Honeywell referring to the difficulty which Mr Shelley had had in transferring the data concerning the drawings from Auto CAD to Pro E and saying that what was proposed is that Mr Shelley should re-draw the drawings on Pro E “from the bottom up” in frequent consultation with Mr Chevalier. This drawing transfer was estimated to take nine months to one man year of work to carry out. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the six months or so after the JCA was entered, Honeywell held a number of meetings with OEMs to promote the ULS.  Thus, on 9 July 2001, Honeywell had its first meeting about the ULS with Volkswagen. In August 2001, invitations were sent to a number of vehicle OEMs (including Nissan UK, BMW, Mercedes, Renault, PSA and Volkswagen) to view the latch at the Frankfurt motor show in September 2001. Before that show, meetings were also held with Jaguar and BMW.  At the show various OEMs attended Honeywell’s stand including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Starting on 11 October 2001, Honeywell had a series of meetings with MG Rover about the possible use of the ULS in their new RDX60 model, the projected replacement for the Rover 45. These culminated in a visit by MGR engineers to Newhouse on 11 and 12 February 2002 and, on 19 February 2002, Honeywell received a letter of nomination to supply the ULS to MG Rover for the RDX60. In the event, although a number of meetings took place between Honeywell and other OEMs in the period from late 2001 onwards, this was the only nomination from an OEM received during the course of the collaboration. The reasons for this are the subject of a major dispute between the parties.</p>

However, before that was achieved, from March 2002 onwards until at least December 2002, a number of changes in the design of the ULS were made, some to improve manufacturability, others in response to actual or perceived requirements of OEMs. These changes were essentially made or directed by Mr Chevalier. It is in issue between the parties whether the fact that Mr Chevalier had to take the lead in this respect is a matter attributable to breach of the JCA by Honeywell. It is also in issue to what extent the design changes caused delay to the project and whether that delay in turn is attributable to breach of the JCA by Honeywell.</p>

At the same time, in late January 2003, MG Rover suspended the RDX 60 project and asked Honeywell instead to supply the ULS for the existing Rover 25 and 45 models, although no formal letter of nomination was in fact signed before ALS terminated the JCA.</p>

The cause of these problems is in issue between the parties, ALS blaming it on the failure of Honeywell to progress the project properly and on unauthorised changes to the design by Honeywell. In contrast, Honeywell contends that the problems were all attributable to Mr Chevalier’s design and specifically to the fact that whilst it was a good design for hand built prototypes which could be manually tweaked to operate correctly, it was very difficult to translate into a reliable repeatable design for manufacturing purposes.</p>

These were presented to Mr Chevalier on his return to the project on 11 and 12 June 2003 (on the basis that under the JCA, all design changes had to be approved by ALS): some found favour, others did not. </p>

ALS contends that it was frustration at the absence of progress that led Mr Chevalier eventually to serve notice of termination on 11 September 2003, which notice was fully justified on the basis that there were continuing or extant breaches of the JCA by Honeywell.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In contrast, Honeywell contends that during the period between the failed soft tooled build and the termination of the JCA, it made real progress in the development towards manufacturability of the ULS. This included development work on the so-called Rev D design, a smaller version of the latch originally designed to meet the demands of MG Rover for fitting the ULS into its existing models. From July 2003, it was agreed between the parties that the smaller latch should be the mainstream product. Accordingly, Honeywell contends that whatever the position may have been at the time of the failed build, at the time of the notice of termination there was no extant breach of the JCA which would have justified termination. Honeywell’s case is that the real reason for the termination was that there had been a breakdown of the relationship between Mr Chevalier and the Honeywell project management, a matter which was not attributable to any breach of the JCA by Honeywell. Accordingly, the purported termination by ALS was wrongful.</p>

This was agreed between the mechanical latch experts (although there was a slight disagreement as to precisely where it was in the concept stage). Although Mr Chevalier vacillated in his evidence as to how much work was required to be done on the design at the time that the JCA was entered to make it ready for the soft tooled prototype build, he did agree quite clearly that, as at that time, the ULS needed considerable design work to resolve a lot of issues before soft tools could be commissioned.  This was also the view of the mechanical latch experts. This is all of course wholly inconsistent with the latch being “essentially complete”, which was not a case pursued at trial. </p>

However, that case was not supported by the evidence of either Mr Spurr or of Honeywell’s mechanical latch expert, Mr Stephen Drysdale who agreed that although the design posed challenges, the ULS would have been manufacturable. Again, that case (at least in its most extreme form) was not pursued at trial.</p>

He had prepared himself to give that evidence to an extent that was unparalleled in my experience. This included a 370 page witness statement which went way beyond the actual evidence he could give. It is literally littered with inadmissible material. In particular, Mr Chevalier seems to have read all the internal documents from Honeywell, many of which are set out in his statement with his opinions about them then expressed, usually in a manner designed to support his “world view” of the relationship between ALS and Honeywell. The indefatigability of his determination to defend his invention and to get across to the Court and to Honeywell his version of the collaboration and why it went wrong was impressive. No incident in the history of the relationship was too minor but that it would be analysed by Mr Chevalier, usually in a manner which was critical of Honeywell.</p>

However, on many occasions he seemed to me to be completely lacking in objectivity. This manifested itself most obviously in his complete inability to accept anything in anyone else’s evidence or in contemporaneous documentation which was in any way inconvenient to his version of the collaboration or the evidence he was determined to give. Three examples will suffice from the documents, some of which I will need to consider more closely later in relation to the issue whether Mr Chevalier misled Honeywell and indeed OEMs before and at the outset of the collaboration as to the stage of development which the ULS had reached.</p>

On occasion, the determination of Mr Chevalier that he had not said things attributed to him by Mr Cummings’ notes extended to purporting to have total recall of what had been said at meetings which took place 8 or 9 years ago. I found this incredible. I have no doubt that Mr Cummings’ notes of meetings are accurate and that the statements attributed to Mr Chevalier were made by him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, there is the ALS business plan prepared by Mr Chevalier. Extracts of this were provided to Honeywell in June 2000 before the JCA and the full version, now described as the “ALS-Honeywell Business Plan” was sent to a number of members of Honeywell management in June 2001.  In each case, what was provided included passages which made representations about the ULS being in an advanced stage of development which were simply not true. Mr Chevalier’s explanation was that these were in some way a future projection of what the position would be a few years later if and when he needed to raise finance. He insisted that the extracts and the full Plan were only provided to Honeywell for the market information contained in them and that he said to Honeywell on numerous occasions that they should not rely on the statements about the stage the ULS was at which were not intended to be taken seriously. I deal with this matter more fully later in this judgment but for the present it suffices to say that none of that explanation is reflected in the contemporaneous correspondence or meeting notes. It is frankly incredible. I should add for good measure that it was never put to any of the relevant Honeywell witnesses that Mr Chevalier had told them that they could not rely upon the information in the business plan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, there are the presentations to the various OEMs at the outset of the collaboration which made statements about the advanced stage of development of the ULS very similar to those contained in the Business Plan. Mr Chevalier had a hand in the preparation of these documents, which were a collaborative effort, as one might expect, and he was clearly the source of the statements about the stage of development which the ULS had reached. Confronted with the statements made, which were clearly inaccurate and misleading, he maintained that his only involvement had been in providing pictures and that he had not read the text, since had he done so he would not have permitted the presentations to go out containing such inaccuracies. Again, I found this explanation incredible. It is inconceivable, given that the ULS was his invention and the presentation was marketing the product to major OEMs, that he did not read the text and approve it, even if he was not responsible for writing it. Furthermore, one of the pictures, for which he was even on his own case responsible, contained highly misleading text.  In any event, whether he wrote the text of the presentations or not, that text was clearly based upon the statements in the Business Plan, which he did write.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Such matters as these examples reflect badly on Mr Chevalier’s credibility. Inevitably, I have asked myself whether he was deliberately lying in his evidence. Ultimately, I have concluded that, whilst there were occasions when Mr Chevalier knew that what he was saying was not true (for example his unedifying evidence that the letters to car manufacturers in June 2001 had in fact been written by Mr Kettle), the overall explanation is less sinister. He has obviously lived and breathed the ULS for more than ten years and, like many people in such situations, has come to believe his own version of events. He has convinced himself that there is nothing wrong with the ULS or its design and that all the problems with the collaboration were the fault of Honeywell. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The reality is that whilst Honeywell was at fault to some extent as I shall come on to consider, Mr Chevalier’s version of events is skewed and Honeywell is simply not the demon Mr Chevalier makes it out to be. That is not to say that he has not convinced himself of his “world view”. I was left with the overwhelming impression that there was a strong element of the “Walter Mitty” about Mr Chevalier, in the sense that when it comes to the ULS and what he sees as the invincibility of his design, there is something of the fantasist about him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This may be the explanation for the misleading statements in the Business Plan and the presentations to OEMs. It is not so much a question of deliberately misleading the OEMs or Honeywell. Rather, Mr Chevalier had a wholly unrealistic view of the ULS and had convinced himself that the ULS was at a more advanced stage of development than it actually was or at least, he seems to have seriously underestimated how much design work was required to bring the ULS to successful soft-tooled prototypes. The extent to which Mr Chevalier would brook no criticism of the ULS may be the explanation for the extraordinary and unwarranted attack launched by Mr Chevalier in his evidence on the two Honeywell employees who did have latch expertise, Mr Spurr and Mr Kilker, a matter to which I will return later in the judgment.</p>

This is less a criticism of his veracity than a demonstration of the extent to which witness statements can be partisan and misrepresent what a witness’s evidence really is.

However some caution is required in relation to accepting Mr Kettle’s evidence uncritically, essentially for two reasons. First, he is obviously a salesman by profession with an optimistic view of the prospects of successfully promoting the ULS, a “glass half full” man, as he accepted or as Mr McQuater put it “ever the salesman”. Accordingly, he inevitably put a positive spin on events both in his oral evidence and, perhaps more importantly, in his contemporaneous assessments of meetings with OEMs.</p>

There was justification in that perception since for example he did send a full unexpurgated copy of an internal Honeywell e-mail about personal insults to Mr Chevalier, which really suggests that the view that he was Mr Chevalier’s man was justified. He also retained a disk with a great deal of Honeywell documentation and confidential information on it and handed it over to Mr Chevalier.  Despite his genuine regret about this, it must tell against him. Furthermore, although in his oral evidence he was essentially truthful, the fact that he was prepared to sign a witness statement which bore so little relation to the evidence he could really give also tells against him. Having said all of that, I do not consider that it is a question of not accepting his evidence, so much as recognising that it has a tendency (perhaps unconsciously) to be slanted in Mr Chevalier’s favour.</p>

He had been head of marketing and sales for the ULS project in Freeport. In his witness statement he was highly critical of Honeywell’s performance of the JCA, particularly on the issue of lack of resources, a matter with which he had been concerned. It is no exaggeration to describe that as something of a diatribe against Honeywell. However what emerged in cross-examination was a much more reasonable and measured analysis, which recognised that at many stages the project was well-resourced and that the real problem was one of attracting latch experts to join Honeywell from other established latch manufacturers. Mr Bur accepted that Honeywell had had real problems in attracting such experts, apart from Mr Spurr.  I formed the view that he was an essentially honest witness who gave way on extreme positions in his witness statement when challenged in cross-examination.</p>

In Mr Alder’s case he now acts as a consultant to Mr Chevalier’s successor company VSS. They both appeared fair and straightforward witnesses trying to do their best to assist the Court albeit with the inevitable limitation of being asked to recollect events which occurred between five and seven years ago. One area where I was not particularly impressed with Mr Alder’s evidence concerned the MG Rover specification or rather the absence of it, where I felt he was somewhat defensive, but that may have been out of an understandable loyalty towards his former employer. </p>

Delphi (now Inteva) is one of the principal latch manufacturers in the world, after the two main players, Kiekert and Arvin Meritor.

He was a frank and straightforward witness but to the extent that ALS relied upon his evidence in support of its case as to the costs of manufacture and the likely sale price the limitations of his evidence must be recognised. Specifically, there is no evidence as to the price which any OEM would be prepared to pay for the ULS as manufactured under licence by Inteva and, of course, Inteva has yet to manufacture the ULS at all.</p>

First, just as Mr Kettle and Mr Bur tended in their respective witness statements, to support ALS’s case and Mr Chevalier’s evidence, in a somewhat indiscriminatory manner not borne out by their oral evidence, so a number of the Honeywell witnesses in their statements towed a “party line” of being misled by Mr Chevalier’s alleged misstatements. In truth, with the exception of Mr Shelley, Mr Mitchell, Mr Cummings and, to an extent, Mr Hayes, they could not give any direct evidence of the course of the project being affected by any misstatement by Mr Chevalier as to the state of the design.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, I agree with Mr Douglas that there was a tendency towards what he described as “collective amnesia” concerning the impact of the parallel work on the Valeo project at Newhouse and the extent to which it diverted resources away from the ULS project. However, I would not regard that as anything sinister, just a manifestation of a natural human tendency to downplay the impact of something, in circumstances where you have been under criticism, as Honeywell undoubtedly was from Mr Chevalier. As I will develop in more detail when I deal with the whole Resources issue, I do think that at various times during the life of this project, personnel (and in particular Mr Shelley) were pulled off the ULS project, in effect to fire fight on Valeo. However, whilst Honeywell and its witnesses may have downplayed the impact of this, ALS has undoubtedly overstated its impact. I do not consider that it can be regarded as a general malaise throughout the project.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, on a related point, I found the evidence of Mr Hayes about complaints he had made contemporaneously concerning restrictions on resources caused by the involvement of Honeywell engineers, particularly Mr Shelley, in other projects, specifically the Valeo project, unconvincing. He seemed unable to face up to the reality of what he was clearly saying at the time, in a manner which made that part of his evidence seem somewhat evasive. Again there may be nothing sinister in that. He was removed from the project in July 2003 and replaced with Mr Kilker (whom he clearly did not particularly like and who had a very different management style) rather unceremoniously, at a time when the project and Mr Hayes himself were under a lot of pressure. It may be that Mr Hayes has sought to forget what cannot have been a very happy period in his professional life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a general observation about the Honeywell witnesses, inevitably many of them could not recall the detail of events save to the extent they were assisted by contemporaneous documentation. This is scarcely surprising, since the best part of five years has passed since the most recent events under the JCA. In the circumstances, in assessing the course of the project, I have often been more assisted by what appears from the documents than by what is inevitably a somewhat fractured recollection.</p>

This is relevant to both parties’ cases. ALS maintained, albeit in a somewhat muted fashion at the end of the trial, an alternative case of misrepresentation by Honeywell. Honeywell contends that it was misled by Mr Chevalier during the various meetings as to the status of the design of the latch. Honeywell contends that what emerges throughout the history of this matter, from before the first contact between the parties until the present day, is a pattern of Mr Chevalier making misleading statements about the status of the ULS and “talking it up”. I have already indicated in my overall assessment of Mr Chevalier as a witness that, as a general proposition, that seems to me to be correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Prior to his first contact with Honeywell, Mr Chevalier had approached several latch manufacturers with a view to negotiating a royalty agreement in relation to the ULS. In the event, no-one offered terms which were acceptable to him. In his discussions, he exaggerated the status of the ULS. By way of example, in a letter to Mannesmann on 7 September 1998 Mr Chevalier described the ULS as “developed to an advanced stage”. When asked about this in cross-examination, Mr Chevalier tried to say that this letter was not about the ULS but some other invention of his, but when I pointed out that a subsequent letter had described this as the “one motor all function” latch, he accepted this must be the ULS.  </p>

In his oral evidence he had maintained that he did not create the concept of the ULS until 1997 and was unable to explain the discrepancy or to what the half a million pounds related.  Confronted with the fact that the letter contained untrue exaggerations about the ULS, Mr Chevalier sought to blame the contents of the letter on Professor Harper, who then worked with him. This was the first example of what became something of an unedifying theme in his evidence of blaming others for the contents of documents sent out under his name.</p>

Mr Cummings prepared typed notes of all such meetings. These were prepared immediately after the relevant meeting from manuscript notes and were circulated to attendees within Honeywell for comment where appropriate. I have already referred to the fact that, whenever the notes contained some statement ascribed to ALS which is inconvenient to its current case or a misstatement by Mr Chevalier, he sought in his evidence to say that this was not said by him and that Mr Cummings was in some way “talking up” the proposal for internal Honeywell discussion purposes. </p>

This was certainly true to an extent of Mr Kettle’s written witness statement, but as I have already said, that bore little relation to the actual evidence he could give. In his oral evidence, Mr Kettle candidly accepted that without reading Mr Cummings’ notes of the meetings, he could not recollect what had been said at the meetings and that the set up of particular meetings meant that he would not always have heard what had been said anyway. Having seen Mr Cummings in the witness box, I am quite satisfied that his notes accurately reflect what was said at the meetings. He was a careful and professional man and would have had no reason to make up what he recorded in the minutes. Where the note included internal discussions within Honeywell either before or after the meeting with ALS, the note made that clear (as in the Summary on the third page of the note of the 19 October 1999 meeting).</p>

In his oral evidence, Mr Chevalier accepted that he might have mentioned Lander Automotive but he would never have said the mechanical sub-assembly was fully tooled. Lander Automotive was a company in Birmingham with whom Mr Chevalier had had some negotiations at an earlier stage to manufacture the latch on a production line, but from the documents it is clear those negotiations broke down as the parties were unable to agree terms. </p>

His excuse was that he thought they would have entered an agreement whenever he wanted one but that is unconvincing and not supported by any document. At several stages of his evidence he went so far as to say that he did have an agreement with Lander. Ultimately none of the misstatements about Lander matter because ALS contracted with Honeywell, not with Lander, but it is another example of unsatisfactory and unreliable evidence from Mr Chevalier</p>

He did candidly admit that this would not have registered much with him, because at that stage he was focused on the control electronics, which was what Mr Chevalier had come to see Honeywell about. That Mr Cummings was not confused and had not misunderstood what Mr Chevalier told him, is evident from the fact that in his Summary he refers to the mechanical development being well advanced and to manufacturing resources being in place already.</p>

As Mr McQuater accepted this is perhaps not the most egregious of the misstatements made by Mr Chevalier, although it would undoubtedly have contributed to the impression that the design of the mechanical portion of the latch was well advanced.  As I have said in discussing the general impression Mr Chevalier created as a witness, it may well be that he genuinely believed that the design (which of course he had been perfecting over a number of years) was such that little or no additional design work was required to put it in production. </p>

He claimed that Dr Turnbull had engaged in a “hard sell” about Honeywell being a global advanced technology company with sufficient involvement and understanding of the automotive industry to undertake the development and assembly of the ULS.  This formed a main plank in ALS’ pleaded case of misrepresentation. The full panoply of what Dr Turnbull is alleged to have said at this meeting is set out at Issue 33(1) of the Agreed List of Issues. Although Mr Chevalier maintained in his evidence that this had all been said by Dr Turnbull, it seems to me highly unlikely that it was or that even if anything was said about Honeywell’s capabilities, it was as detailed and specific as Mr Chevalier contends. </p>

He said that he had not heard Dr Turnbull make any offer that Honeywell might manufacture the entire latch and had not taken part in any prior discussion. He accepted that there were a lot of good reasons why ALS would want to work with Honeywell.

He also did not recall representing at the meeting that Honeywell had the necessary understanding of the industry to undertake the development, but he pointed out that Honeywell did have experience of providing sensors to the automotive industry but they had no experience at Sensing and Control with dynamic assemblies.

It is quite clear from Mr Cummings’ note of the meeting (and in particular the six references to Honeywell as a “manufacturing partner”) that there were serious discussions about Honeywell manufacturing the entire latch and that Mr Chevalier expressed enthusiasm for this proposal. Mr Chevalier’s protestations to the contrary in his evidence, that there had been no such discussions before the subsequent meeting of 24 July 2000 and that the note was an internal Honeywell document, were distinctly argumentative.

It is also clear from Mr Cummings’ note of the meeting on 20 June 2000, that ALS was told that Honeywell had so far been unable to open the drawings.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross-examination of Mr Cummings, Mr Douglas taxed him as to why the words “final design” were in inverted commas, suggesting to him that this meant “so-called final design”, with an appreciation on his part that there might be some further design work to do. Mr Cummings was having none of this and was adamant that the words were in inverted commas because they were the actual words used by Mr Chevalier. I accept that evidence and, in any event, Mr Chevalier essentially accepted that he had described it as the final design at the meeting. He tried to put a gloss on this that he meant at the end of the concept stage, but this is simply not borne out by the remainder of the passage I have quoted. Mr Kettle’s evidence both in his witness statement and at trial was that he recollected Mr Chevalier saying at this meeting that the design of the mechanical part of the latch was ready.</p>

He denied that the impression created was of formal testing and of an advanced stage of development and again suggested that what Mr Cummings had noted bore no resemblance to the truth or reality and that he must have been muddled. I do not accept that Mr Cummings was muddled and consider that he noted down accurately what had been said. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What he records Mr Chevalier as saying about the state of the design did amount to a statement that the formal testing was underway and that the design of the mechanical portion of the latch was in an advanced state of development, essentially completing design validation before moving to the product development phase. Of course, faced with the reality now of where the design of the latch actually was in terms of development, Mr Chevalier no doubt has to accept that what was said bore no relation to that reality, but that he said it I have no doubt. Furthermore, this became something of a theme of Mr Chevalier’s.</p>

Mr Chevalier initially accepted in cross-examination that he had said that he had made further visits to car manufacturers, though he later denied this, saying that what he had said earlier had been a “pulse” (which I took to mean a momentary aberration) said without proper thought. I consider that he did say that he had had further such meetings, another instance of him “talking up” the latch. </p>

That was followed up by a presentation to Mr Wild and others to enable a decision to be made as to whether to support the proposal or not.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Douglas sought to rely upon this document as showing that Honeywell’s motivation was purely financial and that it had not relied upon any of Mr Chevalier’s statements about the state of the design in making its decision to assume responsibility for the entire latch.  In fact, this document seems to me to support the opposite conclusion, that reliance was placed on Mr Chevalier’s statements. It contains a number of matters clearly derived from what he had said at the meeting on 20 June 2000. Thus, under Background it says “June 2000-ALS present “final” mechanical design. Request Honeywell commitment”. In relation to potential customers it says “ALS has shown prototypes to (at least) six car manufacturers-PSA, Renault, VW Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Ford” and under next actions it says “Production is 18 to 30 months away. Investment would be in 2001 and possibly 2002”. All this is entirely consistent with the statements which Mr Chevalier had made at the meeting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The note of the 20 June 2000 meeting also refers to ALS having prepared a comprehensive business plan which it would be happy to share with Honeywell if Honeywell decided to become its manufacturing partner. Mr Cummings evidently wanted to see the business plan for the purposes of his presentation to management, as Mr Chevalier accepted at one point in his evidence, although he later resiled from this and said that all that Mr Cummings wanted was market information.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chevalier was reluctant to hand over the whole business plan at this stage. He claimed that this was because it was an internal ALS document and was not to be relied upon and that he had told Mr Cummings and Mr Kettle this, an allegation he repeated several times. This was one of the points in his evidence where I did feel Mr Chevalier was lying and knew it. This allegation was made up as one of the explanations for the extraordinary inaccuracies in the business plan, the other being that the whole document was only referable to the future, in the event that he required finance, an equally fanciful explanation.  It is striking that it was never put to Mr Cummings in cross-examination that Mr Chevalier had said that the business plan should not be relied upon, although that was something he had expressly denied in his second witness statement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The closest Mr Kettle came ostensibly to supporting Mr Chevalier’s position on this was in his witness statement, where he said he had assured Mr Chevalier more than once that Honeywell would not rely upon the business plan. It became apparent in cross-examination that that was not really his evidence and even if it had been, I would not have accepted it. It is wholly inconsistent with what he said in his e-mail to Mr Cummings of 22 September 2000 about ALS sharing the business plan with Honeywell  because it would go a long way towards building trust and helping convince Honeywell that it was a project worth pursuing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his oral evidence, Mr Kettle said he had thought the business plan would be a great help to Mr Cummings in preparing internal reports but that Honeywell would not be relying solely on ALS’ business plan in making its own commercial decision, although as the salesman he would not have been party to the internal workings of those in Honeywell making that decision. He avoided answering the question whether he had in fact given Mr Chevalier the assurance Honeywell would not rely on the business plan. When pressed by Mr McQuater he said, rather unconvincingly, that he could not remember exactly whether he had definitely said that Honeywell would not use the business plan and that he could not remember saying that to Mr Chevalier in black and white. I consider that this is one of those instances where in his oral evidence Mr Kettle, an essentially truthful witness, could not support what had been written on the page of the witness statement ostensibly in his name. I find that Mr Chevalier did not tell anyone at Honeywell that they could not rely on the ALS business plan and that Mr Kettle did not give Mr Chevalier any assurance that they would not rely on it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to why Mr Chevalier was reluctant in the period before the JCA was signed to hand over the business plan, this may be one aspect of his jealous guarding of his own intellectual property and confidential information, a trait which emerged time and again over the course of the relationship between the parties. Whatever the explanation, all that he provided in the aftermath of the 20 June 2000 meeting was an extract from the plan which he sent as an attachment to an e-mail to Mr Cummings headed “Latch Information” on 4 July 2000. </p>

In a section headed “The Business” is another statement that “The inventions embodied in the patents have been translated into prototypes developed to a level suitable for mass production”. All these statements are in line with what he had said at the 20 June 2000 meeting, giving the impression that the ULS was at the end of the design validation phase and about to enter the product development phase. </p>

As I have already indicated, that explanation is incredible and I reject it. It is not necessary to decide whether Mr Chevalier consciously and deliberately sent Honeywell a document which was misleading. It may be that the real explanation, as I have said, is less sinister and that the contents of the document demonstrate the fantasist in Mr Chevalier, the stage of development he would like to think the latch had reached. Whatever the real explanation for the document though, the truth is that the statements were misleading.</p>

No FMEA identifiable as having been in existence at that time has been disclosed by ALS.

In fact it seems to me wholly inconsistent with Mr Cummings’ internal e-mail of 6 July 2001 which refers to doing a gap analysis for which Honeywell should ask Mr Chevalier for the analysis, FMEA and quality audit checking which he had already carried out. This suggests both that Mr Cummings believed what Honeywell was told at the meeting on 24 July 2000 about FMEAs and other analyses having been carried out and that he wanted the FMEA and other documents,  although in the event there is no evidence that he asked Mr Chevalier for these documents.</p>

It is clear that this was a substantial exaggeration and that (despite his denial in his evidence) Mr Chevalier was talking up the business plan for Mr Wright’s benefit. As Mr Chevalier had to accept, PWC (to whom he paid £10,000) had proceeded on the assumption that the information provided to them by ALS was accurate and had only modelled financial projections, not challenged the reasonableness of the assumptions made in the plan. He accepted that Ernst &amp; Young had only been involved informally and at most had looked at the figures in the business plan, scarcely an audit. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two other aspects of the meeting on 24 July 2000 relevant to the issues in the case. First, Mr Cummings’ note records Mr Wright saying that Honeywell has a strong track record with vehicle OEMs but that “This product is, however, more mechanically complex to manufacture than anything made currently at Newhouse”. In both his witness statement and his oral evidence, Mr Chevalier devoted considerable energy to denying that this had ever been said by Mr Wright, presumably because it was a statement which ran flatly counter to much of ALS’ misrepresentation case. However, I am in no doubt that Mr Wright did say this, not just because there is no reason to suppose Mr Cummings’ note was inaccurate. Mr Cummings himself said in evidence that this was an instance where he had a good recollection of this being said and that it indicated a note of caution, that Mr Wright had some concerns. Mr Kettle accepted without demur in cross-examination that Mr Wright had said this and Dr Turnbull said he recalled something along those lines being said. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second matter concerns the allegation pleaded by ALS and maintained in Mr Chevalier’s witness statement that, at this meeting, agreement was reached that, in the event that Honeywell did agree to manufacture the latch, Honeywell’s profit share from any collaboration would be a 15% mark up on its costs. This was denied by all the Honeywell witnesses who attended and was not reflected in the note of the meeting. Mr Kettle maintained in evidence that there had been a “quick fire exchange” between Mr Wright and Mr Chevalier in which Mr Wright said we need to get our money back, Mr Chevalier said would you be happy with 15% and Mr Wright said yes they would. Mr Kettle accepted that there was no legally binding agreement, but was insistent that a short discussion had taken place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his oral evidence Mr Chevalier was constrained to accept that there had been no binding agreement at the meeting. He accepted that the note of a subsequent meeting on 29 November 2000 shows him recognising that nothing had yet been agreed about profit share. His explanation was that things had now moved on from the 24 July meeting and that the subsequent meeting demonstrated that Honeywell was going to put forward monies to develop the project including investment in tooling and a production line. He then accepted that for practical purposes we could “put aside” what he had said was agreed at the meeting on 24 July 2000. This evidence was all rather incoherent, but what is clear in my judgment is that nothing was agreed about profit share at the meeting on 24 July. I have considerable doubts whether it was even discussed, since it would have been of sufficient significance that Mr Cummings would have noted it. I agree with Mr McQuater’s submission that, in the light of the evidence, ALS’ case on an agreement as to profit share wholly collapsed.</p>

A further meeting between the parties was held on 29 November 2000, at which Mr Chevalier handed over a CD of the latest component and sub-assembly drawings. No further statement was apparently made by Mr Chevalier about the status of the design at either of these meetings, but equally nothing was said to disabuse Honeywell of the impression previously created.  That meeting on 29 November 2000 was in fact the last formal meeting between the parties before the meeting on 17 May 2001 at which the JCA was signed. In the intervening period, negotiations took place at a rather desultory pace about the terms of what became the JCA.</p>

That this is the case is obvious from a comparison between the two documents. Although the document prepared by Mr Cummings does not mention expressly that the design of the ULS was essentially at the design validation stage, it seems to me that the timescale contemplated by the document is predicated on that assumption. Thus, the Resource Requirements refer to the development and pre-production time scale being estimated at 18 months and the Project Time Line contemplates design transfer until the end of Q3/2001, with contract negotiation with selected OEMs starting in that period and running into the fourth quarter and then immediately after that, development of production tools and automation. In other words, this Plan did not contemplate Honeywell having to do any design work prior to process and product development. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Looking at the position as it stood as at the date of the signing of the JCA, it seems to me clear that Mr Chevalier had exaggerated the status of the design and made statements to Honeywell about it which conveyed that it was at an advanced stage of development, effectively at the design verification stage. Furthermore, as I set out at a slightly later point in this judgment, this pattern of exaggeration and misstatement by Mr Chevalier continued after the JCA was signed, particularly in the materials sent out to OEMs.  In truth (as the experts now agree and Mr Chevalier was constrained to accept in evidence) the design was still at the concept development stage, requiring considerable work before it was even ready for a soft tooled prototype build. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question which then arises is whether Honeywell was in any sense misled by those misstatements at the time when it entered the JCA. I agree with Mr McQuater that it is quite obvious, both from the contemporaneous documents and the evidence of the relevant Honeywell witnesses, that Honeywell believed what it was told by Mr Chevalier about the state of the design. I have already referred to the contents of the power point presentation prepared by Mr Cummings after the 20 June 2000 meeting, the assumptions made in the Honeywell Business Plan and the unchallenged evidence of Mr Cummings, all of which support that belief. There is also the evidence of Mr Mitchell about what he understood concerning the status of the design from his discussions with Mr Wright and Mr Cummings. Although those discussions may have post-dated the signing of the JCA, they reflected what Honeywell understood at the time the JCA was entered. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That Mr Mitchell had that belief at the time the JCA was entered or immediately thereafter is borne out by the terms of his Inter-office Correspondence headed “ALS assumptions and resource allocation” dated 20 June 2001 sent to Mr Sosnowski. Under “Assumptions” the second bullet point was “Design is manufacturable as it is today”. The timeline set out then assumed that in June 2001 “the design is locked and in place for a production and manufacturing Plan”, in July 2001 a team is assigned “to develop manufacturing approach, process, equipment and design validation” and in December 2001 “finalise design, manufacturing process, Equipment and design validation”. That aggressive timeline is clearly predicated on the design being at an advanced stage and not requiring a substantial amount of further work before design validation, or, putting it another way, as a forward plan it would be completely nonsensical if Honeywell had appreciated that a considerable amount of further design work was required before design validation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To those matters can be added the evidence of Mr Kettle that Honeywell did not expect the design of the mechanical assembly to require a lot of change at the time of the JCA and of Mr Shelley that Honeywell was presented with a latch that was pretty well advanced and it was promoted that way as well. That Mr Shelley for one had believed initially that the design was “complete” is borne out interestingly by the terms of an e-mail which he sent to Mr Dan Kilker, the then project manager, on 11 September 2003 (the very day Mr Chevalier sent his termination letter, although Mr Shelley’s e-mail was sent before): “The method JP is using to develop this latch is absolutely ludicrous considering the timescales we are expected to meet with this so-called completed design”. Although Mr Shelley did realise at a fairly early stage of the actual performance of the JCA that the design was not as far advanced as Mr Chevalier was representing (a matter to which I return below), that e-mail gives the lie to the suggestion that the belief by Honeywell at the time of the JCA that the design was far advanced is some after the event invention for the purposes of this litigation, which seemed to be what Mr Douglas was suggesting. </p>

He points out that Honeywell made no real attempt to find a way of opening the drawings before it entered the JCA, nor did anyone ask Mr Chevalier for hard copy drawings or for his FMEAs or test results. In effect Honeywell did no due diligence before entering the JCA, whereas pressing further on those matters would have revealed the real state of the design. </p>

Apart from being a prophetic perception of the design problems in fact encountered later in the development from one person within Honeywell who did have some latch experience, he points out that this demonstrates what could and should have been ascertained about the real state of the design with some due diligence. That may well be right but the issue here is not whether any reliance was reasonable (as it might be in a case of misrepresentation) but whether in fact there was any reliance at all. The absence of due diligence does not prove that there was no reliance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Douglas counters that by submitting that the fact that no due diligence was done on the design demonstrates that Honeywell was not really interested in the design or the stage it was at, but only interested in the financial opportunity it presented. Because of the potential financial reward, Honeywell was prepared to take the latch as it found it and to take the risk that it proved unmanufacturable, an example of the “high risk, high reward” strategy which Honeywell Sensing and Control adopted.  As I see it, there are two fallacies in that argument. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the risk that the ULS might prove unmanufacturable has no necessary connection with the stage of development which the design had reached at the date of the JCA.  The latch might have reached the end of the design development phase and still prove unmanufacturable in the process and product development phase because the design was fundamentally flawed. Second, the financial opportunity which Honeywell undoubtedly saw before the JCA was entered was predicated upon the design being at an advanced stage, “final” as described by Mr Chevalier at the meeting on 20 June 2000, reflected in the $1 billion business opportunity power point presentation prepared by Mr Cummings on 28 June 2000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next Mr Douglas submitted that the fact that the design was still in the concept development stage was obvious from the machined concept prototypes Mr Chevalier showed Honeywell at the various meetings and from the drawings which he provided to Honeywell before the JCA. So far as the prototypes are concerned, I do not consider that they were any indication of the stage which the design had reached. All they would tell anyone inferentially was that no prototypes had been built off soft tools yet, not whether the design was at a stage where a soft tooled prototype could now be built. It is also interesting to note that the evidence of Dr Turnbull, a senior engineer at Newhouse was that his assessment from seeing Mr Chevalier’s prototypes was that the design was “mid-design” in Honeywell terms, ready for soft tooling.</p>

Mr Mitchell was challenged by Mr Douglas to point to a single document where he had complained to Mr Chevalier that the design was not as advanced as it should have been. Mr Mitchell was clearly flummoxed and was unable to do so.  Mr Chevalier’s own evidence was that the first time he had heard it suggested that he had misled Honeywell about the state of development of the ULS was when he saw Honeywell’s Defence in 2006.</p>

As will appear later in my judgment, I consider that it was very much  a matter of gradual realisation, with some individual engineers appreciating that the design of the mechanical sub-assembly was not as far advanced as Mr Chevalier had stated.  This is particularly so in the case of Mr Shelley, perhaps because, in a very real sense, he was the only mechanical design engineer at Honeywell who looked at the whole of the design of the mechanical sub-assembly, as opposed to particular parts of it with which other engineers were concerned, until Mr Spurr arrived in January 2003. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, there is some force in Mr McQuater’s submission that as engineers, the Honeywell personnel would have been more concerned with working towards a solution of design problems rather than engaging in a blame culture. This might well have been the case when the collaboration was still in effect but does not really explain why, when Mr Chevalier terminated the JCA in September 2003 and sent a detailed letter setting out his allegations against Honeywell, Honeywell did not respond that some of these matters were attributable to his having misstated the state of development of the latch in the first place. The explanation may be that at that time, Honeywell was more concerned with finding a way to continue the collaboration than pointing the finger at Mr Chevalier. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third and perhaps most importantly, there are a considerable number of internal Honeywell documents (some of which I have already referred to and others which I will need to refer to later in considering the progress of the project) from which it is apparent that at the time of entering the JCA and for some time thereafter, many at Honeywell were still under the misapprehension that little if any design work was required prior to the soft tooled build. </p>

I consider that Mr McQuater is right that Mr Chevalier misled Honeywell comprehensively, in the sense that those involved with the project at the time the JCA was entered believed that little or no work would be required on the design before soft tooled prototypes could be produced. </p>

In any event, as Mr Douglas rightly points out, any plea of rescission would be met by the answer that by about September 2002 at the latest, Honeywell was well aware that the design had not been as Mr Chevalier had stated at the time of entering the JCA and yet, Honeywell continued with the contract, thereby affirming it.</p>

Reliance upon the misstatements merely as part of the “background” would almost certainly breach that principle.  Rather, the way Mr McQuater puts Honeywell’s case is that the statements made by Mr Chevalier demonstrate a common understanding or assumption as to the status of the latch and thus form part of the admissible background to which the Court can have regard in construing the contract. </p>

As Mr Douglas points out, to the extent that Honeywell is contending that Mr Chevalier deliberately misled Honeywell, he can hardly have had the same understanding as Honeywell and on analysis, this may be just another way of putting an unpleaded case of misrepresentation.  Of course, as I have already said, it may be that Mr Chevalier did not deliberately mislead Honeywell, because he had underestimated how much design work would be required before a soft tooled build could take place. Nonetheless, he undoubtedly exaggerated the stage of development which the latch had reached. On balance I do not consider it would be safe to conclude that at the time the JCA was entered, there was some common understanding or assumption.</p>

It was, as I put to Mr Kettle and he accepted, a case of “willing buyer and willing seller”.  Indeed, if anyone was engaged in a “hard sell” it was ALS. Not only was Mr Chevalier a tireless enthusiast and advocate for the latch, but both he and Mr Toledano exhibited what Mr Kettle described in an internal e-mail dated 22 September 2000 to Mr Cummings and Mr Harman as “running on high octane optimism”.

Given that the JCA was entered into in May 2001 and the first prototype build did not take place until March 2003, it can be seen straightaway that this issue is of considerable importance in determining whether, as ALS contend, Honeywell is responsible for all of that delay.</p>

Under this, Honeywell has agreed to take all reasonable steps without unreasonable delay to take the latch from whatever state it is in at the time of the JCA up to manufacture. He says that it is of no significance that the Scope of Work does not include a specific commitment by Honeywell to further develop and design the ULS to make it suitable for the building of soft tooled prototypes, either because the list of commitments is not exhaustive or because that commitment to develop and design the ULS from wherever it is at the time of the JCA is encompassed within item 12 of the Scope of Work, the commitment by Honeywell to “develop the manufacturing means and method for the product”.</p>

He submits that it is extraordinary that, if Honeywell were assuming an obligation to develop the design to make it ready for the soft tooled build, that obligation is not clearly stated in the Scope of Work, nor can Article 4.5 be used to create such an obligation by a side wind.

He did accept this and once that concession is made, it can be seen that the distinction which Honeywell seeks to draw between design work before the soft tooled build (for which it says it is not responsible) and the build itself and design work after that build to optimise manufacturability (for both of which it does accept responsibility) is an artificial one. As Mr Douglas points out, the JCA does not draw this distinction. </p>

However, even if that analysis were wrong, I do not consider that the Scope of Work can be regarded as an exhaustive definition of everything that Honeywell may have to do to make the ULS manufacturable.  Article 4.5 imposes a clear obligation to take <span style="text-decoration:underline">any and all</span> reasonable actions to manufacture the product and that obligation is not specifically qualified by reference to the Scope of Work. In effect, Honeywell seeks to put an impermissible gloss on the Article by adding the words “as set out in the Scope of Work” after the words “any and all reasonable actions”.

That is of course correct but I do not see how it assists Honeywell. The obligation has two parts: to develop the latch for manufacture (a qualified obligation in the sense that it is not absolute but, in effect to take reasonable steps in a reasonable time) and to do so at a competitive cost. The existence of the latter part of the obligation does not reduce the extent of the former. </p>

Both parties recognise that as with other “reasonable endeavours” obligations, the Court is applying objective criteria, but they differ as to whether there is also a subjective element to the analysis, by reference to the precise experience of Honeywell. Honeywell’s case is that the standard required of it is the degree of care and skill ordinarily to be expected of an automotive component supplier with no specialisation or experience in car door latches, by reference to the legal principles applicable in the field of professional negligence. ALS disputes this and points to the fact that Honeywell is a multinational engineering conglomerate and that having agreed to take the whole latch forward for manufacture, it should not be able to hide behind its absence of latch expertise.</p>

Indeed as I have held, the case made by ALS that Honeywell misrepresented during the pre-contract meetings that it had latch expertise is a hopeless one. As I have concluded, Mr Wright of Honeywell told ALS at the meeting on 24 July 2000 that the latch was more mechanically complex to manufacture than anything else made at Newhouse, thereby disavowing any specialist expertise to manufacture the ULS. Furthermore, the JCA recognised the absence of such specialist experience at the outset in providing in the Scope of Work for ALS to provide training and technical support to Honeywell personnel.</p>

Frankly I was not impressed by that approach. It seemed to me that a competent and experienced mechanical engineer would be able to understand the design of the latch within a relatively short period of time. However, it is a considerable leap from that to saying that the Honeywell engineers should have appreciated at an earlier stage the problems only thrown up subsequently by the soft tooled build.</p>

This must particularly be so in the context of a collaboration agreement such as the present. Thus, the extent to which the dual priorities of targeting vehicle manufacturers (“OEMs”) and proceeding to a soft tooled build before anything else were encouraged and agreed by Mr Chevalier and the extent to which changes in the design were dictated by Mr Chevalier (who at least at the outset of the collaboration was the only latch industry “expert”) will inevitably have an impact on the issue of reasonableness under Article 4.5. </p>

That was certainly a trait exhibited time and again in Mr Chevalier’s evidence, both in his witness statement and in his oral evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The initial stage of a typical project is the identification of a new concept in terms of latches which would usually but not always be driven by the requirements of a particular OEM. The concept is then developed usually to the stage where there can be a high degree of confidence that the proposed product will meet all the requirements of the specification. The level of development in this concept development stage will vary, but typically it would include brainstorming sessions between design engineers to develop design ideas, concept drawings, “virtual” testing of the design against required specifications, for strength, stress etc, including basic tolerance analysis and assembly studies, the building of manual prototypes from machined parts, concept development and demonstration prototypes to show the relevant OEM who is the actual or potential customer.</p>

According to Mr Drysdale, the concept development stage would typically take 6 to 12 months. After that stage comes the product development process, which major OEMs such as Ford, General Motors and Chrysler define as divided up into a series of overlapping phases, planning, product design and development, process design and development, product and process validation and finally production. </p>

At this stage the latch manufacturer would usually produce amongst other things a preliminary bill of materials and a preliminary process flow chart. The questions being asked at this stage include does the product meet the customer’s requirements, is it reliable and how will it be manufactured? The stage typically lasts about 3 months. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The product design and development phase is intended to encompass a comprehensive engineering review to ensure that the product meets the objectives of the Voice of the Customer. It would typically include design reviews, Design Failure Mode effects and Analysis (DFMEA), the building of prototypes and design verification.  The DFMEA is a tool for risk assessment at the design stage. It quantifies the potential failure according to the severity, probability of occurrence and ease of detection of a failure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Drysdale would expect design for manufacture to be considered prior to ordering of prototype tooling. At this stage the component parts for prototypes are produced from “soft” tools which are not as durable or long lasting as hard tools used in actual production but should be representative of the materials and process intended to be used in production. The so-called soft tooled build of prototypes is used by the latch manufacturer to verify that the design meets the specification and by its manufacturing engineers to verify the capability of assembling the product within the specifications. Design Verification tests on the prototypes are carried out and any improvements to meet the specification thrown up by those tests are effected by modifications made to the soft tooling. Then the final design testing, Design Validation occurs. As Mr Drysdale says, design verification and validation includes a full test programme according to the customer’s specification. </p>

It will probably overlap with the next stage, process design and development, intended to ensure that the design is suitable for the intended method of manufacture, because even during the product design and development stage, engineers are considering issues of manufacturability.  Process design and development will typically include a product and process system review, a process flow chart, a Process Failure and Mode Effects Analysis (PFMEA) and a pre-launch control plan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The next stage is product and process validation. This involves validating parts produced from the final “hard” production tooling and manufacturing process. It will typically involve amongst other things production parts approval (PPAP), production validation testing, production tooling and a production trial run.  Production validation testing is the final testing of component parts made with production tools, assembled under production conditions. There is no room for any changes to design at this stage, so that if there are outstanding problems at this stage, the customer may have to approve a deviation from the intended design. However, as Mr Drysdale points out, with a safety critical product such as a door latch, this may not be a foregone conclusion and if there have to be changes made, this may delay the vehicle launch.</p>

The latch manufacturer would also anticipate providing the customer with production latches in considerable quantities, perhaps as many as 500, for the customer’s own pre-production trials. Making everything production ready would typically take another 2 to 3 months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was ALS’s case (certainly by the end of the trial) that in large measure, the explanation for the failure to reach the stage of manufacturability by the time the JCA was terminated, when compared with the typical latch project, was not only the lack of resources (which I address in summary below) but the failure of Honeywell to follow a proper design process, with for example (but not exclusively) DFMEAs and PFMEAs, from an early stage of the project. I shall need to consider these allegations in more detail, but by way of overview, I should say that I viewed them with considerable scepticism, essentially for two reasons. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I consider that there are obvious dangers in drawing too close a comparison with a “typical” latch project, to the extent there is such a thing. All timescales for such projects are in one sense aspirational and the time actually taken may be longer (or I suppose shorter) depending on the particular circumstances. I get limited assistance from the fact that to get from concept to design validation might have taken Kiekert or Meritor 15 or 18 months, not just because Honeywell was not a specialist latch manufacturer, although that is of some relevance in assessing its performance as I have indicated in my analysis of the legal principles. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The timescale of a typical latch project is also of limited assistance because, on any view, this was not a typical project. It did not involve collaboration between a latch manufacturer and a particular OEM as such projects often do. Rather it involved collaboration between the inventor who wanted to market the latch to as many OEMs as possible and Honeywell which was not a latch manufacturer. The JCA did not prescribe that particular stages should be undertaken in developing the ULS, let alone the length of time any stage should take. Furthermore, as a matter of fact, the particular course the project took was to a considerable extent determined by actions and priorities agreed between the parties or which Mr Chevalier wanted to take.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason why I viewed this overall case, that Honeywell was in breach for falling short of what was to be expected on a typical latch development project, with some scepticism is that it was founded to a very considerable extent on the evidence of Mr Bland, ALS’s mechanical latch expert.

It seems that despite that Order, ALS was intent on calling evidence of this kind. Honeywell made an application to exclude all this evidence which came before me at a resumed case management conference on 24 January 2008.  At the outset of that hearing, ALS withdrew the Report of Mr Butler. So far as the passages in the Reports of Mr Bland and Mr Sykes are concerned, I took the pragmatic view that rather than taking a blue pencil to those passages at that stage, I would allow them to remain, but at the trial, to the extent that the Reports dealt with material which was outside the scope of the expert evidence as ordered by the Court, would not expect Mr McQuater to cross-examine on those matters.   </p>

Rather his Report contains a liberal sprinkling of views and comments on Honeywell’s contractual obligations, its performance under the JCA and the reasons for delay, straying into comments on the facts which went far beyond what is permissible from an expert, even if the issue he was addressing had been within the scope of expert evidence, which it was not.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One example at random will demonstrate this point. Mr Bland expressed the opinion that, at the end of the JCA, Honeywell had done about 10% of the necessary development work envisaged in the product and process development stage, a matter of which he was highly critical. However, that opinion was reached without any detailed analysis of the design work actually done on any of the revisions and having only looked at a few drawings. Also he did not seem to have considered (or, if he had, had disregarded) the detailed description in Mr Spurr’s witness statement of the progress made with the design and the problems encountered and resolved in the six months from the soft tooled build until the termination of the JCA (on which he was scarcely cross-examined at all). Frankly, Mr Bland’s opinion on this matter was worth very little. In contrast, Mr Drysdale, who had conducted a detailed review of the drawings and of the design in all its revisions (as contemplated by the Scope of Expert Evidence) was able to provide a measured and careful description of all the design problems and changes and to conclude that substantial progress had been made in that six month period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third problem with Mr Bland’s evidence was his own perception of his role as an expert, apparently not something he had been before. Whilst as a person he had an engaging personality, as an expert he was not satisfactory. In his oral evidence, he was argumentative, tendentious and prone to act as an advocate in ALS’s cause. It was not that he lacked integrity, rather that he lacked the independence the Court expects of an expert, possibly because of his lack of experience of giving expert evidence.  Also, despite Mr Douglas’s dismay when I suggested it, I formed a very firm view that he was a great enthusiast of design process, on the absence of which he blamed the failure of the project. Experts who are enthusiasts for a particular cause tend to lack objectivity and this was certainly true of Mr Bland.</p>

As I have said, he provided a detailed and helpful description of the design in its various revisions, of the problems encountered and the solutions reached.

In addition, it was not a pleaded case and does not appear as one of the complaints of breach in Issue 16 of the Agreed List of Issues.

As Honeywell also points out, some of the relevant Honeywell witnesses, particularly Mr Shannon and Mr Spurr, did deal with the purpose and nature of such tools as DFMEAs and Design Change Logs (DCLs), but not in the context that the timing and content of such documents was a breach of contract. One suspects that if this had been an allegation from the outset, Honeywell might well have adduced further evidence as to why it was, for example that the DFMEA which Mr Shannon was pressing for in June 2002 was not started until January 2003.</p>

Whilst, if a DFMEA had been in existence at an earlier stage, Honeywell might have picked up some of the problems with the design later set out in the DCL, before the drawings were sent out for the soft tooled prototype build, those problems were identified and addressed in due course, albeit after the first soft tooled prototype build failed. At most this is a point that goes to having wasted the cost of the first build, a cost borne by Honeywell in any event and not passed on to ALS and I simply do not see it as having contributed any significant delay to the project. </p>

Clearly in a relatively small team, everyone knew what his responsibilities were. Of course it might have been better if the documents had identified responsibilities, but the idea that this caused any confusion or contributed to the alleged lack of progress is again fanciful. Remarkably, the criticisms of the contents of the DFMEAs and the DCL were not put to Mr Spurr in cross-examination, although he was the person with primary responsibility for them from March 2003 and he had dealt with them in detail in his witness statement.</p>

First, it is contended that, from the very outset of the collaboration right through to the end, there was a clash between this project and the Valeo project which was also being carried out at Newhouse.  Personnel were diverted and distracted so that there was a lack of progress and focus on the ULS project. Second, it is said that the senior management of Honeywell never really bought into the ULS project and therefore never dedicated the appropriate resources to it. Third, and as an aspect of that second complaint, Honeywell did not employ appropriate latch experts, other than Mr Spurr, who came to the project too late. They should have employed at least the four experts for whom Mr Bur was asking in February 2002 and, in view of the inevitable delay in finding and hiring appropriate people, they should have started looking at the outset of the co-operation. </p>

However, just as Honeywell witnesses had a tendency to downplay this, so ALS’s case that there was a clash and consequent under-resourcing throughout is an excessive view, not borne out by the contemporaneous documents. Furthermore, it is important to remember that having to deal with conflicting projects is a fact of professional life, for many people, not just engineers. The fact that someone is said to be, say, 60% committed to the ULS project does not necessarily mean the project is under-resourced, because the amount of work required of him on the project may not be more than that percentage, let alone that his employer is in breach of contract.</p>

Valeo does not seem to have intruded much during most of 2002, but did present problems of clashing responsibilities for Mr Shelley in February and March 2003.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The allegation of management not buying into the project is misconceived and simply not borne out by the evidence. Inevitably in any company, senior management are not willing to commit the totality of the financial resources which may be required by the end of the project (if it is successful) from the outset. They will want to be satisfied at the end of each phase of the project that it is successful, before being prepared to commit to the next phase. In the context of a qualified obligation to take all reasonable actions without unreasonable delay, how that approach can be said to be a breach of contract escapes me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, the evidence shows that the management of Honeywell did buy into the project. They agreed to fund the cost of soft tooling, they agreed to fund the cost of test equipment and testing and they approved the hiring of latch experts, although in the event only Mr Spurr could be induced to join the project. At the end of the collaboration, Honeywell had expended US$3.7 million on this project, hardly indicative of a lack of commitment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The absence of latch experts before the arrival of Mr Spurr may have hampered the project in the sense that, had a latch expert been hired earlier, some of the problems which Mr Spurr identified, for example as regards the manufacturability of the design, could well have been identified earlier. However, two things must be borne in mind about this. First, under the JCA there was no obligation as such to hire latch experts, only under Article 4.1 to establish a Project Team and Programme Manager for the latch assembly in total. Second, ALS is not on strong ground in complaining about this, since twice at an early stage, in September 2001 and again in February 2002, Mr Chevalier positively discouraged Honeywell from hiring experts from the latch industry, a point to which I will return. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, Honeywell did try to hire the four latch experts whom Mr Bur recommended, but it proved a slow and dispiriting process, in the sense that a number of appropriate experts who were approached and even interviewed declined to join Honeywell. One other agreed to join but was made a better offer by his current employer. All of this demonstrates that expert engineers working for established latch manufacturers were reluctant to move and that even if they expressed an interest, their current employers would seek to dissuade them. Those factors would equally seem to preclude the employment of such experts as consultants, one of Mr Bur’s alternative ideas. It is difficult to see how any of this can be blamed on Honeywell, let alone shown to be a breach of contract. Mr Douglas’s suggestion at one point that the problem could have been solved by offering the prospective employees more money had an air of unreality and goes beyond any contractual obligation Honeywell could conceivably be under.  </p>

So far as the latter action is concerned, it is clear that from the very outset of the collaboration (as recorded in an e-mail from Mr Kettle to Mr Cummings of 24 May 2001) Mr Chevalier was anxious to send out invitations to the OEMs. The early targeting of OEMs was clearly part of the strategy he advocated, with which Honeywell concurred.</p>

In those covering letters, there is no suggestion either that Honeywell should not rely upon the Business Plan or that it was somehow merely a projection for the future in the event that ALS needed finance. It is clear that Mr Chevalier sent the Plan to Honeywell, who had been pressing for it for some months, on an unqualified basis, intending that it would be relied upon in planning the future course of action. </p>

It is not suggested that anyone at Honeywell engaged in a comparison between that passage and the original passage in the extract provided to Honeywell in July 2000 which said that the prototypes were developed to a level suitable for mass production. However, even if that comparison had been made, it would only have suggested that all pre-production testing had not been completed.

On that basis, there is no inconsistency with the Important Note.

Mr Chevalier’s evidence about the Business Plan was deeply unsatisfactory. Faced with the inevitability of the conclusion that what he had said in it was simply not true, he became evasive and somewhat incoherent. He said that he had told Honeywell many times that the Business Plan was not serious and that they should not rely on it. When it was pointed out that he had not said that in the covering letters sending the Plan, he said he had not needed to as he had explained many times and Honeywell knew absolutely about the situation. None of that was ever put to any of the relevant Honeywell witnesses and I reject Mr Chevalier’s evidence on this point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for reliance by Honeywell on the Business Plan produced by Mr Chevalier, Mr Cummings’ evidence in his witness statement (which was not challenged) was that it confirmed many of the things Mr Chevalier had been telling Honeywell during the course of negotiations.  Understandably after this length of time, Mr Cummings had only a general recollection in his oral evidence of having read the document. Whilst there is no evidence that it (rather than Honeywell’s own assessment and business plan) was specifically relied upon in the initial planning of the project, as I have already held, the business plan Mr Cummings had produced in April 2001 had derived in part from the extract provided earlier of the ALS Business Plan. Furthermore, it is clear from the planning documents and meetings that Honeywell had that it thought that once the design had been transferred (i.e. the drawing transfer had taken place) the ULS would essentially be ready for design validation through the soft-tooled prototype build. </p>

He was contemplating only Mr Shelley on mechanical design, scarcely consistent with an appreciation that a considerable amount of design work on the mechanical sub-assembly would be required before design verification could occur. A similar picture emerges from Mr Mitchell’s “ALS Assumptions and resource allocation” document dated 20 June 2001 to which I have already referred.</p>

It would hardly have done so if it had appreciated that, contrary to what Mr Chevalier was consistently stating, significant design work would be required before any soft tooled prototype build or design validation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chevalier drafted a series of letters to be sent to OEMs soon after the JCA was signed consistent with the course of action agreed at the meeting on 17 May 2001 of targeting OEMs and arranging demonstration meetings, which Mr Chevalier was very keen to do. Letters dated 19 June 2001 to Daimler Chrysler and Volkswagen (the latter following up an earlier letter of 11 June in which Mr Chevalier sent the technical specification for the ULS to Mr Kai Schrenke of Volkswagen) stated: “The development of the system is completed to a very advanced stage and can be producible within 9 to 12 months from placing a development contract”, which echoed what he was saying at the meeting on 20 June 2000 and on page 38 of his Business Plan. The letters to BMW dated 11 June and 12 June 2001 went further and stated: “The development has been completed to an advanced stage-pre-production prototype with Honeywell and it is now a Honeywell product.” That statement of course corresponded with what he had said in the “Important Note” in his Business Plan quoted above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chevalier’s evidence about these letters was to say the least unimpressive. He accepted that he had drafted the letters to Daimler Chrysler and Volkswagen, but although it is quite clear he had also drafted the letters to BMW, the contents of which he accepted were nonsense, he sought to blame Mr Kettle. He said that those letters were drafted by Mr Kettle and that he, Mr Chevalier, had objected at the time, but Mr Kettle had said, ‘let’s go ahead, by the time we reach serious development, Honeywell will have reached that stage’. Put bluntly, that was a shameful lie on Mr Chevalier’s part and in his evidence Mr Kettle was having none of it, saying that all the letters had been drafted by Mr Chevalier, which was obviously the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Kettle also said that the statements in the letter accorded with his understanding of the stage the ULS was at and that if Mr Cummings had had any problems with this, he would presumably have spoken out. Mr Cummings had expressed concerns to Mr Kettle as to whether 9 to 12 months was doable, but evidently had not expressed those concerns to Mr Chevalier. The fact that Mr Cummings did not “speak out” suggests that he continued to believe what Mr Chevalier was saying about the state of development of the latch. Both Mr Chevalier and Mr Kettle recognised in their evidence that it would be potentially disastrous to mislead OEMs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">According to Mr Kettle, Volkswagen’s response to the approach was that it had started to work with Magna to produce a new latch incorporating power opening and closing, but would work with Honeywell instead, if the ULS proved to be as good as the technical specification suggested. A meeting was arranged for 9 July 2001. In readiness for that meeting, Mr Kettle prepared a Presentation document. Although at this distance in time Mr Kettle could not remember whether he got the information about the latch and the stage the design was at from the ALS Business Plan or from discussions with Mr Chevalier, it is clear that by one route or another, that information must have come from Mr Chevalier.  Mr Kettle sent a draft of the presentation to Mr Chevalier on 29 June 2001 and Mr Chevalier sent back what he described as “the final version” under cover of an e-mail of 6 July 2001 in which he said “It has the same text as the previous one but additional pictures”. </p>

In fact of course that text was essentially the same as he had stated in the letters to BMW.

However, when faced down on this point in cross-examination, he accepted that he did not expect to have completed the pre-production prototype within 2001, so to that extent the text was misleading, which it clearly was. </p>

In each case Mr Chevalier received these handouts and, in the case of MG Rover, sent it to them direct himself. All the handouts contained the same inaccurate and misleading information about the state of development of the latch. Clearly appreciating this in the witness box, Mr Chevalier sought to distance himself from the handouts. The furthest he was prepared to go by way of admission of involvement in their content was to say that he may have known some of the content but not its entirety, since the document was developed by Honeywell.</p>

After all, this was the first formal presentation of his invention as a Honeywell product to OEMs and must have been an extremely important moment for him. Not only was he well aware of the content of the handouts, but in so far as information was given about the latch (including as to the state of its development) it was derived entirely from him. </p>

There remains the mystery of why Mr Chevalier was prepared to make these statements in the letters and presentations to OEMs in circumstances where (as he was constrained to accept in his evidence) the information given as to the state of development of the latch was overoptimistic and misleading. As I have said, my assessment of Mr Chevalier is that whilst on occasions he did lie deliberately, in this particular instance, he did not deliberately send misleading information to OEMs.  Rather, this is an instance of his having an overoptimistic and wholly unreal perception of his invention and what was required to bring it to production. He had already lost all objectivity in relation to the latch.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This lack of objectivity pervaded much of his evidence about what was required to bring the ULS to production. At various points in his evidence, he accepted the view of both the latch experts that, at the time of the JCA, the ULS still required a considerable amount of design work to achieve a successful soft tooled build and design validation. He promptly blamed Honeywell for failing to carry out that work, asserting that the Honeywell engineers had known from the outset what work was required. However, at other times in his evidence, he reverted to the wholly inconsistent position of saying that very little additional work was required before design validation, just a few minor changes and tolerances which would take a few days. This latter position more accurately reflects what he was saying at the time in late 2001 and in 2002, as will be seen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although ALS did not call any evidence from OEMs who received these documents containing the misleadingly optimistic statements deriving from Mr Chevalier (other than MG Rover who for reasons I will come into were in a special category), it seems to me to be a fair inference to draw that such OEMs probably considered on the basis of these documents that the design development of the ULS was much further advanced than it in fact was. As the true position emerged, in the sense that the ULS had not been developed to the point where soft tooled prototypes were available in a relatively short time frame, it is possible that some OEMs became sceptical as to whether what was undoubtedly a clever design could be converted into a manufacturable product. Of course this is conjecture, but it is the case that, other than from MG Rover, there was no contractual commitment from any other OEM during the period of the JCA. </p>

This is the commencement of the drawing transfer by Mr Shelley. I will come on to deal in more detail with ALS’s allegations that there was unreasonable delay in effecting that transfer, but for the present it is sufficient to record that, by late June or early July 2001, Honeywell had purchased an AutoCAD package which enabled Mr Shelley to view Mr Chevalier’s 2D drawings. Mr Shelley was then able to assess how long it would take to transfer the drawings onto Honeywell’s system by re-drawing them in Pro E.  This was the period of nine months to a year for one man referred to in Mr Cummings’ e-mail of 6 July 2001. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Shelley accepted that when he viewed the ALS drawings, the state of those drawings was apparent to him, in the sense that he appreciated that the drawings were suitable for the process of machining but not for the process of production using tools, just as he had appreciated Mr Chevalier’s prototypes were machined when he saw them. It was on that basis that Mr Shelley assessed that the drawing transfer would take some time, since he recognised that the process of transfer would involve making modifications to improve manufacturability and improve the piece part count.  However, with respect to Mr Douglas, that is not the same thing as having appreciated from opening the drawings in July 2001 that a considerable amount of design work would be required before a soft tooled build could take place or that Mr Chevalier had seriously overstated the stage the design was at. It was not put fairly and squarely to Mr Shelley that he had appreciated that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What he had appreciated and had passed on to Mr Cummings was that the process of drawing transfer would take much longer than originally appreciated, because, as Mr Cummings recorded in his e-mail of 6 July 2001, what was required was to re-draw the product from the bottom up, with frequent discussions with Mr Chevalier to understand the design and to get to the point which, as he put it, Mr Chevalier’s drawings were already at. It was the realisation that the drawing transfer might well take nine months to a year that led to Mr Cummings’ comment that Honeywell should be cautious in the way it presented timescales to car manufacturers. </p>

He says: “We should also immediately start dialogue with JP Chevalier regarding the analysis, FMEA, quality audit checking which he has already carried out in order to establish a gap analysis between what has been done and what needs to be done before we will be satisfied”. From this it is clear he thought that Mr Chevalier had carried out those various steps of the design validation. </p>

Of course there is an issue as to whether Mr Chevalier had done any analyses or had an FMEA and about when if ever Honeywell asked for them, but that has no bearing on Mr Cummings’ state of mind in July 2001.</p>

Present were Mr Steve Cox, principal engineer Closure Latching Systems and a design engineer and project engineer. The meeting went well and Mr Cox was enthusiastic about the ULS. Jaguar even offered to provide a car for use for test and demonstration purposes. However, as Mr Kettle accepted, there were several layers of decision making above Mr Cox and as Mr Cummings’ note of the meeting records, Mr Cox said that Jaguar was not big enough to proceed with the project on its own. In other words, because it was a safety critical device, at that time it would have to be approved by Ford (then owner of Jaguar) in Dearborn.  Noise (specifically on power opening and closing) was an important issue for Jaguar, as Mr Cummings’ note records. </p>

Shortly after the meeting, Jaguar forwarded the presentation to Ford USA, Ford Germany, Volvo and Land Rover, which were all part of the same group, PAG.  A meeting was provisionally arranged with Ford USA for 18 October 2001 but was cancelled because of restrictions on travel following 9/11. In the event no meeting took place with Ford in Dearborn until 18 June 2002.</p>

It was due to be attended by Mr Chevalier but he was taken ill at the last minute. As a general observation, Mr Chevalier attended very few of the meetings which took place during the collaboration with OEMs outside the United Kingdom, apparently because of an aversion to air travel.  This is of course no fault of Mr Chevalier’s but inevitably it meant that he was dependent upon reports of such meetings from others, specifically Mr Kettle, who was the person at Honeywell with whom he had closest contact. As I have already commented, Mr Kettle exhibited the enthusiasm and optimism of the natural salesman, and sometimes the views he expressed about the prospects of success were over-optimistic. </p>

A number of points emerge from Mr Cummings’ note of the meeting. BMW did not require control electronics or power opening or closing. Although as he said, they showed a genuine interest in the latch, it received a much more enthusiastic response from the BMW engineers present than from the purchasing manager. BMW, like Volkswagen and Jaguar, was prepared to go to the next stage of prototype evaluation and budgetary costing. </p>

Despite Mr Kettle’s ever hopeful approach when asked about this meeting, even he accepted that the fact that BMW had a new corporate latch meant that any adoption of the ULS was a couple of years away at a minimum. As Mr Cummings said in his witness statement a follow up meeting with BMW was planned for February or March 2002, but without a fully operational prototype, it was not possible to take matters further.</p>

The Honeywell stand was visited by a number of OEMs, including DaimlerChrysler (Mercedes) to whom a demonstration was made. A preliminary meeting was scheduled for mid-October 2001, but that too was postponed as a consequence of travel restrictions following 9/11.  A representative of Ford Germany attended and told them that Ford had been selecting a new modular latch system for its European market including the Ford Fiesta, the Ford Focus and Volvo models, which would have a start of production in 2003, indicating that the ULS had missed those opportunities. The Ford representative indicated that it might be possible to test the ULS on its premier segment and the Ford Galaxy. Some interest was shown in power closing. Volkswagen also visited the stand and there were discussions about them supplying car doors to Honeywell for fitting the ULS.</p>

They asked for two samples of the latch in the week commencing 5 November 2001 to fit into a car for trials. If the trials went well, they would want more samples to be fitted to prototype vehicles. As Mr Kettle explained in his evidence, MG Rover were in difficulty. They were no longer owned by BMW and so were no longer guaranteed BMW’s pricing from its latch supplier, which was presumably Arvin Meritor. They were looking to launch a new model, code named RDX 60, but did not want power closing yet. They might do so in 18 months or two years.</p>

He suggested that the document called “Work Breakdown Structure” which Mr Cummings was in the course of preparing should be used as the baseline for the first “pulsing” meeting/teleconference.  As Mr Cummings explained in his evidence, this was a primary planning document used by the project management office within Newhouse to plan a project. The draft of the document which Mr Cummings prepared (in fact in conjunction with Mr Shelley), together with an Excel spreadsheet project report was sent by e-mail to Mr Wild, Mr Sosnowski, Dr Turnbull and Mr Smith-Malzfeldt on 9 August 2001.

So far as Concept Development is concerned, ALS can point out that the first item is the establishment of a Six Sigma Plan including DFMEAs, process flows and PFMEAs, all of which are contemplated by Design For Six Sigma.

However, be that as it may, the fact that the Work Breakdown Structure contemplated the creation of a DFMEA by Honeywell in my judgment is no indication that Honeywell had appreciated that a considerable amount of design work would be required on the mechanical sub-assembly before the soft tooled prototype build.</p>

As Mr Cummings put it, both the Customer Needs Identification and Concept Development phases are a little bit light compared to a typical Honeywell project starting from scratch.

In terms of resources, a mechanical design engineer was being sought from Freeport to assist Mr Shelley. It is true that “design and drafting activities” are referred to, but it is clear from other documents that what is being referred to is someone to assist Mr Shelley in the drawing transfer, which is indeed the role which Mr Scott Vorwald assumed from September 2001. The only external resource contemplated by way of someone from the latch industry was an applications engineer to liaise with customers over their specific requirements.</p>

As Mr Mitchell (who participated in this review) said, when Mr Douglas put this passage to him, the compressed timescale of 18 months was because the design was (in other words was believed to be) already conceptually tested and at a point where, with minor modifications, it could be put into production. It seems to me that evidence has considerable force. </p>

I have indeed considered their evidence very carefully against the background of the contemporaneous documentation. Far from this supporting the contention made by Mr Douglas, I am satisfied that it supports Honeywell’s case that they, like others within Honeywell, were not aware of how much additional design work was required, really until the second half of 2002 and that they did rely upon what they were told about the status of the design by Mr Chevalier.</p>

Mr Gibson’s evidence was to similar effect, although he may have been confused about precise dates. His evidence was that after that trip, he began to have concerns that the design was not as finalised as Mr Chevalier had said, although it was clear from his evidence that there was not some blinding realisation and that what he was focusing on as a manufacturing engineer was getting baseline data about the ULS with which to go out to get quotes from component suppliers. </p>

It indicates again that Mr Chevalier’s clear priority was the targeting of OEMs and the building of soft tooled prototypes which he hoped would lead to one or more development contracts. It also confirms Mr Chevalier’s earlier statements to the effect that changes in the design and testing were not required prior to that soft tooled build. It also states in the clearest possible terms Mr Chevalier’s view that it was not necessary for Honeywell to hire latch experts externally.</p>

Obviously appreciating that the strong view about there being no need for experts was not helpful to ALS’s case in this litigation that Honeywell was at fault for failing to employ latch experts sooner than it did, he sought to explain this all away as a sarcastic comment about Mr Kilker, although he then denied that the effect of what he was saying was “Butt out so-called latch expert, I’m the only latch expert”. He then sought to say that the e-mail was designed to support Mr Kettle as he was concerned the Americans in Freeport were trying to take over the project, notwithstanding that, as he sought to deny unconvincingly, one of the reasons why he had been keen on a collaboration agreement with Honeywell was the U.S. dimension.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The truth about this document as I see it, is that it does indeed demonstrate that Mr Chevalier was very jealous of the latch and his own expertise in relation to it and much happier dealing with engineers who were not latch experts and whom he could therefore seek to influence. He did not like the involvement (or as he saw it interference) of engineers who did have expertise in the latch industry, such as Mr Kilker and subsequently Mr Spurr. Perhaps this was because of a concern that such experts might start asking searching questions about the ULS and its design, questioning what he regarded as its invincibility. Equally, his concern to safeguard his intellectual property may have had something to do with it. He certainly considered later that Mr Spurr in particular was trying to “design round” his patents. </p>

Of course it does not follow that merely because it was Mr Chevalier’s preference that Honeywell should not hire latch experts, Honeywell itself did not recognise the desirability of doing so, at least in relation to dealings with customers over specifications. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In August 2001, Honeywell was looking for an applications engineer to liaise with customers during the generation of customer specifications, which would preferably be a latch industry expert. It was in that context that Mr Chevalier provided Honeywell with a list of potential candidates from Kiekert and Arvin Meritor. It seems that a recruitment agency was engaged which actually made an offer to a potential candidate but Honeywell put the whole question on hold pending what were described in Mr Cummings’ Action Log as at 25 October 2001 as “organisation changes”. None of the Honeywell witnesses was able to assist as to what those were.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally, the fact that Mr Chevalier held that view would not in itself excuse Honeywell from hiring experts from the outset of the project, if it recognised the necessity of doing so. The problem for ALS’s case is that, apart from the possible requirement for an applications engineer, it does not seem to me that Honeywell management involved with the project such as Mr Mitchell saw an immediate need for latch experts. When Mr Douglas put to Mr Mitchell the business plan prepared by Mr Sosnowski in November 2001 and passages referring to adequate project staffing at the start of a project being essential and to it being critical that technical resources be in place as soon as possible, Mr Mitchell gave a qualified answer. He said that it was only once the design was transferred to Honeywell and the design validation stage was reached, that Honeywell would know what additional external resources might be required.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That approach seems to me perfectly reasonable, given that Honeywell had not appreciated that considerable design development work would be required before successful design validation could take place. The position would no doubt be different if at this stage in the autumn of 2001, Mr Chevalier had been impressing on Honeywell that it was essential to employ latch experts straightaway without delay, but the e-mail of 22 September 2001 was suggesting the exact opposite. In the context of a joint collaboration agreement I do not consider that it is justified to criticise Honeywell for not having taken steps to employ latch experts earlier than they did, in circumstances where Mr Chevalier was the latch expert and he was saying other experts were not necessary.</p>

Mr Cummings, Mr Kettle and Mr Smith-Malzfeldt attended a follow up meeting with MG Rover, at which Mr Larry Devlin the purchasing manager and two project engineers were present. Honeywell quoted for three versions of the latch, super lock, electrical child safety and power opening. The quote was above MG Rover’s present price obtained through the corporate BMW deal but which was unlikely to be available without the BMW influence. Honeywell agreed to prepare a value analysis to show that the total installed cost would give advantages that would offset the increase in price of the latch. Mr Devlin indicated that open book costing would be a mandatory requirement of any business with MG Rover. Mr Devlin also confirmed that MG Rover was prepared to proceed further to a formal request for quotation. At some stage after the meeting, MG Rover supplied Honeywell with a Rover 75 door to which Honeywell was going to fit the latch. </p>

From a Honeywell perspective, the project timescale and volume requirements and the customer location makes Rover a good potential lead customer”. This is further demonstration that, at this stage in November 2001, Mr Cummings still believed that the design of the latch was at an advanced stage, as had been consistently represented by Mr Chevalier.</p>

Honeywell provided some preliminary pricings for various levels of functionality of the ULS, which Mr Cox said were ok at first glance and not far away from Jaguar’s targets in view of the extra functionality the latch could offer. He said he would circulate the pricings within PAG and thought that Volvo would be particularly interested.  He said Volvo was trying to identify a latch for their next generation cars and was in discussion with a latch manufacturer, probably Meritor. From what the Ford Germany representative had said at the Frankfurt show, it seems likely that arrangements between Volvo and that latch manufacturer were further advanced than Mr Cox was aware. Mr Cox agreed to facilitate a meeting with PAG in Europe once Honeywell had a fully functional latch. </p>

It is clear that he remained so throughout the collaboration, but a much more difficult question (which I will have to address hereafter in the context of quantum) is whether those people above him in the Jaguar organisation who would have been making the management decision whether to adopt the ULS, would ever have been prepared to do so. For the present I simply note that Mr Cox’s optimism about Volvo was not borne out at least at that stage. No meeting with Volvo took place until Mr Kettle met them on 9 September 2002.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as Volkswagen is concerned, on 2 November 2001, Honeywell had received two doors, a front and a rear, for a Passat into which to fit the ULS. On 20 November 2001, a follow up meeting took place at Wolfsburg with Kai Schrenke and Herr Loock who was the engineer responsible for testing latches, attended by Mr Cummings, Mr Kettle and Mr Smith-Malzfeldt. Honeywell indicated that it was expected that the two Passat doors would be available for return, fitted with the ULS by early January 2002. Volkswagen asked Honeywell to quote for 2 million latches a year for the new Passat model. Mr Schrenke confirmed that the likely split would be 5% simple mechanical latch, 80% with central lock and super lock and 15% with full functionality (i.e. power opening and closing). There was an issue with the compatibility of the ULS with the Volkswagen control system, which Honeywell recognised would have to be resolved. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Herr Loock expressed concern that the ULS could be susceptible to malfunction through dust ingress and corrosion. This concern apparently derived from the close spacing of the levers in the ULS, although the widespread use of metal parts was perceived as an advantage. In view of the subsequent design problems with the ULS identified at the time of the failed soft tooled build in March 2003, this assessment by Mr Loock was rather prophetic.</p>

In fact, tshe doors were not returned with the ULS fitted until the next meeting with Volkswagen in September 2002.  Although in one sense this allegation did not assume enormous significance at trial, being subsumed within the general ALS allegations about lack of progress, it seems to me to be an issue of some significance, particularly given the extent to which ALS’s case on its quantum of loss and damage is dependent upon the likelihood of obtaining a contract with Volkswagen for use of the latch on the new Passat model had it not been for Honeywell’s breach of its obligations under Article 4.5 of the JCA.</p>

In his witness statement, he says that Mr Chevalier would not let anyone else fit the sample latches into the doors and arranged to come to Newhouse in January 2002 with his own working prototypes. Mr Chevalier spent most of a week trying to fit the latches into the doors and, more importantly, to get them to function fully. He described how one evening they were in the factory until 10pm and Mr Chevalier and Mr Kettle had to extend their hotel reservations. Mr Chevalier went away not having succeeded, taking his prototypes with him. Mr Cummings equally was not cross-examined about his evidence concerning the fitting of the latches to the doors. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the circumstances, it is difficult to make any definite findings about this issue of the prototype doors save as follows. First, whether Mr Chevalier had to take over building the doors from Mr Crawford or was engaged in the task throughout, it is more likely that he wanted to do the job himself and that he was the only person really qualified to do so. He was the latch expert and he knew full well that Honeywell had not at this stage employed a latch expert of its own. Second, I do not consider that the exercise can have been as much of a failure as Mr Cummings seems to be suggesting. It is common ground (as set out in the Agreed Chronology) that on 4 February 2002 a few days after Mr Chevalier’s visit, the MG Rover door was returned to MG Rover fitted with a prototype latch which was demonstrated to MG Rover. However, the latch was only demonstrated mechanically and Honeywell was not able to demonstrate the latch electronically because of problems with the control electronics as developed by VVLP. Nonetheless, that mechanical demonstration was evidently satisfactory so far as MG Rover was concerned, since after a visit to the Newhouse factory the following week, Honeywell received the letter of nomination for the RDX60 from MG Rover on 19 February 2002.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, I do consider that the build of the prototype latches into doors in the week of 28 January 2002 was nothing like as straightforward as Mr Chevalier tried to make out and that it did throw up issues which required further design and development work. I suspect that this may be the explanation for Mr Cummings’s realisation (reflected in his Project Progress Report for January 2002, which must have been prepared after 29 January) that further development work and design work was required. This is the first indication, albeit in an internal document, of Honeywell appreciating that further design development would be required before soft tooling could take place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the Volkswagen doors were concerned, it appears that at least by the second half of February 2002, the latches had been fitted into the Volkswagen doors. On 22 February 2002 Mr Kettle wrote to Mr Nigel Cliffe of Bentley (owned by Volkswagen) to inform him that Honeywell would be returning the Passat doors to Volkswagen at a meeting with Kai Schrenke on 6 March 2002.  Mr Kettle said in that e-mail that the latches had been fitted to the doors and that they would be capable of “demonstrating all possible functions such as power opening, power closing, passive entry, central locking etc.”  In the light of the problems encountered with the control electronics during the demonstration to Rover on 4 February (which Mr Kettle accepted existed) this statement was optimistic to say the least. Mr Kettle said he would have got this information from someone and although he could not remember from whom, he accepted it might have been from Mr Chevalier. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to all this was that Honeywell was apparently going to be placed on the Volkswagen system for receiving Requests for Quotation. Mr Kettle regarded this as significant in terms of progress towards securing a nomination from Volkswagen.  It appears that a formal part of that procedure would be a factory visit to Newhouse by Volkswagen personnel.  Although Mr Kettle appears to have subsequently had a meeting with Mr Cliffe of Bentley on 7 March 2002 about arranging that visit to Newhouse, it never took place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The problems with the control electronics developed by VVLP continued. Although they worked on the latch during a meeting with Mr Chevalier and representatives of VVLP on 4 March 2002 (at which time Mr Kettle was expecting the MG Rover latch to be ready for 6 March and the Volkswagen latch for 11 March), this did not remain the case. The meeting with Mr Schrenke had been postponed until 21 March. On 11 March the Rover latch with full functionality was sent to Mr Chevalier. It was working perfectly but suddenly it just stopped, due to an electronics problem. Mr Randell of VVLP had sent a replacement latch to Mr Chevalier but was not available to start on the Volkswagen latches until Friday 15 March 2002. Mr Kettle had to contact Mr Schrenke to delay delivery of the doors which he described as “frustrating but unavoidable” in an e-mail. </p>

ALS did not call any witness from Volkswagen, so that it is very difficult to judge how, if at all, their attitude to the ULS would have differed if the doors had been delivered back with fully functioning prototypes in March 2002. It may well be that the reason the visit to the Newhouse factory did not take place was that the doors had not been delivered back. </p>

At all events, if any fall-off of interest was caused by the fact that the doors were not delivered back to them in March 2002, it does not seem to me that blame for that can fairly be laid at Honeywell’s door.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What seems to have provoked Mr Chevalier to complain to Mr Mitchell was that he had gone to Newhouse in the week of 14 January 2002 and said that he had found no signs of activity, other than Mr Shelley transferring drawings. That he then complained to Mr Mitchell and Mr Cummings is apparent from the fact that they and Mr Bur had a telephone discussion about this on 15 January, referred to in an e-mail from Mr Bur of 24 January 2002.  This refers to Mr Chevalier having a perception that Honeywell was not making proper investment in ALS and to his concern that Mr Smith-Malzfeldt (who spoke German) was leaving the team.  In his evidence, Mr Chevalier maintained that he had told Mr Mitchell at this time in January that Honeywell needed to employ experts from the latch industry but Mr Mitchell said that would take time. It was therefore as an interim solution in the meantime that he, Mr Chevalier, agreed to train engineers coming onto the team at that time, such as Mr Ricks and Mr Bur.</p>

It was not suggested to Mr Mitchell that there had been a discussion about hiring experts in January and Mr Bur in his evidence could not recollect Mr Chevalier mentioning that experts were needed when they had their meeting. It seems to me that Mr Chevalier’s assertion that he had told Mr Bur and Mr Ricks when they came to his flat that industry experts were needed was also untrue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> The best indication of Mr Chevalier’s attitude to the resources needed is to be found in the e-mail he sent Mr Mitchell on 26 February 2002 (following a telephone conversation the previous day) immediately after the MG Rover letter of nomination. His first priority of “vital importance” was the appointment of a project manager endowed with “excellent communication skills” and he said that Honeywell must have someone who would fit these criteria. Then the next priority was the appointment of a fully committed engineering team to deal with the immediate need of satisfying Rover. This should consist of two mechanical engineers, Mr Shelley and Mr Paul Trickett (another mechanical engineer at Newhouse Mr Chevalier had been impressed with), a test engineer and technical assistant, a production engineer who was an assembly line specialist and two electronics engineers, one a software specialist and the other a hardware specialist, both of whom must be experienced in electromechanical drive mechanisms for automotive applications. Mr Ajay Kumar Vaidhyanathan (who had joined Honeywell on 14 January 2002) could be one of them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Under the heading “How to bring the product forward” Mr Chevalier repeated what he had said before, that the first priority was to adapt the design for the purposes of production, the first stage of which was soft tools. He said “This means that some minor forms and tolerances will be changed in the current design”, and that those modifications could be achieved by having Mr Shelley and Mr Trickett spend a few days with him. He continued that “improvements on some aspects of the design are totally unnecessary and will not be worthwhile or justifiable until such time [as] satisfying customer specifications and testing are underway”, echoing what he had said about testing not being necessary in his reaction to Mr Kilker in September 2001.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> This was all further confirmation of the statements he had made many times previously to the effect that little or no development work was required before soft tooling.

It is another clear statement (like the one on 22 September 2001) that Mr Chevalier did not think it necessary for Honeywell to employ latch experts. The terms of the e-mail essentially demonstrate Mr Chevalier’s motivation for that view, that he preferred to be in charge, training up other engineers who were not latch industry experts, whereas as I said earlier, such experts might pose a threat to his supremacy as the latch expert.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chevalier sought to explain this e-mail away in a manner which was, if anything, even less satisfactory than his explanation of the 22 September e-mail. He claimed that he had told Mr Mitchell and Mr Wright in a telephone conversation on 21 February 2002 that it was necessary to hire experts and that in the same conversation he had complained about the fact that it was Honeywell’s responsibility to develop the design. This was a conversation about resources he referred to having had with Mr Wright in his witness statement, but Mr McQuater rightly pointed out that in the witness statement he had not said that during that conversation he had mentioned the need to hire experts or complained that Honeywell was not doing design development work.</p>

However, that is not what the e-mail says. In my judgment there is an irreconcilable inconsistency between his statement in the e-mail and the conversation alleged to have taken place a few days earlier. The suggestion that he had said that it was necessary to hire latch experts and that he had complained about Honeywell not doing design development was pure invention on his part. I note also that Mr Douglas did not suggest to Mr Mitchell in cross-examination that such a conversation with him had taken place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The truth was that he was the latch expert and jealously guarded that role. Slightly later in his evidence, he came fairly close to accepting this when he agreed that he had an obligation under the JCA to provide technical support, that Honeywell was looking to him for guidance and instruction on the work to be done on the latch design and that he did not see it as the job of people like Mr Shelley to come up with changes in design, but rather that he would provide instructions on changes. That was very telling evidence both as to why matters took the course they did during the remainder of 2002, namely  Mr Shelley consulting Mr Chevalier about changes to the design, and as to the force of any criticism now levelled against Honeywell for failing to carry out design development itself, matters to which I will return. For the present, I need only record my finding that Mr Chevalier never told Honeywell that it had to hire latch experts. So far as his requirements for a team were concerned, they were as set out in his e-mail of 26 February 2002. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of whether the complaints he was making were justified, Mr Chevalier himself would never admit that they were not, but the matter needs to be looked at objectively. Whatever his perception was from his visit in January 2002, the fact is that Honeywell was deploying more resources already. The Core Team was set out in a document dated January 2002 prepared by Mr Cummings, probably at the same time as his January 2002 Project Progress Report. That showed in addition to Mr Cummings himself, Mr Shelley,  Mr Scott Vorwald (who was providing mechanical design support to Mr Shelley) and Mr Gibson, the manufacturing systems engineer, that Mr Vaidhyanathan, a senior electronics design engineer and Mr Paddy Shannon a Six Sigma specialist had joined the Core Team. The document showed Mr Shelley and Mr Cummings as committed to the team 60% of the time and Mr Gibson 40% of the time.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Naturally, ALS seized on those figures as demonstrating that there was insufficient commitment, particularly over matters such as drawing transfer. Mr Shelley felt in his evidence that Mr Cummings had underestimated his commitment and at this time in January 2002, he was pretty much fully committed. That may well have some force in it, in that the impression I have (to which I will return in more detail when dealing with drawing transfer) is that Mr Shelley became more involved in the drawing transfer towards the end of 2001. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Certainly, whether the correct figure for Mr Shelley’s commitment was 60% or slightly more, I reject entirely the suggestion made by Mr Kettle in his evidence that, in the period from September 2001 to December 2002, Mr Shelley had only spent 20% of his time on the project, let alone that Mr Shelley had told him this. This was one area where Mr Kettle’s desire to further the ALS cause got the better of him. I note also that it was not suggested by Mr Douglas in his cross-examination of Mr Shelley either that his real involvement was only 20% or that he had said that to Mr Kettle.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gibson also disagreed with Mr Cummings’s assessment of his involvement as only 40%, which he could not explain. He said he had checked his own records and that on average he was 80% committed to the ULS project throughout, more heavily at the start. I have to say I found the evidence about an average 80% involvement slightly defensive and not wholly convincing. However, it is important to have in mind the point which Mr Cummings himself made in his evidence, that the percentage figure shown may have been enough in view of what was actually required of the individual. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as concerns what Mr Gibson was doing in the first six months of the project, his evidence was that after the visit he made to Mr Chevalier in London, it took until the end of September 2001 to get Mr Chevalier to come to Newhouse to go through the components and to sit and build a prototype with Mr Chevalier. This was a baseline exercise. Mr Gibson then drew up a Prototype Assembly Method Map. He prepared assembly instructions which he went through with Mr Chevalier. Honeywell then obtained quotations from particular suppliers based on the information provided by Mr Chevalier, which Mr Gibson said was agreed by Mr Chevalier. He said that he discussed the quotations obtained with Mr Chevalier, but was a little confused about this. My distinct impression is that Mr Gibson had only a very general recollection of what he had done when, which is scarcely surprising after nearly seven years. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However his description of what he was doing tends to bear out his evidence that he was more heavily involved in the project at the outset. Equally it may well be that Mr Cummings’ assessment that as at January 2002, Mr Gibson’s commitment was only 40% is correct, but that at that time, no greater commitment was required of him.  Furthermore any criticism levelled by ALS at Honeywell for not having Mr Gibson more committed to the project is inconsistent with Mr Kettle’s evidence that Honeywell would not be expected to invest a lot of money in manufacturing engineering until it had a contract with an OEM, so that before then there would have been minimum call on his time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, in terms of what was actually required to be done in the first seven or eight months of the project, I consider that there is not much force in the criticism of Honeywell for not having sufficient resources in place. The process of drawing transfer by Mr Shelley and Mr Vorwald may have taken somewhat longer than it should have done (a matter to which I will return), in part because Mr Shelley had not been fully committed, but otherwise there does not seem to me to be any basis for criticising the activities of Mr Gibson or Mr Cummings in that period.</p>

In fact, Mr Chevalier got his own way about this, because, in due course in May 2002 Mr Cummings was replaced with Mr Richard Hayes, whom it was thought would be better attuned to Mr Chevalier. In any event, I formed a favourable view of Mr Cummings as a thoughtful, careful and professional engineer, who did the best he could in running the project and the criticism of him seemed misplaced. </p>

On the Rover Team, they proposed hiring a project or team leader with about 10 years of design experience in the latch industry, to bring experience and credibility to ensure a successful launch with Rover, that Mr Shelley be allocated 100% to designing and developing the upper level electronic assembly and that a controls engineer with 5 to 10 years experience in the automotive industry be hired. They recognised that hiring in external resources might take 3 to 6 months so that consideration needed to be given to what to do in the short term.</p>

The next day, 27 February 2002, Mr Mitchell responded to Mr Chevalier’s e-mail of 26 February 2002 about resources, saying that Mr Bur and Mr Ricks had made a recommendation as to the team which needed to be in place, which he and Dr Turnbull were to discuss later that day. </p>

Mr Ricks prepared a Resource Proposal Spreadsheet for presentation to a meeting of the Project Approval Committee in Freeport on 6 March 2002, which set out in tabular form their recommendation, including the hiring of four engineers externally and what the short term approach should be, on the basis that it would take time to hire in such external resources. It was proposed that in the short term, Mr Cummings should be 100% on the Platform Development Team and Valeo projects and that, pending the hiring of a mechanical design engineer from the latch industry, Mr Shelley should fill in the gaps and oversee the soft tooling order. They noted that he was currently supporting both aspects of the ULS and Valeo Keyless and Valeo Headlamp Levelling. In the corresponding mechanical design position on the Rover team for the upper assembly, they recommended bringing in Mr Abanni Maxwell, a mechanical design engineer at Freeport to help design the upper assembly, with a 6 to 9 months commitment. </p>

They also recommended that Mr Bill Eaton, a manufacturing engineer in Freeport be brought in to assist Mr Gibson. As project leader until someone was hired in from the latch industry, they recommended Richard Hayes. Before the Controls Development engineer from the automotive industry was employed, they recommended that Mr Vaidhyanathan would fill the gap short term with some electronics engineering resource from Freeport. In terms of priority for the external recruiting the top priority for Mr Bur and Mr Ricks was the project leader for the Rover Team, followed by the manufacturing engineer, then the mechanical design engineer and finally the controls/software development engineer.</p>

What is interesting though, is that his reasons for this view were the need for Honeywell to “come up the learning curve fast” because of its need to show it was now a latch supplier.  Mr Bur also accepted in his evidence that one of the reasons why he and Mr Ricks wanted latch experts on board, was a perception that Honeywell was too dependent on Mr Chevalier’s expertise. Their game plan was to come up the learning curve fast so that Honeywell would become latch experts. They envisaged changes being made to the JCA, with Mr Chevalier becoming a consultant and ALS receiving just royalties.</p>

Ultimately Mr Paul Trickett did not join the project, because his line manager would not release him from the other work he was on, a normal incident of business life. In other words, most if not all of the short term resources recommended were put in place. Mr Maxwell was lead engineer coordinating efforts at Freeport, concentrating on developing design concepts for the upper electronics assembly. Mr Maxwell in fact came to Newhouse for three months in June 2002 to work on the upper assembly.</p>

Up until March 2002, Honeywell was still waiting for a design transfer in relation to control electronics from ALS and its sub-contractor VVLP, before commencing its own work on control electronics. I return to this point in the context of ALS’s criticisms about control electronics later in the judgment. </p>

In fact, as emerges when the issue of the housing is examined closely, that allegation is without merit. However, ALS cannot have it both ways.  I would be extremely reluctant to conclude on the basis of ALS’s evidence that Honeywell was in breach in failing to start development work on the upper assembly until the spring of 2002 and I decline to reach that conclusion.</p>

Mr Bur tried to suggest in his evidence that senior management subsequently changed their minds, but there was no evidence to support that assertion, which was one area where I thought Mr Bur’s evidence was not satisfactory. On the contrary, it is clear that recruitment consultants were instructed and efforts began to fill all four roles. In fact it appears from the Personnel Requisitions sent by Mr Ricks to Mr Mitchell on 13 March 2002 that approval in principle to all four hires may have been given by the Project Approval Committee at its meeting. </p>

Apart from Mr Spurr (who had his own reasons for leaving Arvin Meritor and who was able to negotiate both that he remain at Arvin Meritor until he had earned his Christmas bonus for 2002 and that he should essentially work from home in Solihull) people who were approached and even interviewed either turned down the job (as in the case of Veronique Mejean who was offered the job of project leader in August 2002) or were induced to stay in their current employment, as was the case with Mr Steve Wright, who was due to join Honeywell from Arvin Meritor at the same time as Mr Spurr.

Not only does that go beyond taking all reasonable actions under Article 4.5, but there is absolutely no evidence that this would in fact have induced any prospective employees to join Honeywell.  The same point can be made about Mr Bur’s contention in his evidence that Honeywell never explored his alternative suggestion of seeking to engage such external experts as consultants. However, there is no evidence that any of the people approached who were unwilling to join Honeywell as employees, would for some reason have been prepared to join as consultants instead. Indeed, common sense suggests that, if the reluctance derived, as it seems to have done, from unwillingness to leave the employ of an established latch manufacturer, the prospective latch experts would have been no more willing to join a rival newcomer as consultants and their current employers equally unwilling to countenance their acting as such consultants. </p>

ALS can draw no sustenance from Mr Mitchell’s decision to abandon the two team approach in early May 2002, since the removal of Mr Cummings is what Mr Chevalier was evidently pressing for. As I have said, Honeywell’s inability to fill the external latch expert roles other than with Mr Spurr was not itself a breach of contract. Accordingly, even if there had been under resourcing as at January 2002 and that was a breach of the JCA (about which I have considerable doubts), any breach had clearly been cured by June 2002.</p>

It was not until Mr Shelley purchased an Auto CAD LT package in about June 2001 that Honeywell was able to view the 2D drawings, but not the 3D models created in Auto CAD by Mr Chevalier. Mr Shelley’s evidence was that there would have been no point in buying an Auto CAD package which would show the 3D models because, when he reviewed the files with Mr Chevalier at his flat, Mr Chevalier’s 3D models did not coincide with his 2D drawings, so the 3D models were of no use.

Despite some sweeping statements by Mr Chevalier that there were such translation packages and that the totality of his computerised information in Auto CAD could have been transferred in hours or certainly days, no evidence was ever produced by ALS to back up that rather extreme assertion. I prefer the Honeywell evidence that no such translation package was available, not least because if one was available, it is inconceivable that Honeywell would not have purchased it, particularly when faced with Mr Shelley’s assessment that the drawing transfer would take 9 months to a year for him to carry out.  </p>

In his evidence Mr Chevalier claimed he had handed over another CD of drawings at the signing meeting on 17 May 2001. However that seems unlikely for two reasons. First, had such a CD been handed over, I feel sure Mr Cummings would have recorded that in his note of the meeting. Second, after the termination of the JCA, ALS’s then solicitors wrote to Honeywell in February 2004 requesting the return of all confidential proprietary material. The CDs of drawings listed did not include anything handed over at the meeting on 17 May 2001.

It was in that context taken with the fact that there was no translation package available, that Mr Shelley and Mr Cummings concluded that the best way to transfer the design knowledge to Honeywell was to re-draw the product from the bottom up with frequent discussions with Mr Chevalier, as set out in Mr Cummings’ e-mail of 6 July 2001. </p>

Later in July 2001 it was agreed that additional mechanical design resource would be deployed to assist Mr Shelley, not least because he was involved in all the projects at Newhouse including Valeo. Following the Executive Review on 14 August 2001 Mr Scott Vorwald in Freeport was brought in to assist with the drawing transfer and drafting.

It seems likely though that there were two reasons. First, the determination by Honeywell management as to whether the suggested approach to drawing transfer was the correct one and the deployment of the additional resource of Mr Vorwald. Second, in July and August 2001 Mr Chevalier had made some alterations to the drawings for the purposes of the manufacture of the prototypes for the Frankfurt motor show and it was evidently decided not to start the drawing transfer until those revised drawings were available. Accordingly, the CD which Mr Shelley was given by Mr Cummings at the beginning of September 2001 and from which he started the process of transfer was of the latest revisions of the drawings dated July and August 2001. Mr Chevalier was critical of Honeywell in his evidence for not starting the process of transfer until September 2001, but I would be reluctant to conclude that there was any breach of the JCA in doing so. It would seem sensible to have waited for the latest revisions of the drawings and there was no pressing urgency, in circumstances where a contract with an OEM had yet to be obtained.</p>

On a complex part such as the upper retention plate, it would take 2 to 3 days to create the 3D model in ProE from the 2D drawing. For simple parts like pins, the process would take anything from 5 to 15 minutes. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Once he had created the 3D model in ProE, he then had to create the 2D drawings in ProE. The views and the nominal dimensions would come across directly from the 3D model. Thus in ProE the problem which Mr Chevalier had had in Auto CAD (that his 3D model had not been updated in line with his 2D drawings) would not occur. The parametric modelling in ProE meant that whatever work you did in 3D would alter the 2D drawings automatically and vice versa. However only about 70% or so of the dimensions would transfer across from the 3D model to the 2D drawings, so that it was always necessary to add dimensions. In addition it was necessary to add geometric tolerancing details and critical dimensions. Again, on a complex part such as the upper retention plate, the process of generating the 2D drawings from the 3D model could itself take another 2 to 3 days. It was also necessary to generate about 50 sub-assembly drawings which Mr Chevalier had not provided. </p>

However in his e-mail of 29 November 2001 attaching the spreadsheet, Mr Shelley said in terms that the timescale did not include “engineering analysis or redesign at this stage, it’s basically just documenting the existing prototypes to Honeywell standards”. He accepted this in his evidence and Mr Cummings agreed that Mr Shelley was just transferring drawings at this stage and not doing any developments or modifications. It seems to me that Mr Shelley’s recollection about making simple changes to the parts relates to a later stage of the process of drawing transfer.  </p>

It seems to me that Mr Shelley’s detailed spreadsheet is more likely to be accurate. What that shows in terms of time needed to complete the task is that another 1,751 hours were needed between Mr Shelley and Mr Vorwald.  It is to be noted in the context of Mr Bland’s complaint about the absence of FMEAs that the timescale includes 280 hours in total for detailing FMEAs, including of the mechanical design (Mr Shelley with Mr Chevalier) and of the mechanical assembly (Mr Shelley with Mr Gibson).</p>

A further update was produced on 16 January 2002 which showed a reduction to 1592 hours. Again as a rough guide (as Mr Shelley confirmed in evidence) this suggests in a period of a month (when Newhouse was closed for two weeks over Christmas and New Year) some 50 hours of work on drawings.</p>

Mr Shelley was already effecting simple changes to develop for manufacture during the process of drawing transfer. It is clear from the issues raised by this diagram that, by this stage, Mr Shelley had a reasonable grasp of the design. He had also appreciated that design changes would be needed not just to make the ULS manufacturable but for soft tooling, although he had obviously not appreciated the extent of the changes and development required as identified by the latch experts for the purposes of this litigation. Mr Chevalier accepted in evidence that the diagram was of steps to be taken after the design transfer took place and that the next step after such transfer would be tolerance analysis to ensure that the tolerances were suitable for tooled as opposed to machined production. </p>

In his witness statement (on which he was not challenged) Mr Shelley identified these as changes to the clutch plate, the gear cap and the retention plates. Mr Chevalier wanted to use elastomer on the lower retention plate to absorb noise and rubber in the strengthening grooves. Mr Shelley also said that they discussed sealing the gasket between the upper retention plate and the lower housing to reduce noise. In his oral evidence, he said there was some discussion about springs but Mr Chevalier did not have any calculations available at the time. Thus, it is clear that Mr Chevalier had started to propose changes to the design, concerned not only with soft tooling and manufacturability, but in particular the issue of noise raised by a number of OEMs, before Honeywell had completed the transfer of the drawings as they stood in August 2001.</p>

From the notes of that, a similar aggressive timetable emerges, with the start of production date for the Rover RDX60 in the first quarter of 2004. This would require production acceptance by 1 October 2003, which allowing for 12 months for the design, development and debugging of a complex production line would require the assembly line to be ordered by 1 October 2002. That in turn required the start of design validation by 1 July 2002.  This seems to me to demonstrate a continuing lack of appreciation by Honeywell that significant design development work was required before any soft tooled build could take place.</p>

On the spreadsheet those items were shown as “USA” and the timings previously entered for them were taken out. As Mr Shelley said in his covering e-mail “note this timescale is only to detail as per JP’s design info.. modifications to improve manufacturability/reduce piece part count will extend timeline, plus USA will have to add times in for their remit”.</p>

However even allowing for drawing responsibility transferred to Freeport and for the removal of the FMEAs having reduced timings, the outstanding time required had reduced dramatically to 730 hours. Comparison with the previous update at 16 January 2002 shows that a substantial number of drawings had now been completed.  In very broad terms that comparison reveals some 400 hours of work in that period.</p>

This is borne out by a number of contemporaneous documents. Thus on 11 April 2002 Mr Hayes e-mailed Mr Chevalier saying that Honeywell was now reviewing options for soft tooling suppliers, expecting to be ready to order for 22 April. Any tweaks or adjustments by Mr Chevalier to the design would need “definition”, in other words a design freeze in the next 2 to 4 weeks. </p>

As I understand it, JP has made recent drawing modifications and no one is sure of the latest revision of each part. How are we going to know when the design is frozen so we can order soft tools?” When these documents were put to Mr Chevalier he did not deny that he was making design changes at this time. He just said that Honeywell had not finished the design transfer.</p>

Thus, for example on 2 May 2002, he sent Mr Chevalier some jpeg files showing a change to the spring retaining clips on the lower retention plate made at a supplier’s request. In the same e-mail he mentioned other changes Honeywell was considering. He also asked Mr Chevalier to send him a set of the latest drawings (i.e. including all the design modifications Mr Chevalier had made)  as he would soon be conducting tolerance studies and finalising drawings for the production of soft tooled parts. Mr Chevalier’s response the same day was that the modified files would be sent to Mr Shelley some time the following week once Mr Chevalier had settled into his new flat. Mr Shelley’s evidence in his witness statement (again not challenged) was that Honeywell was still waiting for the revised drawings a month later. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was significant because, at that time in early May 2002, it was contemplated by those managing the project, Mr Cummings, Mr Hayes (who was about to replace Mr Cummings as project manager) and Mr Bur that once drawing transfer was completed in May, soft tools and prototype equipment would be purchased in June and July and the prototype build off soft tools would take place in August 2002.  This intention appears from Mr Bur’s update sent to Mr Hayes and Mr Cummings on 2 May 2002 and Mr Hayes’ e-mail of 3 May 2002, setting out his input for an ALS review with Mr Wright. What was entailed in terms of any design work was what Dr Turnbull referred to in his evidence as “relatively small changes to the overall design” to improve manufacturability. A similar picture emerges from an e-mail circulated by Mr Cummings on 9 May 2002 headed “ALS platform-mechanical design activity”, from which it is also clear that the activity contemplated included a tolerance analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By May 2002 Mr Shelley and Mr Vorwald had substantially completed the transfer of Mr Chevalier’s drawings in relation to the lower half of the latch (the mechanical sub-assembly). This is apparent from the last version of Mr Shelley’s drawing history spreadsheet dated 30 May 2002. This shows the drawings for which they were responsible as completed and provides an estimate of 185.25 hours as the time now needed to develop Honeywell drawings from Mr Chevalier’s design for soft tools (piece parts only) for the lower latch. In contrast a longer time is shown of 437 hours for work (principally in Freeport) to develop Honeywell drawings for the soft tools on the upper latch. This is because that included items where Mr Chevalier had not provided drawings, such as the housing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The upshot is that the process of drawing transfer took Honeywell between 8 and 9 months from early September 2001 until sometime in May 2002. Before considering whether that time was so excessive as to amount to unreasonable delay in breach of Article 4.5, I should deal with the allegation that Honeywell ought not to have undertaken this exercise at all.  This allegation was essentially founded on the evidence of Mr Bland to the effect that it was only necessary to produce a 3D model, because in his experience, toolmakers and component manufacturers would receive the computerised model and work off that. Production of an appropriate model would have taken four weeks, which Mr Bland regarded as generous, given that Mr Spurr had produced a ProE model in 23 hours.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there are two principal fallacies in this allegation. First Honeywell can hardly be seriously criticised for doing what it did, given that it had a specific contractual obligation under Exhibit 4 of the JCA to transfer the drawings into the internal Honeywell format. Mr Chevalier tried to counter that by saying that transfer was not the same as re-drawing from scratch. However the answer to that was to be found in Mr Shelley’s evidence that, in the absence of a translation package, in order to recreate on Honeywell’s system a live parametric model and drawings, it was necessary to engage in the task he performed. Mr Bland’s four week exercise would simply create a “dead” 3D model which would not be parametric.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, Mr Bland’s evidence that toolmakers and component manufacturers would only need to work off the 3D model is against the weight of the other evidence.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Spurr’s evidence was that the modelling exercise that took 23 hours was the one he undertook earlier this year referred to in Appendix 19 to Mr Drysdale’s report. It involved taking the ALS drawings and producing a 3D solid parametric model. The double size prototype he helpfully produced in his evidence in Court was then made, by sending the CAD data to the prototype shop.  He said of soft tooled prototypes, that he would send the CAD data to tool makers who would do most of tool designs from it. Drawings would follow with critical dimensions that require greater control.  He expanded on this in re-examination, adding that a great deal more work would be required beyond the 23 hours to produce detailed drawings and to produce a meaningful model so that any future modifications to the parts could be undertaken, without completely remodelling them. </p>

In the circumstances, I much prefer the evidence of the other witnesses to that of Mr Bland. Furthermore, no doubt had Honeywell merely created a 3D model and then found, as seems likely, that toolmakers or component manufacturers required 2D drawings, ALS would have complained that Honeywell had failed to comply with its obligation to transfer the drawings to its system. </p>

However, common sense would suggest that it would not be simply a question of halving the time taken. As Mr Drysdale said, the task would still take between three and six months.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact of course, the transfer took between eight and nine months. As to why this was so, ALS inevitably pointed the finger at Mr Shelley’s involvement in other projects, specifically Valeo, and Mr Cummings’s assessment in January 2002 that Mr Shelley had only a 60% commitment to the ULS project. As I have already indicated, I suspect that Valeo and Mr Shelley’s other commitments may well have intruded, but did so to a greater extent in the first few months leading up to December 2001. After about December 2001, it seems to me that his own Drawing History updates demonstrate a substantial commitment to the ULS project. </p>

It would be unreal to expect a mechanical design engineer of Mr Shelley’s obvious competence to drop everything else. ALS sought to rely upon Mr Mitchell’s call for a “tiger team” dedicated to the ULS, but that was an ideal, not a contractual requirement. Certainly prior to the Rover nomination in February 2002, there was no particular urgency attached to the project.</p>

Accordingly, as I see it, some leeway is permissible on my figure of 4 months for the transfer to take account of the involvement of the personnel engaged on the drawing transfer in other projects and perhaps some additional time to allow for their lack of experience of the ULS, at least at the start of the process. An overall period of 5 months or so would not seem untoward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were also some design changes made by Mr Chevalier or by Mr Shelley himself in the period of design transfer after the meetings on 13 to 15 March 2002, which probably delayed completion of the drawing transfer by Mr Shelley and Mr Vorwald by a few weeks. Thus the time which should have been taken for the transfer was about 6 months overall, rather than the 8 to 9 months actually taken. However, when this is being considered in the context of allegations of breach of the JCA, there is an important caveat. Some of the design changes which Mr Chevalier had started to effect from March 2002 onwards were responsive to actual or perceived requirements of MG Rover. It is not suggested that the obtaining of the RDX 60 nomination was in any sense delayed by drawing transfer not having been completed.</p>

Thus in my judgment, the correct analysis is that, allowing for those design changes, the drawing transfer should have completed by about the middle of March 2002, some two months or so before it did. Thus, at the end of the drawing transfer in May 2002, there was a breach of Article 4.5 by Honeywell in the sense that that transfer had taken two months longer than it should have done.</p>

By way of overview, at the outset of this period, it was contemplated that once the design was frozen (which it was anticipated would be later in May 2002) there would be a full tolerance analysis of the entire latch (estimated to take 22 days) and then a design review, before going out to soft tooling which was due to commence at the latest in the first week in July 2002. This is clear not only from Mr Shelley’s diagram of the issues for the meetings with Mr Chevalier between 13 and 15 March 2002, but also from the proposed plan sent out by Mr Cummings on 9 May 2002. In the event, the drawings for soft tooled prototypes were not sent out to toolmakers and component suppliers until December 2002 and January 2003 and were sent out without any tolerance analysis or design review having taken place.</p>

On this question as on so many other issues in the case, the parties’ positions are polarised at opposite extremes. Honeywell’s case is that the delay was caused by constant changes to the design made by Mr Chevalier and further delay in his signing off the drawings. As a consequence, the design was not frozen until very late and the urgency to get drawings out to toolmakers and component suppliers in order to build a prototype latch to take back to Volkswagen was such that it was not possible to do any tolerance analysis or design review. Other matters also delayed progress such as the absence of a detailed specification from MG Rover.</p>

I propose to examine these issues under various headings, design changes, the housing, resources, further dealings with OEMs and process development.</p>

By reference to this e-mail, Mr Douglas suggested to Mr Shelley that no design changes were being made by Mr Chevalier at this stage, but Mr Shelley disagreed.

Mr Douglas sought to suggest to Mr Hayes in cross-examination that what this contemplated was reverse engineering, in other words prototype build first, followed by tolerance analysis afterwards.

These were changes to the design of the claw and pawl to prevent so-called slam locking.

When it was put to Mr Chevalier that there was pressure on him to sign off the drawings, his original extreme and obviously inaccurate response was that there were no drawings to sign off, but he did then agree that there was pressure to sign off and had been for some time. This evidence ties in with Mr Bur’s e-mail to Mr Shelley and Mr Maxwell of the same date, saying he would like formally to get Mr Chevalier to sign off on the drawings, to freeze the design.

He went on that freezing the design was a few weeks away from completion on the bottom half of the latch. The reasons for this were (i) that Mr Chevalier had not finalised the design changes, a problem which had cost the plan probably about three weeks due to sitting down with Mr Chevalier along with potential latch builds into Volkswagen doors; (ii) Honeywell then had to modify the models and detailed drawings to suit the new upper and lower retention plates (to which some of Mr Chevalier’s changes related); (iii) tolerance analysis had to be completed on critical areas.</p>

However, I consider that, viewing the matter objectively, the design changes had in fact delayed the plan for more than three weeks. After all, the reason why the design freeze is still a few weeks away is, inter alia, Honeywell’s need to modify the models and detailed drawings in the light of design changes. It seems to me that the reality is that, without ascribing any blame for design changes to anyone, those changes, together with the need to do a tolerance analysis, which at least in Mr Shelley’s assessment, could only be done once there was a fixed design, had set the plan back by six weeks or so. Mr Shelley’s estimate of three weeks delay was thus something of an under-estimate.</p>

Mr Shelley was now assessing that such a freeze on the bottom half of the latch was a few weeks away i.e. some time towards the end of August 2002. ALS itself put forward no specific explanation for delay in the design freeze on the bottom half between early July and mid to late August as having been caused by anything other than changes in design. Problems with the housing (to which I will return) cannot account for delay in a design freeze on the mechanical portion of the latch, despite Mr Chevalier’s attempt to contend that in his evidence. </p>

This is demonstrated by what Honeywell correctly describes as the somewhat self-serving terms of his e-mail of 17 August 2002, containing the suggestion that the changes had been explained to Mr Shelley’s full satisfaction on 15 August 2002 and should require “a maximum of one to two working days to complete”. </p>

The reality is that by this stage of the project, Mr Chevalier had realised that a lot of changes to the design would be required before there could be a soft tooled build and he did not want to be blamed for the delay.  It is of some significance in this context that the e-mail of 24 August 2002 also appears to be the first time that Mr Chevalier suggested that design changes were Honeywell’s responsibility and that, because Honeywell engineers had not complied with that responsibility, he had had to effect the necessary changes himself. </p>

Significantly, in view of his attempt in evidence to blame all the problems with the housing on Honeywell and, specifically, Mr Maxwell, he did not seek to blame any of this need for more work on Mr Maxwell (a matter to which I return below).  He suggested two options. The first was that he should make the changes on Auto CAD, but the drawbacks with that were that he would have to explain the drawings to Mr Shelley and that Mr Shelley would then have to transfer them into ProE. That would set the project back by a further six weeks at least. That statement is an interesting one as it seems to me to be a realistic recognition at the time of what Mr Chevalier steadfastly refused to accept in his evidence, that the process of transfer of the drawings and specifically of transferring changes into ProE was a complex and time-consuming one. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a clear perception within Honeywell that the design changes which Mr Chevalier was making were delaying the project. As Mr Ricks put it, in forwarding Mr Chevalier’s report to other members of the team: “the never ending design saga continues”.  Mr Bur admitted in evidence that by this stage, the perception within Honeywell was that the design changes being made by Mr Chevalier were creating a “serious problem with the timetable in relation to Rover”.  On 18 October 2002 Mr Bur made a presentation to Mr Mitchell and others for the purposes of preparing some costings for Volkswagen in which he described the design of the MG Rover design (“base latch”) as “not complete-2 weeks away” (as it transpired another under-estimate) and that the design needed to be finalised before Honeywell could get further procurement quotations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During October 2002, Mr Chevalier made a number of further changes to the design, particularly to the lower housing. This prompted Mr Ricks to send an e-mail on 28 October 2002 saying that they were “already 4 weeks behind schedule with releasing the soft tooling orders because of continued design modifications and changes.” Mr Ricks said he appreciated Mr Chevalier’s desire to design the housing to get the quietest latch possible, but made the point that the priority had to be MG Rover. In effect he was saying that the housing design could be improved later because MG Rover was not as concerned about noise as other OEMs.  At around the same time as Mr Ricks’ e-mail, Mr Hayes observed on 30 October 2002 that procurement of prototype components was “on hold” pending the finalisation of the mechanical design. Mr Bur accepted in evidence that everything was on hold at the end of October 2002 until the drawings were finalised and released.</p>

His own evidence was that he did not sign off drawings in December 2002, but only signed off some drawings a few months later. Somewhat surprisingly in view of that evidence, Mr Douglas put to Mr Shelley that Mr Chevalier had indeed signed off A3 prints of the drawings at design freeze meetings (so described by Mr Ricks in an e-mail of 27 November 2002) in London between 18 and 22 November 2002 [ i.e. in week 47]. Mr Shelley agreed that a meeting had taken place, the purpose of which was for Mr Chevalier to sign off the drawings, but when the Honeywell representatives arrived, there were more changes made to the parts by Mr Chevalier. Mr Shelley did not think drawings for the full latch were signed off at the meeting. Mr Bechtold confirmed this. He said Mr Chevalier would not sign off, because of changes to the clutch and other changes he wanted to make.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In the event, the signing off of at least some of the drawings seems to have taken place on a piecemeal basis. In its written Closing Submissions, Honeywell said that it had identified 33 drawings with Mr Chevalier’s signature on them, which was not challenged by ALS. Thus, it appears the process may never have been formally completed, but Honeywell started sending out drawings to toolmakers and parts suppliers during the course of December 2002, in effect some five months later than anticipated and then without the tolerance analysis or design review contemplated by Mr Cummings and Mr Hayes having taken place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">ALS (principally through the expert evidence of Mr Bland) was critical that no such tolerance analysis and design review (i.e. development of a DFMEA) had taken place before Honeywell went out to soft tooling. That is an issue to which I shall have to return in more detail in the context of examining the reasons for the failure of the soft tooled build. However for the present I should record that the delay which had taken place in effecting a design freeze (which to the extent it took place at all did not occur until December 2002) was such that, in order to try to meet the deadlines on a successful prototype build imposed by the requirements of MG Rover and Volkswagen (to which I refer below), there was insufficient time to carry out a full tolerance analysis or a design review before going out to soft tooling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of the cause of the delay of five months in going out to soft tooling, I have no real doubt that the cause was the numerous changes in design. Mr Douglas for ALS sought to argue that Honeywell had exaggerated both the extent of the changes and the time taken. He relied on Mr Drysdale’s assessment that the changes made to the design were not all that significant and that the design of the ULS was still nowhere near ready for the soft tooled build when that took place. Mr Drysdale may be right in absolute terms, but the fact remains that, however significant the changes were, they took time, not only for Mr Chevalier and others to make them but for them then to be incorporated into the ProE model and drawings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question remains as to who is responsible for the delay which occurred whilst these changes were made and in the meantime no design freeze took place. At the time and in his evidence, Mr Chevalier sought to blame Honeywell for the delay, essentially in two respects. First he contended that Honeywell and specifically Mr Abanni Maxwell had effectively embarked on a frolic of its own taking time producing a design of housing which was useless in the sense that it did not solve the problem of noise encountered with some of the functions of the latch. Second he contended that the problem was the lack of experience and expertise of the Honeywell engineers, a return to the theme of inadequacy of resources, in circumstances where the development of the design was Honeywell’s contractual responsibility. These contentions were essentially adopted by ALS in its closing submissions. I shall consider each in turn.</p>

Whilst I accept that the full significance of what Mr Chevalier was saying in his evidence may not have been appreciated by Honeywell, the fact remains that the allegation that Honeywell had frequently changed the design of the latch without ALS’s written consent, in Paragraph 27(13) of the Amended Particulars of Claim, did include an allegation about changes to the design of the housing. </p>

In cross-examination, Mr Chevalier sought to contend that when he went to Newhouse on this visit, he found that Mr Maxwell had completely redesigned the housing which was a block of plastic.

What is conspicuously absent from that e-mail, is any suggestion that this was some entirely new and flawed design for the housing which Honeywell had developed without his knowledge or consent. Mr Maxwell made some of the changes which Mr Chevalier was suggesting in that e-mail and others were the subject of discussion between them, as appears from Mr Maxwell’s e-mail of 27 August 2002.</p>

It is clear from that report that substantial changes were made to the design of the housing at those meetings and that those changes were being led by Mr Chevalier. This is entirely what one would expect and accords with what he said, at one point in his evidence, to the effect that he did not see it as the job of people like Mr Shelley to come up with changes in design, but rather that he, Mr Chevalier, would provide instructions on changes.

This evoked the immediate response from Mr Chevalier: “Abanni.  The housing looks neat-excellent”. In evidence Mr Chevalier tried to explain this away, saying the engineers were under pressure, so he had to give them compliments, but that he had never thought it was an excellent design. I did not find that evidence at all convincing. It seems to me that the e-mail from Mr Chevalier reflected what he thought at the time, although of course that is inconvenient for the case he is now seeking to run.</p>

This Mr Chevalier considered contrary to his clear instructions and said that this work would have to be scrapped and re-done. In response, Mr Ricks sent an e-mail pointing out that the number one priority had to be finalising the design for the sake of the Rover program and that with several more weeks of design and time to build the moulds for the housing, there would not be initial housings available until the end of December. Since prototypes were due in January, this would leave no slack time in the schedule. Changes to the housing to reduce noise could be made later.</p>

He accused Honeywell engineers of being unable to follow clear guidelines (meaning from him) and to want to introduce endless modifications and fruitless ideas which have to be scrapped and the work revert to the original design. He said that Mr Maxwell had been working on the housing for more than six months and 90% of his work was totally erroneous and had to be scrapped and redone again.</p>

In my judgment it does not, but rather is illustrative of the sort of distorted exaggeration to which Mr Chevalier was prone time and again in his oral evidence, whenever he felt that he or his invention were being criticised.  I consider that a much more accurate and measured assessment of the design of the housing was given by Mr Shelley, who said in evidence that it still needed some work on it, but the suggestion of 90% change was way too high. He thought that the changes required were probably due to Mr Chevalier having ideas on dampening sound, because he knew that otherwise there were going to be problems with noise from gear train ratios and other matters. In other words, the changes were required to endeavour to make a quieter latch.</p>

Mr McQuater correctly suggested to Mr Chevalier that what he was complaining about there was the fact that Mr Maxwell had gone off at something of a tangent over the last few weeks. Mr Chevalier’s reaction in his evidence was to reiterate his theme that the housing was useless.</p>

In cross-examination he accepted that he was reasonably happy with the housing at that date. Although in re-examination he sought to resile from that somewhat and to say that there were still errors in design that prevented it being assembled correctly, it seems to me he was indeed reasonably happy with the housing at the time. </p>

Even if Honeywell did develop the design of the housing, Mr Chevalier was fully aware of what was happening and was directing the development of the design. In this regard, I accept entirely the evidence of Mr Shelley, who although not directly concerned with the housing, was intimately involved with the process of design change. He said that Mr Maxwell did not create his own design but was following instructions from Mr Chevalier, that Mr Chevalier was the design leader on the full project with overall design control and although there were some problems with the housing that persisted, Mr Chevalier’s complaints about 90% of the design of the housing having to be scrapped were exaggerated. </p>

However, I do not consider that any real delay to the project was caused by Mr Maxwell’s work (since Mr Chevalier was still making other changes to the design at that time) and in any event do not consider that it can even begin to be said that what Mr Maxwell was doing constituted a breach of the JCA by Honeywell.</p>

I have already concluded that although the contractual obligation of Honeywell was to take all reasonable actions to develop the design from wherever it was at the date of the JCA to make it manufacturable, the question of what is reasonable depends upon all the circumstances. Those include the fact that, as I have also concluded, Honeywell was misled by Mr Chevalier as to the state of the design of the latch. That considerable additional design work was required before any soft tooled prototype build, only really emerged during the period from about March 2002 onwards and then in a piecemeal fashion, without as Mr McQuater put it, a “Eureka moment”. The message from Mr Chevalier himself as to how much design work was required was a contradictory one.</p>

Accordingly, I do not consider that Honeywell can be criticised for not having a latch expert in place in the period between March 2002 and December 2002 when changes to the design were being made. In the absence of such an expert, as Mr Chevalier accepted in his evidence, he had to lead the design process.</p>

Mr Chevalier was jealous of his design and clearly regarded himself as the only person who should make any changes to it, a concern reflected in the “design veto” in item 7 of the Scope of Work at Exhibit 4 to the JCA. I consider that this process of having to filter all changes or modifications or improvements through Mr Chevalier inevitably caused delays in the project at various stages, including at this time in the second half of 2002. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That is not the same thing as saying that Mr Chevalier was obstructive about changes (a suggestion Mr Douglas was keen to refute), just that, because he wanted to have overall control of the design, the process of making changes inevitably took more time than if Honeywell had been free to make changes unimpeded. Nor, in my judgment, is there any question of ALS (through Mr Chevalier) having been in some way in breach of the JCA by reason of the design changes. The only issue which matters is whether the delay between May and December 2002 caused by the design changes is a matter which is attributable to a breach of contract by Honeywell. I am very clearly of the view that it is not. In circumstances where the changes were all being either made by or at the least controlled by Mr Chevalier, it is difficult to see what else Honeywell could have done.</p>

As noted in Section IX above, by June 2002, a number of new Freeport personnel had come on board, described by Mr Hayes in an e-mail of 24 June 2002 to Mr Chevalier as a “small army”. These engineers were trained by Mr Chevalier in small groups on the workings and design of the latch. So much training had gone on that by 25 June he was looking to change the format to larger groups of 10 or 15, because training smaller groups was taking up too much of his time. No doubt appreciating that this was inconsistent with his case at trial that Honeywell was under-resourced throughout, he tried to claim rather bizarrely in his oral evidence that this had been Mr Kettle’s idea not his. That suggestion was refuted by Mr Kettle. </p>

In his evidence Mr Chevalier reserved his criticism for Mr Maxwell and the housing, but I have already held that criticism was unjustified. So far as Mr Bechtold is concerned, at one stage in November 2002 Mr Chevalier was highly critical of his competence, at a time when he (wrongly) thought that Mr Bechtold was trying to claim intellectual property in changes to the design of the clutch. As with Mr Maxwell and the housing, this was indicative of the protective attitude Mr Chevalier maintained towards his invention. Whenever he felt that Honeywell design engineers were encroaching on his territory of the design of the ULS, he had a tendency to become prickly and critical. </p>

He also accepted that, to an extent in the absence of anyone at Honeywell who was an expert in latch design, he would have to lead the process. </p>

Mr Kettle told Mr Cox they were demonstrating the latch to Land Rover on 28 May.  He asked the Jaguar representatives whether there was any feature they would like on the latch that was not there and they could not think of any. Mr Henshaw of Jaguar also referred to their interest in passive entry and power opening because that was the way the market was going.

The meeting went well but representatives from the core latch engineering group of DaimlerChrysler who had been invited to the meeting did not turn up. It was put to Mr Kettle that, since DaimlerChrysler was in German ownership and Mercedes had a strong relationship with Kiekert, it would have been difficult for Honeywell to break into DaimlerChrysler. Mr Kettle would not accept that, at least in relation to Viper, which had its own specific latch requirements. However in relation to DaimlerChrysler generally, it seems to me that the non-attendance of their representatives speaks volumes and suggests very strongly that, at least whilst under German ownership, the group would have been unlikely to want to contract with Honeywell.</p>

This evidence was confirmed by Mr Hayes, who said that the problem was the absence of any test specification. Honeywell had pulled together the information it had, which was limited so far as the mechanical performance expected of the latch was concerned, and put together a specification which it presented back to MG Rover.</p>

Mr Hayes had prepared a draft specification from which he prepared a summary, which he sent to Mr Alder on 20 August 2002. Although Mr Alder claimed in his evidence that MG Rover had provided a test specification but that Honeywell had rewritten its own and he had wondered why, he does not seem to have raised such a query with Mr Hayes. Rather, as Mr Hayes told the team on 5 September 2002, Mr Alder approved the summary, but MG Rover was still trying to pull together the test specification. Mr Johnson also reported on a meeting with MG Rover the same day at which the electrical specification, which was already late, was still not provided.</p>

MG Rover asked Honeywell for a statement with respect to the RDX 60 programme, which was provided in an e-mail from Mr Hayes of 11 February 2003.  Amongst other things, Mr Hayes complained about difficulties in obtaining information. It is clear that the difficulties in obtaining detailed specifications from MG Rover did cause some delay to the project, specifically, as stated by Mr Bechtold in September 2002, the ordering of equipment and tooling was very difficult in the absence of a fixed specification requirement. In reality, that delay coincided with the delay in sending out drawings for the soft tooled build, because of the changes in design which were being made. Either way, in my judgment the delay was not caused by any breach of contract on the part of Honeywell.</p>

Honeywell was to deliver to MG Rover by the end of November 2002 200 or so prototype latches manufactured off soft tools. As has been seen, changes in design delayed the project.  There was also an issue as to who was to pay for the 200 or so latches. Honeywell expected either MG Rover or TWR (to whom MG Rover had sub-contracted the RDX 60 programme) to do so. Mr Kettle chased Mr Devlin as to who was going to place the order for these latches in e-mails on 26 September 2002 and 22 November 2002. This question had not been resolved at the time that MG Rover suspended the RDX 60 programme in January 2003, as is apparent from the report Mr Hayes sent MG Rover on 11 February 2003. </p>

This had first been raised by MG Rover at a meeting Mr Kettle had with them on 19 April 2002, at which they asked how quickly Honeywell would be in a position to supply latches for their existing 25, 45 and MGF models due to problems they were having with their existing latch supplier. The matter does not seem to have been raised again until around the time that the RDX 60 project was put on hold. However, from January 2003, both parties proceeded on the basis that this alternative was an active possibility, although no letter of nomination was provided by MG Rover prior to the termination of the JCA. </p>

The people met from Volkswagen apart from Mr Schrenke were Mr Meyer and Mr Petersen who Mr Kettle described as two of the decision makers in the Volkswagen latch department. The two Passat doors were returned fitted with the latches and one of them was used to demonstrate all the functions of the latch both mechanically and electronically. There are two e-mail reports of the meeting, one by Mr Kettle which exhibited his usual boundless enthusiasm and one by Mr Friedrich, which was more balanced and in my view more realistic. The meeting was undoubtedly a positive one. However, as Mr Kettle accepted in his evidence, two issues still remained for Volkswagen. They still thought that the latch was too noisy and were concerned about price. Mr Friedrich recorded that there would be no business opportunity for power closing unless those issues were resolved.</p>

On price, it was agreed that Volkswagen would send Honeywell the PQ46 programme [i.e. Passat] information in order for Honeywell to quote on that programme. Volkswagen was evidently working with Audi and Magna on a power closing latch but there were technical problems and concerns about price. If Honeywell was able to solve the two issues Volkswagen had, then Mr Friedrich records that Volkswagen would be open to considering a running change to use the ULS. Mr Kettle says in his e-mail report that if Honeywell could reduce the noise level during the power closing function, Volkswagen would like to work with them on the Passat programme.</p>

I will need to consider this in more detail when I address the quantum issues, but for the present I simply record, first that Mr Kettle accepted in evidence that, even after this meeting, there was still a long way to go and, second that Mr Friedrich records that Volkswagen expected new low noise electronically operated latches in January/February 2003 “to decide on the next steps”, suggesting to me that there was no question of Volkswagen committing themselves at this stage. It is clear that it was following the meeting that Mr Chevalier began to become particularly concerned with making changes in the design of the housing to ensure that noise problems were reduced and that prototypes of a quieter latch could be delivered to Volkswagen. </p>

However, there is no evidence from any of the relevant decision makers in Volkswagen as opposed to relatively junior engineers, that they were prepared to contract on the basis of these prices. For reasons which I will elaborate later, I have considerable doubts whether Volkswagen would in fact have been prepared to agree to pay the substantial differential between the price of the basic latch and the price of the premium latch.</p>

Furthermore, since it depends in large measure on the evidence of Mr Bland, which fell outside the Scope of Expert Evidence as ordered by the Court (and with whose evidence I was not in any event particularly impressed), it is an area which has to be approached with some circumspection. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I think it's important to clarify something. It’s a common misconception that Six Sigma is a quality process or a quality system.  That's not the case at all.  You've heard people talking about QS9000, TS16949, these are quality systems, the demand that you document things in certain ways and that you can prove to an auditor that you have followed what you say. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Someone once put it very succinctly to me. These processes say document what you do, and do what you document.  Whereas Six Sigma is different.  It's a set of tools, there's nothing new under the sun.  A set of tools, many of which have existed for a long time.  Some statistical, analytical, some more organisational, which you can use if and when appropriate in order to move any process or design forward. So they're the means to an end.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A.  It's a very good point.  I think QS for example clearly dictates that you should have -- you should use DFMEAs and PFMEAs and so on.  What's unique about Six Sigma is that rather than just applying certain tools because QS says it's the right thing to do, in Six Sigma, as I said, all the tools in Six Sigma are actually pretty old tools, FMEAs were developed by NASA on the Apollo missions in the 1960s.  But what Six Sigma does is it gives you a very logical path to follow in order to employ the tools at the right time in a project in order to solve certain problems or to answer certain questions. So there's a Six Sigma process that helps you decide when to apply certain tools, and the outcome of those tools will help you achieve the requirements of, for example, TS16949.</p>

Of course ALS can point to Mr Drysdale’s opinion that Honeywell should have had a DFMEA before going out to the soft tooled build, but Mr Drysdale also thought that ALS should have already developed a DFMEA itself at the time of the JCA, a matter on which he was not challenged.   Although Mr Chevalier had said at the meeting on 24 July 2000 that he had an FMEA, none was ever produced. Furthermore, at no stage of the project prior to the soft tooled build, despite his many criticisms of Honeywell, did Mr Chevalier suggest that Honeywell was at fault for not having a DFMEA.</p>

Mr Shannon was to prepare a draft and distribute it. The meeting with Mr Chevalier then took place and Mr Shannon said that it was a good starting point for a DFMEA. In fact the DFMEA was not started then. Mr Bur asked if there was a DFMEA on the mechanical sub-assembly and on 3 July 2002, Mr Shannon said no, but it was one of the things they had to start “ASAP”. Mr Shannon pointed out that what they did have was very detailed Process Maps and a Process Cause and Effect Matrix. Mr Shannon explained in his evidence that, initially, because they had thought that they had a finished design, they had focused on those design tools, which would be used for process or production development after design validation. </p>

In fact the first DFMEA was not produced until 24 January 2003. The reason why it was not produced before does not seem to me to be lassitude or neglect on the part of the Honeywell engineers. On the contrary, it is clear from their planning documents from May and June 2002, that a design review was intended to be completed before going out to soft tools. The real reason seems to have been the absence of a frozen design.</p>

The evidence of Mr Hayes and Mr Shannon was that Mr Chevalier was rather dismissive of the DFMEA and did not think it very valuable. It is important to have in mind that any changes to the design had to have the written approval of Mr Chevalier, so that even if a DFMEA threw up a problem which Honeywell considered required a change in design, the contractual position was that, unless Mr Chevalier approved it, Honeywell was not entitled to make it. This can be seen in the fate of the Honeywell suggestion that helical gears be used to make a quieter latch, one of the matters thrown up by the design review after the soft tooled build, as reflected in the Design Change Log, to which I will return later.</p>

Again the reason why no full analysis was done was that this was impeded by the constant design changes before December 2002.  That this was the case emerges clearly from a report that Mr Shannon made of a visit he, Mr Shelley and Mr Murchie made to Freeport between 2 and 6 December 2002 to discuss the Six Sigma aspects of the project with the engineers in Freeport.

In a particularly odd, somewhat incoherent and frankly unbelievable passage in his evidence, Mr Chevalier suggested that the reason why the soft tooled build failed was that Honeywell had made changes to the tolerances and clearances of his design, without his knowledge or consent, before they went out to soft tools, in the period between November 2002 and January 2003 and that is what caused the clashes in the build. He even claimed to have asked Mr Shelley why this was done and Mr Shelley had said “we changed everything for Six Sigma, that’s where the trouble started”. </p>

ALS sought to overcome this omission in its written Closing Submissions by suggesting that, in his Supplemental Witness Statement, Mr Shelley had not denied in terms that he had told Mr Chevalier that he had changed all the tolerances and drawings.  In my judgment, that is a very unsatisfactory approach. It is clear from what Mr Shelley was saying in his Supplemental Statement and in his oral evidence that the only changes to tolerances made were to pins and washers, following the limited tolerance analysis he did conduct. The 20 to 40 drawings he referred to were clearly those for pins and washers. If ALS had wanted to challenge this and suggest that changes made to tolerances were wholesale, let alone that Mr Shelley had admitted as much to Mr Chevalier, that could and should have been put fair and square to Mr Shelley in cross-examination.</p>

Rather, pressure of time was such that Honeywell decided to do the soft tooled build first with a view to getting prototype latches to MG Rover and Volkswagen within February 2003 if possible. This was confirmed by Mr Spurr in his evidence.</p>

This was put to Mr Shelley, it being suggested that Honeywell could have done tolerance analyses on parts as early as July 2002. In cross-examination, Mr Shelley said the main reason why this was not done was “workload”, but in re-examination he expanded on that and said that, to do tolerance analyses at an earlier stage, the design would have to be completed, but it was not and was constantly changing. I suspect that, if you were to do a tolerance analysis on a part which was worthwhile, you would have to know in advance that no further design changes to the particular part would be required. In any event, any suggestion that Honeywell’s failure to do this was a breach of the JCA seems to me unarguable.</p>

However, those problems, including tolerance issues, were identified during and after the build and, thereafter, in about May 2003 prototypes were successfully made with soft tooled components.  I do not see any basis for the contention that somehow the absence of these design processes caused delay to the project, let alone its failure. It may be that the cost of the project was increased, because of the wasted cost of the unsuccessful initial prototype build but that was not passed on to ALS.</p>

He also accepted that any changes in design had to be approved by him.  It was that approach by Mr Chevalier and the changes in design which it generated, that was responsible for the delay between the time when Honeywell had originally intended to go out to soft tools and the time when it actually did, not any breach by Honeywell of the JCA.</p>

On that basis, Honeywell should have been starting to order soft tooled components at about the end of September 2002, rather than when that process actually started, at the end of November/beginning of December 2002. Of course, if as ALS contends, there should have been a full tolerance analysis before that ordering process started, on the basis of how long Mr Shelley thought that process would take, it is doubtful whether the ordering would in fact have started any earlier than it did.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The process of ordering parts for the soft tooled build appears to have begun at the very end of November 2002. In fact during the period from September to December 2002, Mr Smillie the Honeywell procurement engineer, had prepared a full bill of materials and obtained prices from a range of suppliers from Newhouse and Freeport suppliers’ lists. He said in evidence that this was not easy, as he did not always have drawings and he pressed Mr Shelley and Mr Bechtold for drawings. He had a meeting on 18 December 2002 with Mr Chevalier, who had some ideas and leads. At around the same time, Mr Eaton was chasing up potential suppliers in the United States. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Smillie also explained the production parts approval process (“PPAP”) which was engaged in by Mr Martin Dalziel, another Honeywell engineer with whom he worked closely. In the period between January and March 2003, as prototype parts came in from suppliers, Mr Dalziel went through the PPAP, which involved checking the key dimensions of the parts against the drawings. Mr Smillie said Mr Dalziel went further and checked every dimension on every drawing. That this exercise had been carried out was borne out, as it seemed to me, by the documents in Trial Bundles T and U and by the spreadsheet produced by Mr Dalziel entitled “ALS VW Build: Parts Summary (21 Mar 03)”.  </p>

Rather, this was another point which emerged from Mr Bland’s expert report and from the experts’ meeting. Because it had not been a pleaded allegation, Honeywell did not call Mr Dalziel, but was able to address the points ALS was making, through producing the documents in Bundles T and U and through the evidence given by Mr Smillie. It was clear that, in so far as the allegation emanated from Mr Bland, he had only considered a fraction of the relevant documentation. </p>

This is a rather unsatisfactory way to leave an aspect of the case upon which Mr Bland placed some emphasis (albeit on the basis of limited information) and which, whatever ALS may now say, was never pleaded. </p>

It is evident from the Parts Summary, which is a living document, that discussions were held, for example with the manufacturers of the mouldings, PMP in Arbroath, after the build. This was confirmed by Mr Smillie, who said that Honeywell had used PMP for the housings because they had already made housings for the Valeo project, they met the correct standards and Honeywell had good experience of them. He said that there were subsequently many discussions between the Honeywell design department, PMP and Alumould who made the tooling, through to April 2003 to achieve good housings.</p>

Nor do I consider that there is any question of the decision to carry on with parts which may have been out of spec was in any respect being a breach of the JCA by Honeywell. It was an engineering judgment, which ALS cannot demonstrate was unreasonable.</p>

The circumstances in which Mr Shelley undertook these analyses were that Mr Shelley felt that work on the stack tolerances was necessary due to Mr Chevalier’s “<span style="font-style:italic">interesting thoughts</span>” on how the stacks would perform within the latch, as Mr Shelley put it in an e-mail to Mr Ricks of 27 January 2003. His evidence was that, at a meeting the previous week, he had asked Mr Chevalier how he would go about stack tolerances and Mr Chevalier had said he would make all the sizes nominal, and put a plus or minus tolerance on all parts. Mr Shelley’s view was that this would not work, because it would probably end up crushing the top washer, so he disregarded Mr Chevalier’s views.</p>

Second it contends that there was inadequate analysis of the ALS design by Mr Shelley and third it contends that (presumably in his rush to complete the drawings) he sent out drawings which contained mistakes or incorrect dimensions. </p>

Mr Shelley said in evidence that the first latches were “sloppy”, and he thought that a contributing factor may have been the fact that the actual pins obtained from the manufacturers were not plated, whereas the tolerance studies had made an allowance for plating. He accepted though that it was highly unlikely that the absence of plating alone had contributed to sloppiness.</p>

It was put to Mr Shelley that a revised drawing for one of the rivet pins was inconsistent with an earlier drawing, but Mr Shelley said that the earlier drawing was only a reference drawing which would not have been sent out to the part manufacturer.

At this point we suffered disaster - the PP pin bent when we were fitting the gear - the pin is supposed to spread open to clamp the gear internal diameter. Unfortunately this screwed up our whole latch unit completely so we're back at square 1 again on building the base latch.”</p>

I have already dealt with why Honeywell was justified in carrying out the prototype build when it did, but Mr Drysdale’s views of the design problems accord with the views expressed by the Honeywell personnel as to why the build failed.</p>

Presumably on ALS’s case, all changes to the design required according to a full tolerance analysis would have had to be approved in writing by Mr Chevalier. It must be a matter of complete speculation whether that approval would have been forthcoming. It has occurred to me that what this all demonstrates is that the problems encountered during this collaboration were not so much due to breach of the JCA by either party but inherent conflicts and unworkability within the structure of the contract itself. However, no specific submissions were addressed to me on that point and, in the light of my findings of fact, ALS’s case that changes in design made by Honeywell caused or contributed to the failure of the soft tooled build fails on the facts, so that it is unnecessary to say any more about that point.</p>

The tolerance analysis was completed by 5 February 2003 and on the basis of Mr Shelley’s evidence, the revisions to the drawings before they were sent out to parts manufacturers would have taken another five days or so.  That assessment is borne out by the fact that by 11 February 2003, as Mr Hayes confirmed in his evidence, he wanted the analysis and drawings completed and considered this was all too late. In an e-mail of that date which he sent to the team, he talks about focusing on getting sample latches (ideally 10) to Volkswagen by the beginning of March 2003.</p>

However, in his e-mail Mr Hayes also says he still does not have the pins and washers drawings and that he had talked to Mr Willi Krupp (who had taken overall charge of the relevant division of Honeywell at around this time) about getting Mr Shelley full time on the ULS until the drawings were done, to which Mr Krupp had agreed.</p>

Mr Hayes indicated his concern that this “really could place Honeywell in a poor light with both JP and also potentially our customer [VW]”.

In his e-mail to Mr Krupp he complained fairly bitterly about being fed up with having a small resource pool and, in a meeting report at this time, he assessed the risk of resources being tied up on other projects at 80%. Understandably, ALS seized on this as demonstrating that a serious problem with the project remained the lack of resources.  No doubt a continuing conviction that this was a serious problem was compounded by Mr Hayes’ somewhat evasive evidence in cross-examination, about the complaints that he made at the time in the period between February and May 2003, exhibiting an apparent inability to accept what he had said. This seemed to me to have more to do with not wanting to recall what must have been an unhappy time for him, with the prototype build failing, than with not telling the truth in the witness box.</p>

As I have already concluded, the real reason for the failure was the design of the ULS. By the time of the build itself, Honeywell had a full team in place, including Mr Spurr who attended the build. I have already concluded that there was good quality control and only a limited number of personnel needed to be involved in the actual build.</p>

It is also correct that after the failed attempt to hire other experts in the summer of 2002, the matter seems to have fallen off the agenda for a while. In a subsequent e-mail in May 2003, Mr Hayes refers to having energised this again with Dr Turnbull in November 2002, but says that due to “organisational changes” the opportunity to start the recruitment process in January 2003 had been lost and it was only then, in May, that they had started to re-interview. Mr Hayes was unable to recollect what those organisational changes were but it seems likely that this was the reorganisation that led to the forming of the Secure Vehicle Systems group (comprising both ULS and Valeo) of which Mr Willi Krupp became head in February 2003. </p>

I have already held that the failure to hire more experts in the summer of 2002 was not a breach of the JCA and I see no reason to reach a different conclusion in relation to position in the spring and summer of 2003.</p>

Given that only Mr Shelley was engaged on this exercise, it seems to me that it was incumbent on Honeywell to ensure that he was engaged on it full time and not distracted by other projects. To that limited extent, Honeywell was in breach of its obligation to act without unreasonable delay under Article 4.5 of the JCA. </p>

It is ALS’s case that in that event, Volkswagen would have agreed to use the ULS on the new Passat. I shall have to deal with that contention in more detail in relation to quantum, but suffice it to say I am sceptical about that proposition for a number of reasons, not least that problems with noise remained even after the DCL had identified issues with the design and it remains extremely unlikely that those problems with noise would have been resolved by early March 2003, even if the three months delay had not occurred.</p>

I will return to this question later when I consider the issue of termination and the correct construction of Article 10.1. However, even assuming in favour of ALS that it could have terminated in March or April 2003 for three months delay at that stage, the difficulty for it is that it did not do so and did not serve a notice until 11 September 2003, nearly six months later. I will consider the effect of that delay when I deal with the issue of termination later in the judgment. </p>

Although ALS in closing criticised Mr Spurr in a number of respects for having a negative approach, it was not seriously suggested to him in cross-examination that his description of the difficulties was exaggerated or wrong.

The multiplying of components on one stack magnified the sensitivity to tolerances, which had a cumulative effect compounded by lever tilt if there were any axial free-play. The inside and outside opening levers also sat on the pawl rivet and lever tilting had to be factored in. The lever ratio on the levers meant that a small variation in dimension at the rivet end resulted in a very large change in lever travel at the outside end. As explained by Mr Spurr, it multiplied the variation by a factor of 5, a problem which was complicated by lever tilt resulting from the tolerance issues around the pawl rivet. The build up on this stack clearly posed functionality and assembly problems.</p>

Mr Spurr also described in his evidence that in Rev E, he had resolved the problem with the sliding levers jamming by making the index a thick toothed arrangement, alleviating the need for the sliding levers to be so close together.

In the smaller latch design developed for the MG Rover models (the so-called Rev D of which more later) Honeywell resolved this problem by eliminating this stack altogether.

First, in the original design, the return spring for the intermediate sliding levers did not ensure that the levers returned to the correct position, which was critical. Part of the force of the spring was trying to lift the lever rather than slide it, which tended to cause jamming. This problem was again identified in the DCL. Honeywell solved it by introducing the so-called “scissor mechanism”, which applies the force as close as possible to the direction of the slider so that binding and jamming do not occur.

He showed in his demonstration at the beginning of his evidence how one side of the latch had to be assembled in a rather insecure way, then the upper retention plate added and the latch turned over and the same process repeated on the other side. Mr Drysdale’s view was that, in the original design, no consideration had been given to assembly or part count. That view resonates with Mr Shannon’s description of the latch as being like a Swiss watch in terms of the difficulty of assembling a lot of small moving parts.</p>

The solution which Honeywell came up with was the chassis, which supports the building of the latch from the bottom up in layers and is largely the reason it can now be assembled from one direction only. The chassis also protects most of the components from dust and water. Mr Drysdale thought this was a good idea involving a fundamental change. A number of other ideas were also developed by Honeywell for reducing part count. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Throughout the project, the noise of the latch particularly during power closure posed a challenge. A number of the OEMs to whom the latch was demonstrated expressed concern about noise. As Mr Spurr explained during his demonstration at the beginning of his evidence, the ULS as designed by Mr Chevalier had a relatively high speed small motor which tended to be noisy. That, combined with a straight cut spur gear with nine teeth or less, tended to cause an undesirable high pitched whining noise during power closing. He identified a number of other factors contributing to noise, including the alignment of the lower and upper housing. The motor was in the upper housing whereas the gear mesh was controlled in the lower housing. Gear alignment and tooth geometry were absolutely critical, in the sense that, unless they were precisely aligned, noise would result. In addition, the clutch sometimes creates a click and the tension springs create an unpleasant noise. </p>

In fact, in relation to the gear ratios and gear mesh, Mr Bechtold had already consulted gear specialists, Davall and Winzeler before the soft tooled build, who had identified issues with the gears. Mr Spurr’s main proposals to reduce the noise from the motor and gears were to substitute a larger motor and helical gears for the small motor and spur gears.  When he returned to the project in June 2003, Mr Chevalier rejected the ideas of the larger motor and helical gears. However, he did introduce helical gears for a prototype demonstrated to Jaguar in September and October 2003 and the VSS latch as it now is also uses helical gears.</p>

Mr Spurr considered that the housing remained a problem, because of the need to have the top and bottom halves fitting together and the need to achieve exact and repeatable alignment between the motor (in the upper housing) and the motor shaft bearing (in the lower housing). Any misalignment caused a big variation in noise. </p>

Instead of the gear being supported on the housing, it would be supported on the upper retention plate, then the motor would be inserted through a pocket in the housing. At the end of the collaboration, Honeywell had not completed this change, but Mr Spurr was looking at locating the motor directly on the upper retention plate. Some of this design work was done on the CAD model for Rev E, the version of the latch on which Mr Spurr was working at the very end of the collaboration, to cater for the problems of packaging the latch in the MG Rover doors, and which he said was presented to the ULS team in Power point on 15 December 2003.</p>

The quietest produced achieved a noise level of 62 decibels at one metre.  In July 2003, Mr Chevalier claimed to have successfully built a quieter latch which would satisfy Volkswagen with a noise level of about 45 decibels at one metre.

Mr Chevalier and Mr Kettle both claimed that VSS has more recently produced a latch which satisfies BMW’s requirements and that VSS is talking to BMW again.  Mr Kettle claimed that the problem had been the design of the sliders which had been changed. Mr Chevalier went further and said that BMW had said it would use the VSS latch at the next opportunity. No document was ever produced to support this assertion and I reject it. I do not consider that the noise issue has even now been resolved to BMW’s satisfaction.

After the evidence had concluded, but before the oral closing arguments, ALS produced a bundle of “up-date” documents about developments in relation to the VSS latch with various OEMs including Volkswagen. Honeywell objected to this material, so that I did not consider it in detail.  In its written Closing Submissions it was particularly critical of one document, the minutes of a meeting apparently between VSS, Inteva and Volkswagen dated 4 July 2008.

I will need to consider the status of the VSS latch post-collaboration in more detail later in this judgment, but it is also striking that Mr Drysdale did carry out a series of tests on the VSS latch earlier this year. His conclusion from his tests was that the latch would not satisfy any major European or US OEM in production. When these test results were put to Mr Chevalier, he made the outrageous statement that Mr Drysdale was biased. In view of the seriousness of that allegation, it is extraordinary that not only was that suggestion never put to Mr Drysdale, but his evidence about the testing was simply not challenged in cross-examination at all, nor was any contrary evidence from Mr Bland produced.</p>

I suspect that the real reason for this outburst, despite his denial, was the one Mr McQuater put to him, that his concern was that he should be present at all design meetings and that he wanted to assert his design authority.</p>

Mr Chevalier had sent an e-mail the same day complaining about all the defects in this latch, although it is interesting to note that in the power point presentation at the design review between 17 and 26 June 2003, it is suggested that the latches had had screws over-tightened at Mr Chevalier’s flat. When they were loosened, the latches functioned.</p>

I note from the written presentation for the design review, that Honeywell was in fact developing corrective actions for each of the points Mr Chevalier had raised.</p>

The history of this development, which coincided with Mr Spurr joining Honeywell, is dealt with by him in detail in his witness statement which was not substantially challenged by ALS in cross-examination. As a general observation at the outset of considering the course of this development, I consider that the work done by Honeywell on the Rev D latch gives the lie to the suggestion that there was no development work of any significance after June 2003.</p>

It appears that at this stage, Mr Chevalier considered that it was not possible to reduce the size of the latch. In an e-mail to Mr Hayes of 27 January 2003, Mr Spurr (who had just joined the project) said that he was not in a position to disagree with that, but he was not in favour of turning the latch upside down, which seemed to be the solution favoured by Mr Chevalier to fit the latch in the Rover doors.</p>

As he put it: “I recommend that we decline this opportunity as it adds considerable risk to the overall programme for a small sales value”. Mr Chevalier and Mr Kettle were critical of Mr Spurr in their evidence for what they regarded as a negative approach. </p>

Honeywell had not yet produced prototypes and to redesign a fair portion of the latch to meet the MG Rover package requirements could divert resources away from crucial aspects of testing and gaining credibility. That was a perfectly sensible and rational attitude to have. Ironically, in view of the fact that MG Rover went into administration in April 2005 and Nanjing Automotive Company who bought the company has yet to make any production vehicles, more than three years later, Mr Spurr’s cautious approach has proved correct.</p>

The following day, Mr Chevalier sent an e-mail to Mr Devlin of MG Rover (not copied to Mr Spurr) in which he said in effect that there would be no problem fitting the latch into the existing models. In the meantime, Mr Spurr had prepared a written installation feasibility report summarising the findings they had made, which demonstrated that a number of fundamental changes to the design would have to be made in order to make the ULS fit in the doors, and that a study was required to examine the effect and feasibility of those changes.  In an e-mail to Mr Chevalier on 5 February 2003, Mr Spurr said that he intended to present the document to MG Rover on the following day, when he had a meeting with Mr Scott Bradley (Closures Engineer at MG Rover).  This provoked an angry response from Mr Chevalier, indicating that he did not want Mr Spurr to make a unilateral approach to MG Rover.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, as MG Rover’s own packaging studies demonstrated, the ULS would not fit in the existing doors without either significant modification of the doors themselves, including moving the striker, or reduction in the size of the latch, limiting the modifications needed to the doors. Fairly obviously, the latter option was chosen.  By the last week of February 2003, Mr Spurr had two ideas for making the latch smaller and informed Mr Chevalier of this. Mr Chevalier replied that he was looking forward to exploring Mr Spurr’s solutions when they were ready.</p>

However, this is not supported by the contemporaneous documentation, which shows that Mr Chevalier did not at that stage consider that it was possible to make the ULS smaller. There is nothing to suggest that some smaller latch solution had been devised by Mr Chevalier. Indeed, his own response to Mr Spurr in late February demonstrates that it was Mr Spurr who was finding the solution. Mr Chevalier’s attempt to explain this away as “encouraging Mr Spurr to have ownership” rather than being negative, was frankly nonsense. Although he also asserted that he had CAD data showing that he had developed the smaller latch in October 2002, nothing was ever produced to support that assertion.</p>

I intended them to be introduced at the next stage of product development”. He then told MG Rover, incredibly optimistically, that Honeywell had almost completed the required changes to the ULS.</p>

His explanation in his evidence for the omission of Mr Spurr (with whom he had been corresponding fairly amicably over the previous few weeks about the design of the smaller latch), that he was annoyed with him about sending the report to MG Rover on 5 February 2003, made no sense at all.

This is really the beginning of a fairly irrational and confrontational approach to Mr Spurr (and later to Mr Kilker and to an extent Mr Krupp), culminating in Mr Chevalier’s decision to terminate the JCA, none of which was justified by their behaviour towards him. </p>

Even Mr Chevalier accepted that Mr Spurr had been positive about the reduced size latch when Mr Chevalier returned to the project.  The proposal for a Rev D latch was also discussed at the design review which took place between 17 and 26 June 2003. I had the distinct impression that, in its submissions, ALS focused only on those aspects of the design review which suited its case: concerns about resources and milestones which had the finish of product validation in November 2005. However, the power point presentation as a whole shows design work ongoing in all areas and the testing already undertaken and planned. As a whole it is upbeat and seems to me to give the lie to the suggestion that nothing happened on the project after Mr Chevalier’s return.  </p>

However, Mr Chevalier said this latch was still too noisy and not suitable for demonstration to customers.  Overall, Mr Kilker reported that Mr Chevalier rated the design review as 10/10 for management, 8/10 for content of presentation, and 7/10 for “quality with regards to his concerns”.</p>

In early July 2003, he sought to justify to Mr Spurr his failure to include him on the list of addressees for his e-mail on 27 March by saying that he was “careful [about] handing over design information that contained his ideas...”  This is much closer to the truth about why he did not copy Mr Spurr in on the e-mail than the explanation he gave in the witness box.</p>

Mr Spurr was surprised by this, since Mr Chevalier had never suggested anything of the sort during their discussions in February and March 2003.

The document does not say anything of the sort and this evidence seems to me to do no more than demonstrate the lengths to which Mr Chevalier was prepared to go to claim that every aspect of the design, including changes clearly made by Mr Spurr and Honeywell, was carried out by him. Although it is not strictly necessary to reach a decision on the point, I am quite satisfied that the original idea for design of the smaller version of the ULS which eventuated in the Rev D smaller latch was Mr Spurr’s idea, rather than Mr Chevalier’s, although some of the changes subsequently made to the Rev D design emanated from Mr Chevalier.</p>

Apart from the question of ownership of the smaller latch design, which I have dealt with, the other items were as follows: assisting Honeywell to put together at least two silent fully functional latches suitable for demonstration to customers, to discuss the time issue concerning delivery of prototypes and preparation of production for Rover, to discuss the pricing issue, to revisit ALS’s request to assist Honeywell to produce prototypes for the Rover models and to deliver the drawings relating to the changes required to fit the existing latch into the Rover doors.</p>

In the event, Messrs Spurr, Shelley, Bechtold and Vorwald were in London for the week of 21 to 24 July 2003, spending the mornings at a hotel and the afternoons at Mr Chevalier’s flat, the purpose being to complete the remodelling of the design of the smaller latch in ProE. Mr Spurr described these meetings as extremely positive and productive and Mr Chevalier agreed that the meetings were positive and professional. He also told Mr Krupp about the “good atmosphere and professional working style” of the team members who visited his flat.

These he expressed in a document described as a “Draft Installation Study” on 13 August 2003, which he circulated to all the team, including Mr Chevalier, for comment.

In a measured reaction to this accusation, Mr Spurr said that the installation study had taken place at Newhouse at the same time as Mr Chevalier was there building four “silent” latches, that at no time had he excluded Mr Chevalier, that they had in fact discussed various installation problems on the evening of 30 July and that he would have been available to discuss whatever Mr Chevalier required on the morning of 1 August, but Mr Chevalier had left early in the morning.

This suggestion was outrageous and wholly without foundation. However, it is an indication of the extent of Mr Chevalier’s paranoia about and dislike of “latch experts”, something which he had exhibited from the outset of the JCA.

From 13 August 2003 Mr Chevalier also excluded Mr Spurr from his e-mail circulation list because of his suspicions about a hidden agenda. This suggestion of a hidden agenda later developed into the even more serious suggestion that Mr Spurr had deliberately sabotaged the project, an allegation Mr Chevalier repeated in his evidence. This is as I have held wholly without foundation and it was quite improper of Mr Chevalier to make such allegations. It was not something which, quite rightly, Mr Douglas felt able to put to Mr Spurr in cross-examination.</p>

I find that, in this as in everything else, Mr Spurr had behaved in a proper and professional manner and was only doing what he had been employed by Honeywell to do.  In contrast, this incident and Mr Chevalier’s reaction, both at the time and in his oral evidence does him little credit. What it does demonstrate though, is that the relationship between the parties had disintegrated, through no fault of Honeywell’s. </p>

On 3 September 2003 Mr Kettle, Mr Krupp, Mr Kilker and Mr Spurr together with Mr Chevalier, attended an important meeting with nine executives from MG Rover at which the Rev D latch and Mr Chevalier’s installation study were presented. The latch received a positive reception, although there were design and packaging issues to be resolved. MG Rover pressed Honeywell on timing and it was indicated that Honeywell should be ready with a production latch within 12 to 14 months of an order from MG Rover to proceed. Mr Spurr regarded that somewhat aggressive timescale as unrealistic and risky.</p>

Mr Kilker’s evidence was that he thought not copying in Mr Spurr would delay the programme.  The fact that they had just had a very good meeting with MG Rover, but Mr Chevalier was excluding Mr Spurr, was the sign of a dysfunctional team. He said that team morale was shaky and that, if he was going to move the project forward, he needed Mr Chevalier as “the design gatekeeper” to work with the team. That all seems to me entirely reasonable.</p>

In his oral evidence, Mr Chevalier said that MG Rover had asked him technical questions about the reinforcement of the doors on the existing models and that he had arranged this follow up meeting. He had sent them technical explanations based on his work with Mercedes. He claimed that Mr Spurr and Mr Kilker had no idea what was expected of them; they might as well talk about the weather.  Given that this was all to do with whether the smaller latch would fit into the MG Rover doors, which was an issue with which Mr Spurr had been closely involved, Mr Chevalier’s assertion that this was something Mr Spurr knew nothing about, displayed breathtaking arrogance on Mr Chevalier’s part. I suspect that the reality was that he simply did not want Mr Spurr meeting MG Rover without his being there.</p>

He said MG Rover were disappointed, having been led by Mr Chevalier to believe that installation would not be a problem. Mr Spurr prepared an installation review which sought to address those issues on 15 September 2003, considering whether the “S-point” (the centre point of the striker) of the ULS could be moved. Mr Spurr and Mr Kettle attended a further meeting with MG Rover on 18 September 2003. Mr Spurr provided a further report on 29 October 2003 seeking to resolve continuing packaging and technical problems and attended a yet further meeting with MGR on 3 November 2003, to agree the technical solutions proposed. In his witness statement, Mr Spurr described the remaining packaging issues as having been “ironed out” by around the time of the 3 November 2003 meeting, evidence on which he was not challenged.</p>

On 29 October 2003, Mr Kettle attended a meeting with Mr Devlin, the purchasing manager of MG Rover, who was not happy about a proposed increase by Honeywell of 10% on the sale price of the latch. Mr Kettle recorded that Mr Devlin was still going ahead with the latch but wanted an explanation in writing of the proposed increase. Mr Kettle in evidence described this as a game, something Mr Devlin wanted for his bosses, because in fact the latch was still cheaper than what MG Rover were currently paying for their existing Meritor latch.</p>

At first sight this makes somewhat gloomy reading, since it says that although the proposal that the ULS should replace the current Meritor latch had been well received, it had foundered on two key issues, lead time and price.  In evidence, Mr Kettle accepted this was a setback, but was insistent that this did not mean that the proposal had been rejected. This was ramping up pressure to bring the price down, which was confirmed by Mr Alder. </p>

I was not impressed by any of this and preferred the evidence of Honeywell’s market expert Mr Brayshaw. His experience in the body structures market (clearly relevant here) was that it was the normal course of business to be supplied with doors and body structures, which were in free supply.

Accordingly, the doors were fitted with latches at Newhouse about 9 October 2003, with Mr Chevalier’s involvement. Mr Spurr discovered that Mr Chevalier had altered the latch software to reduce noise, but in consequence the latch would only operate at a door seal force of 100 Newtons. Mr Spurr recommended further work on the design but this did not happen with further latches fitted on 23 and 24 October 2003 and those latches stopped working correctly.</p>

The build was initially unsuccessful and some parts had to be shaved or smoothed before installation. Eventually on 13 November 2003, latches were fitted in a set of doors.  Mr Shelley said that the rear door latch was fully functional but noisy and the front door required tuning of connections and was also noisy. The general view of the team was that these latches were noisier than in previous builds, as recorded by Mr Murchie in a summary of the team’s findings dated 14 November 2003.</p>

That suggestion is as ridiculous as it is outrageous and again, as with Mr Spurr, it is noticeable that Mr Douglas did not put that case to Mr Kilker (or for that matter Mr Krupp).

He had a number of criticisms of Newhouse and said that the “team has not been correctly resourced until May ‘03”. In cross-examination, he said that he had picked up that the only timeline was out of date and the dates were “blown through” and that he wanted a new timeline with dates that would be adhered to.

That seems to me to be an important point, which is echoed in what Mr Krupp said about his requests for further resources at a slightly later stage, that these were looking to the future of the project.</p>

To be fair to Mr Hayes, he had clearly been working to a tight timetable in trying to get the soft tooled prototypes built in time to present them to Volkswagen. I had the distinct impression that Mr Kilker did not think much of Mr Hayes’ management skills. That emerged from the second document on which ALS placed much reliance, a graphically worded and somewhat acerbic e-mail from Mr Kilker to Mr Erickson of 5 June 2003 in which he talks about the confusion in the team and the fact that there is no time line or action register and no solid direction. He had given Mr Hayes a completed time line and a much more logical action register (more logical that is than the DCL). In cross-examination, Mr Kilker said that, putting it in perspective, he was new to the programme, did not know all the team members and would have expected the DCL to give the names of the people responsible and target dates.</p>

This e-mail was sent just before Mr Chevalier returned to the project and, as I have already held, in the period of slightly over two months since the failed build, Honeywell had made real progress in identifying difficulties in the design and taking steps to resolve them. That was the point Mr Hayes himself was making in the e-mail to Mr Kilker which prompted Mr Kilker’s own e-mail to Mr Erickson.</p>

He also ensured better communication between Newhouse and Freeport, as Mr Krupp said in evidence. He was one of those in management who was instrumental in organising the thorough design review between 17 and 26 June 2003, about which even Mr Chevalier seems to have been favourably impressed. Although Mr Chevalier was critical of Mr Kilker’s project management in his evidence, on analysis it is difficult to see what it was that he was criticising.

What those documents show is that Mr Krupp had identified nine positions to be filled, consisting of an overall NPI leader for the whole SVS Group, a manufacturing engineer with latch expertise (which none of Messrs Eaton, Gibson or Murchie had) at Newhouse, a quality engineer at Newhouse, a procurement engineer at Newhouse and various technicians. </p>

Although Mr Krupp does say that the position would not be filled before October 2003 or possibly January 2004, which he regarded as too late, he says that it can be compensated for in the meantime by Mr Spurr, Mr Kilker and himself.

In terms of the ongoing design work which Mr Spurr and Mr Shelley in particular were engaged in, as I have already held good progress was made in identifying problems with the design and resolving them in the six months after the soft tooled build. Furthermore, Mr Spurr’s evidence in his witness statement (again not challenged) was that prior to the actual termination of the JCA on 16 December 2003, (when Mr Chevalier wrote saying that Honeywell’s proposal in its letter of 11 December 2003 was not acceptable to ALS) he continued with design work on Rev E having been asked to do so by Mr Sansom and Mitchell prior to their meeting with Mr Chevalier at Heathrow on 27 October 2003.</p>

Mr Douglas pointed out that the only formal tests carried out were burst tests. Mr Bland was particularly critical of the first burst test in May 2003 at which the latch failed, but the later test in August 2003 seems to have been successful. Mr Eaton said in evidence that the latches in the second test had had different retention plate material, were case hardened and stronger. The latches were intact at 11,000 Newtons and appear to have withstood the forces specified in ECE11, the relevant European standard. Mr Eaton also confirmed that these were the tests which Mr Chevalier had indicated that he wanted Honeywell to perform.</p>

To that end, Honeywell had purchased test rigs and other equipment as Mr Eaton explained in his evidence.

By the time of termination, the DFMEA had been in existence since January 2003. The first version of the PFMEA was prepared on 6 August 2003, just before a September design summit was to take place. More work was carried out by Mr Eaton by 18 August 2003.

Whilst not in itself determinative of whether Honeywell was in breach of the JCA in this respect, that confirms me in my view that the whole case based on inadequacy and tardiness of design tools such as DFMEAs and PFMEAs, which assumed considerable prominence in ALS’s closing, is an elaborate and artificial construct based on unconvincing and unsatisfactory evidence from Mr Bland. Even if I had thought that Honeywell was in breach in this respect, as I have said earlier in the judgment, I am at a loss to understand how that breach is said to have been causative of the lack of progress of the project or its failure.</p>

Originally Mr Chevalier had engaged VVLP in October 1999 to design an electronics system suitable for demonstration purposes. VVLP then started work on the software later, in May 2001, at around the time the JCA was signed. What is clear from the Scope of Work and from the surrounding circumstances, is that it was never contemplated that Honeywell would design control electronics for the ULS from scratch. Rather, what was contemplated was that there would be a design transfer from ALS of the control electronics design effected on its behalf by VVLP. Thus, item 1 of the Scope of Work provided that ALS was to provide component and assembly drawings, schematics (circuit diagrams), specifications, test results and microprocessor listings. Clearly Honeywell’s obligation to further develop the electronics was contingent upon receipt of these.</p>

There were also difficulties with the integration of the control electronics with ALS’s mechanical prototypes. The electronics experts, Mr Sykes for ALS and Mr Wenham for Honeywell, agreed that as at January 2002, VVLP’s electronics design was still very much at the early proof of concept stage and was not suitable for volume manufacture. There were a number of deficiencies which it is not necessary to enumerate here. So far as the software developed by VVLP as at March 2002 is concerned,  I accept Mr Wenham’s evidence that it was “hacked” and contained deficiencies which demonstrated that it was not designed by an experienced software designer. Mr Suknaich also described it in his evidence as “obsolete”.</p>

Although by July 2002, it had added electronic functionality to five demonstration latches, at least one of which was capable of demonstrating power opening and closing, as MLE itself was at pains to point out in its design review of 14 June 2002, the software it had developed was purely for demonstration purposes, with many short cuts and shortcomings and needed to be rewritten from scratch.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Honeywell’s expert, Mr Wenham, considered that this had advantages over the use of two single sensors, reducing assembly costs and increasing reliability because there were fewer external connections to the printed circuit board. ALS’ expert Mr Sykes queried whether this development was really necessary, rather than simply using two off-the-shelf sensors. However, I put to him during his evidence whether he accepted that, on the basis that Honeywell had an obligation under the JCA to develop the sensors (which it clearly did have), it was reasonable to do this development work. In answer he said that if a decision had been made that a bi-polar magnet was required then this development work was reasonable. </p>

Mr Johnson explained that the modelling required on the ULS was “was very extensive in computing time and in resource time” because every movement of an arm within the latch required a new magnetic model. Mr Sykes again originally sought to query the necessity of such modelling work, but accepted in answer to me that it was entirely reasonable.</p>

So far as electronics were concerned, this was successful. As Mr Johnson recorded in his note on the build: “…the electronics performed exactly as designed. Performance indicated that there would not be any electronic related issues for a prototype latch”. As he explained in evidence, Honeywell was focusing at this stage on integrating the circuit boards with the sensors and housing to achieve functionality for a prototype that could be demonstrated to Volkswagen.</p>

As he explained in evidence he had to start from scratch and create a software set for the latch, as VVLP’s software was obsolete. He built the software in C-language, a higher level code than the assembler language in which VVLP’s software had been written, which Mr Sykes accepted was sensible. Furthermore, rather than using an open-loop, time based system like that in the VVLP source code, he rewrote the software using a closed loop PID system, which Mr Sykes accepted was more suitable for a product like the ULS, giving “more repeatable, more accurate control”.</p>

During the whole project, he was never given a latch that worked suitably for software development. Mr Wenham agreed that to make any progress with software development, you would have to have some level of confidence that the mechanical latch was repeatable and representative of what will be there going forward. Absent consistency, it is necessary to customise the software for each latch.

As a consequence of the unreliability, Honeywell never moved on to the next stage of electronics development where full systems testing would have been carried out and the electronics FMEA completed.  That is not to say that Mr Johnson and Mr Suknaich were idle. As explained by Mr Johnson in his witness statement (not challenged in cross-examination) following the soft tooled build in March 2003, he and Mr Suknaich were heavily involved in the process of fitting software to latches sent to Freeport, modifying the software algorithms for demonstration purposes and visiting Newhouse, or Mr Chevalier in London, to fit electronics and to test latches fitted into doors. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion, I consider that Honeywell did make progress with the development of control electronics as far as it could, given the state of design of the mechanical latch. This part of the case added nothing to ALS’s case on the failure to develop the design of the mechanical portion of the latch. I was left with a distinct impression that what the maintenance of the case of breach in relation to control electronics demonstrated was the inability of ALS to abandon any point, whether good or bad.</p>

On the contrary, it seems to me that real progress was made during the period between March and September 2003 by Mr Spurr and other Honeywell engineers, in the face of not inconsiderable difficulties with Mr Chevalier’s design. Positive meetings had been held with both MG Rover and Jaguar at the beginning of September. Far from going nowhere, it seems to me that Honeywell was poised to move forward with one OEM, MG Rover. I have reached the very firm conclusion that, in terms of project development, there is no question of any breach of Article 4.5 or any other provision of the JCA in relation to matters between March and September 2003. </p>

What emerged from his evidence is that his real complaint was about an alleged absence of appropriate project management. However, when the circumstances which led to his decision to terminate are examined critically, it becomes apparent that, ultimately, this complaint comes down to Mr Chevalier’s personal animus about Honeywell project management and Mr Spurr and Mr Kilker in particular.  </p>

Hence also the lengths he was prepared to go to in claiming the idea of the smaller latch as his own, culminating in the meeting on 15 July 2003. I have already held that the idea was Mr Spurr’s not Mr Chevalier’s.

Although Mr Douglas sought to suggest that there was something sinister about this meeting, in the sense that it was an attempt to see whether Honeywell could design around Mr Chevalier’s patents, I accept Mr Spurr’s evidence about this.  He explained that this was something the team was asked to do to make sure that Honeywell’s investment in the project was protected. He had asked specifically whether this was an attempt to cut ALS off and on being told it was not, he had agreed to do it. He explained the detail of the document generated, that it had both a positive and a negative aspect. The positive aspect was that, if anything had been invented by Honeywell during the design process, Honeywell would be free to patent it. The negative aspect was looking to see if there was a way around Mr Chevalier’s patents, because if there was, Honeywell would have to do something to protect itself from its competitors.</p>

Despite Mr Chevalier’s denial in his evidence, it is quite clear from the e-mail that he had recorded this conversation with Mr Spurr. I agree with Honeywell’s submission that in the circumstances, Mr Chevalier’s contention, in a later e-mail on 4 September 2003, that Mr Spurr had shown “an incredible degree of contempt and disrespect” towards him and ALS by suggesting that he would come with a witness, was extremely hypocritical. </p>

In my judgment, their decision to do so was perfectly reasonable in the circumstances. However about an hour and a half after learning that the meeting had proceeded in his absence, Mr Chevalier served notice to terminate the JCA.</p>

It is apparent from what he said at the time and in his evidence that he felt that he was being treated badly by them. However, in my judgment his attitude was irrational and unjustified and the objective reality was that the project management were trying to progress the project in difficult circumstances (largely caused by Mr Chevalier’s irrational behaviour) in a polite and civilised manner.</p>

He said that at some stage in 2003 (in his witness statement he said from July 2003) he had started thinking in terms of an actual design solution, although at that stage it was just a few ideas and sketches.

Relying on Mr Kettle’s evidence that his recollection was that what Volkswagen was interested in was an e-latch with mechanical safety, in other words the ULS, ALS invites me to conclude that Mr Spurr was wrong in saying that Volkswagen was interested in an e-latch with no mechanical connection. However it seems to me that the report Mr Spurr prepared two days after the meeting is more reliable than Mr Kettle’s recollection. Also whilst ALS is no doubt correct that Mr Kettle knew Mr Schrenke far better than did Mr Spurr, that seems to me no reason for a latch engineer of Mr Spurr’s calibre to have misunderstood completely what Mr Schrenke was saying in response to a specific enquiry about interest in e-latches.</p>

ALS sought to suggest by reference to the presentation which Mr Spurr and Mr Kilker were working on in October 2003 that they were putting the e-latch forward as an alternative to the ULS, rather than in addition to it. Mr Spurr did not accept this, although, as ALS submits, Mr Kilker did accept this in cross-examination. However, at a time when Mr Chevalier had given a thirty day notice to terminate on 11 September 2003, I consider that Honeywell was perfectly entitled to investigate its options in the event that the termination became effective (including the development of an e-latch as an alternative to the ULS), especially given the breakdown in the relationship with Mr Chevalier.</p>

ALS simply cannot point to any evidence that the discussions about the e-latch and investigation of its possibilities in the last few months of the collaboration between August and December 2003 caused the diversion of resources from the ULS project or any breach of Article 4.5.

On the findings of fact I have made that is essentially this case.  The fallacy in ALS’s argument that it can still serve a notice of termination after six months seems to me to be the suggestion that there was some extant breach as at September 2003 which remained unremedied. The correct analysis is that this is not a case of continuing breach which remained unremedied, but of  past breaches which, in the light of the subsequent good progress with the project, were simply not continuing. </p>

When the provision talks about an entitlement to terminate for a failure of the other party’s contractual obligations, thirty days after receipt of a letter setting out the reasons for termination “said letter not having achieved its purpose during this period”, it is clear that the thirty day period is intended to enable the party in breach to take steps to remedy the breach.  In other words it is focussing on present breaches which are capable of being remedied. What it does not entitle the party who serves the notice to do is to say: “There were breaches of Article 4.5 in the past, sixteen months ago and six months ago. I did not serve a notice on you on either occasion, even though I might have done and, even though in the intervening period, there has been no further breach of Article 4.5, I can serve a notice on you now in respect of those past breaches”.</p>

The short answer is that ALS has no right or remedy capable of being waived in those circumstances, so that Article 12.2 is irrelevant. The question of affirmation or waiver does not arise. Rather, on the correct construction of Article 10.1, ALS cannot terminate in September or December 2003 for breaches committed in or before March 2003.</span>

It is fair to say that this aspect of ALS’s case did not loom large in its submissions, which may reflect a recognition that if it could not succeed under Article 10.1, it was unlikely to do so at common law.</p>

As I have said, ALS contended that because Mr Chevalier had continued to protest about Honeywell’s performance after March 2003, no question of waiver or affirmation could arise. If it had been necessary to decide this point, I would have inclined to the view that, whilst that continued protest would probably not preclude a claim for damages for past breaches (if any such damages could be proved) the issue of termination would be another matter. It seems to me that by continuing the JCA after both May 2002 and March 2003, ALS in all probability waived any entitlement to terminate the JCA under Article 10.1 or at common law, for Honeywell’s breaches as at those dates.</p>

Honeywell accepts that what happened following the termination also has a bearing on issues of quantum and mitigation.  In contrast, to the extent that ALS referred to post collaboration events at all in its closing, it did so essentially to suggest that the departure of Honeywell from the scene had led to the ULS being tainted and to ALS having had considerable difficulties in interesting OEMs in the latch. I propose to consider that contention in more detail in relation to quantum.</p>

On any view, that statement was not true. Shivani did some testing in house, but these tests did not begin until October 2004 and the documents disclosed in relation to these were not frightfully satisfactory, consisting of the front sheet of the report with a summary of results and no detail. Mr Drysdale examined these and concluded that they would not satisfy any major European or American OEM.

The process of testing at MIRA did not begin until February 2005, with the burst test, after which the other tests were awaiting the delivery of off-process latches from Shivani. This was no doubt the cause of Mr Alder’s concern on 4 March 2005 about the fact that so little test work had been carried out. In the event, none of the further tests was carried out before MG Rover went into administration on 8 April 2005.</p>

I am firmly of the view that this was pure wishful thinking and invention on Mr Chevalier’s part to bolster ALS’s case that at the time that MG Rover went into liquidation, Shivani was already manufacturing latches off its production line. The contemporaneous time plan of MG Rover dated February 2005 did not envisage off tools latches from Shivani until week 20 which is about the middle of May 2005. Furthermore, ALS has failed to produce a single shipping document to substantiate the allegation that these latches were in transit, which is extraordinary if they were indeed in transit on 8 April 2005.</p>

However, that statement merely said that Shivani was in the process of delivering the latches, not that they were actually en route. Mr Kathuria’s oral evidence on this was extremely unsatisfactory. He was vague in the extreme, though he claimed that he remembered a requirement for 6,000 latches and then, that he thought that in March 2005, Shivani had made off-process latches and sent some £9,000 to £10,000 worth to MG Rover. I do not accept that evidence.

At the time that MG Rover went into administration in April 2005, the start of production by Shivani envisaged at the time of the nomination as December 2004, had fallen back to mid May 2005, according to the MGR time plan. Mr Alder said this was a “very very tight timescale”, so that I have considerable doubts whether Shivani would in fact have produced off-production latches by mid-May 2005.

It is also striking that, in his evidence, Mr Chevalier sought to downplay the significance of the delay, saying that such delays were common at this stage of a project, a contention which lies uneasily with his willingness to blame Honeywell for every single delay however minor during the course of the JCA. The truth is that, despite its experience as a latch manufacturer, Shivani faced problems and delays in bringing the ULS to production, which were no more and no less than the sort of delays and problems any such project faces, without any blame being ascribed to Shivani.</p>

More than four years after it first collaborated with ALS/VSS, Shivani has yet to produce the ULS on a mass-produced basis in any significant numbers.</p>

However, when confronted by documents from February 2007 onwards which demonstrated that the problems were not resolved, he changed his stance and sought to suggest that he was not really aware of what was going on whereas Mr Alder was, and these were all matters which Mr Alder could deal with in his evidence.</p>

ALI was expected to supply the ULS to NAC for use in its MG3 model. Mr Chevalier sought to portray a positive picture of ALI, saying that it had an automated assembly line in place and was simply awaiting the go-ahead from NAC to start production. However, the contemporaneous documentation shows that ALI has also experienced problems in achieving manufacturability of the ULS.  For example, in an e-mail of 16 January 2008, problems were identified with the latches produced by ALI which included tolerance issues. Mr Chevalier refused to accept in evidence that these related to design of the ULS as opposed to problems encountered in the normal course of the manufacturing process, repeating what he had said in relation to Shivani and JHA, that such problems were normal and expected.</p>

The former is a very small niche manufacturer of sports cars with a factory in Cwmbran in South Wales. VSS has an agreement to supply its latch to Connaught, but it is clear from the correspondence in 2006 and 2007 that Connaught was complaining about delay in supply of the ULS and the fact that it had been let down, more than once. In February 2007, Connaught complained that it had been let down before, and had had to do expensive redesign work which it was not prepared to do again.</p>

Mr Chevalier then asserted that VSS was supplying production latches to Connaught “as we speak”. As I pointed out at the time, there is no evidence that the Connaught car is in production “as we speak”, so that seems to be another instance of Mr Chevalier’s tendency to invent or exaggerate when faced with criticism.</p>

Slightly more than a week before the end of the trial, on 8 July 2008, ALS claimed, through its solicitors, that VSS/Inteva had received a nomination on the Dodge Grand Caravan, but no evidence of this was produced and, as Honeywell points out, even if this is true, it may relate to the sliding side doors which give rise to further issues, such as whether a larger motor is involved.</p>

I have also referred in the same section to the tests on the VSS latch carried out by Mr Drysdale earlier this year. Those tests led him to the conclusion (not challenged in cross-examination) that, particularly as regards noise, but also as regards other factors, the state of the ULS is still not such as would satisfy the specification and requirements of any major European or American OEM.</p>

It may well be that in those circumstances, the development of the Rev B latch would have been sufficiently far advanced that Honeywell and ALS would have decided not to develop the smaller latch at all.

As I see it that is not the same thing as Honeywell having to establish that on a balance of probabilities it would have exercised the right to terminate under Article 10.3.

Mr. Sumption Q.C., who appeared for the appellant, said that the court should choose the highest figure, which on the information reasonably available at the time of the forecast, could without negligence have been put forward as the mean. He said that a court should assume that the vendor would have performed the contract in the way least onerous to himself, that is to say, the way calculated to secure for himself the highest possible price consistent with his warranty. In support of this argument he relied upon cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack v. Woods of Colchester Ltd. </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1966/4.html">

Ltd. </span>[1983] 2 All E.R. 390 in which the courts had to calculate the damages payable upon a wrongful repudiation or termination of a contract. In order to compensate the plaintiff for what he has lost, the court must in such cases determine what benefits the plaintiff would have derived from the performance by the defendant of his outstanding obligations under the contract. It is well settled that the court will assume that the defendant would have performed those obligations in the way least onerous to himself. If his duty was to act reasonably, it will be assumed that from various reasonable methods of performance he would have chosen the one least unfavourable to himself: see Mustill J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Paula Lee Ltd. v.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">23. All this makes perfectly good sense when damages depend upon a prediction of how the defendant would have performed outstanding contractual obligations which gave him a choice of what to do. But this is not such a case. Paragraph 32 did not allow the vendor to choose from the range of figures which would have counted as reasonable forecasts and put forward the highest figure in the range in order to obtain the highest possible price. The PRS had to be "calculated in good faith" and therefore had to be a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide </span>estimate made without regard to whether it would have produced a higher or lower price. There is accordingly no basis for calculating the damages on the assumption that the vendor was contractually entitled to choose the highest figure. All that can be said is that there would have been a range of possible figures. But there is no legal basis for assuming that the hypothetical figure would have been at the upper rather than the lower end of the range. So far as the estimates which could reasonably have been made differed from the mean of those estimates, it would have been on a random basis and not because the vendor was entitled to choose the highest figure. In those circumstances, the only rational course open to a court is to choose the figure which it considers that a forecast made with reasonable care was most likely to have produced. “</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there was clearly an issue as to the competitiveness of the ULS in relation to other latches, certainly in terms of the basic latch market. I will look at the evidence about this in more detail in the Quantum section below, but in summary, Mr Spurr’s assessment in his strategy document of 17 September 2003 seems broadly correct and accords with the evidence of Honeywell’s market expert, Mr Brayshaw. Whilst the ULS had considerable advantages in relation to other premium latches offering features such as power opening and closing, there was only limited demand for such products. In relation to basic latches, with which the ULS would have to compete to achieve any significant market penetration, the ULS did not offer any competitive advantage.</p>

I found earlier that there was no agreement as to the share of profits at the meeting on 24 July 2000, contrary to the assertions made by Mr Chevalier in his witness statement. Thereafter, Honeywell did seek to renegotiate the terms of the collaboration going forward at various stages, including after Mr Chevalier had served the notice of termination in September 2003. Honeywell wanted to put ALS’s share of the profits on a royalty basis. In the letter of 11 December 2003 from Mr Sansom, President of Sensing and Control, to Mr Chevalier putting forward proposals for the future of the collaboration, Mr Sansom stressed the urgent need to agree a royalty structure, in order for the collaboration to be commercially viable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, whether through greed or otherwise, Mr Chevalier was never prepared to enter a royalty agreement with Honeywell and did not even put forward a counter-proposal, simply terminating the contract finally on 16 December 2003. Accordingly, towards the end of 2003, Honeywell was faced with the position that it did not know what proportion of any gross or net profit it would make from the sale of the ULS once manufacture commenced. This was hardly a sound basis for committing further resources to the project.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, even if Honeywell had been able to estimate what proportion of any net profit it would receive, the financial prospects for the project from Honeywell’s perspective as at the end of 2003 were not promising. At the time that the JCA was entered, Honeywell had required an internal rate of return of 25% over a five to ten year period for investments in electromechanical projects. The assumptions made by Honeywell in its business plan at the outset of the project, reflected in Exhibit 6 to the JCA, were that the ULS could be manufactured for £6.95 and sold for £8.20. This would have given an internal rate of return of slightly over 30%.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as the project progressed, Honeywell found itself unable to reduce the projected manufacturing costs to that estimated level. I have already referred to the evidence of Mr Eaton about prices obtained from prospective suppliers, often with input from Mr Chevalier as to who should be approached.

However ALS has not produced any evidence of lower prices Honeywell could have obtained, other than the Inteva model which I refer to below and which I did not find reliable. Towards the end of the project, Honeywell was looking into reducing labour costs through manufacture in the Czech Republic, at that time a so-called low cost jurisdiction.</p>

As he confirmed in his evidence, the assessment was that a basic latch selling at $6 to $8 was simply not feasible. As Mr Mitchell put it in the document: “Low end latches declining with $6 to $8 pricing. We cannot play in this entrenched commodity world”. The material and labour costs for a mid range latch (with passive entry and power unlocking) were $12.20. Mr Mitchell said in evidence that at that cost, they could not have made money. </p>

How that was to be achieved was also unclear. At that time in October 2003, the only actual customer for the ULS, MG Rover, was resisting a proposed price increase of 10% to reflect increased manufacturing costs. Any increase in price to other prospective customers would only reduce the competitiveness of the ULS.</p>

I was not assisted by the evidence of Mr Manning of Inteva on the issue of manufacturing costs. That evidence came forward rather late in the day: Mr Manning was interposed between two Honeywell witnesses on Day 24 of the trial. He gave evidence about the projected costs of manufacturing a low specification latch set out in a spreadsheet dated October 2007. However, this was all based on estimates, not upon actual quotes from component manufacturers (in contrast to Honeywell’s costs figures) and, since Inteva has yet to manufacture the ULS, it remains far from clear whether it could manufacture the ULS at that projected cost.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, the relevant financial model in the spreadsheet contained sales prices for the latch which had been selected to produce a 10% operating profit over the lifetime of the contract with the projected OEM, Chrysler. For legitimate reasons of commercial confidentiality, Mr Manning was not willing to disclose the actual prices quoted to Chrysler nor whether those prices were acceptable, although it appears that VSS/Inteva did not obtain the contract. Overall, the spreadsheet was essentially a theoretical exercise, not grounded in hard reality and no basis for any suggestion that Honeywell management were acting irrationally in relying upon the costs estimates it had obtained.</p>

That one customer had financial difficulties of which Honeywell was well aware having described these internally as a “major risk”. MG Rover had suspended the RDX60 project (for which the letter of nomination was actually received) indefinitely and although Honeywell and MG Rover were proceeding on the basis that the ULS would be supplied for use in the existing models, there was no contractual commitment to that effect.</p>

When the future of the project was under consideration internally in October 2003, Mr Mitchell’s preferred solution as to what would work best for both parties was continued Honeywell control of the project, with a review board which would include Mr Chevalier and one team in a single location and the hiring of a new team of experts as a matter of priority.

However, it is my strong suspicion that by December 2003 senior Honeywell management had had enough of what was seen as excessive involvement and meddling by Mr Chevalier and that, unless ALS had agreed a limited role for Mr Chevalier and an appropriate level of royalty payments for ALS, Honeywell would have exercised its right to terminate under Article 10.3, which (on the findings I have made) it would have been perfectly entitled to do.</p>

On the basis of those probabilities, the likely sales of the ULS are projected forward until 2024. </p>

This has removed some of the more extreme probabilities in the original model.  It gives two figures for the quantum claimed, depending upon the date to which the claim is discounted. On the basis of discounting to the date of trial, assumed to be 1 January 2008, the claim is some £457 million. Taking the more conventional approach of discounting to the date of the loss (assumed to be 1 January 2004), the claim is just under £332 million. Of course, from those figures would fall to be deducted any profits made or anticipated to be made by ALS/VSS from actual sales of the latch made since the collaboration ended.</p>

It is interesting and innovative and certainly has advantages over other latches at the limited premium end of the market. However, as Mr Mitchell recognised in October 2003, it simply cannot compete with the sort of basic latches which sell for around $8 and which make up the vast preponderance of the latch market. Mr Henry fairly and candidly accepted in evidence that his case for market penetration of some 20% by the ULS, on which the quantum model was based, could not stand if I did not consider that the ULS was a ground breaking product.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Honeywell and ALS shall establish a separate legal entity…whose sole purpose shall be to receive payment for Product from a Customer and distribute such revenue according to the schedule attached as Exhibit 6.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Upon the basis of that provision, ALS argued that this provided for the distribution of revenues from the sales of the ULS in accordance with Exhibit 6 and that, accordingly, Exhibit 6 is not just an estimate of costs but the schedule by which profits are to be distributed. ALS recognises that it still faces the hurdle that Exhibit 6 does not state in terms how profits are to be distributed but seeks to overcome that by submitting that the Court has to interpret Exhibit 6 as providing that Honeywell would get its costs of production and 15% return on its investment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two related but fundamental problems with all of this. First whilst it is correct that Article 5.2 refers to distribution of revenue according to Exhibit 6 (or indeed any revision to it), if, as is undoubtedly the case Exhibit 6 does not make any provision as to how profits are to be to divided, I do not see how Article 5.2 can be used to fill the gap. Second, I cannot see how I could possibly construe Exhibit 6 in the manner in which ALS invites me to. The only reference to “profit” in the Exhibit, in context is a reference to that proportion of the costs of obtaining the mechanical sub-assembly from a sub-contractor which represents the profit element for that sub-contractor. Nothing in the Exhibit even begins to deal with the division of profits between the parties to the JCA.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This leads on to the second way in which ALS seeks to overcome the absence of any agreement as to profit sharing. It contends that if Honeywell had performed the JCA properly, then it is probable that the contracts for the Passat and the XK would have been obtained, in which case it is inconceivable that the parties would not have reached an agreement about profit sharing. Accordingly it is submitted that the Court should somehow assess the likelihood of any agreement being reached as part of the loss of a chance in relation to quantum generally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, that way of putting the case faces fundamental problems. The principle of “loss of a chance” is designed to cover cases where the contingency of a future event is dependent upon the acts of a third party, not where it is dependent upon the act of one of the contracting parties who is under no pre-existing contractual obligation in the relevant respect. I agree with Mr McQuater that the applicable principle in such circumstances is that stated by Diplock LJ in  <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack v Woods of Colchester Ltd </span>[1967] 1 QB 278 at 297:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The highest ALS can put its case is that there was an agreement to agree (although I am not sure it can even go that far) but as a matter of general principle, agreements to agree are legally unenforceable, not least because it is no part of the function of the Court to lay down terms of an agreement the parties have not made. There is simply nothing in what was agreed between the parties from which I could even begin to determine what agreement the parties might have reached about profit sharing. Frankly, it is no answer for ALS to say that on a balance of probabilities agreement would have been reached, because that does not answer the question what agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The absence of any agreement about profit sharing presents an insuperable obstacle to the claim based upon loss of profits, which would fail on that ground alone. As for the plea <span style="font-style:italic">in misericordiam</span> that this would leave ALS without a claim, which is somehow unjust, there are two answers to that. The first is the brutal but as I see it unanswerable one that ALS only has itself to blame if it finds itself in this difficulty, having failed to agree some proper basis for profit sharing in the two and a half years between inception of the JCA and its termination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second answer is that, as Mr McQuater points out, a claim for loss and damage as a consequence of Honeywell’s breach does not have to be formulated exclusively as a claim for loss of profits, but could also be put as a claim for wasted expenditure incurred by ALS as a consequence of an abortive collaboration. Indeed as Mr McQuater also pointed out, a claim along those lines was pleaded by ALS, although not ultimately pursued at the trial.</p>

And that relationship between the OEM and its collection of tier 1 suppliers is a mutual interdependency, that the tier 1 supplier can only be successful if he has a long-term supply partnership with the OEM which brings him long-term stable supply positions which allows him to invest in technology and in capacity and in return for which he brings technology to the OEMs.</p>

ALS relies upon the enthusiastic response received by the ULS from OEMs, including Mr Kettle’s report of the comment of Mr Cox of Jaguar at the meeting on 5 September 2003 that the latch was the best he had ever seen. However, what is striking is that for all the compliments, ALS/VSS has been unable to convert interest into a contractual commitment (other than with MG Rover which was something of a special case once it could no longer take advantage of the BMW corporate latch set up).</p>

Understandably, ALS’s submissions in this area of the case focus on this point. Whenever Honeywell sought to rely upon the fact that in almost five years since the collaboration ended, ALS/VSS has still not secured a contract (or even a letter of nomination) to supply the ULS to a major European or American OEM, the response from ALS was that this was all because the ULS was tainted by the failure of Honeywell to develop it and the collapse of the collaboration and that it would all have been different if Honeywell had performed its obligations under the JCA and the collaboration had continued.</p>

In relation to whether the Honeywell name and clout would have made all the difference, the evidence in support of that proposition is the market evidence of Mr Henry. However, his thesis that Honeywell could have broken down barriers to entry was clearly predicated upon his belief that the ULS was a ground breaking product. Not only did he accept, as I have already stated, that if he was wrong about that, then his thesis could not stand. He also accepted that it would be “much more difficult, if not close to impossible” for any new supplier (thus even Honeywell) to penetrate the latch market profitably with a latch which was not ground breaking and not significantly different from other latches. For reasons which I will elaborate, I am very firmly of the view that in the basic and mid-range latch market where the bulk of any supplies of the ULS in volume could be made, the ULS does not offer any, let alone any significant advantages over existing latches available in the market.</p>

It is striking that there is not a single piece of evidence from an OEM that it was deterred from using the ULS by what might be described as the debacle with Honeywell. Indeed, so far as MG Rover, the one OEM which had agreed in principle to use the ULS, was concerned, once ALS/VSS had procured a manufacturing agreement, in the event with Shivani, rather than CE Marshall, letters of nomination were signed and the development proceeded.</p>

This was based on no more than the meeting at the Frankfurt motor show with Mr Kai Schrenke and his girlfriend. Mr Kettle said that he regarded this as no more than a social visit and that his view was that at this stage, it was only his personal relationship with Mr Schrenke which was surviving.

It seems to me that is not an indication of a cooling of relations but the reiteration of a concern about the ULS, which Volkswagen had expressed at a number of previous meetings. In cross-examination, Mr Kettle accepted that the issue of noise remained.

Rather it was to do with the fact that the ULS remained too noisy for Volkswagen, a matter which was to do with the design of the ULS and not, for the reasons I have set out in detail in my findings on liability, attributable to any breach of the JCA by Honeywell. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">ALS’s case is in essence that the ULS offers competitive advantages over other latches and because it can be fitted in all car doors and has all functions that might be required, it is ideally suited for adoption as a corporate latch by any major OEM, which would have happened if Honeywell had performed the JCA properly. My very firm view is that this flattering perception of the latch does not accord with reality either as regards the ULS or the latch market.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is certainly correct that the ULS offers advantages over other premium latches with features such as power release, power closing and electronic child lock. In particular it requires only one motor and actuator, is smaller, lighter and easier to fit in car doors. However, the problem which ALS faces is that the demand for such features either from OEMs or their customers other than on low volume luxury models such as the Mercedes S Class and the BMW 7 Series does not seem great. Mr Brayshaw said in evidence that he could detect no great appetite for power opening or closing on standard high volume vehicles (such as the bulk of the Volkswagen or Ford range).  It appears from both what the Ford representative said at the Frankfurt motor show in September 2001 and the note of the meeting with Mr Goodchild of Ford in Dearborn in June 2002 that there was a lack of interest in the North American market in premium features such as power closing. Furthermore, in September 2001, the indications from BMW were that it was not interested in power opening or closing. </p>

Corresponding figures for Ford Volvo are 9 and 2%. These are hardly consistent with a sudden surge in interest for the complex features of the latch. In his oral evidence Mr Henry sought to argue that his projections understated the likely take up for the mid-range and complex version of the latch over the whole period. I found this evidence wholly unconvincing and, if anything, damaging to Mr Henry’s credibility as an independent expert. </p>

As Mr Henry said himself power opening and closing “are still very rare on the market” and he agreed with Mr Brayshaw that at present the hunger for this technology is not there in the market. In the light of those market conditions which are essentially common ground between the experts, a suggestion of 17-18% take up for Volkswagen by 2017 seems to me optimistic to say the least.</p>

Mr Chevalier had commissioned a report from Alix Partners (probably for the purposes of litigation) which compared the ULS with other latches available in the market. That showed, as Mr Henry accepted, that at 66 the part count for the ULS was higher than for other basic latches. Although Mr Spurr accepted that (at least with the modifications to the design he put forward) it would be easier to assemble than some other latches, this does not seem to have been a universal view. Mr Kilker and Mr Shannon regarded it as being complicated to build, like a Swiss watch. </p>

In my judgment, this is of little if any assistance. Mr Drysdale is a latch engineering expert, not a market expert and he was not asked about this passage in cross-examination, specifically whether he had in mind the basic latch market or the premium end of the market. I suspect from the context, that he was talking about the position if the ULS met the specification in full, that he had in mind the premium end of the market. However, in any event, what he says does not even begin to counter all the cogent evidence to which I have already referred to the effect that the ULS is not competitive in the basic latch market.</p>

I have to say that I found this argument wholly unconvincing. I found the suggestion that an OEM would pay more for the ULS as a basic latch for most of its models, because it would give flexibility to introduce its more sophisticated features onto that OEM’s models in the future, fanciful in the extreme.</p>

The Phaeton is their very much top end product made in extremely low volume… whereas the Polo, Golf, Passat are their very high volume models.

The position might well have been different if Honeywell had been prepared to offer the ULS as a corporate latch at a price cheaper than the basic latches available in the market at $6 to $8, but apart from the fact that it could not hope to do so and make a profit, that strategy would have presented another sort of problem.</p>

However, in my judgment not much can be read into this. The response was in a telephone call from Mr Schrenke to Mr Kettle and there is no evidence that the quote was approved by the Volkswagen purchasing department or finance department, let alone by senior management. I find it inconceivable that on a close examination of the different functions the ULS provided, such as would inevitably have taken place before any agreement to nominate the ULS for a Volkswagen model, Volkswagen would have agreed to pay three times the cost of the basic latch for the luxury of power closing and opening.

At most it might consider the ULS when next re-examining its corporate latch policy some years hence. Even at that stage, the disruption to the business of the existing supplier which would be caused if the OEM switched to the ULS would lead the existing supplier to fight tooth and nail to retain the business.</p>

Mr Henry accepted in evidence that it was a reasonable line to take that if it really was a ground breaking product with the potential to change the latch market significantly, by now some major OEM would have said to its latch supplier: “go and get that licence, buy VSS, buy ALS, do what you need to get the technology”.</p>

I have already indicated in relation to that meeting, that I consider Mr Friedrich’s note of the meeting was more realistic than that of Mr Kettle, the eternal optimist. At all events, although the meeting was positive, as Mr Kettle accepted in his evidence, two issues remained for Volkswagen.

I would expect finance and supply chain and all of the other dialogues to have been advanced.  I would have expected these people to be put in front of the chief program engineer. So I would have expected a whole number of parallel activities to have been taking place.   Equally, it's worth saying that the engineers in all of these car companies spend their lives encouraging suppliers to spend money to develop new technologies and new ideas and bring them to them for free, and they do that by continually dangling the carrot of potential future business.

That absence of documentation is also telling in relation to the “ballpark” quote in October 2002 on which ALS relies. If it really was a quote which was acceptable to senior management at Volkswagen, one would have expected to see correspondence to that effect and further communications between the parties. It is also striking that, if Volkswagen was really seriously considering the ULS for the Passat, no-one at Volkswagen chased Honeywell when it failed to get back with quiet latches by sometime in February 2003. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, Mr Schrenke’s insouciance and the time scale for the introduction of the Passat indicate pretty clearly that Volkswagen was already working with other suppliers and had another latch in mind, as Mr Henry accepted in evidence.  The latch which is in fact now on the current Passat is one designed by Meritor (or possibly by Intier) and produced by Kiekert and Meritor. It is likely that by early 2003 with start of production at the end of 2004 this latch had been in development for some time. Mr Henry also accepted that by 1 April 2003, Volkswagen would already have issued a letter of nomination to the supplier, be it Kiekert or someone else.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason follows on from the first. If in early 2003, Volkswagen had started showing serious interest in using the ULS on the Passat, that would have been bound to come to the attention of Kiekert and Meritor.  They would not have been willing to lose out to a new competitor on a core vehicle programme like the Passat, not just because of the development work that must have gone into their own latch by that stage but because (at least in the case of Kiekert) of the long-standing relationship with Volkswagen. They would have been bound to make representations to Volkswagen at board level and just as Kiekert subsequently saw off VSS on the Passat coupe, it seems to me the overwhelming probability is that they would have persuaded Volkswagen by one means or another to remain with their latch.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, even if sufficient interest had been shown within Volkswagen to consider the ULS seriously at a level within the company where technical and commercial decisions are made, it is improbable in the extreme that Volkswagen would have been prepared to use the ULS which was untried technology from a new supplier which had never manufactured a latch before on one of its core vehicle programmes. The latch on a car door is a safety critical product and it is inconceivable that it should fail, particularly on a mainstream model like the Passat. If Volkswagen were going to use the ULS at all, it would have done so on a low-volume high specification vehicle such as the Phaeton.</p>

At the meeting in May 2002, no particular models were discussed at all. Even at the positive meeting on 5 September 2003, Mr Cox did not mention the new XK but rather the Range Rover, Discovery and Jaguar XKR. That is the limited volume high specification turbocharged version of the XK. Of course the possibility of using the ULS on the XKR would correspond entirely with Mr Brayshaw’s evidence that if an OEM were going to use a new safety related product like the ULS, it would try it out first on a low volume high specification model, not on its mainstream or flagship models.  </p>

Some of the figures are as breathtaking in their optimism as the 75% figure itself. One could take examples at random from the tabular form of the model at Exhibit 6 to Mr Mathew-Jones’ Supplemental Report, but the three identified by Honeywell in its written Closing Submissions will suffice. Mr Henry anticipates a 60% probability of an 80% take up of the ULS across the entire Volkswagen group by 2014, a 60% probability of a 70% take-up for the whole of Ford by 2014 and a 100% probability of a 20% share of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) market by 2017.

However, even looking at it separately on its own merits, it emerges as an entirely speculative exercise. Mr Henry was unable to explain what the science was behind the probabilities he had attributed to particular predictions. He was asked specifically about his figures for the take up on Volvo and was reduced to saying: “At the end of the day, I have to say to you that it’s a judgment that I have to make, have made”. Equally, the rationale for the NAFTA figures I have already referred to was no more scientific than that 1% of that market reflected a low volume model at Ford or General Motors taking up the latch, what Mr Henry described as his “best estimate”.</p>

Although running changes which had been made to the S-Type which had required crash testing were put to him in cross-examination, he confirmed in re-examination that this had not led him to change his views that Jaguar would have avoided incorporating the ULS as a running change at all costs. This was because there would have to be a complete re-test of the body structure, and re-homologation would be required, whereas the whole point of a facelift is to avoid the expense of all that.</p>

In one sense, MG Rover’s decision to use the ULS on its existing models is an example of that. However, outside that case, it seems to me unless the ULS was such a ground breaking product to be “too good to miss” (which I have already held it was not) it is unlikely in the extreme that any OEM would have introduced it as part of a running change.</p>

However, I agree with Honeywell that playing games with the numbers is unacceptable. The willingness to emphasise the flexibility of the model merely demonstrates the artificiality of this entire approach.

Instead, he used a model which looks at cash flows, on the basis of a series of scenarios which vary in their degree of what might be described as pro-ULS optimism. He estimated sales revenue (based on average figures derived from market sources including the market experts). From that he deducted all the various costs to parties of the collaboration, such as costs of production, overheads, tooling, Honeywell’s pre-production costs and ALS’s ongoing costs, to arrive at a net profit, which is then discounted. How that profit might be divided up between the parties is then a matter for the Court, although since there was no agreement on loss of profits and as I have already said that I am not prepared to fill that particular gap in ALS’s favour, this model does highlight the insuperable hurdle ALS faces in that regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In assessing the sales price and the cost of sales and arriving at a gross margin, Mr Mathew-Jones uses the price from the Volkswagen quote as the sales price and the £6.95 in Exhibit 6 as the cost of sales. I agree with Honeywell that these are not appropriate either together or separately. The Volkswagen quote is only one of several prices quoted during the collaboration and the Exhibit 6 figure of £6.95 was on the basis of sub-contracting the mechanical sub-assembly and, in any event, was superseded by later Honeywell costs estimates much more closely based on reality. Furthermore there is no obvious correlation between the Volkswagen quote and Exhibit 6 and one might be forgiven for thinking that these two figures have been taken because they produce huge gross margins which would be entirely favourable to ALS. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Maher’s approach is much more realistic in my view. He takes an average sales price of 12 Euros, derived from the Just-Auto Report he relies on in his expert Report, which is actually not all that different from the weighted average used in Mr Mathew-Jones’ model. Mr Maher’s model assumes significant sales of the latch up until 2024. Even his least optimistic scenario assumes 20 million sales in that period. On the basis of my conclusion that the ULS was not a ground breaking product, even that figure seems to me over-favourable to ALS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Maher then derives the cost of sales from an assessment of the likely gross margin, which he took as 10-14%. This is where the lines for one of the fiercest battles between Mr Mathew-Jones and Mr Maher were drawn. Mr Mathew-Jones argues for a gross margin of something in the region of 30%. In his evidence that the ULS could have achieved this sort of gross margin, he relied in a particularly insistent manner on two matters. First the gross margins achieved by Gentex. However they supply a very different product, auto-dimming mirrors and appear to have cornered the market for such products which may explain the sort of margins they are able to achieve. I did not find the comparison with Gentex helpful at all, despite Mr Mathew-Jones’ insistence on it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, Mr Mathew-Jones relied upon the position of Kiekert, but as Honeywell rightly points out the evidence about Kiekert remains opaque because the available accounting documents do not show matters such as staff costs. If one assumes a realistic allocation of staff costs to the costs of production and also makes a deduction for depreciation, it appears that for 2004, Kiekert’s gross margin may have been slightly more than 13%. Since 2004, the financial position of Kiekert has if anything worsened, suggesting that its gross margin may not be any better than that now and may be appreciably worse.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, I did not find the matters relied upon by Mr Mathew-Jones in support of the gross margin he put forward at all reliable. It is also important to note that this gross margin was itself predicated upon the ULS being a ground-breaking product, which I have concluded it is not. In those circumstances I consider that the level of gross margin which Mr Maher put forward of somewhere between 10 and 14% as entirely realistic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was a weighted average gross margin across a broad range of latch manufacturers and door module suppliers from publicly available figures for the period 2004 to 2006, with the overall average being 10% and the average of the three companies with the highest margins being 14%. It did not include Kiekert because no accounts were available for the later period but for the reasons given above, its gross margins are likely to have been in the same range. It seems to me unlikely in the extreme that Honeywell could have achieved a gross margin in excess of the higher average of 14%.  Apart from anything else, it seems likely that Honeywell would have had to discount its prices to achieve any significant market penetration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a difference between the forensic accounting experts as to the appropriate discount rate, caused by a difference as to where they take account of the probabilities of the projected cash flows arising. Mr Mathew-Jones has applied the probabilities to the cash flows themselves, but because Mr Maher considers (correctly on the findings I have already made) that it is too difficult to be certain about the probabilities of the cash flows arising, he has factored the uncertainty of cash flows into his discount rate. I accept Honeywell’s submission that that is the correct approach and also that Mr Maher’s discount rate of between 20 and 30% is appropriate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The other difference between the parties concerning discounting is the date to which discounting should take place. The normal approach would be to discount a claim for future loss of profits in respect not only of market risk and project risk, but also the time value of money. To the extent that a claimant has been out of its money, the Court then has a discretion as to whether to award interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 for some or all of the period from the date of breach to the date of judgment and as to the rate of interest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, Mr Mathew-Jones has only discounted for project risk back from the date of trial to the date of breach, therefore only discounting the claim for lost profits in respect of market risk and time value of money to the assumed date of trial and judgment, taken as 1 January 2008. ALS sought to justify this approach by reference to the recent decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Victory</span> [2007] 2 Lloyd's Rep 164 to the effect that whilst the general rule is that damages are assessed as at the date of the breach, that is always subordinate to the fundamental rule that the innocent party should be put into the same position as if the contract had been performed. </p>

Mr Maher considers his less optimistic scenarios more realistic and therefore concludes that it is more likely than not that ALS’s loss as a consequence of any breach of the JCA by Honeywell is in fact zero.</p>

The ULS is not a ground-breaking product and whether Mr Chevalier likes it or not, in nearly five years since the JCA was terminated, he has yet to procure any contract to supply the ULS to a major OEM for reasons which simply cannot be attributed to the Honeywell factor. Even with Honeywell manufacturing and selling the product, the barriers to entry and the competitive nature of the market, together with the fact that the ULS is not itself competitive with basic, high volume latches, are such that I am sceptical as to whether the ULS would ever have achieved market penetration, even at the level Mr Maher assumes in his less optimistic scenarios. Even if market penetration could have been achieved to a significant extent, I am equally sceptical as to whether it could have been sold at a profit.</p>
