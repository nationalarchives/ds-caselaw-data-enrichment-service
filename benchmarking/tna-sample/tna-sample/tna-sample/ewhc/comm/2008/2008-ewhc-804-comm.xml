	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first of these two actions Gallaher International Ltd claims that by a letter dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>March 2005 it lawfully terminated a distribution agreement between it and Tlais Enterprises Limited (“TEL”) whereby TEL was appointed as Gallaher’s distributor in respect of certain specified brands of cigarettes.  TEL disputes that the TEL Agreement was lawfully terminated and counterclaims over $ 675 million by way of damages. In the second action Gallaher claims against Mr Ptolomeos Tlais, one of the beneficial owners of TEL, under a personal guarantee. In this judgment I use “Gallaher” primarily to refer to the claimant; but, on occasion, to refer generically to the Gallaher group.</p>

Prior thereto Gallaher supplied cigarettes on the orders of companies owned or controlled by a Mr Charles Hadkinson, particularly Namelex Holdings Ltd (formerly Namelex Ltd). I refer to this company as “<span style="font-style:italic">Namelex</span>”. A large proportion of those orders were financed by the Tlais family.   From June 2000 Gallaher had had a distribution agreement (“the Namelex Agreement”) with a company called Namelex Trading Agencies Ltd, of which Mr Hadkinson and Mr Tlais were beneficial joint (50/50) owners. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The Namelex Agreement was terminated in circumstances where (a) JL Spirits and Tobacco, a company associated with Namelex, was a substantial debtor to Gallaher; (b) a large quantity of cigarettes had been manufactured for Namelex by Gallaher many of which had been shipped to Cyprus and Dubai, whilst other quantities remained in the UK; and (c) Mr Tlais claimed to have been given assurances by Mr Hadkinson as to the level of support that Gallaher would provide in the form of free cigarettes which had not been fulfilled, as a result of which he claimed to have suffered severe losses.</p>

Gallaher so describe him because he strung them along with promises of letters of credit that never materialised; Mr Tlais because he made false representations to him about the support that he was to receive from Gallaher. </p>

The body of the TEL Agreement also provided, by clause 10 (1), that each party was entitled to terminate the TEL Agreement on 3 months’ written notice to expire on, or at any time after, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2007.

Under the TEL Agreement TEL was subject to a number of obligations designed to ensure that that intention was fulfilled and that cigarettes supplied under the TEL Agreement were not smuggled out of the Territories into other markets, including the United Kingdom. Among these was an obligation on TEL to conduct its business in accordance with the Policy on International Trade of the Gallaher Group (the “ITP”). TEL was also obliged to procure that any sub-distributors conducted business in accordance with the ITP: <span style="text-decoration:underline">clause 4 (xxi</span>). </p>

In essence Gallaher relies, firstly, on TEL’s failure to prevent smuggling of cigarettes into the UK and TEL’s alleged complicity in smuggling. It contends that the volume of seizures over a five year period, despite repeated warnings by Gallaher of increasing concern on the part of HMCE and itself and a “red card” (see paragraph 172 below) from HMCE in respect of TEL in January 2005, could not have arisen without breaches on the part of TEL of various obligations under the TEL Agreement.  Gallaher relies in this respect on certain schedules of sales made by Adam Trading, TEL’s master distributor, between 2002 and 2005, (the “Adam Trading Schedules”) which showed sales to a number of destinations outside the Territories. </p>

In order to support its claim for very large damages TEL has had to reconstruct accounts for the entire period.

I propose to set out the core facts (including, where relevant my findings on disputed issues) before further identifying the issues (see paragraph 567) and my conclusions on them.  In doing so I have adopted the general format of the parties’ final submissions and, on occasion, their summary of events.

It and Gallaher Ltd, the main UK operating company, were at the material times subsidiaries of Gallaher Group PLC.  In March 1999 Gallaher acquired from RJ Reynolds, the worldwide trademarks for Dorchester (excluding some Middle Eastern countries) and Dickens &amp; Grant. In the summer of 2000 it acquired Liggett-Ducat, a Russian cigarette manufacturer and distributor, whose brands included Prima, Novost and LD. In November 2001 Gallaher completed the acquisition of Austria Tabak. </p>

The effect of this was to allow Gallaher to focus on its European business.  In the mid 1990s the markets of the former Soviet Union began to open up and Gallaher began to sell its cigarettes, particularly Sovereign and Stateline, into Russia, and then into Kazakhstan. At this stage Gallaher’s international, i.e. non UK, business was divided into four divisions (i) European domestic business; (ii) European duty free business; (iii) the Far East division; and (iv) a trading division. The international business was then a relatively small part of Gallaher’s business, contributing £ 66 million of operating profit in 1998 as against £ 324 million profit from sales in the UK. The figures for 1999 were £ 73 million and £ 347.4 million. Gallaher had no business in the Middle East. </p>

Imported brands, especially if imported from markets associated with quality cigarettes such as the UK and the USA, are usually much preferred to domestic brands. Another is taste, which may be a smooth “Virginia blend”, a more flavoursome “American blend”, or other blends, including cigarettes with flavours such as menthol. Another is tar content, some consumers preferring, and some legislation requiring, lower level tar cigarettes (“Lights”). Lastly there is price, which is often put into three categories, which may overlap: premium (or super premium/luxury); mid-price and value/low price. These three segments apply to imported cigarettes. Locally produced cigarettes may form a still lower price category since they can often be produced more cheaply on account of a more favourable tax regime.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The rate of tax and duty charged on cigarettes and tobacco, particularly in the UK (where there is a high specific duty based on the number of cigarettes rather than their price), is so high that very  large sums of money can be made, illegally, by importing cigarettes into a territory without paying the tax and duty due. Commensurately large sums are lost by the Customs and Revenue authorities (and thus the taxpayers) of the territories concerned. Smuggling is widespread. The US Department of Agriculture estimated that in 2002 929 billion cigarettes were exported worldwide but only 624 billion officially imported. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The same factors make the sale of cigarettes to a tax free or low tax destination a potentially attractive opportunity. Thus it was that, following a substantial tax increase on UK cigarettes in 1993, exports from the UK to Andorra, which is not within the EU, increased from 13 million sticks in 1993 to 1.52 billion in 1997. In the period from 1995 to 1997 Gallaher’s exports to Andorra increased by a factor of 6, whilst those of Imperial Tobacco increased 35 – fold. This volume of imports was such that every Andorran man, woman and child, would have had to be smoking about 140 cigarettes a day to match the number of cigarettes imported. Large quantities of these imports must have been smuggled out of Andorra. Cigarettes made in Gallaher’s factory in Ballymena could return to the UK in a week. </p>

Gallaher  realised (and said publicly) that its increased sales were probably attributable to the smuggling of its product into the UK: see its 1997 Annual Report and the evidence of Mr Peter Wilson, Gallaher’s then Chairman and Chief Executive, to the House of Commons Select Committee on Thursday 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2000. </p>

Russia’s economic collapse and the fall in the value of the rouble in 1998 had brought with it a very sudden downturn in sales. Duty free sales in Europe were soon to be abolished; and sales in European markets had been diminishing or stagnating in the light of increasing taxes (particularly in the UK after the change of government in 1997), advertising bans and increased public awareness of the risk to health posed by smoking. The export of large volumes to Andorra had been severely curtailed; and demand for Gallaher’s brands had declined in the UK. </p>

The implementation of the single European market in 1993 and the subsequent relaxation of the limits previously imposed on travellers bringing cigarettes in from abroad for personal consumption meant that smokers in the UK became more accustomed to smoking cigarettes manufactured and sold abroad. Reduction in border checks reduced the risk of detection for smugglers and the increases in taxes on cigarettes at above the annual rate of inflation increased the willingness, and the economic incentive, for UK smokers to smoke cigarettes with foreign pack markings, if cheaper. </p>

It also undermines the position of Gallaher’s distributors, who expect the manufacturer to play a part in protecting their interests, and who may be tempted to favour rival bands, if it does not.

Smuggling was difficult to combat given the absence of adequate marking of tobacco products with details of the chain of sale and by the existence of the transit regime.

He was formally appointed to the role in about April/May 1999, when the New Business Development division took shape. He became the Divisional Manager responsible for the development of sales in emerging markets. Mr Jack was a long time Gallaher employee. He had held a senior role in national sales in the UK and had recently taken charge of managing Gallaher’s sales in the CIS. He was not, however, one of Gallaher’s senior executive management. </p>

The aim was to make £ 1 of margin for every thousand cigarettes. Sovereign Classic and Dorchester International were the Virginia blend brands selected as the core of the trading business. Mr Jack’s approach was to appoint master distributors in a number of different regions. </p>

He said that this involved selling high volumes, without being concerned about precisely where the goods ended up, even though there was a risk that some might come back to the UK.

Since Mr Wilson displayed a similar lack of concern in respect of supplies to Andorra it seems to me that he may well have expressed such a view to Mr Jack in 1999. His memorandum of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May shows that he was concerned that no one to whom Gallaher sold should sell for re-export to the UK. Gallaher did not want its cigarettes coming back to the UK because of the impact that would have on the home market. But he may well have been less concerned if they ended up somewhere else. </p>

Apart from that no other step was considered to ensure that the product was going to the right place. As to (ii), the supply of goods to a destination in which they are not intended to end up increases the likelihood that they will end up being smuggled. The shipper will not know the person to whom they are ultimately to go and cannot gauge the demand which they are to be used to satisfy. As to (iii), cigarettes with an English health warning have a cachet which makes them more acceptable to consumers and, therefore, smugglers.  </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002 he described his approach to HMCE as “<span style="font-style:italic">sell a little, see the results, sell a little more</span>”. In fact the emphasis was on selling as much as possible. </p>

Mr Clarke assured him that the HRH Group did not and would not sell to smugglers; and was told that, if HRH mirrored Gallaher’s policies and procedures they could never be accused of any illegality.

He made it plain that Gallaher’s prime objective was to compete with IT’s export business. It was agreed that H&amp;R  would solicit orders for, inter alia, Sovereign Gold and Silver, in North Africa (east of the Algerian/Libyan border) and in the Middle East but excluding Afghanistan. This would be for both domestic and duty free business but would exclude the open Cyprus market. Payment was to be by Letter of Credit with credit of 90 days after invoice. Prices for different brands were agreed. The business was agreed on the basis of Mr Clarke’s assurance that H &amp; R would do their utmost to ensure that the product was sold on the basis that the goods would not be returned to the UK market: see Mr Clarke’s letter of 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>May 1999.  </p>

Gallaher would then ship the consignment to a bonded facility in Cyprus – such as Attheshlis Bonded Stores Ltd. If payment by letter of credit had not already been secured, Gallaher would retain title to the goods. Namelex would then pay the storage charges for the goods and would introduce a customer who would pay Gallaher directly.</p>

As trade grew, sub-distributors could then be weaned off free goods so that the price received by Namelex rose. This was thought to be more attractive than offering cigarettes at an initial discount and then removing it, on account of the apparent sensitivity of Middle Eastern consumers to increases in the price of products.  Namelex’s customers would be told that the free goods came from Gallaher – as a means of showing that Gallaher was committed to the business and was providing support to the end customers. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“.. [Namelex’s] understanding of our start point was that we wanted volume and profit from day one and were not prepared to take credit risk. They therefore set up a duality, where Gallaher were paid on a secure basis at a level higher than the actual invoice price, with a proportion of the rebate thus due being paid in free goods: at the same time, they presented their business to their partners as one in which Gallaher invested heavily in free goods to support the market, thus securing the partners support and commitment.

But these expectations were confounded by a problem that arose in respect of product that was or became spotted. Thereafter, according to the e-mail, Namelex (i) replaced spotted stock in the market and sold the recovered stock at a loss “<span style="font-style:italic">in markets where they did not operate</span>”; (ii) gave additional free goods to allow reductions in price to achieve quick sell through; and (iii) extended further credit to distributors, presenting to their partners downstream that “<span style="font-style:italic">this was a fully funded Gallaher initiative, which would be consistent with past practice of our multinational competitors</span>”.</p>

He said that Gallaher was a fantastic company, for which he had worked, and that Mr Northridge, the now Chief Executive, had worked for him in the past and that they remained close.

Mr Hadkinson said that he appreciated this, as did Gallaher, and that he could ignore these prices. He should focus on generating demand in domestic markets at whatever initial price was appropriate and Gallaher would compensate him for the loss that he made on each case at the price at which he had bought it. Mr Hadkinson indicated that, if things went forward, Mr Tlais should contact him before making a sale in order for Mr Hadkinson to confirm that Gallaher would provide the free goods necessary to make up the loss to be incurred in selling at that price.

Neither Mr Tlais nor Highstreet nor any other Tlais company had any involvement in ordering, with the exception of certain orders for Latin America and Syria.  Gallaher would ship the goods, at its expense, to Cyprus, and later to Dubai as well. The goods would then be stored in bonded warehouses with Gallaher retaining title to them. Namelex would be responsible for the costs of storage. The goods would be sold ex-bonded warehouse, payment being made by letter of credit (or other secure method).

It caused Gallaher‘s Board to take a more detailed interest in Mr Jack’s trading business. In September Mr Northridge and Mr Simon decided to withdraw Gallaher’s more expensive brands from non-EU export in order to minimise the risk of their being illegally supplied to the UK. </p>

A meeting took place on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2000 between HMCE (Messrs Clive Oldham, John Wales, and Greg Marcanik) and Gallaher (Mr Jeff Jeffery, the corporate affairs manager of Gallaher Ltd, and from March 2002 Gallaher Group Plc). Mr Oldham asked what steps Gallaher had taken to ensure that its customers traded securely. Mr Jeffery’s response was that the pack swap survey showed that very little Namelex stock was smuggled into the UK but he would find out if there were any special measures. Mr Oldham also asked how Gallaher could satisfy HMCE that its major customers were not acting illegally; how it ensured that it knew where its products were sold; and whether it had asked Namelex who it traded with. Mr Jeffery is recorded as saying   that he believed that Namelex was the sole distributor in the non-EU markets for the relevant brands, so identifying its major customers was not an issue.  He would find out the relevant information and respond.  It is clear from Mr Byrne’s evidence that these responses were regarded by HMCE as inadequate. </p>

The problem, if not the solution, is well known to cigarette manufacturers. It is particularly likely to arise if cigarettes are stored at high temperatures or in poor conditions for prolonged periods.

Namelex suggested to Gallaher that it should be allowed to purchase goods already produced for it on extended credit, so that it would not have to pay until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2001. The plan – as explained by Mr Jack to Mr Mark Rolfe, Gallaher’s Group Finance Director - was that Namelex would sell the spotted goods through contacts of theirs and obtain payment for them by the time that the credit expired, and in the meantime would order fresh goods on normal terms to supply existing markets.

Mr Clarke appeared to be willing to meet HMCE but said that all his energy was being devoted to sorting out the debt owed to Gallaher. Mr Keevil asked for more details about Namelex’s customers but Mr Clarke expressed unwillingness to provide commercially sensitive information and said that he feared that Gallaher might cut Namelex out and deal with the customers themselves. Mr Keevil also asked about using more local language health warnings but was told that, because English health warnings had more cachet in the markets, local health warnings would not be used unless required by law.  </p>

He found that the main Attheslis storage facility was reasonably secure. But the result of the physical stock count there revealed 498 million sticks less stock than what appeared in Gallaher’s books, which may have been attributable to exchanges of stock authorised by Mr Jack, as a result of which some of the returned stock could be in Dubai (where there was an excess of 441 million sticks). </p>

The amount of stock in Cyprus belonging to Gallaher or Namelex and its customers did not appear consistent with the impression given by Namelex that stocks were moving out regularly. As a result arrangements were made to return to the UK some containers that had just arrived in Cyprus and others that were in transit. This caused Mr Clarke to claim that it would seriously affect Namelex’s ability to raise the relevant funding. </p>

This was the means by which it alerted manufacturers in respect of customers about whom it had serious concerns, usually based on the proportion of the customer’s total purchases which found their way back to the United Kingdom. In the case of a red card HMCE invited the manufacturer to consider taking action against the customer. The range of action to be considered was: cessation of supply; reduction of supply; restrictions on certain brands; delivery of product direct to intended markets; ending the practice of delivering to free ports; a review of export policy; contractual provisions regarding the behaviour of the distributors in relation to the destination of their products; conducting an audit of the distributors; and agreeing a system for tracing sales. A customer the subject of a yellow card would be one about whom HMCE had some concerns and about which it would expect the manufacturer to make further inquiries. That was the way in which the procedure was explained to Gallaher in a letter from HMCE of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2001 which used the red and yellow card terminology. </p>

Mr Rolfe explained the need to limit the supply of packs with non-specific health warnings.

Mr Jeffery set out the actions which Gallaher had decided to take: ensuring that Gallaher had prior notification of the final destination market of all goods; shipping the goods directly to their final destination market; identifying the supply chain; introducing a system for tracking sales of cigarettes into their final markets, using pack codes to identify destination markets and first customers; and ensuring health warnings were appropriate to the destination markets. In part, these changes were necessitated by Italian legislation of April 2001 which required tobacco manufacturers to adopt a coding system to record certain information on a cigarette packet, including intended final destination and first customer.

After this point he acted as an informant to Gallaher, keeping them abreast of the prospects of success of Mr Hadkinson’s financing plans.</p>

Although Mr Clarke’s evidence is consistent with Mr Jack’s statement to HMCE in June 2002 that he did not know of Mr Hadkinson’s involvement with the Namelex business until October/November 2001, I prefer their evidence to that of Mr Clarke. Their evidence struck me as convincing. Moreover there is no reference to any such meeting in Gallaher’s documentation (or any documents produced by TEL).. This seems to me an unlikely omission if Mr Clarke had made a special journey to Weybridge. If Mr Clarke had begun to tell a meeting including Mr Keevil about Gallaher being implicated in a fraud being perpetrated against Mr Tlais it seems to me improbable that neither Mr Keevil nor Mr Jeffery would have made any note of it, recalled it, or done anything about it. Mr Keevil’s evidence, which I accept, was that he would immediately have contacted Mr Fielden and Mr Perks and advised the suspension of Mr Jack. He did none of these things. </p>

The letter of credit was intended (by Mr Hadkinson) to be confirmed by Deutsche Bank.  Mr Rolfe raised with Namelex the possibility of a direct approach by Gallaher to Mr Tlais as a means of mitigating losses.

In about October 2000 he saw the free goods account between Namelex and Highstreet (which he was only rarely allowed to see) and it then stood at 42,469 cases.  Mr Clarke suggested that Namelex should take steps to reduce that liability and not long afterwards a number of cases were provided to Mr Tlais free of charge. An FOC Stock Report of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>December 2000, supplied by Mr Hadkinson to Mr Tlais,  shows 42,469 cases being due (19,185 cases having been released previously), which Namelex had instructed Gallaher to release.

This was to him an unbelievable figure, representing something close to one free case for every case ordered during the Namelex era. Mr Tlais had agreed with Mr Hadkinson that, once he received $ 30 million of free goods, he would open a $ 30 million letter of credit.  Mr Clarke told Mr Jack what he had found, and his belief that Mr Hadkinson was trying to defraud Gallaher. Mr Jack was deeply concerned and feared that, if Namelex collapsed, and Gallaher’s business in the Middle East with it, he would be out of a job. </p>

At a meeting in late July in Cyprus Mr Clarke told Mr Tlais, on Mr Hadkinson’s instructions, that the free goods would be released in August, although Mr Clarke knew that this was misleading.

He believed, optimistically, that Namelex would come up with the finance it was seeking which would enable the JL Spirits debt to Gallaher to be paid off, and free goods to be provided to Mr Tlais, who would then open his letter of credit and business could continue. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“In assessing the options, the other fact to be cognizant of is that [Namelex’s] customers have not been fully informed of the way in which they have run the business.

It envisaged two possible scenarios by which Gallaher would appear to supply the free goods which TEL expected to receive. Under the first scenario Mr Tlais would pay $ 100 per case for the goods which TEL had manufactured for Namelex with the cost of the free goods coming out of Namelex’s margin. In the second Gallaher would deal directly with Mr Tlais and the expected free goods would be provided out of Gallaher’s margin. </p>

The suggestion in Mr Rolfe’s witness statement that at this stage Gallaher had no reason to believe that the provision of free goods was to be in respect of any previous commitment made to Mr Tlais and was simply an incentive to provide financing against future orders is not borne out by the documents. </p>

It is, however, unclear what was the basis upon which the provision of free goods was to be calculated.  Mr Tlais’ evidence was that he would be selling, initially, at a price that was markedly less than what he was paying and that the difference would be made up by the provision of free goods, although no agreement was made as to any value that was to be attributed to the goods supplied free for this purpose. Mr Tlais was, so he understood, to be covered by the provision of cases to make up his losses as decided by Mr Hadkinson and Gallaher.  The calculation of the free goods account referred to in paragraph 198 above suggests a figure of around $ 100 a case, which was the price that Mr Tlais was paying in the Namelex era.</p>

Gallaher also realised that Mr Tlais sought to recover his financial position by continued trading<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="17">

Mr Bassil said that he, himself, could not survive another audit without taking action; and that the Central Bank was monitoring the combined risk to both banks.

A forced sale would be at a significant discount, would damage the Tlais’ reputation and weaken their influence particularly in respect of the collection of monies, and would have a negative impact on Gallaher’s business and future development in the region, probably leaving little opportunity for the recovery of outstanding debts.  But if Gallaher could provide $ 5 million in an interest bearing account in each of the two banks, they would be willing to provide credit lines totalling $ 4.3 million to Mr Tlais which would give him the liquidity needed to purchase Gallaher’s goods. </p>

Mr Jack apparently did not want TEL’s reputation to be tarnished by association with OTI (because of the association of its owner with Imperial Tobacco), and so a compromise was agreed whereby Gallaher would only pay TEL a commission on sales to OTI for Mozambique.  This agreement was not recorded in writing, but HMCE was informed of it on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002. There seems however to have been only one sale to OTI on a commission basis, all other sales being invoiced by Gallaher to TEL and then by TEL to OTI. </p>

The 365 day goods had a significant proportion of Lights also. Lights were popular in Teheran, although volumes were low, and in Lebanon (where Lebanese health warnings were required, which the Old Stocks lacked). The main demand in the TEL Territories was for full flavour cigarettes. Stateline had been originally supplied to Namelex for sale to the Romanian duty free market with brown filters and there was no demand for it in the Territories. Gold Arrow and Gold Arrow Lights and Businessman had been produced under a contract manufacturing agreement between Gallaher and Namelex.

It had gold packaging similar to Benson &amp; Hedges. For these reasons it was attractive to smugglers. Some of the Dorchester and Sovereign cigarettes were, as I have said, in paper parcels rather than the hard outers which were preferred in the TEL territories. Dorchester Black was a premium UK brand with no market in the TEL territories but a high demand in the UK. It, together with Mayfair and Sovereign Black, had been supplied to Namelex initially but later discontinued after Namelex had protested about the control risks of selling such a product, in that its high cost and the lack of market demand for it would tend to mean that it would be smugglers who would be interested in purchasing it. </p>

As Mr Stewart Hainsworth,  who became responsible for Gallaher’s AMELA division in April 2004 confirmed, the sale of such product is prejudicial to the brand, and may sour relationships with dealers (see, by way of example, OTI’s letter of complaint of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2003<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="31">

Poor quality cigarettes are not inherently attractive to smugglers. But, in general terms the lower the quality or condition of the product the more likely it is to find its way down the chain from legitimate distributors who do not want to keep it (at a cost), to less scrupulous ones, who may divert it and sell it to customers who are more tolerant of poor quality because they are getting the product cheap. In short low quality is a risk factor in respect of smuggling. </p>

On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002 Mr Jeffery informed HMCE that, where it was possible to sell the Old Stocks (then still owned by Gallaher) in Cyprus, this was to occur in Africa over the next 12 – 15 months, although much of the stock was likely to be destroyed in Cyprus because of its condition. That was not, however, Mr Rolfe’s understanding. He thought that the stock was to be sold in TEL territories (not just the African ones) over a nine month period. Mr Jeffery had referred in his letter to plans being in progress to destroy the “<span style="font-style:italic">first element of circa 94 millions</span>”. These were Gallaher’s Dorchester Black cigarettes with a UK health warning which were at that stage due to be destroyed because they represented a control risk<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="32">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Gallaher later reviewed the position in respect of the Dorchester Black in the light of the difficulty of destroying them in Cyprus and the fact that there had been some changes in the UK health warning.

On 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>October 2003 it had required it for all shipments from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>January 2004. Save for a shipment of 8,000 cases to Port Said in June 2004 for Egypt, and some shipments to OTI and to the Lebanese monopoly, direct shipment did not happen. Mr Tlais put forward the need to mix the Old Stocks in Cyprus and Dubai with new goods, in order to clear them, as a prime reason why shipment direct to market could not take place.  It is debatable whether mixing in Cyprus/Dubai, as opposed to supplying any given market with new product, shipped direct from the UK, and Old Stocks shipped from Cyprus/Dubai, was essential. Mr Tlais at one stage suggested that Gallaher should take the Old Stocks back to the UK for the mixing to take place there, prior to direct shipment to destination market; but Gallaher had turned this suggestion down.  Another reason relied on for not shipping direct to market was the need to keep the goods under Mr Tlais’ control and release them only against payments that would improve the customer’s debit position. </p>

However, in late May 2002 OLAF raided Mr Tornarides’ offices in Cyprus and seized about 11,500 documents some of which suggested a close relationship between Mr Tlais and CT Tobacco. Mr McCallum of HMCE was involved in the raid and reported on it to Mr Keevil and Mr Jeffery at a meeting on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2002. He was concerned that the relationship had continued after Customs had agreed with Gallaher that Gallaher, Namelex and its distributors would not supply CT Tobacco after February 2001.

In his evidence Mr Tlais suggested that in his letter he was excluding cigarettes such as Mayfair and Sovereign Black and Dorchester Black which Mr Hadkinson had prevailed upon him to pay for (saying that Gallaher wanted him to take them) representing that Gallaher/he had a buyer who would purchase the goods from him at a profit of $ 15 per case.   When no other sub-purchaser appeared Mr Hadkinson told him that Gallaher wanted him to sell them to Mr Tornarides. Mr Tlais’ recollection was that such sale was not to be at a profit. I cannot see why, if that was the position, Mr Tlais did not say so. 500 million was the figure that was passed on to HMCE by Mr Keevil on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Jun 2002.</p>

He pointed to the fact that the same problems did not arise with Dorchester cigarettes, which he alone controlled, as had arisen with Sovereign. He repeated his concerns about Sovereign and his wish for a replacement on numerous occasions. He made a number of suggestions for alternative sources of revenue including being allowed to sell duty free in Romania (part of Austria Tabak’s business), an extension of his territories to include the Gulf States, or payment of the $ 30 million which he claimed to have lost from the free goods deception, to which he frequently referred. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">There was an additional factor which made Sovereign attractive to smugglers. It  was sold in low duty environments so that, even if purchased duty paid it could be profitably smuggled into a higher duty market, possibly by smugglers purchasing in small quantities and consolidating before export to the UK (“hoovering up”). Sovereign Classic had been withdrawn from the CIS market in part because of the smuggling risk (although the amount of product supplied in the CIS was relatively small – about 150 million sticks in 2000). At the same time, in default of any substitute, Mr Tlais needed supplies of new Sovereign in order to have the income to pay off his debts, and to mix with the Old Stocks that he had acquired. Of the two other brands – Dorchester and Stateline – Stateline was not established in the TEL territories and had very limited prospects.</p>

Mr Tlais indicated that he understood TEL’s obligation to check to see that local distributors were operating properly and to communicate Gallaher’s philosophy to them. He undertook to provide a copy of his list of distributors to Gallaher, which could be shared with HMCE.  It was also agreed that HMCE would be supplied with Mr Tlais’ sales data on a monthly basis, which would be incorporated into the export sales data already supplied by Gallaher monthly,  and which would  broken down to show quantity and final destination market.

Whilst this would be difficult in emerging markets, Gallaher would visit those markets and meet with major sub distributors and brief them on the ITP and the obligations it imposed upon them.

That included a proposal to recruit, amongst others, a Regional Manager to oversee the AMELA region. The manager whom Gallaher selected was Mr Mounif Fawaz (“Mr Fawaz”). He had considerable experience in Middle Eastern tobacco markets having been employed by BAT for 20 years, latterly as General Manager of their Levant/Middle East business in Beirut. Part of the purpose of recruiting him was to provide closer supervision of Mr Jack. He joined Gallaher in September 2002. He knew from his past experience that Sovereign and Dorchester had no significant market share in the Middle East. </p>

He was also consistently very critical of TEL. When Mr Fawaz joined Gallaher he had heard through contacts in the Middle East that Mr Tlais was rumoured to be a smuggler. He came to regard TEL as, at best, a  wholesaler rather than a distributor and, at worst, a smuggler - in the jargon “<span style="font-style:italic">a DNP (duty not paid) reexporter</span>” – a view he stated within Gallaher on a number of occasions. There was considerable personal antipathy between him and Mr Tlais. Mr Fawaz, who has, on occasion, a confrontational style, was not, in my judgment, motivated by malice. What he was motivated by was an unwillingness to tolerate someone masquerading, as he thought, as a major distributor when in reality he was something else.  </p>

Gallaher was keen to save the cost of storage and, if possible, the considerable expense of destruction.  By 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>September, when he wrote to Mr Rolfe, Mr Tlais had learnt that Gallaher was taking the view that the stock should simply be destroyed without replacement security, which Mr Tlais described as totally unacceptable.</p>

These consisted of 20,000 cases of full flavour and 18,100 cases of Lights at the Modern Freight warehouse. 5,000 cases of full flavour had been released in July 2002 to Adam Trading (and so could not have been the subject of complaint by the bank in autumn 2002) and a further 3,000 cases were released in January 2003.  The remaining cases of the full flavour were also released to Adam Trading or, on one occasion, Drilon over the course of 2003 and appear on the TEL customer accounts with sales figures.

In the absence of any evidence from Adam Trading it is quite unclear whether and to what extent Adam Trading had difficulty in selling these goods; and Mr Tlais’ comments in a letter of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2003 that he had “<span style="font-style:italic">the experience of the Old Stocks which include Dorchester Paper Parcel, which are now two and half years old and are still shining examples of your production</span>”, without reference to any defective parcel, suggests that they were not unsaleable.  </p>

At the meeting in July HMCE had been told that systems would be in place to obtain evidence that goods reached their intended market. Mr Tlais accepted the same point.  Mr Clarke also accepted that, even in the context of the Procedural Agreement, TEL undertook a responsibility to get the product to the intended final market and to demonstrate that this had happened as well as to monitor where it went once it got there.</p>

I do not accept this. It is inherently unlikely that Customs would have accepted a lack of control in relation to 20% of Sovereign shipments or that, if an 80% figure had been mentioned, there would have been no discussion about the balance.  The suggestion that Mr Tlais’ commitment extended to only 80% is noticeably absent not only from the Procedural Agreement but also from letters that Mr Tlais wrote to Gallaher in 2002 to which I refer in the next paragraph<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="38">

TEL’s chief sub-distributor was a company called Adam Trading, whose owner and principal director was Dr Khaled Al-Mahamid (“Dr Al-Mahamid”), whom Mr Rolfe met for the first time on this occasion.   Dr Al-Mahamid and Mr Tlais had very close links. The distributor used by TEL/Adam Trading in Iran was called Parsian Fougan; although there my have been others as well.

If true this would have been about 5% or more of the entire Iranian cigarette market and a much higher portion of the value segment. This did not tally with what Gallaher saw in Iran or with a BAT paper on the Iranian market which Mr Fawaz had obtained from a contact there. This showed that consumption was primarily of American (i.e. non Virginian blends – no Virginian blends being in the fast moving stocks in all segments) and made no reference to sales of Dorchester or Sovereign<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="39">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 Firouz Homayoun, who was trying to become a Gallaher distributor, reported to Mr Fawaz that Dorchester started to be smuggled into Iran during 2001 and a sales figure of 1,500 to 2,000 cases per month was achieved; that in 2002 some had been imported officially and sales had reached 5,000 cases per month.

He reported that the business was doing well (Mr Tlais’ position having improved by $ 7 million since May); expressed concern at the halt in production of Sovereign (which had happened because of late payment for some goods and lack of satisfactory documentation); but said  that TEL had a large stockpile of the brand so business should not be affected.  He was also concerned to find a way of releasing the stocks that had been pledged by Gallaher to BLOM. The idea had been that as TEL profited from the supply of the 365 day goods it would generate the money to redeem those goods from pledge.   TEL could not afford to provide replacement security and wanted Gallaher to provide it. Mr Rolfe was not keen on increasing Gallaher’s exposure.</p>

Gallaher would lend TEL $ 1 million, secured on Mr Tlais’ personal guarantee, so that TEL could free up access to the pledged stocks. In return TEL would pay an extra $ 10 a case on Sovereign up to a maximum 100,000 cases, any outstanding balance on the advance being repayable by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2004. TEL would take responsibility for storing and selling the Gallaher Old Stocks, and, if necessary, their destruction; would use its best efforts to sell them in such a way as not to prejudice existing markets; and would account to Gallaher for the proceeds at a minimum price of $ 20 a case (unless otherwise agreed) and would receive a commission of $ 5 per case.

Some of those goods may have been sold, especially since the idea had been that TEL would endeavour to sell off the Old Stocks as soon as it could.

There remained no evidence that any Sovereign cigarettes had been received in Iran despite the fact that 451 million sticks had been shipped for that market. The documents that were produced (e.g. stock movement records, banderol or duty receipts and internal bills of lading), whose quality was poor, did not, on their face, correlate to each other and some of them, such as documents recording payment to the Iranian Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs, did not, in many cases, even show that they related to cigarettes.

Furthermore, following the meeting with the Régie, the General Manager had spoken to him by telephone, and expressed surprise at Gallaher’s choice of distributor.  He felt that Mr Tlais was unprofessional, and his choice of Virginia brands a mistake as the market was predominantly American blend.</p>

Mr Jack made a presentation on behalf of TEL, from a speaking note which was handed to the Customs at the meeting. I am satisfied that this approach had been agreed the previous day because Mr Tlais was uncomfortable presenting in English – as Mr Tlais himself explained to the HMCE officers – and was not an attempt by Gallaher to gag him. </p>

He claimed to have stock levels of 190,000 cases of various different brands with a further 24,800 cases about to arrive. By the end of January the stock would be mainly Dorchester. The main Sovereign markets were Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. Direct shipment could not begin because it was still necessary to mix Lights from the Old Stocks with the full flavour ones in order to sell them. By this time Dorchester intended for Libya, one of TEL’s territories, had started arriving in Nigeria, which was not a TEL territory and was an important market for Gallaher. TEL had been shipping goods for Libya to Cotonou in Benin, for overland transport via Niger and the Sahara to southern Libya. Mr Tlais blamed the diversion on spotting. </p>

Matters were left on the basis that if Gallaher wished to avoid a red card being issued (either against the whole business or in respect of sales of Sovereign to Tlais) immediate action need to be taken to stop  Sovereign sales to Tlais and to use local health warnings in future. HMCE recognised that some time would be needed to discuss things with Mr Tlais. It was agreed that Gallaher would report back by the end of May. Customs would stop short of issuing a red card meanwhile against Gallaher’s undertaking to accept no new orders for Sovereign pending discussions with TEL and Gallaher reporting back to HMCE. </p>

This was put forward as a means of meeting HMCE’s concerns and as something that might well also permit a continuation of sales of Sovereign, which would be largely under Gallaher’s control. Mr Tlais agreed that Gallaher should develop this proposal as a way forward, whilst expressing the need for money outstanding from the destruction process, i.e. compensation in relation to the destruction of the Arabic goods, to be given to him: see his letter of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April. </p>

In one version he removed all Sovereign sales on the ground that it was no longer appropriate to supply the brand, reduced the Dorchester level to one that he regarded as more in keeping with a Virginia cigarette, removed all sales to countries where importation to the domestic market was in practice impossible and altered the targets for Sobranie.  This produced a total of about $ 2 million gross profit with $ 750,000 commission for Mr Tlais. But to do that would, he estimated, require $ 2 million in marketing costs. So in the first year there would be no profit at all. An alternative calculation which involved focusing on Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, would produce profits of less than $ 450,000 after deduction of marketing costs of $ 1 million and before deduction of TEL commission. </p>

In advance of the meeting Mr Jack had sent to Mr McCallum a list of the sanctions that TEL had applied to its customers such as red carding TSS, putting supplies to Drilon on hold, and ceasing to deal with certain distributors etc. Mr Keevil had written to HMCE in advance identifying as areas for discussion (i) TEL’s perspective on the Sovereign issue and the importance to it of continued supply; (ii) HMCE’s attitude to a “run off” period if Sovereign were removed from the brand mix; (iii) HMCE’s attitude to Gallaher supplying Sovereign to distributors direct in the current TEL territories if TEL became an agent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Byrne did all the talking. He left Gallaher in no doubt that HMCE regarded the level of seizure of Sovereign in the UK as very serious. Between April 2003 and March 2004 Sovereign accounted for 56% of all seizures (in excess of 500,000 cigarettes) of genuine product. Between January and April 2004 it accounted for 65%. HMCE’s concern was increasing and the trend was damaging UK revenue. He said that this conversation with HMCE was to be taken as a second serious warning. HMCE was being pressured from several quarters. Comments about whether Gallaher was genuinely committed to its MOU had been made by the Treasury and the Public Accounts Committee.  Gallaher was invited to sort the position out and meet again in 2-3 months. It was made plain that any decision to be taken was a commercial matter for Gallaher to decide. HMCE also expressed concern at the level of stocks that TEL had; and expressed the view that, if Sovereign was removed, it did not want to see the position repeat itself with Dorchester. </p>

The upshot of their discussions was a recommendation from Mr Jack that, instead of amending the TEL Agreement to substitute Gold Bond for Sovereign, and in recognition of the pressures on TEL’s business as a result of the withdrawal of Sovereign, TEL should become an agent, with a $ 5 million a year profit guaranteed for three years.  This proposal was contained in a document, favourable to TEL, entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">TEL Response to Gallaher Proposal in Respect of Gold Bond and his detailed Counter Proposals</span>”. In the course of the document Mr Jack expressed the view that in considering whether the Sovereign seizures represented a lack of control and a matter of concern going forward consideration must be given to the fact that Mr Tlais had continually pressed for a replacement; had been open about the fact that complete control over Sovereign was not possible because of the demand for it by smugglers against which background he suggested that seizures were “<span style="font-style:italic">minor</span>” in the context of the volume shipped. </p>

I take a less cynical view. Mr Rolfe no doubt thought that it would stand Gallaher in good stead, in the event of any legal dispute, to show that it had tried to make things work. He also realised that any arrangements that were made would come under intense scrutiny by the Board, particularly if Gallaher was to give an income guarantee; and time was needed to work out a properly constructed plan with numbers in which he and a sceptical Mr Hainsworth could have some confidence when making any recommendation. He also did not want to improve Gallaher’s offer. He did not regard Mr Tlais as verging on insolvency. Indeed he and Mr Hainsworth had doubts as to the extent of Mr Tlais’ problems with the banks. </p>

On Wednesday 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2007 he told me that what he meant was that the result of that level of marketing expenditure (covering both advertising and selling) would be that the business would be profit neutral.</p>

He had used a form of management-speak, which (as often) obscures meaning, that was intended to indicate that at a mooted $ 10 margin the volume of duty paid sales would not support the level of marketing expenditure budgeted for and would thus show the impracticability of the proposal. It was not suggested that this level of marketing expenditure was unreasonable or artificial.  I accept his evidence that he took a figure of $ 2.6 million for advertising from an earlier Jack plan and added some more to cover the cost of Gallaher having people on the ground to control the business. This was not unreasonable. The $ 3 million figure was specifically referred to in the Heads of Agreement.</p>

In late August (by which time Gallaher had added Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt to the list of proposed territories) he went to TEL’s head office in Cyprus (which he found surprisingly lacking in facilities and employees for a business of the size that Mr Tlais claimed to have built).  He arranged to meet with TEL’s distributors – see paragraph 469 below. He became concerned that TEL was seeking to engage in transit business, having regard to   Mr Tlais’ expressed desire to include markets such as Sudan, Mozambique, Chile, Paraguay, and Libya via Benin, rather than focusing on a few key markets.   </p>

It wanted such a right, TEL submits, because it would afford an easy way for Gallaher to extract itself from the new arrangements in the future. Mr Hainsworth regarded such a provision as standard commercial term in a manufacturer’s contract for the distribution of its own products; and thought that no agreement was reached was because there was an issue as to who should be in control of the business. </p>

He referred to (a) a seizure in Poland involving 2 million Dorchester and 6 million Sovereign destined for Iran and Sudan and another seizure of an unspecified quantity of Dorchester and Sovereign; and (b) two recent seizures in Spain consisting of 3 containers (30 million) of Dorchester supplied to Namelex/Highstreet and 1 container of 9 million Dorchester supplied to TEL.  In addition HMCE had so far notified Gallaher of UK seizures of some 56 million Dorchester supplied to TEL. He recalled that, when Mr Tlais had met HMCE in Cyprus in 2002, he had made clear that he believed there was no issue with Dorchester supplied to Highstreet as Highstreet was fully under his control.</p>

(Mr Jeffery and Mr Keevil thought a red card was extremely likely). Thirdly, Gallaher indicated (i) that, if a red card was to be issued, it would be better if it was done before rather than after the Treasury Select Committee (to avoid the suggestion that nothing had been done by HMCE or Gallaher until the Committee acted)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="61">

As will be seen (see paragraph 510 below), when what looked to be a red card was shown, Mr Jeffery asked for clarification that that was indeed what he had received. </p>

Firstly they were not fully informed, as they should have been,  of the problems that that had arisen in respect of Iranian Dorchester, which TEL had been instructed to dispose of in non-core markets (as to which see paragraphs 1063ff below), no doubt, TEL submits,  because that would cast Gallaher in an unflattering light. Secondly, they were given to understand that Gallaher had ongoing concerns about the control of brands under the proposed new agreement, when Gallaher’s real concern was about being able to terminate the distribution of brands which were under its control.</p>

HMCE does not, however, appear to have been told about the full scale of the damaged Dorchester or that seizures of that product might be attributable to its sale in non core areas, much less that Gallaher did not consider TEL at fault. If HMCE had been told that Gallaher did not consider that TEL was at fault, it might have altered its view as to fault, but it was unlikely to have altered its approach. HMCE’s procedure is to deal with the manufacturer in the light of the quantity of seizures over time.  By now the quantity of seizures was simply unacceptable (whatever the reason or excuse).  HMCE regarded TEL as the link between Gallaher’s Sovereign and Dorchester and the smuggling of both that had taken place over an extended period. HMCE looks to the manufacturer to take the steps it thinks necessary to sort out the problem. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The somewhat stilted language of this letter is probably attributable to the fact that HMCE, at least in the upper echelons, regarded the “red card” metaphor as inapposite (since HMCE had no powers of coercion and it was for the manufacturer to decide what to do) and in part a result of the fact that the MOU could be said to have overtaken the red car procedure anyway. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Wells' concern, as an officer of HMCE, was to reduce the amount of brands smuggled into the U.K. It was the renewed presence of a different Gallaher brand in the illicit market, notwithstanding that there had been a period of time to deal with the problems of the Namelex period, that most exercised his mind. His approach would probably not have been any different if Gallaher had impressed on HMCE that they did not consider that TEL was to blame for the level of Sovereign seizures and said that they had given instructions for large quantities of damaged Dorchester to be sold into non core markets.  By now he would probably have regarded that as an explanation or excuse which could not hide the fact that whatever steps were being taken to prevent illicit trade, they were inadequate. The position might have been different if he had grounds which satisfied him that there were unlikely to be significant seizures of goods the subject of future shipments. But it seems unlikely that he would have reached that view before seeing a concluded new arrangement with TEL which so satisfied him.  </p>

The same pack marking was used for the Sovereign and Dorchester which, as the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2000 correspondence shows, was for Iraq. I regard it as unlikely that Mr Jack was unaware of the significance of this. In February 2003 he claimed that the health warning for Jordan had changed so that the goods could no longer be sold there.  This claim does not seem to be true. Neither the Tobacco County Profiles Report nor the ERC report indicates that any such change took place. It may be that the erroneous suggestion was put forward in order to support the contention that the goods were originally intended for Jordan and could be sold there; but I am unable to reach a conclusion as to whether that is so;</p>

Gallaher made a final decision not to call him during the course of the trial. I have not read that statement nor seen its contents save to the extent that paragraphs were used in cross examination of Gallaher witnesses or referred to in opening.  Gallaher regarded Mr Jack, who is no longer their employee, as having got far too close to Mr Tlais<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="65">

I was not surprised that Gallaher decided not to call him. That lack of surprise does not cause me to forget (i) that he was the principal day to day contact between Gallaher and Namelex and Gallaher and TEL and could, ordinarily, be expected to be called, and (ii) that, the fact of his absence when coupled with the evidence adduced might justify drawing conclusions adverse to Gallaher. I do not, however, infer that he was not called because, had he been called, Gallaher’s case would have collapsed. </p>

He also referred to discussions in early 2001 concerning the possibility of Gallaher investing in a factory associated with CT Tobacco, thereby implying a continuation of Gallaher’s involvement with CT Tobacco.  He did not refer to the fact that Mr Jack had made it plain that he would not countenance such an investment given Mr Tornarides’ involvement. He suggested that Gallaher and Namelex were colluding to ensure that the price per case paid by Highstreet was higher than Gallaher’s “list price” for the cigarettes when, as he accepted, Gallaher was not aware that Namelex was not using the rebates given to it in order to provide Mr Tlais with free goods.  </p>

Whilst this covers some of the documents not admitted, such as sales invoices, it does not extend to others – such as the signed ITPs.

A note attached to the agenda suggested that the then existing draft of an amended distribution agreement “<span style="font-style:italic">had been overridden in principal [sic] by the new working procedure agreed between the parties and the customs</span>” and that that procedure should be incorporated in the amended agreement. That suggestion was removed when Mr Jack re-wrote the agenda and attached a note on the distribution agreement which contained no reference to any overriding.  On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 Mr Jack sent Mr Clarke a paper setting out the tripartite agreement that was to become the Procedural Agreement.  On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 he wrote to Mr Tlais dealing with amendments to the TEL Agreement and the draft procedural agreement. In neither case was there any suggestion that the latter would replace or override the former.

No suggestion was made in the pleadings that the ITP was not applicable to all sales.

Clause 3 (v) obliges TEL to supply evidence of the shipment of the order to the relevant Territory where it is necessary for the distributor to make deliveries to destination markets via an intermediary port. The Procedural Agreement sets out agreements as to delivery by Gallaher otherwise than to destination markets and additional details as to what types of documentation are to be provided where deliveries are not made directly to those markets. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider in Appendix A to this judgment the method by which these figures have been arrived at.  My conclusion is that the figures derived by Gallaher both as regards “TEL Coded Stock” and “Stock only ever sold to TEL” are a fairly reliable estimate (and certainly the best obtainable) of the amount of stock supplied by Gallaher to TEL that was seized. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">I approach with a little caution the proposition that because HMCE estimates that the authorities only seize about one seventh of all smuggled goods and because the amount of TEL coded stock seized was about a fifth of total production of that stock, the likelihood is that virtually all of the TEL coded stock, other than such as was destroyed, was smuggled. Ratios applicable to the entire population of produced and smuggled cigarettes may not necessarily be applicable to individual sections.  It does however seem to me likely that a considerable amount, probably amounting to well over half of the goods supplied by Gallaher to TEL will have been smuggled. If the amount seized is looked at alone, the quantity is very substantial – nearly 70,000 cases of TEL coded stock and 75,500 cases if the non coded stock is included. Even if these figures are out by a third the picture of substantial seizures and much more undetected is not radically altered. </p>

When supplies of Sovereign ceased seizures of it reduced and Dorchester became, in its turn, the subject of very sizeable seizures. The size of these figures suggests that TEL had not taken adequate steps to sell only into countries where duty would be paid (excluding duty free outlets) and to customers whom they had no reason to believe were involved in smuggling and which, having made the necessary inquiries, they could be satisfied would behave responsibly, and to procure that its sub distributors did likewise.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The question arises as to whether those destinations identified in the Schedule which are not in the Territories were, or may have been, legitimate intermediate ports i.e. ports to which the goods were carried en route between Cyprus/Dubai and one of the Territories.  Some ports on the Schedules e.g. Bar in Montenegro, Illychevsk in the Ukraine, Rotterdam in Holland, Koper in Slovenia, Thessaloniki and Trieste, are hubs for legitimate, but also for illegitimate, trading.  Malaysia could, it is said, have been on a route including Pakistan; Loendersloot in Rotterdam on a route to South America.  But there seems no possible warrant for shipping from Cyprus or Dubai to Rotterdam or elsewhere in Europe, or to Singapore or Malaysia, goods intended for the Middle East. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">Suspicion that these destinations are not true intermediate ports in a legitimate trade is heightened by what is known to have happened in one case where the goods arrived in Malaysia. A number of the entries on the schedules showing Malaysia or Singapore as the port of discharge identify M’Exim International Limited (“M’Exim”) of Singapore as the shipper. On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>January 2004 - a date before the relevant entries in the Schedule – Gallaher had provided TEL with a report of a raid by the Royal Malaysian Customs at Pelapas, Johor. That revealed that master cases of Sovereign and Dorchester shipped by M’Exim had been repacked into a larger carton used to pack loose furniture and that the cartons were to be declared to Customs as furniture for export (according to an informant, export to the UK). Either TEL failed to inform Adam Trading of this information or Adam Trading ignored it and continued using or supplying M’Exim as shipper. </p>

In March 2002 Highstreet received a transfer of   $ 69,090 under a note “<span style="font-style:italic">1010 Dorchester for Pearlion less USD 16760 for our costs</span>”)’ There is also evidence of 2,900 cases (which appear on the Adam Trading customer account) being sold by Adam Trading C &amp; F Rotterdam, again with payment to Highstreet.</p>

If goods are sold by Adam Trading ex warehouse Rotterdam or are sold by Adam Trading to a customer C &amp; F Rotterdam, they will have been sold into Holland, whether or not they have become subject to duty. Their ultimate destination will then depend on the terms of a subsequent sale.  In addition the goods were not being sold to a distributor in a duty free zone but delivered to a bonded warehouse.</p>

Even if TEL’s obligation had been only to use best endeavours to see that Adam Trading complied with the ITP it is apparent that TEL failed to do so.

In the case of an intermediate destination that would involve documents showing not only the arrival of the goods at, but also their onward passage through the intermediate to the final destination.  Without doing any of that TEL could not procure (except by chance) Adam Trading’s compliance with the ITP, or fulfils its own obligation under the ITP to make the necessary inquiries to satisfy itself that its customer would behave responsibly. </p>

I accept that submission. TEL was in breach of its obligation to procure that Adam Trading complied with the ITP - by <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> selling products into countries where duty would not be paid or where Gallaher had other distribution arrangements and by making the necessary inquiries to satisfy itself that its customers would behave responsibly. If TEL was not aware of these sales, it was also in breach of its own obligation to make such inquiries in respect of Adam Trading.  Further clause 5 (iv) requires TEL to resell the Brands only where there is no reasonable cause to believe that the purchasers will sell them outside the Territories. A sale without restrictions would, where the destination intended by the purchaser was not known to be within the Territories, be likely to afford reasonable cause to believe that a sale would take place outside them.</p>

Damaged or poor quality goods (as some of the Old Stock and Dorchester was) represent more of a control risk than goods in pristine condition. A brand which is already attractive to smugglers is likely to remain so if the factors that make it attractive (e.g. English get up and global English health warning) remain, as with Sovereign they did.  The Procedural Agreement recorded agreement with Mr Tlais’ observation that he believed that, in the short term, there would continue to be product diversion of Sovereign.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">These considerations do not, however, sufficiently account for the very high incidence of seizures both of Sovereign and Dorchester and its continuation over the whole length of the TEL Agreement and across the Territories. The fact that a product has become attractive to smugglers does not mean that it must stay smuggled in large quantities. Much depends on the degree of control exercised by Mr Tlais and his sub-distributors, whose compliance with the ITP he agreed to procure, and the selection by them of the persons with whom they dealt. Smuggling is, in large measure, a function of availability. One likely reason for the incidence of smuggling in the Namelex era was the laxity of control exercised by Namelex.  If control is exercised properly e.g. by getting distributors to sign the ITP and monitoring what they are doing with the product, smuggling of the brand will decline<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="75">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> One example of what appears to be such a lack of control is the seizure of a container with 827 cases of Sovereign in Piraeus in December 2004. According to Mr Jack’s report the goods had been produced by Gallaher for TEL for the Iranian market (save for 14 cases of counterfeit) and shipped to Dubai; they had then apparently been sold by TEL to Intercargo (not on the TEL customer list). Intercargo took delivery in Port Said and the goods then went to Alexandria, Varna, Limassol, Burgas and then to Piraeus apparently, according to Intercargo, en route to Iran.</p>

Again much will depend on the degree of control. It is noticeable that Mr Tlais’ position in October 2002 was that all of his sales, including those into core markets, were ITP compliant and made to distributors who had signed the ITP.</p>

So far as reduction is concerned TEL suggests that little weight should be attached to the overseas notifications because they were not supplemented by the track and trace procedure and they may be less reliable. TEL then observes that, if you take the seizures notified by HMRC only, then, on Gallaher’s figures, the HMRC seizures represented 11.2% of all goods said only ever to have been supplied to TEL. Sovereign seizures represented 12% of Sovereign supplied to TEL.  Dorchester seizures represented 9.1% of Dorchester supplied to TEL. These figures should then be reduced to take account of the fact that the termination at the beginning of 2005 exacerbated already high control risks so that only seizures up to 2004 are relevant. In that case the relevant percentages are 7.4%, 8.4% and 5.2%. If reliance is placed only on goods pack coded for TEL (i.e. no account is taken of the 365 day goods) then the relevant percentages up to the end of 2004 are 6.3%. 7.2% and 5.2%. The figures are reduced even further if you ignore 25% of seized volumes on the ground that they are volumes to which Gallaher has applied assumptions about attribution, which TEL claims are unjustified. </p>

Since OTI was TEL’s customer, TEL was obliged by the TEL Agreement to procure that OTI complied with the ITP (as with any other customer). This is borne out by a letter from OTI to Tlais Trading of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003 in which Mr Nathan, OTI’s chairman, warns Mr Tlais that Gallaher is seeking to do business with OTI direct, rather than indirectly via Cyprus.

TEL’s failure to produce adequate documentary records of its sales/dealings and Mr Tlais’ conviction only serve to confirm that view. If TEL had fulfilled its obligations in this respect the likelihood is that there would have been a much lower level of goods smuggled and of goods seized and there would not have been the wholesale distribution of Gallaher’s cigarettes to destinations outside the Territories exemplified by the Adam Trading Schedules. </p>

Essentially there was a failure of control of the distribution either by TEL or Adam Trading (or other distributors) as a result of which Gallaher products could with relative ease be resold into countries where duty would not be paid and to countries outside the Territories or to persons whom there was reason to believe were smugglers.   Neither TEL nor Adam Trading can have made the necessary enquiries and taken the necessary steps to satisfy themselves that their customers would be behaving responsibly. In particular there was no sufficient record from which it was possible to discover at any given time where the stocks supplied to Adam Trading were, where they were intended to go, and where they had gone.  </p>

So far as the level of seizures is concerned Gallaher thought – erroneously – that the level of seizures was 74% of all genuine seizures by HMCE in 2003-4. That is what Mr Keevil told the Board on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2004, citing “<span style="font-style:italic">Measuring and Tackling Indirect Tax Losses – 2004</span>”.

Importantly, the figures which Gallaher had in March 2005 were greater than those upon which they now rely. But even the lesser figures relied on at trial give rise to an inference of complete lack of control. Those figures, when taken with the evidence of the Adam Trading Schedules, of which no satisfactory explanation has been given, are sufficient to justify such a belief.  The reasonableness of that belief is not displaced by the fact that Sovereign had become a much smuggled brand, that there had been damaged Dorchester sold off in non core markets and that Mr Tlais had been engaged in the clearance of the Old Stocks. </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> An accountant would call them a memorandum account.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  They are summaries prepared by Mr Clarke after the TEL Agreement was terminated and after Mr Khatter had left TEL. They detail for each customer to which they relate, the date, volume, price and brand of cigarettes sold; and record cash receipts from customers<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="78">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Mr Pollock found that 452,873 cases detailed in the statements could be matched to stock release and delivery documents. 9,400 cases could be matched to bills of lading and 49,985 cases to sub-distributors’ letters.  These figures cannot reliably be aggregated because it is not clear to what extent different documentation belongs to the same shipment. </p>

The documents from which Mr Clarke made his summaries included print outs from a desk top PC. The contents of that PC have not been disclosed.  Mr Khatter printed these documents out almost every day. They apparently gave details of the last three or four transactions (with date, product, number of cases, price and total), details of payments received and the balance for each customer (so that a lot of duplication was involved). In the absence of the underlying material it is impossible to tell whether the contents of the customer accounts are complete or accurate, or whether, for instance, any apparent sales have been reversed. Nor can their accuracy as a summary of all relevant sales be verified by reference to other documents. TEL’s’ own expert identified numerous instances in which he could not match entries in the customer accounts to any documents.  </p>

I accept Mr Clarke’s evidence that he did this because he thought that the documents were duplications and did not need to be retained. But he should not have done so. The destruction of the documents has meant that it is not possible to check whether his summary accurately reflected the contents of the base material from which it was compiled.</p>

Mr Tlais’ evidence was that the customer accounts showed the release of the goods and that the price recorded in them was not the final price, which was agreed only when the customer had sold the goods on. The customer would then “<span style="font-style:italic">take his expenses and very small profit for him and then [TEL] receives the balance</span>”. Mr Clarke’s evidence was that the price that was to go in as a debit entry in the books was agreed at the point of release. The evidence of both Mr Clarke and Mr Tlais was that payment would become due when the goods were sold by the customer. </p>

The total of the goods supplied to Iran is said to be the product of sales to Parsian Fougan recorded in its customer account (60,000 cases) and such of the sales to Adam Trading as were destined for Iran. But it is impossible to identify which of the sales in the Adam Trading customer account were destined for Iran; and the only figure identified in Mr Clarke’s witness statement as sales by Adam Trading to Parsian Fougan (5,631 cases of Dorchester) is too small. </p>

As a result there are very few TEL or TEL related invoices. The invoices disclosed total about $ 4.66 million and represent less than 10% of the sales recorded in the customer accounts.  A number of those are from Highstreet or Tlais Trading Company Ltd or are invoices to unknown customers.

That is the price used in the letter of credit for the relevant goods but the customer account statement refers to $ 60 as the price per case. Either the customer account statement is wrong or the price was not wholly paid by the letter of credit.

The disclosed release instructions to the several warehouses (the authenticity of which was disputed and not proved) do not identify the goods being released other than by the brand (so that there is no way in which the age or codes of the goods can be known), and hardly ever  provide any indication of the intended final destination of the goods. </p>

Mr Tlais’ evidence was that it was not he who did this. He would tell Mr Khatter that he wanted goods to be released to a particular destination and Mr Khatter would tell the warehouse that the goods were for that destination, or would give instruction for goods of a particular code to be released. </p>

Mr Tlais said that his instructions were that the release instructions specifying the destination should always be given in writing. I doubt that too. Even if it was so, Mr Khaterr did not comply with those instructions. Further, releases in respect of 7,850 cases cannot be matched to any record of sales, whether on an invoice or a customer account. </p>

The cost of sales is calculated as the value of the opening stock plus purchases less closing stock. By calculating gross profit in this manner the sales made in any given period are matched by the costs appropriate to those sales. Without such a calculation costs will appear in the account in one year (e.g. the very large costs of initial purchases in 2002/3 which represented 86% of total purchases over the whole period of the account) which may be far more than the costs properly attributable to sales in the same year; or one year (e.g. 2003/4 and 2005/6 in the historic trading account) may have sales with no apparent related cost. </p>

TEL mixed old stock with new, in what is said to have been the proportion 80% (new) and 20% (old). It is impossible to determine from the documents which sales were of mixed goods and of what each particular sale consisted. It is thus not possible reliably to calculate the cost of sales of mixed product or the value of stock left behind.

The effect of making that assumption was that there was (see Sub-appendix 6.5.2) a shortage of new stock at the end of the period resulting in a negative new stock balance of 80,740 cases.  This exercise showed that it was not possible to calculate a reliable stock movement schedule by category of stock using the 80:20 ratio. It may be that whilst in general a ratio of 80:20 did apply, there were some shipments of unmixed old stock or different permutations of old and new stock in the sales transactions.  But, if so, the documentation did not enable Mr Pollock to make an appropriate adjustment.</p>

They have deprived TEL, Gallaher, and the Court of the ability to have a reliable view of the success or otherwise of TEL’s trading activities or a proper foundation upon which to assess TEL’s claim to damages. The absence of such accounts and records has led to enormous efforts having to be made to construct from inadequate raw data the means of establishing or refuting a huge claim for loss of profits. That is, is itself, an indication of the materiality of TEL’s breach. One of the reasons for having proper accounts and records is to avoid the sort of protracted and expensive reconstruction exercise that has had to be undertaken in this case<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="91">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Mr Pollock informed me that he and his firm had spent over 8,000 hours in compiling his expert report.  Whilst this breathtaking total was by no means entirely devoted to constructing an historic trading account it is obvious that a substantial part of it was devoted to that and an examination of the deficiencies of TEL’s papers.  </p>

Another reason is to enable Gallaher to monitor what has happened to and in respect of its goods, to whom they have been sold and with what intended destination; and to facilitate the investigation of Customs’ seizures of goods, for which purpose TEL’s accounts and records were inadequate. </p>

No doubt it would have been a better position to obtain data from third parties if Gallaher had not terminated the TEL Agreement; but it is most unlikely to have been able to have remedied the sizeable gaps in accounts and records within 30 days or even a more extended period. </p>

Mr Jack had previously produced a memorandum showing that, on receipt of a further parcel of documentation held in Iran and with Adam Trading in Dubai, this figure would rise to around 95%.  On the strength of this Mr Rolfe had felt able to commit to his directors that 80% could already be accounted for. On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June he confirmed in an e-mail that he was holding up approval for the manufacture of a new order for Sovereign pending clearance from GRA that the documentation in respect of earlier shipments was at a satisfactory level which he put at least 80% of volume.

It arose in circumstances where the likelihood was that the goods had in fact arrived in Iran and Syria. Proof of arrival was withheld because one recipient was in dispute with TEL or Adam Trading and the other had been red carded. Documentation had been produced in respect of over 80% of shipments and Gallaher had been prepared to continue to manufacture on that basis. In December 2003 Hazem showed Mr Jack documents which, as far as he could tell (they were in Farsi), proved arrival of the goods in Iran.  The TEL Agreement was a long term agreement covering many hundreds of millions of cigarettes. Termination would have been acutely prejudicial to TEL. The effect of the breach, if the TEL Agreement continued would have very limited prejudicial consequences for Gallaher.  </p>

The goods, some of which were coded for Yemen and some for Iran, were in fact  shipped by Adam Trading to Rotterdam, with Loendersloot as the notify party, (although there are also copy bills of lading naming Metco Ltd as the shipper). This is apparent from a comparison of the container and seal numbers on the exit certificates which also appear on shipping documentation obtained by Gallaher from Metco pursuant to a letter of request in Holland. The goods had been sold to Metco C &amp; F Rotterdam.  Metco paid Highstreet for the account of Adam Trading. </p>

In fact TEL produced documentation which purported to evidence shipment to Yemen and Iran when that evidence was false.  TEL was also in breach of its obligation to procure compliance by its sub-distributors with the ITP.

When the words were added in manuscript shortly before the TEL Agreement was signed the parties’ intention must have been to allow TEL to sell in duty free zones cigarettes intended for sale to the consumer without payment of duty. It is inherently unlikely that the purpose of the amendment was to allow duty paid sales to take place via duty free zones; and doubtful whether an amendment was needed to allow that in any event. Whilst it is possible to construe the TEL Agreement in its final form in the way contended for by Gallaher by reference to the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">Territories</span>”, that involves accepting that the “<span style="font-style:italic">duty-free zones within the Territories</span>” means the duty free zones within  <span style="font-style:italic">“the domestic duty paid markets</span>”  in the countries listed in Schedule 1. That is contradictory. Much more likely is that the parties intended to allow for sales in duty free zones in the Territories, meaning thereby the countries listed in the Schedule without the additional reference to duty paid markets of which a duty free zone is not a part.</p>

The Old Stocks had predominantly global English health warnings. So did most of the new stocks. TEL was, as Gallaher knew, expecting to mix new stock with Old Stock.   As Gallaher was aware, during the TEL era the only countries that did not have specific local labelling requirements - so that duty paid cigarettes for the domestic market could have a global English health warning - were (i) Afghanistan, and (ii) Iran - until June 2003 when a warning was required in Farsi as well. Cigarettes with Global English health warnings could also lawfully be sold in Iraq after the lifting of UN Sanctions (on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2003) but there was no duty payable immediately after the war. In other countries global English health warnings, if permissible, were only permissible for duty free stock<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="92">
		<p class="FootnoteText">  It is not clear whether after June 2003 global English was still permissible for goods shipped direct to the Iranian duty free zones: cp Mr Jack’s letter of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 and paragraph 22 of Mr Goel’s second report. When Mr Jack visited the ITC in March 2003 he was told that the Farsi health warning would be needed after June 2003 for all imports. Hazem expressed the view that the date would not be universally applied and that that there would be some flexibility. The likelihood is that new imports for duty free shops did require a Farsi warning because duty free and duty paid labelling requirements had previously been the same.</p>

The island enjoys tax exemptions and reduced customs duties. Neither Iranians nor foreign nationals require a visa to enter it. About 1 million tourists do so every year. Gallaher was aware that cigarettes were being supplied for these duty free zones. There was a Gallaher show room in Chah Bahar.</p>

His witness statement made no reference to such assessments save that it referred to the October 2002 trip to Iran – his only trip to Iran in the TEL era. He compiled no report on that visit. When questioned about it he claimed not to have been reliant, as was suggested to him, entirely on those who had a commercial interest in inflating demand. Asked whether he had received any detailed analysis of the market by price segment and blend and brand preference, he said that he had got all the information and given it to Gallaher.  In respect of a number of the other markets (Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran duty-free, Iraq, Latin America, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen) he indicated in very general terms that he had made the necessary inquiries, knew the market well, and that Mr Jack had all the information. </p>

I  accept that a reasonable assessment of demand does not have to be made in elaborate detail or recorded in any particular form, much less in the form that a would-be distributor or a paid research organisation would present it to a client.  An experienced operator may be able to carry much of the information in his head.

That view was based on (a) personal experience and (b) retail audits. As to the former, between 1999 and 2002 he had visited Iran about 40 times spending about a third of his time in rural areas and driving all the way around the country. In addition as he put it:</p>

There is no one here who smokes those kinds of cigarettes.  So we asked for the listing of what they had imported, which they gave to us.

Its representatives obtain information on how much is being sold of different brands; and check invoices or take physical stock checks. Two audits have been relied on. One such audit was an MEMRB audit covering Tehran only over the period 1995 to 2001 i.e. before the TEL era. Between 1995 (before which imports were not permitted) and 1999 (when there was a general relaxation) imports were only permitted by those who had been registered for that purpose.  The second audit was an RAI Iran audit covering 2004 and 2005.</p>

It had the advantage of being the “first mover” after the market was opened up in 1999<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="96">

It is common ground that on the first market visit in October 2002 there was no evidence of Gallaher product in retail distribution. But Gallaher confirmed the presence of Dorchester with in-market wholesalers who reported (with what degree of accuracy is unknown) a brisk trade, and also confirmed with the monopoly that the stock in the market was duty paid. In the course of the visit Mr Rolfe was minded to extend the portfolio by introducing Dorchester Slims (he was subsequently persuaded - by Mr Fawaz - that it was inappropriate to do so in the absence of any market analysis).  </p>

In December Mr Rolfe told Mr Tlais that Mr Jack would present the brand support plans for Sovereign and Dorchester in January.  In the event he was persuaded by Mr Fawaz that it was impractical to commit marketing investment until Gallaher had a better idea of consumer (not wholesaler) demand and the pattern of it, which would be after Mr Jack had made a further visit. In January 2003 Mr Jack calculated (by deducting Tlais closing stock from Gallaher sales) that TEL (not Parsian Fougan) had sold 1.6 billion Dorchester full flavour (160,000 cases) and 20 million Lights (2,000 cases) the previous year. </p>

Sovereign was unknown.  He suggested that in correct hands (by which he no doubt meant himself) the product could fill a market vacuum created by the sale and distribution problems of Magna and Montana – two blended products. Mr Goel regarded this as unreliable not least because Montana, which he was handling, was selling 20,000 a month - about 12% of the market. </p>

He then took the ERC figures in 2004/5 and 2005/6 for the whole imported market. If major manufacturers occupied an identified percentage of that market he assumed (i) that all other potential competitors had the potential to occupy the remainder and then, favourably to TEL, (ii) that the contestants for the remaining share (or the whole of the imported market if no clear share was attributable to a specific manufacturer) would participate equally in the remainder. He then discounted the total market available to TEL by factors that took account of the distribution of cigarettes in the market. Thus if the total accessible market was 200 cases and the market was 82.7% King Size and 27.8% hard pack (these being the characteristics of TEL’s products) he would assume a figure of 200 x 82.2% x 27.8%. </p>

Firstly, Gallaher and TEL obviously sought to tap into emerging markets. Estimating the level of a new entrant’s future sales in such a market is not easy; and should not be unduly constrained by assumptions that the new entrant will have little or no impact on existing market shares. Some degree of optimism may be entertained. Secondly, Gallaher did not think at the time that it was supplying goods in volumes that were not commensurate with demand.  Thirdly, account must be taken of the fact that the Dorchester supplied by Gallaher in 2002 was, on Mr Goel’s figures, the total supply of TEL coded Dorchester during the TEL era. In addition Gallaher supplied 114,201 cases of Sovereign between 2002 and 2004 but that was, as Gallaher was aware, to go predominantly to Afghanistan (as was some of the Dorchester). Fourthly, orders in the opening year may legitimately involve an element of stockpiling.  </p>

Gallaher was, on Mr Keevil’s evidence, aware of the health warning requirements for the duty paid markets. It must therefore have been apparent to Gallaher that it was supplying TEL, and not GOTA, with cigarettes which could not be sold in the duty paid market.  </p>

It is not clear to me whether this avoidance was legitimate or illegitimate. Whatever the answer is, it does not seem to me that Gallaher, which supplied a further 4,800 cases in 2004 after those supplied in 2002, can complain of its use as a material breach.  Mr Jack was well aware that this route was being used and there is no evidence that he ever objected to it. Mr Perks’ evidence was that Gallaher shut down this route but it is not apparent that that was ever communicated to TEL.</p>

But none was supplied in 2003. In the absence of a better understanding of the unofficial route I do not regard it as established that TEL made sales in excess of any reasonable estimate of duty free demand.

Mr Goel’s view - that the 4,800 cases ordered in 2002 and 2003 exceeded any reasonable estimate - is based on the fact that in respect of both of those years ERC state that only 3,000 cases were not accounted for by the sales of local manufacturers and BAT, the dominant player in the market; and his expectation that a new entrant could not take more than the unaccounted for demand. I am not convinced that any reasonable person would be bound to make that assumption (and so assume that a new entrant would make no impact at all on BAT’s share), or that 4,800 cases are beyond any reasonable estimation.

For that reason he regards the 1,600 cases as in excess of any reasonable estimate of demand. That is one method of calculating demand.

As I have indicated I do not accept that Mr Tlais was wholly unaware that shipments were being made by Adam Trading to non TEL territories in sizeable quantities in breach of the ITP: see paragraph 618. The number and range of the different transactions was sufficient to give reason to believe that Adam Trading was engaged in an illegal trade or, at the lowest that it was selling outside the Territories. The likelihood is that Mr Tlais knew that that was happening or, at the least, turned a blind eye to it.  The relationship between him and Dr Al- Mahamid was close. His evidence was that the two of them were in daily contact and that their discussions covered the destinations of the goods. TEL’s business was increasingly dependent on Adam Trading, which obtained goods on credit in ever larger amounts.  There is no evidence from Dr Al-Mahamid to explain the transactions in those schedules, the extent to which Mr Tlais was kept in ignorance of them, or as to what checks, if any, Mr Tlais made on Adam Trading’s business.

This is difficult to square with his written statement and the fact that the customer was eventually red carded, albeit Mr Tlais said everything was done through Adam Trading. I am, however, prepared to accept that Hormuz was Adam Trading’s customer, not least because there appears to have been no customer account with Hormuz and, according to Mr Clarke, there was no communication between TEL and Hormuz. In circumstances where Adam Trading was given extended credit and TEL’s price to it was or could be dependent on the price that it received from its customer, the distinction between being a customer of TEL and being a customer of Adam Trading was less marked than would otherwise be the case – the customer was a customer of the joint business. This may partly explain the discrepancies between Mr Tlais’ written and oral evidence on whether a number of customers were customers of TEL or Adam Trading.

In the absence of any evidence that Adam Trading had an effective system for appraising and monitoring the activities of its distributors and that that such a system had revealed nothing of concern, and in circumstances where TEL was party, with Mr Jack, to the selection of Hormuz, it was necessary for TEL to carry out a proper investigation in respect of that company (“due diligence”). </p>

Mr Jack’s report on Parsian Fougan in 2003 gave details of their business which included representing Japan Tobacco and, indirectly, BAT.  He recommended them strongly to represent the new Gallaher portfolio. Parsian Fougan is the current distributor for Iran for Japan Tobacco, Gallaher’s now parent, and has achieved market dominance for Winston. Hazem was, however, overconfident in respect of sales. In April 2002 he had told Gallaher that there was a ready market for Gallaher’s products at a volume of approximately 50,000 a month</p>

According to Mr Jack’s e-mail of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2004 at some stage in the “<span style="font-style:italic">distant</span>” past they had been used by Gallaher to distribute Sovereign in Fujairah and he was not aware that any problems had been experienced.

These sums were credited to the Adam Trading customer account.  TSS was, according to Mr Tlais’ evidence, continuing to trade with Adam Trading but not in cigarettes, and paying Adam Trading by this route. Whilst the suspicion must be that TSS was still obtaining cigarettes from Adam Trading, there is insufficient evidence to justify such a conclusion.</p>

This was not one of the ITPs disclosed by TEL on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2005. It is also one of the documents whose authenticity was challenged.

Mr Clarke’s evidence was that the warehouses were given the country codes and were told orally that goods were for a particular market.  But, in light of the fact that most of the release instructions that have been disclosed contain no reference to the country codes or the country for which the goods were destined, it seem to me likely that goods will on occasions have been sent to destinations other than those for which they were coded. </p>

This never happened. Further, even if the country coding system had been rigorously followed, the fact that there were a number of distributors or sub distributors in each country (see the following paragraph) would have made tracking very difficult.

The pack coding system was somewhat rudimentary. But it could be used to identify what goods had been supplied to whom. The cases supplied to customers could also be identified not only by the double digit pack code but also by the other indicators stamped on the outers such as production order numbers, SAP codes and single letter month indicators – even if TEL was unaware of the meaning of some of these.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">These breaches were, in my judgment, taken as a whole material. Instead of there being a distribution structure in which care had been taken to ensure, by the making of necessary inquiries, that goods were not sold to those likely to smuggle them or to sell them outside the Territories, the reality was that goods were sold by TEL without the necessary inquiries having been made and sometimes in circumstances where there was reasonable cause to believe that such improper sales would take place – particularly in the case of Adam Trading, the principal distributor.  Sub sales were made by TEL’s customers to a range of purchasers in relation to whom TEL had made no inquiry nor satisfied itself that its customers had done so. The fact that, in the event, there were so many seizures of cigarettes supplied by Gallaher to TEL does not automatically establish that TEL was in breach of its obligations. But taken with the evidence to which I have referred it provides powerful confirmation of a failure of due inquiry and that due inquiry would have revealed reason to believe that Gallaher’s cigarettes were to be smuggled or sold outside the Territories, as in the event they were. </p>

Where a direct customer of TEL (“its sub-distributor”) did not sign the ITP, TEL was in breach of <span style="text-decoration:underline">clauses 4 (xxi) and 5 (v)</span> since, in those circumstances, it will not have procured its sub-distributor to conduct business in accordance with the ITP; nor will it have imposed on its sub-distributor the obligations (a) not to resell the Brands except in the Territories and (b) to resell them only to persons or firms where there was no reasonable cause to believe that such persons or firms will well them outside the Territories.  </p>

The ITP does not require the signatories to it to ensure that its obligations are accepted by sub-sub distributors (i.e. the customers of Adam Trading etc); and there is no evidence that TEL saw that there was in place an effective system whereby sub-distributors such as Adam Trading ensured that all such sub-sub-distributors signed the ITP or otherwise agreed to comply with its terms, and many did not.  A fortiori these considerations apply where no ITP has been signed by the first sub-distributor in the chain.</p>

In particular there do not appear to have been any terms and conditions which imposed an obligation on TEL’s customers to give an account of the destination or intended destination of the goods they sold or to permit any form of audit. Nor even, according to Mr Tlais’ evidence, was there any agreement permitting brands to be removed if they were being smuggled.

I do not accept this.  Mr Goel’s evidence, which I accept, was that in every country in which he worked with distributors including North Africa, Equatorial Africa and the Middle East there were written contracts. The suggestion that there is an Arabic bias against them appears to me at best a gross generalisation, and, in relation to the many non-Arab territories in respect of which there were no written contracts, an irrelevance.  Reliance on such a supposed bias can neither excuse what would otherwise be a breach nor eliminate its materiality.   </p>

The matter relied on in sub-paragraph 973 (v) is not a breach of the TEL Agreement. There were, however, breaches of the TEL Agreement to the extent set out in paragraphs 976 and 978 -981. These were, in my judgment, taken as a whole, material.  The absence of adequate written terms and the failure to take efficient steps to have downstream distributors subscribe to the ITP is likely to have significantly contributed to a loss of control of the Brands.  By March 2005 they were irremediable within the necessary time scale. It would not, I think, have been possible to secure compliance with TEL’s obligations for the future within 30 days and its non-compliance in the past had contributed to an irreversible breakdown in confidence. </p>

I do not regard Gallaher as having acted otherwise than in good faith. Such steer as Gallaher gave HMCE towards a red card which it was poised to issue anyway was not a breach of good faith. Gallaher thought that TEL was, by virtue of its lack of control, responsible, as I find it to have been, for many of the seizures. If Gallaher was entitled to terminate the TEL Agreement, as it was, its motive in doing so is immaterial. In any event, Gallaher’s prime motive was to bring to an end a distributorship with a company which had showed such a lack of control and which it believed to be complicit in smuggling. </p>

The goods were sent from Iran to England for analysis. Both products were, in his view, not suitable for sale. The 10 months old stocks were worse than the 20 months old in relation to cigarette paper whiteness and staining, and discoloration of the tobacco. There was print degradation on the younger but not the older packs. The foil tissue and inner surface of the blanks was discoloured on both but much more so on the younger packs. The findings for the 20 months old cigarettes were typical of natural ageing; the younger packs showed signs of accelerated ageing. </p>

This indicated that the quality faults encountered with the 10 months old product in Dubai, including unacceptable cigarette paper staining, darkening of the tobacco, staining of foil tissue and print degradation on the packet, could be simulated at elevated temperatures (60°C) in a confined space after 7 days. The severe staining of the foil tissue resulting from this experiment, greater than that on samples returned from Iran, suggested that the conditions in Iran may not have been as severe but extended over a longer period of time.</p>

The same tests were conducted with Sovereign which, if anything, did slightly worse. R &amp; D and Mr Jack concluded that the materials and production of current batches of stock were within specification and that the deterioration was due to the product being subjected to extremes of temperature during transit. R &amp; D were also of the view that, in the light of the quality of TEL and Hazem’s warehousing, the damage had probably been done prior to the goods being taken into the warehouse. Mr Jack expressed confidence in the goods in storage in Dubai. He expressed the view that the best solution for the future was to address the logistics of shipping to ensure minimum dwell times in ports and thus minimum exposure to extremes of temperature and temperature variation. This could be achieved if Hazem gave regular orders consistent with a regular sales pattern; if shipment took place direct to Bandar Abbas of duty free goods, and if the Iranians set up a tax stamp regime which would speed up the process of duty payment.

The essential question for present purposes is whether the quality of the cigarettes was such that, assuming a normal voyage and competent handling of the goods on arrival, they would remain merchantable until they had reached the warehouse, having regard to the time during which they could reasonably be expected to be awaiting receipt into the warehouse and the conditions which they could reasonably be expected to encounter during that time, and for a reasonable time after that. </p>

If the goods were damaged there was a real risk that they would end up being smuggled. That is not necessarily the fate of substandard goods; but, as the evidence of Mr Byrne of HMCE bears out, some smugglers may not be not overly concerned with quality and will find attractive products in which legitimate traders have no interest. A purchaser of substandard goods who finds difficulty in selling them may be tempted to sell them to whoever will take them in order to get them off his hands<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="116">

On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August Mr Tlais pointed out that being told that the goods seized were destined for Iran and their month of production was of no use because he had had to sell the damaged goods outside of the coded destination “<span style="font-style:italic">to avoid damage to the destination market at the instruction of Gallaher</span>”. He explained that he had supplied the damaged Dorchester to Latin America, Libya, Afghanistan, and Iraq mostly on an FOC basis in order to avoid storage costs and that it was unlikely that he would ever collect any income from the goods as he had many claims on file from customers who could not sell them.  The goods were packaged with Sovereign in some instances as they were so damaged as to make normal sale to regular customers impossible because those customers had rejected them. </p>

He asked for details of the parties to whom TEL had supplied Iranian and other Dorchester product in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, the countries in Latin America to which it had supplied Dorchester, the volumes of Dorchester mixed with Sovereign and the parties supplied with the mixed goods, and details of the steps TEL had taken to ensure that its customers exercised proper control and management over goods supplied.  </p>

It was open to Gallaher and TEL to agree that that debt would only have to be satisfied by payment of $ 10 extra in respect of each case of Sovereign supplied. But the parties are not readily to be regarded as having made such an agreement, which would mean that Gallaher would lose any claim to the balance of the debt if for any reason supplies of Sovereign ceased. Such cessation might occur if, as a result of events outside Gallaher’s control, it became impossible to supply Sovereign (e.g. because of governmental restrictions), or because Gallaher exercised its right to cease supply for what might be overwhelmingly sound reasons or bad ones, or because TEL ceased to order Sovereign (subject to any term that might be implied limiting TEL’s freedom of choice). </p>

It records agreement with a proposal that, once the $ 1 million has been settled, the $ 10 supplement should continue and be used to drawdown the amount payable for the 365 day goods. This is an agreement as to a mechanism of payment; not that, if the mechanism ceased to work, the debt would disappear. The agreement appears to have been something of a compromise between TEL’s wish to pay for Lights only when paid and Gallaher’s wish for cash flow.  I accept Mr Rolfe’s evidence that he never accepted that the supplement was to be the only means by which the debt in respect of the 365 day goods was to be satisfied, and never waived any entitlement to the balance of the debt if it could not be paid out of the supplement.

It sits uneasily with the contention that it was agreed in 2003 that payment would only be made from the $ 10 supplement since, if TEL only had to pay when it received value, it is difficult to see why Gallaher should accept payment by instalments. The alleged agreement, whether in 2002 or 2003,  is impossible to square with (i) Mr Rolfe’s recording in his letter of June 2003 that TEL had asked to pay for the Lights only when they were sold (not only when sold and paid for); (ii) the absence of any reference by Mr Rolfe to his accepting that position;  (iii) the absence of any communication from TEL, or in any other documentation, referring to either of the supposed agreements; and (iv) Mr Tlais’ letter of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2004 in which he confirmed the continuation of the $ 10 supplement without any suggestion that nothing was due unless the goods had been sold.

Such documentary evidence as there is has been obtained from Adam Trading. In the light of the fact that Adam Trading has been shown to have produced false documentation in the form of (i) the forged UAE customs exit certificate referred to in paragraph 376 (i) and the (ii) the UAE customs exits certificates and customs bill with false statements of destination (Iran and Yemen when the goods were going to Rotterdam, Adam Trading being the shipper) referred to in paragraph 771 , and in the absence of Dr Al-Mahamid to give evidence, I approach the documentation with a degree of circumspection.  </p>

I infer that the 490 cases of M code were in the same state as the K and L coded stock. The destruction of 13,852 cases of Dorchester made in the UK is attested by a destruction certificate of the relevant Ministry of the Sultanate of Oman dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span>March 2004, which Mr Clarke sent to Gallaher on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>April.

This lists four items (i) Taxes in Khasab - $ 41,556; (ii) transportation charges from warehouse to Jebel Ali to Khasab - $ 96,964 (iii) Municipality charges - $ 12,000 and (iv) “Other expenses” - $ 81,743. The document gives no indication as to what the latter were. Mr Clarke’s evidence was that he believed that this item constituted a consultancy fee to someone to procure the necessary authority from the Omani officials. TEL had found great difficulty in arranging for the destruction of the goods. Dubai refused. A sheikh from Ras al-Khaimah then wanted a huge sum to allow or procure destruction. In the end it was possible to make arrangements in Oman.</p>

As to the cost of destuffing, Mr Rolfe did not quibble with the proposition that taking goods out of containers for the purposes of destruction (or transporting them for the purposes of destruction) was part of the costs of destruction. These goods were taken from destruction from the warehouse in Iran in which they had been stored. They had to be taken down from the pallet racking, put into trucks and taken to the vessel. Transportation from the warehouse is included in Adam Trading’s fax.  The $ 27,704 appears, therefore, to be a duplication of the $ 232,642 claim. In any event it is not proved.  TEL’s warehousing costs (presumably from the time that it received the goods) are not part of the costs of destruction and Gallaher did not agree to pay them.</p>

But a TEL release instruction to Thomsun Mercantile of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>November shows the release of 13,500 cases of Dorchester,  and matches an entry in the Adam Trading customer account of the same date recording the release “<span style="font-style:italic">for destruction</span>” of that quantity of goods at Thomsun Mercantile.

If that did not happen, the account given in respect of the 13,500 cases is a complete invention put forward, at an early stage, for the purpose of inflating the counterclaim. I regard that as intrinsically unlikely and inconsistent with the contemporaneous communications about the anticipated and then actual arrival of about 13,000 cases from Iran (see Mr Tlais’ letter of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April and Mr Clarke’s letter of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2003).

As with Category A (1) I regard TEL as having established no more than $ 228,743 – $ 81,743   = $ 147,000.

His letter indicated that, after KPMG had raised a destruction certificate, Gallaher would credit the goods, duties and destruction costs as agreed in relation to each batch. In early 2004 a stock count began.  On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2004 Mr Jack had told Mr Tlais that he accepted Hazem’s quote of $ 4 per master case for destruction in Chah Bahar; that destruction could commence immediately in respect of goods already checked by KPMG, and that no claim in respect of destruction would be entertained without the original destruction certificate. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April he said that he looked forward to certification of destruction and destruction invoices in respect of the goods destroyed in Oman (being goods that had been shipped there from Dubai) and that he “<span style="font-style:italic">likewise</span>” looked forward to the Iran matter being finalised. On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May Mr Jack indicated that he expected to receive destruction certificates and that these would allow him to finalise financial matters in respect of Iranian stocks. In a letter to Mr Tlais of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>June 2004 Mr Jack indicated that if the destruction process took longer than two weeks he would pay KPMG’s bill in the first instance but would deduct all professional charges in excess of 2 weeks “<span style="font-style:italic">from financial compensation in settlement</span>”.

The invoice states that it is the only invoice issued for the goods described in it and “<span style="font-style:italic">shows their exact value</span>”.

The balance of $ 21 ($ 50 - $ 29) was due to be paid when Parsian Fougan had sold the goods on but was never paid. Parsian Fougan stopped paying Gallaher because of disputes about (i) Gallaher having been in contact with Mr Homayoun; (ii) Gallaher having shipped some LD to Iran; and (iii) the problems with the damaged Dorchester. </p>

There is no information which would enable one to know whether the 40,964 cases destroyed include some or all of those cases. Since, however, the goods invoiced by Tlais Trading in August 2002 only totalled 40,000 the likelihood is that at least 964 came from Adam Trading.

The amounts itemised include (i) transporting cigarettes from Bandar Abbas to Tehran; (ii) collecting cigarettes from all around the country and bringing them to Tehran; (iii) bringing the cigarettes to a central warehouse in Tehran; (iv) transporting the cigarettes back to Bandar Abbas; (v) and from Bandar Abbas to Chah Bahar; (vi) “<span style="font-style:italic">other charges</span>”; (vii) unloading and loading charges “<span style="font-style:italic">in several cycle</span>s”; (viii) warehousing charges for 18 months; (ix) destruction charges in Chah Bahar; (x) payment to sale agents; (xi) staff charges and (xii) further “<span style="font-style:italic">other charges”</span>, which I was told by Mr Clarke, covered, together with (vi), a consultant for the purpose of obtaining a licence for the destruction of the goods.   Mr Rolfe recalled that at the meeting in October 2004 when these costs were considered Mr Tlais had indicated that he could not support all of them. He also said that he thought that these charges were higher than they should have been, that some of the costs involved Parsian Fougan’s own vehicles and they should suffer some of the pain too, and that he was going to attempt to negotiate them down.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The generality of the description of the charges is such that it is not clear exactly what is covered. Item (i), for instance, appears to be the original cost of taking the goods on arrival in Iran to Tehran. Items (ii) – (v) and (ix) appear to be costs of destruction (in which I include gathering the goods up in order that they can be destroyed). Items (vii) and (xi) may, in part represent the cost of destruction. If items (vi) and (xii) cover what Mr Clarke says they do (what you have to pay to get things done) they may be said to represent a destruction cost; but the description “<span style="font-style:italic">Other charges</span>” is wholly inadequate.  Item (viii) is not a cost of destruction. It represents wasted expenditure which Gallaher made no agreement to reimburse. Item (x) is also something which Gallaher did not agree to pay. In that state of the evidence I am only prepared to take items (ii) – (v) and (ix) as representing the destruction costs.  They total 194,258,200 tomans. I was told that the exchange rate in late 2007 was approximately 935 tomans to the $. Subject to any further argument as to the appropriate exchange rate I propose to use a figure of (194,258,200 ÷ 935) = $<span style="font-style:italic"> 207,762</span>. </p>

That was decided so long ago as 1611 in Peytoe’s Case.  If however, it can be shown that what a creditor accepts in satisfaction is merely his debtor’s promise and not the performance of that promise, the original cause of action is discharged from the date when the promise is made: Sibree v Tripp; Hall v Flockton; Evans v Powis.”</span></p>

The reference in (ii) (b) to confirmation of the absence of claims by Highstreet etc and Gallaher makes clear that the release is mutual and the TEL Agreement is then dealt with separately in (iii). I am quite prepared to accept that the parties recognised that the TEL Agreement was to be the means by which Mr Tlais was, hopefully, to trade out of his problems and recoup the losses that he had suffered in the Namelex era; and that, if the TEL Agreement was at an end, the means of recoupment would be lost. It does not, however, follow that the consideration for the compromise was the fulfilment of the TEL Agreement. </p>

The example of repudiation the day after the contract (a circumstance that the parties cannot have had at the forefront of their minds) may be matched by postulating a repudiation in the final year of the TEL Agreement, at a time when only some of the $ 30 million has been recouped because the contract has proved unprofitable. It seems to me far from obvious or necessary that the efficacy of the parties’ compromise should be dependent on Gallaher’s continued performance over a 5, or 10, year period of an agreement which, although expected to be profitable might not in fact be so. In any event, on my findings, Gallaher has not repudiated or wrongly terminated the TEL Agreement. </p>

Namelex was entitled to make a profit when acting as the middle man between Gallaher the manufacturer and Mr Tlais/his companies as the sub distributor. Neither Gallaher nor Namelex was bound to disclose what that profit was.  Mr Clarke’s evidence was that the rebate process was set up without any intention to deceive, he being “<span style="font-style:italic">100% involved</span>” in setting it up (although not in its operation i.e. the actual supply of free goods thereafter which was dealt with by Mr Hadkinson and Mr Nammour). The intention was that Namelex would, using the rebate, provide free goods (purchased from Gallaher) to the customer as an incentive. It would be easier to wean customers off the free goods than provide no free goods and increase the price. He had discussed and agreed the whole idea with Mr Jack, whose understanding of the way in which it was intended to work would have been the same as his. Mr Jack, he said, was in no better position than he was to know what was happening in relation to the supply or non supply of free goods by Namelex. Mr Clarke confirmed that Gallaher were not aware of Namelex’s failure to pass the free goods on. </p>

Gallaher is alleged to have become party to this deceit and/or to have conspired with Mr Hadkinson to injure Mr Tlais by the giving of false assurances. Gallaher is also alleged to have ratified an agreement purportedly made on its behalf to provide 268,000 free cases or $ 30 million. This claim was not originally included in Mr Tlais’ defence but was added by amendment after Gallaher had issued an application for summary judgment.  </p>

It is not, however, at all clear whether any losses that were suffered during that era were suffered by Mr Tlais personally as opposed to his elder brother, other members of his family, or Highstreet. The letters of credit opened during the Namelex era were opened either for the account of Namelex or “<span style="font-style:italic">Ste Taleb and Mohammed and Khaled Tlais</span>”.

This loss, if suffered, cannot have been the result of reliance on letters written on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>September and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2001. </p>

When Mr Clarke first learnt of the figure he found it incredible, not least because it would mean that Mr Tlais was to get about one free case for every case purchased. Since Mr Tlais’ evidence was that he was selling goods at up to 70% below cost price, the $ 30 million figure would be greater than his loss as measured by the cost of the goods.  In parts of his evidence, however, Mr Tlais claimed that the free goods were also to provide him with some measure of profit.  The 70% figure cannot be verified because there are no records showing what discounts were given to customers during the Namelex era. Nor do the customer accounts provide a reliable guide as to what is truly due. </p>

He claimed to have been told by Mr Hadkinson to sell, or that Gallaher wanted him to sell, to various customers such as CT Tobacco.

This exercise is not an exact one. It is, in part, based on the customer accounts which will in some cases (of uncertain number) not reflect the price actually obtained, and it makes certain assumptions (e.g. that the goods sold were the goods purchased by the letters of credit financed by his family).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the former, the agreement of Mr Jack (on behalf of Gallaher) and Mr Hadkinson that  Mr Tlais should be sent the September and December letters was an agreement to use unlawful means, namely the deceit contained in those  letters. The dispatch of the letters was the relevant overt act. Since Mr Jack intended that Mr Tlais should continue to finance orders in the belief that Gallaher would be providing him with free goods, when in fact the responsibility for providing free goods rested with Namelex, which was showing every sign of being unable to pay, it seems to me that the necessary intention to injure Mr Tlais could be established. As a result of the deceit Mr Tlais was being exposed to a risk of continued losses.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the latter, I am left in such doubt as to the terms of the agreement about free goods as to be unable to specify what exactly it was that Gallaher ratified, if it ratified anything.  Firstly, it is not clear (a) what Mr Tlais’ obligations were (in particular whether there was any lower limit as to the price at which Mr Tlais was to sell); and (b) what he was to be compensated for. His evidence, in cross examination suggested that he was to be compensated for (i) losses, being the difference between his sale and purchase prices, (ii) for some loss of profit, and  (iii) for losses arising from bad debts; but on what basis these were to be computed was unclear. Nor is it clear whether the agreement covered both him and his brothers.  Finally there appears to have been no agreement as to how the value of any free goods would be calculated – the matter being left to Mr Hadkinson/Gallaher - and whether Mr Tlais had the option of requiring payment in cash. </p>

As Waller, J, as he then was, pointed out in that case the commentary to Bowstead records that the requirement for full knowledge of all the material circumstances is less strictly applied in the contractual than in the tort context.  Further, the distinction between material and collateral circumstances is not always easy to draw. Several of the authorities relate to the rather special situation of claims for wrongful restraint of goods, where knowledge of the irregularity of the distraint, or that the thing distrained was not a chattel, is necessary. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment Mr Jack did know the material circumstances. These were that Mr Tlais had been told by Namelex that Gallaher would be providing him with free goods in sizeable quantities by way of support for his business, and, in particular, losses incurred in starting up, and that the loss which was said to be recoverable under this arrangement was $ 30 million.  In choosing, as he did, to confirm Mr Tlais in his mistaken belief that Gallaher would provide $ 30 million or the equivalent in free goods he must be regarded as having taken the risk that the agreement would oblige Gallaher to pay that sum, whatever the precise route by which it did so or the circumstances in which the agreement to do so was made.  </p>

Mr Jack did not have actual authority to commit Gallaher to expenditure of $ 30 million.  His authority to authorise payments was limited to something like £ 150,000. He was a Divisional Manager and a director of the New Business Division, and he was Gallaher’s signatory to the Namelex Agreement. But there was, as Mr Tlais knew, a level of senior executive management above him, with whom Mr Tlais had dealt. It was intrinsically unlikely that someone in Mr Jack’s position could, himself, authorise a commitment of $ 30 million. </p>

That would serve to confirm that important decisions were being taken at a level higher than Mr Jack and without reference to him.

Such acceptance is apparent in the letters of September and December 2001. Mr Jack was placed by Gallaher as the interface between Gallaher in the UK and TEL/Mr Tlais, in a position where it would be natural for him to communicate to Mr Tlais Gallaher’s decisions. It could scarcely have occurred to Mr Tlais, or anyone in his position, that when he read the words “<span style="font-style:italic">We wish to confirm …We are currently studying the various questions</span> “ etc in the letter of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, it was incumbent on him to inquire of Gallaher’s top management whether that was indeed what they were doing.

It constitutes a good example of the type of case that would have benefited from the proposals set out in the Long Trials Working Party. Swathes of material have been copied but unread and unused. Much if it is not in e-form. The expert reports of the claimants were inordinately long. The four volumes of pleadings were, as so often, of little assistance for trial purposes. The possibility of a preliminary issue(s), or, at least, a structured sequence of decision making, was not put before the Court. I suggested such an issue – in relation to ground 3 – at the beginning of the trial; but, by then, it was too late to be a satisfactory course – certainly so absent the possibility of a speedy determination by the Court of Appeal of any appeal.  These are all defects in the procedure current when the case was prepared for trial, which the Working Party’s proposals seek to make good. </p>

There is nothing that Gallaher can do about this, although it is to be expected that Customs, in whose interests it is to have full information as to what is being smuggled, would endeavour to carry out a search sufficient to discover what different products are there and in what quantities. Further it is possible that counterfeit goods may go undetected if the samples with which Gallaher is provided do not contain the counterfeit product. </p>

If they did Gallaher would include those quantities in the schedule. In some cases Customs would specify the total quantity seized and the different brands but would not specify the quantities of each brand seized. In such cases Gallaher assumed that an <span style="font-style:italic">equal</span> quantity of each brand had been seized.  Gallaher divided the total quantity by the number of pack codes in the samples sent from the seizure. The calculation was done by pack code rather than by brand variant.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.5in">Gallaher’s assumption may be wrong. It is obviously possible that there was a much greater proportion of one brand (e.g. a brand not supplied to TEL) in the seizure than another. If, however, the exercise of attempting to discover the quantity of TEL stock is to be attempted, some assumption has to be made, and the equality assumption seems to me a reasonable one to make and apply across the board, particularly since any differences between the assumption and reality are likely to even out over time.  </p>

In such a case Gallaher assumed (when composing Schedule A 2) that the <span style="font-style:italic">whole</span> of the stock seized was a non-Gallaher brand. Gallaher took this approach, which might appear unduly favourable to TEL, because Customs notifications usually failed to specify how many non-Gallaher brands were involved, so that it was impossible to know what denominator to use.  </p>

If so, the apparent release of the whole of one code to TEL (because the amount released equates to the amount of the run) may not reflect what happened.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Pollock rightly observes in relation to these figures that they betray no recognition that some products may have been new to some territories and required launching and phasing in.  Nor is there any apparent recognition of investment costs (unless they are in the costs of sales, which are not broken down). The figures thus appear to assume that no increase in infrastructure would have been needed to accommodate a tenfold rise in sales. Nor is there any recognition of finance costs. The assumption must be that TEL would have been able to fund any increase in working capital and cash flow as the business grew.  </p>

The assumption is that Gallaher would have replaced Sovereign with a product of similar quality and market positioning, but without the control risks, so that the volumes and margins would have been identical to those that would have been achieved in respect of Sovereign on the basis of the contentions set out in the claim in respect of 2003 to 2012 i.e. that Sovereign would have been sold in the amounts set out in the table in paragraph 21 above and the volumes and profits would have increased by the percentages pleaded. Again the pleading assumes, unrealistically, a seamless transition from one brand to another without any reduction of volume of sales or profitability in the process.</p>

The combined effect of these is said to have been that demand for product from TEL fell significantly allowing other imported (non Gallaher) brands to displace Gallaher brands from their leading position in the market. TEL’s claim is that from early 2003 it did not have any product which was suitable for distribution even if demand remained; that between May and December 2002 TEL had sold about 140,000 cases of Dorchester; and that, but for the Dorchester problem, TEL would probably have achieved an overall market share of 20% with Dorchester maintaining a 5% share. </p>

The figures for 2004/5 are put forward without any support from the documentation disclosed.  The composition of the costs in Schedule 1 is not broken down.

The claim assumes a constant margin, unaffected by the effects of competition or increases in administrative, marketing or financing costs (unless any of these have been included in the costs of sales).   The claim also assumes a very large development of the business from around $ 15 million of sales in 2002/3 to $ 178 million in 2004/5 and $ 225 million by 2010/11.</p>

This would indicate a market share (of a market of 50 billion sticks) of 6% for Full Flavour and 1.2% for Lights. He initially thought that this level of market penetration was somewhat greater than he had expected to see and would have anticipated that penetration would be perhaps 4.5% and 1% respectively at the price point being charged in year 2 of the TEL Agreement. But he noted TEL’s allegation that the historical sales figures by the end of 2002 were between 4% and 7% and growing and Gallaher’s evidence suggesting demand of 20,000 cases per month by March 2003<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="143">

In relation to Iran he expressed the view that, even if TEL had not suffered because of the damaged Dorchester problem, its sales volumes and profits in Iran would not have increased to any more than the figure of close to 11% penetration overall which he projected for 2004/5 with a split of say 8% full flavour and 3 % lights.  He did not therefore agree with TEL’s allegation that without the damaged Dorchester problem Gallaher brands would have obtained a 20% market share in the Iran market if a full portfolio of brands had been supplied. </p>

The key determinant of consumer preference is the <span style="font-style:italic">blend </span>of the cigarette (e.g. Virginian or American). Blends have distinctive tastes and consumer preferences for them can only be changed at a high cost and over the long term (i.e. not within 3 – 5 years). Mr Gough believes it is possible to change consumer preferences in the short term (i.e. within 3-5 years). The industry generally views markets in terms of <span style="font-style:italic">price segments</span>. A segment is a range of prices in which consumers regard the variety of products available as being of equal quality. Usually brands are positioned in the same price segment in each market around the world, their position being derived from the position of the brand in the brand’s largest or home market. The price segments may have slightly different names but are often described as (i) “Premium”, (ii) “Mid price”, and (iii) “Value” or “Low”. There may then be an even lower locally produced segment.  </p>

He then took for each brand and market the TEL sale prices and TEL cost of sales figures implicit in Schedule 1 and developed a price structure for each market (incorporating all relevant margins and duties as derived from a wide range of publicly available data<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="151">

		  <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr Goel assumed that the duties, taxes, regulations as applied to the import, distribution and marketing of cigarettes remained the same between 2002 and 2012. This is unlikely to be true but the tendency of duties and taxes is not to reduce.</span>

		<p class="PlainText"/>
	      </authorialNote>) leading to a sale price to the consumer. The price structure thus calculated made it possible to assess whether at the TEL sales price to the consumer implicit in Schedule 1 the brands would be competitive.  If not, he computed what would be the effect of charging the consumer a competitive price. In some cases this exercise showed that TEL would have to sell at a loss.   </p>

There are said to be a number of reasons for this. Consumers who are prepared to pay a premium or mid range price may well cease to be willing to do so and the brand may be tarnished if in some countries the product is available in a lower segment. If so, it will become impossible to sustain the price. Conversely, consumers who are used to getting their cigarettes at a low or medium price level will show considerable resistance to paying a higher price. Consistency of price generates loyalty at any rate in the mid to lower segments. If repositioning takes place it will almost certainly be downwards.  </p>

Camel was sold in premium segments all across Europe (as the Appendix largely vouches). The document also recorded that Winston was being used tactically and flexibly and gave details of its positioning in the Appendix. Mr Goel explained that Winston was a premium brand that was not selling enough in that segment and was, therefore, repositioned downwards so that by 1995-7 it was positioned in the mid price bracket. </p>

However, as he observed, in specific markets, price repositioning – generally downward – may be necessary to maintain volume and market share. His view was that there were five international price classes: Super premium; Premium (which embraces, inter alia, Marlboro the world’s bestselling brand); Sub-premium, Mid-price; Value.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Lambat’s observation strikes me as an appropriate assessment of the position.  Manufacturers and distributors will, subject to any contractual restraints, do what they judge to be in their best commercial interests. There can, therefore, be no inflexible rule as to the price segment in which they will seek to position their product. Further consumers are not necessarily so sensitive to price segmentation that a product can never successfully be sold in different segments in different countries. Manufacturers are likely to position their product in the same segment across all markets but may reposition one or more of their products in a given market if they think it is in their interests to do so.  Any such repositioning from one segment to another may be upwards or downwards. Gallaher, for instance, increased the price of St George in Russia to deter smugglers who had previously smuggled the brand into Lithuania from Kaliningrad.  But it is more likely to be downwards since consumers are unlikely to be attracted by the idea that they should pay more than they paid before. Manufacturers and distributors will be resistant to launching a brand in an unusually low price segment because over time that is likely to lead them to having to lower their prices in all of their territories. </p>

In this report he carried out an exercise, in relation to Iraq, Iran, Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Syria.  South Africa and Yemen. He postulated a pack price that would place the product in what he regarded as an appropriate segment (either value or low mid price) and, working backwards from that, he deduced what CIF price would have to be charged by TEL in order to produce that pack price. </p>

Mr Gough assumed a pack price of $ 0.30 which, by back calculation would produce a TEL Sale Price of $ 97.48 and, therefore, a gross margin of $ 10. That calculation was reached by removing 2 sets of wholesaler margins of $ 2, increasing a Regional Wholesale Margin from $ 3 to $ 3.46 and eliminating a freight charge from UAE to Iraq. </p>

The explanation would appear to be that it is the product of (a) TEL’s pleaded actual profit for 2003/4 ($ 7,000,000 – see Schedule 1, para 8) and (b) the loss of profits claim for 2003/4 in respect of (i) Iran ($ 3,700,000 – para 9.2.); (ii) Libya ($ 2,267,040 – para 9.5); and (iii)Latin America ($ 3,825,640 – para 9.8<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="152">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Where the figures are wrongly cast so as to total $ 3,825,600.</p>
	      </authorialNote>). The figure for 2004/5 in the second column is derived from TEL’s pleaded estimate of profits for 2004/5 - see paragraph 21 above. The figures for the succeeding years are then increased by the following percentages: 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, and 0%. The figure of $ 16,553,520 in the last column for 2004/5 is produced by using TEL’s pleaded quantity of sales but using the margin figures derived from taking Mr Gough’s packet price assumption, e.g. $ 0.43 for Dorchester full flavour for Iraq, producing a sale price of $ 97.48 less TEL’s $ 87.48 cost of sales figure leading to a    $ 10 gross margin. The figure for 2005/6 is a 10% increase. The figures for the succeeding years are increased by figures which are close to but not always the same as the original 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 %. The difference is to take account of the fact that Mr Gough believed that TEL would never capture more than 542,850 cases in Iran (nearly 11% of the Iran market).   </p>

It is relevant, however, to point out that Mr Gough said in this third report that he does not believe that TEL would “<span style="font-style:italic">necessarily generally”</span> only have been able to sell its brands in the value segment. It could have commanded a retail sales price at the lower end of the mid price segment.

Such sales would comprise diplomatic and military stores and ship’s chandlers.  Mr Goel’s experience at BAT was that legitimate sales to <span style="font-style:italic">diplomatic stores</span> were very small, a maximum of 100 cases per year. Sales to <span style="font-style:italic">military stores</span> were usually handled directly by the manufacturer, not a distributor, as military organisations purchased supplies for a number of countries from one source, usually in the home location of the manufacturer. So far as <span style="font-style:italic">ships’ chandlers </span>are concerned , his experience in 1998 – 2001 was that most manufacturers limited sale to ships’ chandlers to below 50 cases per month, which would allow most of them to supply up to 2 cases per month to each ship of any particular brand. </p>

In his view TEL could not have legitimately sold significant quantities of goods in duty free zones and shops in its territories.</p>

That included approving, on behalf of the Finance Director, the sales price and marketing spend for the Middle East, and considering the cost of sales. Part of his role also involved liaising with HMCE to satisfy it that the volume of exports to the Middle East was commensurate with market demand. Between 1999 and the end of 2001 he was manager of an internal audit team at RJ Reynolds International, whose business Japan Tobacco had acquired. This was also an accountancy role but included responsibility for indirect tax policy. Part of his responsibility was to take steps to reduce the level of diversion of JTI’s international brands in Latin America, Africa and the Middle Estate by, inter alia, ensuring that volumes supplied were commensurate with demand.  </p>

Some of his opinions crossed the border between opinion and advocacy. It is also apparent to me that he did not approach his task with the neutrality to be expected of an expert. He was provided with three documents critical of tobacco manufacturers and with the TEL witness statements (as well as some other documents) but not with the Gallaher witness statements. He appears to have held the view, before knowing anything about the facts of the case, that Gallaher, and the rest of the tobacco industry, was creating an impression of cooperation with HMCE without any real intention of co-operating with them in a bona fide manner. His Industry report contained a number of very broad allegations about tobacco manufacturers in general,  including, therefore, Gallaher e.g., that they were motivated by a desire to promote smuggling, for which, apart from the Andorran episode, there was, so far as Gallaher is concerned, a dearth of evidence. </p>

His second report involved no further research and consisted largely of comments on TEL figures. His third report produced lower TEL sales prices, in order to accommodate lower pack prices. It is entirely unclear whether TEL would have sold at those prices – TEL’s factual evidence, such as it was, having been that the Schedule 1 figures represented the “<span style="font-style:italic">correct assessments of the finances of the TEL business and its profitability (and projected profitability)</span>”. There were some notable inconsistencies between the third and the second report and one marked inconsistency with the industry report (which refers to there being no market for Stateline whereas the third report assumes a sale in 2004/5 of 2.9 billion sticks).</p>

They are also put forward on the basis not only that there had been no termination but also that there had been no problem with the damaged Dorchester. If the termination was unlawful but Gallaher is not legally responsible for the damaged Dorchester one of the assumptions is misplaced. </p>

The figures further suggest that the greater raw gross profit margin and net profit margin actually earned, compared with Schedule VI, derives from the availability of Old Stocks at less than the price for stock supplied under the TEL Agreement.

On the material before me, such an exercise would not be the application of a robust judgment; but one at best speculative and at worst arbitrary.</p>

Nor does the evidence explain how, with a wider portfolio of brands but the same volume, overall profits would have been 15-20% higher, nor establish that that would be so. I agree with Mr Goel’s comment that, whilst replacing claimed low margin volume with the same volume of high margin products would mathematically yield higher margins, expanding the portfolio would not necessarily cause volumes of the brands already in the portfolio to be reduced and replaced by the new higher margin brands. To infer that it would produce a 15-20% increase would, on the material before me, be nothing other than conjecture.  </p>

The claim cannot be maintained together with the loss of profits claim since the latter asserts that TEL lost the profit on 90,000 cases of Lights in 2003/4 and 398,000 cases in 2004/5.

Imported international brands represent 67 % (MEMRB retail audit) or 63% (ERC) of the market.   The imported international brands market is American blend. MEMRB identified a small Virginia blend segment in 1999 (0.3%), being the last full year of Silk Cut, a premium price brand, sales in Tehran. Mr Goel’s evidence was that there was no data supporting the continued existence of such a segment. Accordingly, as he concludes, the only TEL brand with potential is State Line. (Mr Gough accepts that the market is predominantly American blend but is of the view that there is a significant existing market and growth potential for Virginia, particularly outside Tehran). </p>

In order to position Sovereign (or any other cigarette) in the imported mid price section (i.e. the section immediately above the value section) the CIF price would need to be less than $ 92 per case.  If TEL reduced its CIF price to $ 91.67 it could position Sovereign in the mid price segment<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="169">

He acted on the basis of unspecified information from Japan Tobacco International.  I am left in considerable doubt as to whether he has included all relevant taxes. He has also eliminated a distributor (so that there were only three margins- Importer, wholesaler, and retailer) and excluded internal freight and documentation charges as being the responsibility of the in-market wholesaler. There was, however, a secondary wholesaler in Iran, a photograph of whom appears in the papers. Mr Gough calculated that it would be possible to sell Dorchester in 2004/5 at a price of $ 0.43 with a TEL margin of $ 10 a case. I do not regard this as likely.</p>

I have my doubts about that. Mr Gough’s calculations reduces the margin for the In-market distributor from Mr Goel’s $ 19.94 figure to $ 12.97, and assumed that he bears the $ 2 and $ 1 charges, reducing his margin to $ 9.97.

He also excludes a semi-wholesaler margin and assumes, on instructions and from experience, that only one in-market wholesale margin would be applicable. Again I have doubts about that. He also excludes port charges and handling charges on the ground that the CIF price will include carriage and insurance to a named location in Libya. It is not at all clear to me whether such charges can properly be eliminated, not least because what they covered was not explored in evidence.

He includes the non GTC taxation and duty payments on the ground that some duty or equivalent payments would need to be due to those in control of the tribal routes. What exactly those payments would be is unclear. Further his calculations do not seem to take into account the cost of using the route itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.5in">   The sale price of Sovereign implicit in Schedule 1 is $ 120 with costs of sales of $ 88.33. This would produce a price per pack of $ 2.10.That price would result in Sovereign being sold at 89% of the B &amp; H price. So TEL could arguably create a mid-price segment (unless there is some practical barrier to the creation of one, which the absence of such a segment might suggest). Mr Goel estimates that, on that footing, there is a potential of 1% of the whole market for Sovereign, being the estimated market size of the smallest established Virginia brand in the import segment – Karelia Royal. This would result in Sovereign sales of 2,600 cases per year yielding TEL, if trading took place at all, a gross margin of $ 82,342. In Mr Goel’s opinion an annual volume below 4,800 cases would not be viable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.5in">   An annual volume below 4,800 cases is not viable both (a) intrinsically and (b) because the effect of clauses 4 (xv) and 4 (xvi) of the TEL Agreement taken with Schedules III and IV is to prevent TEL from conducting a business of less than that number of cases per year.  Under those provisions TEL is required to use its best endeavours to limit stock to not more than two months in market sales per Territory and to purchase in units of 40’ containers, which hold about 8 million sticks. TEL would thus have to order at least 4 million sticks per month or 48 million sticks (4,800 cases) per annum. </p>

Most of the product is shipped under duty suspension from Bandar Abbas in Iran to the Iran/Afghanistan border near Mashar. This route is taken, rather than importation from Western Pakistan because products imported through Pakistan effectively pay local taxes and duties even if they are intended for re-export.  Duties are paid once the goods enter Afghanistan (ad valorem based on declared CIF price – around 40%) and the goods are transported to Herat. From there they are then transported to Kandahar in the South East near the Pakistan border, which is the main base for distributors. </p>

The basis and assumptions upon which Mr Goel’s assessment is based are contained in Schedule 7 to his report. They include assuming, in the case of Pakistan, that the TEL sales prices as identified in Schedule 1 would enable each identified TEL brand to be sold at the appropriate competitive price segment; and  assuming that where it appears possible for TEL to enter into a market ( because it is selling appropriate blends at apparently appropriate prices) and no clear indication is available of existing market shares  TEL will achieve an equal share with any competitors identified (“the equal share assumption”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.5in">   Mr Gough was unable to analyse any individual breakdown for duty paid sales in Latin America as there was no such breakdown in Schedule 1. He reckoned that since sales were, at least initially, to be on a duty free basis the projected volumes were conservative. This was not, however, based on any expertise or experience. He produced no reasoning or analysis to contradict Mr Goel.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.5in">   TEL put forward a series of alternative calculations based on tobacco manufacture in Poland or elsewhere outside the UK. I do not propose to address these. No suggestion was made in the pleadings that damages should be calculated by reference to non UK manufacture.  The calculations surfaced only in Mr Gough’s third report, which came forward two weeks after the conclusion of Gallaher’s factual evidence.  The question as to whether Gallaher would have undertaken Polish manufacture (provided for by the July 2004 Heads of Agreement but not by way of contract) and what the ramifications of that would be was not addressed to any substantial extent in evidence.  TEL had no entitlement to non UK manufacture or to any price reduction on that account. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in">Cigarette labelling was from May/June 2003 the same as for the domestic market. All cigarettes in duty free shops therefore require a Farsi health warning. A company called Shaheed was the exclusive duty free operator in Iran, including licensed outlets in duty free zones. The total legitimate sales through duty free shops of all brands is estimated to be 5 containers annually because that is what Shahed is understood to sell. Duty free allowances are only available to Iranian nationals in a free zone if they leave the country with the product purchased. If cigarettes are purchased in a duty free zone and taken into Iran they are subject to all applicable duties, taxes and regulations. The legitimate import of duty free goods into Iran would have been limited because only foreign visitors could do so and then only in limited quantities.</p>

Mr Goel thought that the goods sold to TEL would not have complied with these requirements; but that will depend on the content of the “Latin American health clause” with which one consignment of 40,000 cases was labelled. Travellers are allowed to bring into Argentina a maximum of 20 packs of cigarettes without paying duty.</p>
