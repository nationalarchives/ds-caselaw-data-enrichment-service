	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a claim by the Claimant, Plantation Holdings (FZ) LLC (‘Plantation’) for some US$2 billion. Plantation is a Dubai company which was incorporated in 2004 for the purpose of developing an upmarket and exclusive polo facility on the outskirts of Dubai which was to include villas, a hotel, rented flats and business units (‘Plantation Project’ or ‘the Project’). The land had originally, on 25 January 2004, been leased by the Dubai Development and Investment Authority (‘DDIA’), a company which subsequently assigned its rights under the Lease to Dubai Tourism Development Company LLC (‘DTDC’) (later renamed Dubai Land LLC (‘Dubailand’)) to Mr Arthur Fitzwilliam (the ‘Lease’), the majority shareholder and manager of Plantation who assigned his interest to Plantation in December 2004. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Fitzwilliam’s original idea had been relatively modest: to build what he picturesquely described as a <span style="font-style:italic">“polo commune”</span> for <span style="font-style:italic">“polo mates”</span> consisting of <span style="font-style:italic">“a single polo field with some villas around it”</span>. Although the focus of the Project was to remain on polo and equestrian matters, there was a substantial change in terms of the scale of the Project which was ultimately intended to be on so grand a scale that it would cover a land area a third larger than Hyde Park, with four polo fields. This was to be a very substantial development which would be constructed out of desert land at a considerable cost (as at January 2008, some AED 1.39 billion or US$380 million).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Lease permitted the development of a polo and equestrian facility, a hotel, business units, villas and apartments for sale. Specifically, the Lease, which was for a period of 49 years renewable for another 50 years and which was subject to Dubai law, defined the <span style="font-style:italic">“Premises”</span> as being <span style="font-style:italic">“that piece of land consisting of more or less of … 14,372,941 sq. ft. … located at Dubai Land and as more particularly identified on the Plan of the Premises attached as the First Schedule hereto”</span>. This was revised upwards to 20,000,000.50 square feet by an amendment entered into on 3 October 2004. The Lease went on to define the <span style="font-style:italic">“Project”</span> as being <span style="font-style:italic">“the Project called Plantation to be constructed by the Tenant on the Premises which includes, but is not limited to, a multifunction development comprising a hotel in combination with an independent Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, Equestrian Center, polo fields, stabling, veterinary clinic and residential villas and or apartments for sale, and as may be varied with agreement of both Parties”</span>. The 3 October 2004 amendment introduced into this description of the<span style="font-style:italic"> “Project”</span> a reference also to an <span style="font-style:italic">“Equine University”</span>. As Mr Fitzwilliam put it when describing the scale of the Project when giving his evidence, there was an occasion fairly early on, when he drove out <span style="font-style:italic">“to the desert, overlooking the piece of land before the one we actually got, because there were a number of changes” </span>and parked <span style="font-style:italic">“on this high dune looking over the land that had just been allotted to me, thinking, ‘Oh my God, what have I done?’”</span>. Mr Fitzwilliam may have been momentarily somewhat overawed. He was nonetheless not apparently overly perturbed since, as I shall come on to explain, he thereafter set about turning his idea into reality. Unfortunately for Mr Fitzwilliam, the reality turned out to be rather different to that which he had hoped for. The <span style="font-style:italic">“world full of fun and adventure”</span> which one of the advertising hoardings on the site boasted the Project would be did not materialise: the Project was never completed and Mr Fitzwilliam was to find himself incarcerated in a Dubai prison for some three years as a result of his involvement with the Project, only ultimately to be acquitted of the charges which he faced, during which time the Defendant, Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (‘DIB’), a Dubai incorporated bank and one of the largest banks in the Middle East, took possession of the land held by Plantation. This was clearly not the <span style="font-style:italic">“adventure”</span> (still less the <span style="font-style:italic">“fun”</span>) which Mr Fitzwilliam had hoped for.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This case is a further consequence of Mr Fitzwilliam’s unfulfilled dream of creating the Project. Specifically, the case arises under a contract (‘the Restructuring Agreement’ or ‘the RSA’) entered into on 19 August 2007 and which provides for the restructuring of approximately US$501 million (the ‘Rescheduling Amount’) in payments owed to DIB. Specifically, the RSA was entered into as a result of the fraudulent misappropriation of certain funds received from DIB by individuals who are not involved in the current proceedings (the ‘CCH fraud’). These individuals, Mr Ryan Cornelius and Mr Charles Ridley, were investors in the Plantation Project, who, unbeknownst to Plantation, used about US$18 million of the misappropriated funds by way of investment in the Project. With the Plantation Project well underway, Plantation entered into the RSA<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>agreeing to act as surety by granting DIB a conditional assignment of its leasehold land for the Project (‘the Conditional Assignment’). Just under a year later, on 9 June 2008, DIB alleged that Plantation had committed four breaches of the RSA and required the breaches to be remedied within 15 days. Those breaches alleged by DIB, including allegations that Plantation had not complied with Law No. 8 of 2007 (a Dubai law which had recently come into force and which was designed to protect those who purchase ‘off-plan’), were set out in a letter served on Plantation by DIB’s Dubai lawyers, Al Tamimi &amp; Co. (‘Al Tamimi’), on 9 June 2008. That letter set out details of a number of alleged breaches of the RSA. Plantation’s position is that none of these alleged breaches had occurred at the time that the letter was sent on 9 June 2008. On the contrary, Plantation maintains that, in sending the letter, DIB was simply looking for ‘a way out’ and that this explains why unmeritorious breaches were asserted by DIB. In any event, the letter having been sent by DIB to Plantation and the alleged breaches having not been remedied in the time afforded to Plantation by DIB, with the result that, on 20 July 2008, DIB perfected the assignment of the Lease and thereby took control of the land to which the Lease related. Plantation contends in these proceedings that DIB had no right to take that action and that, as a result of DIB’s actions, Plantation has suffered substantial losses. It is Plantation’s case that in July 2008 the Lease was worth either US$2 billion or AED 2,934,491,309 (approximately US$800 million), depending on whether I decide that a particular deal would have been available in June 2008, and that, in the circumstances, DIB is liable to pay Plantation damages in one of these amounts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">DIB denies liability to Plantation. DIB’s case is that it was entitled to act as it did and when it did, and that accordingly it was not in breach of the RSA in doing what it did. Even if that is not the case, however, it is DIB’s position that there is, in any event, no basis upon which Plantation can claim to be entitled to substantial damages since Plantation’s case entirely ignores both the highly precarious nature of Plantation’s financial position, specifically a funding model which required it to achieve sales at an unachievable (and unachieved) rate (all the more so having regard to the wider economic realities in the second half of 2008). DIB contends that, in the circumstances, even had DIB not taken the action which it did, Plantation would, in any event, have failed and DIB would, as a result, have been entitled to take possession following an Event of Default. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These are the issues which must be resolved in these proceedings. It ought, however, to be acknowledged at the outset that the present proceedings are, in fact, the second set of proceedings to come before the Commercial Court concerned with the Project. The first involved Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley as defendants in a claim brought by DIB seeking payment of some US$432 million (after giving credit for recoveries) arising under the RSA. In broad terms, DIB’s case in those proceedings, which resulted in a judgment in DIB’s favour handed down by Flaux J (as he then was) on 6 December 2013 ([2013] EWHC 3781 (Comm)), was that Events of Default occurred under the RSA which led to the acceleration by DIB of repayment of sums due, with the result that Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius (and two other defendants), who were all guarantors under the RSA, were jointly and severally liable to DIB for the outstanding amount due under the RSA. Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius were by that stage in prison in Dubai, having been arrested in May 2008 and subsequently convicted by the criminal courts there of defrauding DIB and paying bribes to DIB’s employees. They remain in prison to this day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be necessary in a moment to deal with the factual background in some considerable detail. Before doing so, I should, first, however, say something about the factual witnesses from whom I heard. As will become apparent, Mr Cakebread (leading Ms Levy for Plantation) and Mr Anderson QC (leading Mr Edwards for DIB) each made criticisms of certain witnesses. These are criticisms which I shall need to address and it is convenient to do this before addressing the facts. In particular, Mr Anderson QC submitted that one of Plantation’s witnesses, Mr Nicholas Bacon, gave evidence which was misleading and dishonest. This is a submission which I shall need to consider in some depth, not only because of its seriousness as an allegation but because of the importance of the evidence given by Mr Bacon which, Mr Anderson QC suggested and I agree, went to a major issue in the case. It is convenient to address the criticisms made of Mr Bacon as a witness in relation to that particular issue when addressing that issue rather than in an introductory section such as this and so somewhat divorced from the context in which the criticisms come to be made. I can nonetheless deal at this stage with other criticisms which were made concerning Mr Bacon and propose to do that at the same time as setting out my impressions concerning the other witnesses. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In dealing with the factual witnesses, as opposed to the expert witnesses, it is right to acknowledge that, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out, given that the central events in the present case took place between 9 and 10 years ago, in 2007-2008, it is inevitable that witnesses’ recollection of relevant events will have been impacted by the time which has elapsed in the meantime. It is helpful in this respect to have in mind the observations which were made by Leggatt J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Gestmin SA v Credit Suisse (UK) Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 3560 (Comm) at [22]:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“… the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses’ recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts. This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the present case, these observations generally hold good. However, as will appear when I come on to address Mr Bacon’s evidence concerning a meeting which according to him took place in Hertfordshire in June 2008, there is at least one instance in this case where the issue is not merely an issue of recollection but is an issue of whether the witness is telling the truth. In short, either Mr Bacon did travel from Dubai to London and onwards to Hertfordshire to the meeting which he says was arranged for June 2008, or he did not: if he did not, the explanation for the evidence which he gave cannot simply be misrecollection. </p>

These were Ms Suzanne Sutherland, Mr Bacon, Mr Ian Kelly and Mr Fitzwilliam. Mr Anderson QC submitted that none of these witnesses gave evidence which particularly assisted Plantation, albeit for reasons which differed from witness to witness. Specifically, Mr Anderson QC suggested that not only was Mr Bacon a dishonest witness but that Mr Fitzwilliam was also not entirely straightforward with the Court when giving evidence, whilst submitting, further, that Ms Sutherland gave evidence which in important respects was mistaken and which needs, in any event, to be approached with considerable caution given her lack of relevant financial expertise and her clear closeness to Mr Fitzwilliam. As for Mr Kelly, it was Mr Anderson QC’s submission that his evidence, which he accepted was plainly truthful, provided little (if any) support to Plantation’s case. In my view and as I shall now explain, there is force in each of these various points. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I make it clear at the outset that, in considering the evidence which was given by Plantation’s witnesses, I have taken into account the observations made by Mr Cakebread concerning Plantation’s inability to access documents and computers which were still on the Plantation site when DIB took physical possession in early November 2008. I bear in mind specifically, therefore, that witnesses such as Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland were somewhat hampered in recalling matters without the assistance of all the relevant documents. As I shall explain, during the course of the trial, in fact after she had completed her evidence, various documents were disclosed which had been obtained from Ms Sutherland’s own personal (as opposed to Plantation) computer, but the fact remains that Plantation has not had access to material which it would otherwise have been able to consider when its factual evidence was prepared. In contrast, it does appear that, contrary to evidence given by DIB’s solicitor, Mr Hugh Lyons, who referred to DIB not knowing relevant passwords, DIB might very well have had access to Plantation’s computers and servers since one of DIB’s witnesses, Mr Ilahi, ultimately confirmed that password information was, in fact, sought and apparently obtained.  </p>

As I have already explained, Mr Fitzwilliam is the person who had the idea to develop the Project. Plantation was, in effect, his company. He set the company up and he stood to benefit very substantially from any success which the Project was going to achieve. Mr Fitzwilliam is plainly an intelligent man. This was apparent from the manner in which he conducted himself when giving his evidence. It was apparent also from my observations of him during the course of the trial generally. He is quick-witted and humorous. He has charisma. I can readily see that these characteristics, together with a charm which was also apparent when he gave evidence, equipped him very well in his business-related activities. He is an entrepreneur. It is clear, too, that Mr Fitzwilliam is somebody who commands loyalty, certainly from Ms Sutherland and I suspect from others who have worked for him over the years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Anderson QC submitted nonetheless that Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence should not be accepted without question. He did not suggest that Mr Fitzwilliam was dishonest in everything which he told the Court. He did, however, suggest that Mr Fitzwilliam must not have been telling the truth concerning the meeting which Mr Bacon was insistent had been arranged in Hertfordshire in June 2008, specifically that he (Mr Fitzwilliam) was travelling to that meeting when he was arrested at the airport in Dubai. I shall have to return to this topic. Other than in relation to this, the criticism which was made concerning Mr Fitzwilliam by Mr Anderson QC was that the evidence given by Mr Fitzwilliam should be viewed with some caution given that he bears an obvious grudge against Dubai in general and DIB in particular given that he had to endure a substantial period of time in a Dubai prison before his acquittal. Whilst I agree with Mr Anderson QC that Mr Fitzwilliam does indeed bear such a grudge, nonetheless I do not accept that this means that, as was suggested by Mr Anderson QC, Mr Fitzwilliam has lost the ability to consider matters rationally and, moreover, has sought to advance a case based on<span style="font-style:italic"> “wildly improbable conspiracy theory and assertion, lacking any basis in reality”</span>. Mr Fitzwilliam is not, in my assessment, some sort of wild conspiracy theorist. It may be that he is wrong to think that what happened to him was the result of involvement of the Dubai Government and DIB’s connections with the Dubai Government. This is a matter which I shall come on to address. The fact that Mr Fitzwilliam holds his view does not mean that he is to be criticised for doing so. Mr Anderson QC highlighted in this regard certain evidence given by Mr Fitzwilliam concerning the causes of the Dubai property crash in 2008, specifically this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“I’m strangely, and probably bizarrely, of the opinion that the problems that happened in Dubai had absolutely no reason to happen. Had the authorities not been arresting guys like me, and other guys like me and causing the investing public to worry about the deals they had made, there wouldn't have been a drying up of the liquidity. So there was absolutely no reason for Dubai to have the property crash that it did, if they had left us all alone.”</span>

	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Anderson QC suggested that this is a viewpoint which no rational person could hold. Even if that is right, however, it does not follow that Mr Fitzwilliam should be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist whose evidence should be discounted. Mr Fitzwilliam himself acknowledged, in giving the evidence which he did, that others might regard his view as strange or bizarre. The fact that he did so rather detracts from the submission that he lacks rationality. I repeat that Mr Fitzwilliam is entitled to his opinion. The more so, given what he went through after his arrest. Mr Fitzwilliam is a self-confident man. He is also an optimist. In the circumstances, I am in little doubt that he does indeed believe that, but for his incarceration, he could have made the Project a success notwithstanding the economic downturn. Although, therefore, I reject the suggestion that Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence should be treated as evidence which is given by somebody with a grudge who lacks rationality, I do nonetheless recognise that Mr Fitzwilliam’s self-confidence and optimism do need to be borne in mind when considering Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence in relation to the financial viability of the Project at any particular juncture and, in particular, the ability of Plantation to secure the monies required to make the Project a success. These characteristics, combined with Mr Fitzwilliam’s lack of experience in a development on the scale of the Plantation Project (still less in Dubai as opposed to his redevelopment of apartment blocks in London), are matters which mean that it would be unwise to accept at face value everything which Mr Fitzwilliam had to say on the progress of the Project and its ability to be a success. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Sutherland was employed by Plantation as its Chief Financial and Operations Officer. She was, however, not somebody who had had prior experience in running a project such as the Plantation Project, whether in so senior a role or at all. Nor did she have equivalent high level managerial experience in other businesses. Ms Sutherland, indeed, very fairly (and characteristically so since I am in no doubt that she was an honest witness) acknowledged this when giving her evidence. She accepted, in particular, that she had never previously managed a construction project and nor had she ever before compiled and maintained financial projections for a construction project or, for that matter, cost schedules, cash flows, and business plans. Rather, her background was initially as an account manager in Australia <span style="font-style:italic">“for an import scheme into usually third world countries”</span>, and then from about 1995 as an account manager in Dubai with <span style="font-style:italic">“an American company that was selling engines and boats in the marine industry”</span>. This was followed, some four years later, by Ms Sutherland working for Mr Fitzwilliam <span style="font-style:italic">“in a company that he had set up with partners from the UK, which was bringing in software for HR management”</span>. It was another four years after this, in 2003, that Ms Sutherland started working for Mr Fitzwilliam on the Plantation Project. This was the first time that she had worked in a senior financial position, whether in relation to a construction project of any size or at all. It was also the last time that Ms Sutherland was to work in such a role since, after leaving the Plantation Project, she moved initially to work for Mr Fitzwilliam at another of his businesses, Regent Investment Consultants, before subsequently, within the last couple of years, setting up her own business running a children’s nursery in Dubai.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, I agree with Mr Anderson QC when he submitted that Ms Sutherland was not qualified or sufficiently experienced to perform the role which she was asked to perform at Plantation. The role would have been very substantial and demanding for anybody with relevant experience. It was necessarily all the more demanding for a person in Ms Sutherland’s position who had never before carried out such a role. The fact that it entailed not only financial but also operational responsibilities would have made Ms Sutherland’s task especially taxing. Ms Sutherland was being asked, in effect, to learn ‘on the job’ and to do so in circumstances where that job was very large indeed. It is not a criticism of Ms Sutherland to make this observation since I am clear that she did the best that she could to make the Project a success. It is plain that she worked tirelessly to achieve such a result. I do consider, however, that there is substance in Mr Anderson QC’s suggestion that, in the circumstances, given Ms Sutherland’s lack of relevant experience, some of the evidence which she was able to give concerning the progress of the Project, and specifically its financial position at various stages, is properly to be viewed with some caution not because the evidence was given anything other than honestly but simply because Ms Sutherland’s lack of experience means that her evidence, in places, does not carry the same degree of weight as it would were it to have been given by a witness who has had a greater level of relevant experience.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is an additional aspect which should be mentioned in relation to Ms Sutherland. This is that, although I repeat that I do not doubt that Ms Sutherland gave evidence which was honest, it seems to me that there is nonetheless force in Mr Anderson QC’s submission that her closeness to the Plantation Project, a venture in which she invested a considerable amount of energy, and her longstanding (and continuing) association with Mr Fitzwilliam make it necessary not to take at face value everything which Ms Sutherland had to say when giving evidence. As Mr Anderson QC accurately submitted, Ms Sutherland clearly felt a certain sense of ownership in relation to the Project. That sense of ownership continues and explains, at least in part, why Ms Sutherland attended trial throughout the two months which it lasted. This was something which, she explained, she did at her own expense (and despite the fact that she has her own business in Dubai), albeit that she clarified that she was not having to pay for hotel accommodation because she was staying with Mr Fitzwilliam at his house in London. Ms Sutherland and Mr Fitzwilliam are clearly friends. Whilst this does not mean that Ms Sutherland is to be regarded as an unreliable witness, still less a dishonest one, it does nonetheless mean that Ms Sutherland is less independent than would otherwise be the case. That lack of independence is underlined by the fact that, as Ms Sutherland perfectly candidly acknowledged during cross-examination when asked by Mr Anderson QC, although there is no formal agreement that she will be compensated if Plantation succeeds in its claim against DIB, she believes that there will be what she described as <span style="font-style:italic">“a discussion” </span>about such compensation being paid to make up for the loss of the villa plot which she would have received had the Project been completed. This was a substantial 50,000 sq. ft. plot which, at least at one stage, might have been expected to have a value in the region of AED 20 million or US$5.4 million. </p>

I have mentioned already that Mr Anderson QC’s submission was that Mr Bacon was dishonest in the evidence which he gave. This submission was mainly based on the evidence given by Mr Bacon concerning the meeting which he said was arranged to take place in June 2008 in Hertfordshire. However, Mr Anderson QC pointed to other aspects of Mr Bacon’s evidence unconnected with that evidence which, in his submission, demonstrated dishonesty on the part of Mr Bacon. It is difficult to divorce consideration of these other aspects from the June 2008 meeting evidence in the sense that, if Mr Bacon did give evidence which was dishonest in relation to the latter, then it is all the more likely that he would be willing to give untruthful evidence on other matters. However, having considered matters carefully, I have reached the conclusion that, even taking no account of the evidence which Mr Bacon gave concerning the June 2008 meeting, Mr Bacon was not a satisfactory witness.</p>

These included the curiosity that, although Mr Bacon described himself in his witness statement, as having a first career as an army officer, when during cross-examination he was asked which regiment he was in, he refused to answer saying that he could only say if the Ministry of Defence gave its approval. It was then put to him that there is no record of him graduating from Sandhurst. He replied that this was because he was injured at the time of graduation and was <span style="font-style:italic">“back-squadded”</span>. There was also the oddity that in certain business literature he was described as having a degree from Oxford University when he did not go to that university. His explanation was that he had nothing to do with the particular document being put together. Again, this was evidence which caused me to have some doubt about Mr Bacon as a witness.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A particular matter highlighted by Mr Anderson QC concerns the evidence which he gave concerning a Mr Stephen Mallet, described in his witness statement as being the Chief Investment Officer of a company called Chescor Capital (‘Chescor’) which operated a mezzanine fund and whose Chairman and Executive Director was in 2008 a Dr Amin Badr-El-Din. It was with Dr Badr-El-Din that the meeting in Hertfordshire in June 2008 was, according to Mr Bacon, to take place. Indeed, Mr Bacon’s evidence was that the meeting took place on 9 June 2008 in the sense that he (Mr Bacon) attended on that day and met Dr Badr-El-Din and Chescor’s <span style="font-style:italic">“other principals”</span> but that Mr Fitzwilliam did not attend owing to his arrest in Dubai and so that the meeting was ineffective. This, I repeat, is a matter to which I shall return. What matters for present purposes is a narrower point, namely that Mr Bacon’s witness statement made no mention of the fact that, far from at the time Mr Mallet being Chescor’s Chief Investment Officer, Mr Bacon and Mr Mallet were, in fact, business partners who had been approached by Chescor to assist, not as employees (still less in Mr Mallet’s case as Chief Investment Officer) but as external consultants, in the development of its mezzanine fund. The fact that Mr Bacon and Mr Mallet were business partners was confirmed to me by Mr Bacon when I asked him during the course of cross-examination. This was confirmed two days later by an email from Chescor, specifically from one of its principals, Mr Alan Moore, which was produced by Plantation’s solicitors the following day. In that email, Mr Moore described Mr Mallet and Mr Bacon having both been engaged by Chescor to assist in the  development of the mezzanine finance fund <span style="font-style:italic">“sometime around 2008”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“for a relatively short period (I believe about three months)”</span>. The impression given by Mr Bacon was, therefore, distinctly misleading. Nor is it easy to see how this is an impression which can have been innocently given. Mr Bacon obviously knew that he was in a business relationship with Mr Mallet at the relevant time. It is difficult to explain why, in the circumstances, Mr Bacon should have made no mention of this in his witness statement. It is also hard to see why Mr Bacon should have chosen to describe somebody with whom he was in partnership as Chief Investment Officer of a company which had asked that partnership for assistance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If this had been an isolated incident, then, I may have been inclined to the view that Mr Bacon had in his witness statement not expressed himself as fully as he should have done. However, it was not an isolated incident. On the contrary, there were other aspects to Mr Bacon’s evidence which involved a lack of straightforwardness. One example concerns Mr Bacon’s explanation in his witness statement that in the first quarter of 2008 he moved from a company called Alcazar Capital Ltd (‘Alcazar’), an asset management and investment advisory firm based in Dubai where he held the position of Senior Executive Officer, to another Dubai-based company, a private equity firm called Novati Group International SPC (‘Novati’), the company whose literature described Mr Bacon as having graduated from Oxford University, where he held the same job title and was Managing Director of its <span style="font-style:italic">“Advisory and Proprietary arm”</span>. His evidence, again in his witness statement, was that he left Novati in December 2009. However, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out, there are no documents showing that Mr Bacon joined Novati in 2007. Instead, it appears that it was not until late 2008 that Mr Bacon (and Mr Mallet) entered into some kind of relationship with Novati. Furthermore, Mr Bacon acknowledged under cross-examination that Novati was never registered within Dubai as a financial services company but that it held a metals trading licence. This is another fact not mentioned in Mr Bacon’s witness statement. Nor did Mr Bacon explain in his witness statement what he told Mr Anderson QC when giving evidence concerning Novati transforming, as Mr Bacon put it, into a different company called Novaar <span style="font-style:italic">“with the same directors and staff”</span> and the same ownership (a Mr Williams and a Mr Mapplebeck). Nothing had previously been said about Novaar at all and, furthermore, the documents do not support Mr Bacon’s claim since Mr Anderson QC was able to put to Mr Bacon an article dated 10 February 2009 in which Novaar was described as being a <span style="font-style:italic">“family office”</span> of HRH Prince Saud bin Mansour al Saud and another document emanating from the Dubai International Financial Centre which listed its shareholders as being Prince Saud’s relatives, not Mr Mapplebeck and Mr Williams, albeit that the latter document identified Mr Williams as a director and another document produced in 2010 by Highworth Research Ltd and shown to Mr Bacon in re-examination by Mr Cakebread identified both Mr Williams and Mr Mapplebeck as directors and, in Mr Williams’ case, as Chief Investment Officer. It appears, indeed, from the 10 February 2009 article and from the Highworth Research Ltd document that, far from Novati becoming Novaar, Novati and another company, Harald Quandt Holding, had an advisory role in the setting up of Novaar.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This leads on to a related matter, which is that, although Mr Bacon was insistent when giving evidence that he had taken the Plantation Project with him when he moved to Novati from Alcazar, what appears actually to have been the case is that the Plantation Project did not go to Novati at all but was instead regarded by Mr Bacon as being his own personal piece of business. Having described how initially, in late 2007 and in the early part of 2008, he worked for Plantation <span style="font-style:italic">“on a very part time basis … on a private, consultancy basis”</span>, Mr Bacon went on to say this in his witness statement:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“When I moved to Novati, I took the Plantation project with me. My personal consultancy agreement with Arthur was terminated, and the Plantation project became one of the projects on Novati’s ‘Deal Flow Report’. Novati would have had a success fee agreement with Plantation, although I cannot now remember the exact terms.”</span>

	  </content>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This is clear evidence expressed in unqualified terms, save perhaps for the <span style="font-style:italic">“would have had”</span> wording of the last sentence. The truth, however, is that no ‘success fee agreement’ between Plantation and Novati has been unearthed. Moreover, contrary to what Mr Bacon stated in his witness statement, it is quite apparent that, even after he maintained that he had moved to Novati, Mr Bacon was treating the Plantation Project as being a private (and so non-Novati) matter. This is demonstrated by the fact that the consultancy agreement to which Mr Bacon himself referred in his witness statement, which he explained contained terms which <span style="font-style:italic">“would have been similar”</span> to those which appeared in the consultancy agreement which he stated he entered into when first working on the Project (in late 2007), is an agreement dated 27 September 2008 between, importantly, Mr Fitzwilliam and Plantation, described together as the <span style="font-style:italic">“Client”</span>, and Mr Bacon (described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“Consultant”</span>) in his personal capacity. Indeed, tellingly, after Mr Bacon is identified in this way, the agreement then explicitly states:</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“It is noted that Mr Bacon is a Managing Director of Novati Mid-East, SA of Emirates Towers, Sheikh Zayed Road, PO Box 31303, Dubai UAE and a Director of Gryphon Investment Bank of 52 Brook Street, London W1K 5DS, United Kingdom. One or both of these institutions may be involved with transactions with Mr Arthur Fitzwilliam and or Plantation Holdings, but they are not party to this agreement, and any fees due to those or any other entity connected to this transaction are wholly separate to this agreement.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the circumstances, it is quite impossible to see how Mr Bacon could be right to state in his witness statement that the consultancy agreement which operated after his move to Novati was between Novati and Plantation rather than as between Plantation and Mr Bacon. This agreement is sufficient by itself to make good the point that Mr Bacon cannot have been right in his witness statement to maintain that after his move to Novati, whenever this took place, the Plantation Project was no longer his personal business but became Novati’s business. However, there is other documentation which reinforces the conclusion that Mr Bacon was simply not right to state what he did in his witness statement. I have in mind in this respect the fact that on 18 May 2008, and so at a time when he claims to have moved to Novati, Mr Bacon sent Ms Sutherland an email enclosing a draft agreement in respect of something described in the covering email as the <span style="font-style:italic">“WhiteWater”</span> project. That draft agreement contained marked-up changes to a version which was apparently executed a month earlier on 13 April 2008. Importantly, it was an agreement between Plantation (not apparently Mr Fitzwilliam also) and Mr Bacon (with no mention of Novati). At the same time, Mr Bacon additionally enclosed an invoice on his own personal letterhead (and so again with no mention of Novati) dated 13 May 2008 and addressed to Mr Fitzwilliam at Plantation in respect of <span style="font-style:italic">“1 Months [sic] advisory fees in advance”</span> with payment details naming Mr Bacon (and not Novati) as the billing party. In addition, the same email also sent a draft agreement, again between Mr Bacon (with no mention of Novati) and Plantation, in respect of something known as the <span style="font-style:italic">“Holly Bolly Project”</span>. That Mr Bacon was operating on his own account in relation to these other projects and the Plantation Project is, in the circumstances, perfectly clear. I reject the suggestion that Novati was involved in any way. This applies whenever Mr Bacon joined Novati, whether in April 2008 or thereabouts, or later on in that year. I incline to the view that it was the latter rather than the former, hence the express reference to Novati in the 27 September 2008 consultancy agreement which does not appear in the earlier draft agreements. It seems to me also that this view is supported by the fact that on 25 May 2008 Mr Bacon sent Ms Sutherland an email entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“Invoice”</span> in which he stated that he <span style="font-style:italic">“would appreciate if my May 13</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> invoice could be settled before the end of the month (May)”</span> and continued:</p>

I regret to say that I did not find him to be a satisfactory witness. Although in some ways an engaging witness with an apparent wish to assist the Court, the instances which I have described lead me to conclude that, whilst I should not necessarily reject everything which he had to say in his evidence since that would involve too sweeping an approach, I should nonetheless only accept his evidence if satisfied that what he said was inherently likely to be right, or if there was support for his evidence from the documents or from other credible evidence. </p>

Mr Kelly explained that he and his wife, Susan, were purchasers of one of the villa plots in the Plantation Project. Having signed a contract with Plantation in July 2006 and having paid a deposit at the same time, he and his wife subsequently also made various agreed stage payments. Over eight years later, their villa having never been completed, none of these monies have been reimbursed. This is despite the fact that, he and his wife having brought proceedings against Plantation (and others, including Mr Fitzwilliam and DIB), they have obtained a judgment in the sum of AED5.2 million against Plantation. That judgment has not been satisfied for obvious reasons. However, as Mr Kelly very frankly accepted, were Plantation to succeed in the present claim against DIB, he <span style="font-style:italic">“would recover all my money, plus interest”</span>. Mr Kelly was a patently honest individual. He was intelligent and impressive.

He explained that he sat on a committee at DIB formed in the summer of 2007 in order to deal with the aftermath of the CCH fraud (to which I have previously referred and which I shall describe in more detail shortly) and to implement the RSA. This was a committee described at the time as the ‘Project Stallion Task Force’ but which in the middle of 2008 was reconstituted and renamed as simply the ‘Task Force’. As part of his involvement in this way, Mr Kamal gave evidence concerning DIB’s provision of a standby loan facility and its purchase of certain villa plots in an effort to solve Plantation’s cash flow difficulties. Mr Cakebread accepted in closing that Mr Kamal was a straightforward witness who for the most part strove in his evidence to assist the Court. He highlighted, in particular, how Mr Kamal agreed with him as to the application of Law No. 8 of 2007. These are all matters which I shall address in due course.</p>

This placed him one grade below the half a dozen or so Executive Vice Presidents who reported to the Chief Executive Officer. He was the Head of Real Estate Finance and Investments at DIB, meaning that he ran with the Real Estate Finance team and the Investments team. His focus in this position was on DIB’s lending on, and investment in, property in the UAE and the wider Gulf region. He reported to Mr Kamal and worked very closely with him, speaking to him on an almost daily basis. He had a team of around 35 people reporting to him. He explained that his first involvement with Plantation came in August 2007, albeit that he was already familiar with the Plantation Project because a year or two earlier Plantation had sought financing from DIB. His involvement in August 2007 came in the wake of DIB’s entry into the RSA the same month, although he explained that it was not for several months after this that he was told about the RSA. This was on 3 December 2007 when Mr Kamal sent him an email with certain extracts from the RSA. Mr Bitar gave detailed evidence concerning his involvement, including in relation to Law No. 8 of 2007 and the various steps taken during 2007 and 2008 regarding the Plantation Project. Mr Cakebread did not suggest that Mr Bitar was anything other than a straightforward witness, albeit that he considered that at times Mr Bitar <span style="font-style:italic">“tried to follow the party line”</span>.

Mr Cakebread suggested in closing that he was at times an evasive witness who <span style="font-style:italic">“appeared genuinely scared to provide a truthful answer”</span>. A particular aspect highlighted by Mr Cakebread in this regard was Mr Al Sharif’s concern at one point in his evidence to ensure that he corrected a suggestion made that the Dubai Government appointed the Chairman of DIB’s Board. Mr Cakebread suggested that this was indicative of DIB’s witnesses feeling under pressure from DIB or, indeed, the Dubai Government. For my part, I do not consider that such an observation is fair. Mr Al Sharif was a very careful witness. He certainly was not willing to give points away which he had any doubt about. He was cautious. This did make it sometimes difficult to follow what he had to say. He was sometimes inclined to argue with Mr Cakebread and his desire to be precise did occasionally suggest an evasiveness. Ultimately, however, I consider that he was straightforward enough. Indeed, Mr Cakebread himself observed that he was candid. I agree, although on no view could Mr Al Sharif be regarded as overly forthcoming.</p>

It was suggested, in particular, that Mr Ilahi adopted the role not of a security holder but of a receiver. Mr Ilahi, who is now retired, is a chartered accountant by training. He worked for DIB for 23 years between 1989 and 2012, specifically in the Finance Department until 2011. His involvement with the Plantation project started in earnest in early November 2008, although it does appear that in July 2008 he was copied into an email which indicated that DIB would be taking over the Plantation site. His role was to <span style="font-style:italic">“take on the day-to-day supervision of the Plantation Project”</span>, reporting to Mr Nidal Shomali, then DIB’s Head of Collection. I shall come on later to deal with particular aspects of Mr Ilahi’s evidence which were criticised by Mr Cakebread, but my assessment of Mr Ilahi is that he was an honest witness doing his best to assist the Court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have previously explained that the Plantation Project was on a grand scale. This was no ordinary development. Mr Fitzwilliam explained in his evidence that his original approach to the DDIA in relation to the proposal to create a polo club with a single polo field and, as he put it, a few villas surrounding it was a proposal which interested the DDIA but that the DDIA was only interested in the Project if it was to be world-class and would also encompass a general equestrian facility. It was for this reason that he decided to increase the scale and scope of the concept, whilst making it clear to the DDIA that the Project would not be commercially viable as solely a sporting location and so would need substantial capital investment on the part of the Dubai government or a significant inducement for a private developer to undertake it. It was this which resulted in the idea to create 110 private villa plots which could be sold at a premium together with other residential and commercial development. This, then, is the context in which the Lease came to be entered into with the <span style="font-style:italic">“Rent”</span> set at a very modest AED 1 per year, albeit that clause 4.1.3 (<span style="font-style:italic">“Utilities Payment and Connection”</span>) imposed upon Mr Fitzwilliam (the original lessee prior to the assignment to Plantation in December 2004) the responsibility <span style="font-style:italic">“for all connection charges to bring various utilities required onto the premises, and… for all consumption charges”</span>.

This represented an opportunity to obtain financing, Plantation not being conventionally financed with its business model entailing funding largely from the sales of villa plots. As Mr Fitzwilliam acknowledged during the course of his cross-examination, he needed capital investment from the<span style="font-style:italic"> “get-go”</span>. He was attracted to what Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley had to offer because he was, as he put it, <span style="font-style:italic">“only having to put up 30%”</span> (a reference to the shareholding split in the Joint Venture Agreement) and he had previously done business with Mr Cornelius. Mr Fitzwilliam explained that at this stage he considered that Villa plot sales were better than expected, but he acknowledged that Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius did not ultimately invest as much as had been intended. Be that as it may, the Profit Sharing Agreement provided for the incorporation of Plantation, the company, specifically for the purposes of the Project with the first recital making express reference to Mr Fitzwilliam having entered into the Lease with the DDIA and the second recital stating as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was Mr Fitzwilliam’s entry into the Joint Venture Agreement with Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley which was, ultimately, to result in the RSA being entered into in August 2007. More specifically, it was because of the fraud which was committed by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley against DIB and the fact that that fraud entailed DIB’s money being used (unbeknown to Mr Fitzwilliam) by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley to fund their financial obligations in relation to the Plantation Project. The fraud is not as such an issue in the present proceedings. In the circumstances, I rely upon what was decided by Flaux J in his judgment in 2013 as providing the necessary background to the dispute which I must determine. In what follows, therefore, I draw on that judgment, whilst emphasising again that, after serving three years in a Dubai prison, Mr Fitzwilliam was fully acquitted by the Dubai Criminal Court of the charges relating to his potential involvement in the fraud. He is, therefore, an innocent man. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning, then, to the CCH fraud which was described by Flaux J, from November 2002 onwards DIB’s Structured Finance Department entered into a series of agency agreements with CCH Europe GmbH and its associated company, CCH plc (referred to collectively as ‘CCH’) as the means by which short-term trade finance would be provided to exporters. Respecting the fact that it is not in accordance with Islamic principles for DIB to provide trade finance by way of short-term interest bearing loans, the model used was so-called murabaha agreements whereby DIB, with CCH acting as its agent, would buy the goods from the exporter, and then, again through CCH, sell the goods to the purchaser, making for DIB a profit represented by the difference between the purchase price and the sale price. These arrangements dated back to the 1980s when Mr Ridley and his then business partner, Mr Guvan Nil, did murabaha deals with DIB. They continued as before after Mr Nil died, with his son, Mr Eren Nil, another defendant to the proceedings which resulted in the 2013 judgment, replacing his father as Mr Ridley’s business partner. It was at this point that Mr Ridley and Mr Nil junior incorporated CCH, CCH becoming the corporate vehicle in Mr Ridley’s and Mr Nil’s dealings with DIB. Specifically, under the agency agreements, once CCH had put the contractual arrangements with sellers and purchasers in place, DIB was to remit the funds required into an account in the name of CCH. It was this that enabled the fraud to be perpetrated: Mr Ridley arranged with Mr Cornelius for one of the latter’s companies to generate fictitious requests for trade finance for non-existent supply contracts which were submitted to CCH’s office in Germany. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This started in about 2003 and was what led, in due course, to the fraud which was to lead, in turn, to the RSA. Specifically, Mr Cornelius owned and/or controlled a number of companies including PSI Energy Holding Company SA (‘PSI’), a Bahraini company with an involvement with a refinery project in Pakistan (the ‘Refinery Project’) which Mr Ridley offered to finance. That finance came from funding which was provided by DIB as a result of the fictitious trade finance transactions which I have described, Mr Ridley telling Mr Cornelius that false invoices needed to be generated to maintain funding and Mr Cornelius agreeing that one or other of his companies would issue false financing requests which were sent for processing to CCH in Germany and submitted to DIB for financing. Flaux J observed in his judgment at [17] that the <span style="font-style:italic">“range of goods ostensibly sold by PSI Middle East is staggering: jetting pumps, bunker fuel, packing machines, chiller plants together with vast quantities of aluminium sheet and steel beams”</span>. Flaux J took this as an indication that the documentation which was created by CCH and Mr Cornelius’s companies cannot have related to genuine transactions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Flaux J went on, at [20], to describe what became of the monies diverted pursuant to the fraud, explaining that when DIB discovered the fraud in the summer of 2007, it became plain that some US$342 million out of the US$501 million which had apparently been advanced for short-term receivables financing had not been applied in respect of such transactions but instead in unauthorised long-term projects. These included the Refinery Project which I have mentioned and which entailed the dismantling of an oil refinery in Canada and its reassembly in Pakistan: about US$180 million of the monies needed to finance the Refinery Project came from funds advanced by DIB under the impression that the funds were going to be used for receivables financing. As Mr Ridley was subsequently to explain and as pointed out by Flaux J at [21], the costs of the Refinery Project having escalated, CCH’s response was to attempt to trade out of its difficulties by investing more of DIB’s monies in other unauthorised but shorter term projects, including the Plantation Project into which approximately US$18 million of DIB’s money was (unbeknown to DIB) invested. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Flaux J dealt also with DIB’s discovery of the fraud. He explained, at [22], how it was discovered after DIB’s senior management decided to bring the Structured Finance Department under DIB’s direct management rather than under DIB’s subsidiary Millennium Capital Limited with effect from July 2007. It was in this context that Mr Naveed Ali took over responsibility at DIB for the CCH relationship and began to investigate the transactions. He almost immediately stopped any further drawings under the facility. The almost immediate result of which was a default on an invoice on the CCH account which should not have occurred if these were independent, genuine, transactions. He attended various meetings internally at DIB and with Mr Ridley but did not receive any satisfactory explanations. He then made a presentation to DIB’s Credit Committee on 22 July 2007 at which, Flaux J found (see [23]), he explained that he suspected that there had been a fraud. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The investigations which followed the RSA are helpfully described by Flaux J in his judgment at [35] to [48]. These are passages which were plainly based on the evidence given by Mr Lyons in the trial over which Flaux J presided. In his witness statement in the present proceedings Mr Lyons covered the same territory. As I have previously observed, in cross-examination Mr Lyons was not challenged in relation to these matters. Mr Lyons explained that, since the RSA had been negotiated and signed in a short period of time, DIB had not had an opportunity to test the accuracy or otherwise of Mr Ridley’s explanations as to how the funds advanced by DIB had been dispersed. He referred specifically to the fact that in clause 15.2 of the RSA Mr Ridley and Mr Nil represented and warranted that the receivables held by CCH which could be recovered were <span style="font-style:italic">“in the region of US$150 million”</span>, and that in clause 17.6 Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius were required to represent and warrant that <span style="font-style:italic">“in the region of US$340 million”</span> had been utilised to acquire <span style="font-style:italic">“Proceeds Assets”</span> (namely assets acquired with DIB’s funds). These provisions reflected what Mr Ridley had told Mr Lyons during the course of the RSA negotiations as to how DIB’s funds had been deployed. Mr Lyons referred also to the RSA provisions concerned with disclosure as contained in clause 17, the details of which I need not set out here but which required Mr Nil, Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley to provide various information within certain time periods of the Effective Date. Mr Lyons went on to explain that between early October 2007 and the spring of 2008 he and his assistant, Mr Dooley, spent a considerable amount of time seeking to understand where DIB’s funds had been utilised. </p>

In addition, various meetings took place with Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley in late November 2007, in Mr Ridley’s case more than one meeting, during which details of the way in which the fraud had been committed were revealed. Mr Lyons went on then to explain that on 8 January 2008 DIB’s then Managing Director, Khaled Al Kamdam, told him that he was required to meet with the FAD that afternoon. This he did, meeting amongst others, the FAD’s Director General, Mr Yasar Amiri. Mr Lyons’ evidence is that it was plain from the questions which he was being asked that the FAD was deeply suspicious of the RSA and <span style="font-style:italic">“did not seem to understand why the Bank would wish to reach a compromise, rather than simply reporting the fraud to the criminal authorities”</span>. Mr Lyons explained the commercial rationale which lay behind DIB’s entry into the RSA and that DIB hoped that it would be able to recover all or at least a very substantial proportion of the funds which it had lost. However, the FAD apparently still considered that DIB had been wrong to reach the compromise which it had done. </p>

One of the key purposes of the first of these meetings, with Mr Ridley, was apparently to explore with Mr Ridley the substantial <span style="font-style:italic">“hole”</span> that had been identified in relation to the disclosure provided by him. It was during the course of this meeting with Mr Ridley on 15 January 2008 that Mr Ridley explained that certain of the funds misappropriated from DIB had been used to pay bribes or corrupt payments to certain of DIB’s staff. Mr Ridley, however, refused to tell Mr Lyons or Mr Dooley which of DIB’s employees had received such bribes or how much of the misappropriated funds had been spent on such bribes. Mr Ridley stated that he was not willing to behave like a <span style="font-style:italic">“sneak”</span> and could not be persuaded to provide any further details. A few weeks later, Mr Lyons explained, Mr Dooley made contact with him from SJ Berwin’s offices, where he was reviewing various documents disclosed by Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius, to say that he had identified a bank statement of one of Mr Ridley’s companies, Watamu Trading, in respect of which the words <span style="font-style:italic">“Omair Marooj Habib Bank”</span> had been written against a particular payment. Mr Marooj had previously been a senior DIB employee with oversight of DIB’s relationship with CCH, and this appeared therefore to be documentary evidence of a bribe having been paid by Mr Ridley to Mr Marooj.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lyons went on to explain that at around the same time he learned from DIB that the FAD was keen to know what, if any, corrupt payments had been made to employees of DIB. Mr Lyons discussed the matter with Mr Ridley’s solicitor, Mr Tim Taylor QC at SJ Berwin, suggesting that Mr Ridley should ‘come clean’ but Mr Taylor was reluctant to allow his client to reveal to the FAD that they had been paying bribes to DIB employees. I can pick up the narrative from here by referring to Flaux J’s judgment at [46] and [47], Flaux J (unlike me) having heard evidence from Mr Nil:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr Lyons discussed this with the Bank’s then head of the legal department, Mr Al Shamsi, who said that whilst the FAD might be prepared to give assurances, it was highly unlikely they would be in writing. It was arranged for Mr Taylor to meet FAD on 8 February 2008. Prior to the meeting, the FAD made clear that they wanted access to the second and third defendants' documents immediately after the meeting. As Mr Taylor recorded in an email to Mr Lyons after the meeting and confirmed in his oral evidence, the FAD were suspicious of the RSA, which one of them described as a money laundering document. Mr Taylor could not get even a verbal assurance about immunity and there were unsubtle hints about dire consequences if his clients did not provide information to the FAD. He feared they were pursuing an ill-conceived witch hunt against the then chairman of the Bank, Mr Kharbash, who had had a close relationship with Mr Nil senior and about whom there were rumours in Dubai that he was about to be dismissed. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">In the light of the fact that Mr Taylor did not receive any assurances from the FAD, [Mr Ridley] continued to refuse to provide any disclosure concerning bribes paid to the Bank’s employees. However, as Mr Lyons explains in his witness statement, he and Mr Taylor were conscious that the demand for information by the FAD, if not met, could lead to the arrest of the second and third defendants. Accordingly, during the spring of 2008, there were discussions between them and Howes Percival about a basis upon which [Mr Nil] could provide the necessary disclosure, in return for the Bank releasing CCH International Plc from its guarantee under the RSA. This came to nothing, although I have no doubt [Mr Nil] was well aware that bribes had been paid and to whom, despite his unimpressive denial of this in his oral evidence.”</span>

At that stage I shall deal with the suggestion which Plantation makes that the arrest of Mr Fitzwilliam was brought about at DIB’s instigation. The arrests took place some months later and so it is more appropriate to address them later, after first describing what Mr Lyons called in his witness statement the <span style="font-style:italic">“souring of relations”</span>, a term adopted by Flaux J in his judgment at [49] to [60]. In those passages, specifically at [49] to [52], Flaux J rejected the suggestion that there was a change of attitude towards the RSA and the desire to extricate DIB from it owing to a change in the senior management at DIB in the first half of 2008. This is an issue which I shall address later when dealing with the arrests rather than at this juncture. For now, I merely note that, in rejecting the suggestion to which I have referred, Flaux J accepted Mr Lyons’ evidence, on which he was not challenged before Flaux J nor before me, that the souring of relations which came about in the first half of 2008 was the result of DIB’s increasing concern that there was likely to be a repayment default under the RSA when the next repayment date was reached in early autumn 2008. As Mr Lyons put it in paragraph 17.1 of his witness statement (echoing essentially paragraph 174 of the witness statement which was before Flaux J):</p>

It became apparent that the Turkish receivables were highly unlikely to be recoverable because most of the debtors were distressed. It was agreed that the performance of the RSA might still be possible with a concerted effort by [Mr Cornelius, Mr Ridley and Mr Nil], but that there was now very little room for error. At that meeting, [Mr Ridley] also gave assurances that further receivables could be collected from Bills Express in Australia. However, in a conference call on 29 April 2008, he disclosed that US$14 million of receivables could not be collected from Bills Express after all, despite the previous assurance.

It is, I agree with Mr Anderson QC, hardly surprising that the FAD would be interested in investigating what was a very large fraud. Nor, I also agree with Mr Anderson QC, in view of the relationship between Mr Fitzwilliam, Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley, combined with the fact that DIB’s monies had found their way into the Plantation Project, is it surprising that the FAD would wish to look into the Plantation Project. The fact that Mr Fitzwilliam was willing to enter into the RSA, and so take on the substantial obligations which he did, was also, no doubt, something which the FAD considered worthy of inquiry. Although Mr Fitzwilliam was ultimately acquitted of wrongdoing, the FAD might legitimately have suspected that he was aware of what Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley had done with DIB’s funds. </p>

Accordingly, we formed a team with the Financial Audit Department to conduct further inquiry in order to reach to the means by which the fraud operation took place and those involved therein.” </span>

I suspect, however, that the real investigations must have started in the autumn of 2007 since it is perhaps not insignificant that the FAD only made contact with DIB in early January 2008 and, furthermore, that the FAD was pressing for information in 2008 rather than before. I repeat, however, that I do not consider it right to suggest that the FAD only started looking into matters as late as April or May 2008. What is, in any event, clear is that by the time that the case was transferred by the Police and the FAD to the Public Prosecutor in May 2008, no disclosure having been made by Mr Cornelius, Mr Ridley and Mr Nil of the bribes which had been paid, including importantly who had received those bribes, what Mr Lyons and Mr Taylor QC had thought might happen as a result did happen: Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley were arrested (as was, indeed, Mr Fitzwilliam subsequently also).

This is a matter which is particularly relevant as at June/July 2008 because that is when DIB sent Plantation its letter dated 9 June 2008 and subsequently, a month later, perfected the assignment by invoking clause 18.2 of the RSA and clause 2 of the Conditional Assignment. It is necessary, however, to set the financial position in that time period into context. This requires a consideration of the Project’s financial position both before and after the RSA was entered into in August 2007. Although it was in exploring these matters that Mr Anderson QC made criticisms in relation to Ms Sutherland’s financial management abilities and concerning her lack of relevant experience, criticisms which were in substantial part justified as it seems to me, nonetheless I do not find it necessary to go through every occasion when it was put to Ms Sutherland by Mr Anderson QC that she was somehow lacking. This is because what really matters for present purposes is what, in fact, the Project’s financial position was at particular stages, including most importantly as at June/July 2008, rather than whether Ms Sutherland was suitably qualified to do the job which she was doing or for that matter whether Mr Fitzwilliam was too detached from the day-to-day running of the Project (something alleged by DIB but disputed by both Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland) or was overly optimistic and unrealistic as to the Project’s financial position. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point, and probably also as matters turned out the end point, when addressing the finances of the Project is to appreciate that Mr Fitzwilliam’s idea had always been that the Project would be financed through the sales of villa plots or at least very largely so. Ms Sutherland made this very point in her witness statement albeit suggesting that it was<span style="font-style:italic"> “not necessarily”</span> the case that all of the Project’s funding was intended to come from villa plots sales. That she must be right about that is underlined by the fact that in June 2006 there was an attempt made to obtain a <span style="font-style:italic">“Construction Loan”</span> in the sum of AED 100 million. To this end, Jasper Capital on behalf of Plantation put together a proposal document which is instructive. This was at a stage when, as Ms Sutherland explained in her witness statement, the first of the polo pitches had been planted and was in use or was shortly to start being used. In addition, as stated in the proposal itself, there had been pre-sales of certain office plots and one villa plot (to a Mr Ezzat Jaffar).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The intention to finance the Project (at least after the initial Phase I work which was ultimately largely completed by June 2008) through sales of villa plots was, therefore, made very plain indeed. The fact that Plantation was also seeking some external funding is also made clear by the very fact that Jasper Capital was involved at all. In the event, however, Plantation did not obtain the Construction Loan which Jasper Capital had sought on its behalf. Accordingly, as it turned out, the only finance which was provided came in the form of the US$18 million or so which Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius invested in the Project, and so money obtained from DIB without DIB knowing that such money was going to be used for the purposes of the Project. Mr Anderson QC highlighted this during the course of closing when drawing attention to the fact that, in cross-examination, Mr Fitzwilliam explained that he believed that the money being advanced by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley <span style="font-style:italic">“was coming out of their own back pocket”</span>. Mr Anderson QC suggested that this was symptomatic of an amateurish approach to the running of the Project which would have been more suitable for a smaller project such as the conversion of an apartment block in London, one of Mr Fitzwilliam’s previous developments, rather than in relation to a development as large as the Plantation Project. In fairness to Mr Fitzwilliam, the answer highlighted by Mr Anderson QC involved Mr Fitzwilliam making the point that he was unaware that the money advanced by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley was DIB’s money as opposed to their own money. In the circumstances, it seems to me to be a little harsh to suggest, on the basis of this one answer, that Mr Fitzwilliam was too amateurish in his approach. Mr Fitzwilliam was entitled to treat the money invested by Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius like any other money obtained by any other investor. The more significant point is that, besides the US$18 million which had been put into the Project by Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius, no other external funding had been obtained other than the very limited amount of money which came into the Project from villa plot sales which had been achieved in the period leading up to the RSA in August 2007. </p>

This was not, however, because such funding was not sought since just before the RSA was entered into it is apparent that Plantation again was seeking a Construction Loan. This was done using a proposal document based on the earlier proposal which had been put together the previous year by Jasper Capital. At least on the face of it, Mr Cornelius was still involved at this stage because he was again mentioned as promoting the Project together with Mr Fitzwilliam. In all probability, however, the reference to Mr Cornelius was simply a hangover from the earlier proposal. In the Executive Summary, it was stated that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Ms Sutherland acknowledged, at least as I understood it, that the amount of work carried out between the dates of the two proposals was not as much as had been hoped for. She accepted also, in effect if not in express terms, that when the August 2007 proposal referred to certain work being imminently completed, it was not entirely reliable. That, for example, the roads and infrastructure of Phase 1 were not completed by the end of August 2007, just a few weeks after the proposal was put together, is plain. In short, this and other work was still being carried out, and money was needed. Without the funds which Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley supplied and without other third party funding, money was necessarily short since villa plot sales were not by this stage sufficient to generate the finance which was needed. In such circumstances, it is not remotely surprising that the US$50 million standby loan facility available in the RSA was attractive to Mr Fitzwilliam (and so to Plantation) since it provided Plantation with a facility which it very much needed without having been able to secure a Construction Loan, without the funding which had to date been available from Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley, and with insufficient funds coming in from villa plot sales. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Fitzwilliam explained in his witness statement the commercial considerations which, as far as he was concerned, lay behind Plantation’s decision to enter into the RSA. He stated, in particular, that, whilst he was reluctantly prepared for Plantation to provide DIB with security so as to give Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley <span style="font-style:italic">“the time to unwind the investments they had made with the Bank’s funds”</span>, he was <span style="font-style:italic">“not prepared to pay their debts for them”</span>. As he understood the idea behind the RSA, it was that <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation could only be foreclosed upon by the Bank if, after they had collected from all the other sources that Cornelius and Ridley had, there was still a shortfall”</span>. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“We essentially had nothing to do with the repayment to the Bank so had no say as to whether it would be over two, three, or five years, nor about how much was to be repaid each year, nor about what penalties the Bank would extract from Cornelius and Ridley. That was between the Bank and the perpetrators. Plantation’s only interest in regard to the repayment terms was that the repayment schedule was not unrealistic as that could threaten Plantation.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">He added that the <span style="font-style:italic">“hoped for US$50m funding from the Bank would assist Plantation relatively cheaply with its cash flow”</span>. As he went on to point out, at that stage, August 2007, Plantation’s income was <span style="font-style:italic">“from two sources”</span>: sales of villa plots, and what Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley had provided, namely the US$18 million. The former had not by this stage generated sufficient funds to finance the development. The latter, on any view, was a source of funding which would not continue, hence the <span style="font-style:italic">“commercial attraction of funding from the Bank”</span>. Mr Fitzwilliam was here acknowledging the obvious: that Plantation needed the funding which was on offer from DIB. By this stage, earth levelling and other engineering works were being carried out in order to prepare for the next phase of the project when villa plot owners would set about building their villas. As I have explained, this work, the Phase I work, obviously required a substantial financial outlay. There was no other funding on offer from any other bank or other third party. As Mr Fitzwilliam explained during the course of cross-examination, when what Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius had done came to light, Plantation <span style="font-style:italic">“had been merrily working, right, going forward, developing itself”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“now we had bills to pay”</span> meaning that <span style="font-style:italic">“I needed the money from the bank to cover those bills if I was to continue at the rate that I had been going”</span>. He added that, had he <span style="font-style:italic">“known that no money was coming, I would have shut down the tap for a month, two months, until the revenues that we had coming in from sales already would have come in and replenished the coffers, as it were, allow me to pay the money I had overspent, and then we would have to wait for a bit more money to come in until we could start spending again”</span>. Also, although only a standby loan facility subject to limitations in respect of any drawdown (a matter to which I shall return but which was somewhat skated over by Mr Fitzwilliam in the passages from his witness statement to which I have referred), I agree with Mr Anderson QC that the fact that the facility would be coming from a large and well-respected institution must have lent credibility to any efforts which might thereafter have been made by Mr Fitzwilliam and Plantation to obtain finance from elsewhere. It will be recalled in this context that, under clause 9 of the RSA, it was contemplated that it would be open to Plantation to obtain further third party funding, with DIB coming under an obligation to act <span style="font-style:italic">“as would a commercially reasonable financier” </span>in relation to the granting of security by Plantation to such a lender. In the event, no such third party funding was obtained, but what matters is that it was open to Plantation to seek and obtain such funding if it wished to do so.</p>

At this stage, subject only to the question of whether a deal had been, or was about to be, reached with Chescor, the position remained that the funding available to Plantation consisted only of whatever could be achieved through villa plot sales and the US$50 million standby loan facility agreed in the RSA. There was no other third party funding, despite the fact that a further proposal for a Construction Loan, although undated, was apparently put together in March 2008. This document, which took the form of a PowerPoint presentation, was again based on the original Jasper Capital proposal prepared in 2006 as updated by the August 2007 proposal. Like the latter and in contrast to the former, this later proposal contemplated that the Project would take six years, rather than the three years to which the original Jasper Capital proposal was directed. This is despite the fact that the Executive Summary continued to state this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It was pointed out to Ms Sutherland by Mr Anderson QC that in relation to roads and infrastructure, in particular, whereas the August 2007 proposal had stated that these were 50% complete and it was expected that they would be finished by 30 August 2007, in fact, some seven months later, in March 2008, the works had still to be completed. Ms Sutherland acknowledged that there <span style="font-style:italic">“was possibly a delay”</span> in starting those works but, as far as she could remember, once they started they <span style="font-style:italic">“went to schedule”</span>. The March 2008 presentation, like the two earlier proposals, is, therefore, instructive because it illustrates the delays which occurred with the Project. More directly relevant for present purposes, however, is the fact that the proposals are instructive for another reason also: they show that Plantation wanted to obtain loan finance but could not do so. Ms Sutherland confirmed that this was, indeed, the position. The position, quite simply, is that there was no such funding available as at March 2008, and that remained the position in June/July 2008. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to the standby loan facility, I have already observed that in his witness statement Mr Fitzwilliam appeared to refer to the US$50 million as though it was the equivalent of a simple loan from DIB. That was not, however, the case. The most that can, in truth, be said is that, after entering into the RSA, Plantation had available to it, by virtue of clause 11 of the RSA, the prospect of being able to draw on the facility, not that Plantation had any entitlement to do so. Clause 11 was clear about two things: first that DIB’s obligation to provide the facility was subject <span style="font-style:italic">“to such consideration, based on due diligence in respect of the Plantation Project, as a commercially reasonable lender would be expected to have….”</span> (clause 11.1); and secondly that the amount which could be drawn down under the facility was dependant on a formula set out in clauses 11.2(a) and (b). The latter condition meant that it was not necessarily the case that the full US$50 million would be available to be drawn down. On the contrary, the US$50 million was the maximum which <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> prove to be available; whether it <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> ultimately be available would depend on the calculations called for by clauses 11.2(a) and (b). In the event, after exchanges between Plantation and DIB spanning several months during which Ms Sutherland provided DIB with various financial information, and after preparation within DIB of a credit facilities proposal (something in relation to which Mr Bitar took the lead) which was approved by the Project Stallion Task Force and the Credit Committee on 24 January 2008, the agreement which the parties reached, Mr Fitzwilliam having originally objected to the pricing so that DIB reduced the cost of the facility initially from 12% to 10% and then ultimately to 8%, was contained in a letter from DIB dated 13 April 2008 and signed by Mr Fitzwilliam on 7 May 2008. That letter described the amount of financing (the <span style="font-style:italic">“Modaraba”</span>) as being AED 169,000,000 which equates to US$45.63 million. The reason why this was less than the US$50 million contemplated in the RSA is that DIB had by this stage itself purchased three villa plots. The first two were plot nos. 86 and 103 initially in late 2007 for a total of AED 37,266,250 or approximately US$10 million. Out of this about US$4 million went into the Plantation Project because, as Mr Bitar explained in his witness statement, the Project<span style="font-style:italic"> “was desperately short of cash”</span>, and the money was needed to give Plantation the liquidity which, in his assessment, was <span style="font-style:italic">“desperately needed”</span>. Subsequently, in early 2008, plot no. 87 was also purchased by DIB,  Mr Bitar explained, because of <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation’s urgent need for cash”</span> and so <span style="font-style:italic">“in order to provide Plantation with much-needed working capital”</span> by providing Plantation with a further AED 12 million which Mr Fitzwilliam undertook to credit to Plantation’s current account with DIB.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Anderson QC pointed out in closing, since only about US$60 million had been repaid under the RSA by June/July 2008 (more accurately, US$60.4 million which had been received in the first few months after the RSA was entered into), the maximum amount which was going to be available to Plantation was US$11.67 million, one third of the difference between US$25 million and US$60 million (or, more accurately, US$11.8 million, based on the US$60.4 million figure). Rather than being entitled to US$50 million, therefore, the total available to Plantation was somewhat more modest. However, this was not the only difficulty as far as Plantation was concerned because the letter dated 13 April 2008 went on to set out certain conditions precedent, including that Plantation should provide DIB with the <span style="font-style:italic">“Approved Master Plan”</span>, a reference to the plan of the Project which had to be approved by various parties, including Dubailand. Although Mr Cakebread sought to suggest that there either had been approval or that, in effect, approval was a mere formality, the simple position is that there was no Master Plan which had been fully approved and, in consequence, this condition precedent was never fulfilled. In addition, although admittedly not described as a condition precedent or for that matter as a condition subsequent, there was also an obligation to provide personal guarantees for AED 169,000,000 from both Mr Fitzwilliam and Mr Cornelius, together with a further obligation to provide post-dated checks in favour of DIB for the same amount. Again, these things were not supplied to DIB. Had Plantation, therefore, sought to drawdown, DIB would have been entitled to refuse to pay anything. In the event, on 15 June 2008, DIB wrote to Plantation in relation to the letter dated 13 April 2008 stating as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Anderson QC suggested in closing that this was the consequence of the failure to provide DIB with an approved Master Plan and also perhaps the failure to furnish personal guarantees and post-dated cheques. That is not the case, as the passage quoted above demonstrates. What matters for present purposes, however, is what would have happened had Plantation sought to drawdown. The answer seems pretty clear: Plantation would not have been entitled to receive any monies, whether as much as US$50 million or at all. I agree with Mr Anderson QC that, in the circumstances, it is not appropriate to view Plantation as having any entitlement to draw on the standby loan facility and so to regard it as having any relevance as a source of credit open to Plantation as at June/July 2008. In truth, leaving aside for the moment the Chescor issue, the position at that time was straightforward: Plantation’s only available source of funding was revenue from villa plot sales. The position in relation to these was, however, on analysis, not especially encouraging. Specifically, as I shall now explain, the monies which could be expected to be achieved from villa plot sales were wholly insufficient to meet Plantation’s liabilities as at June/July 2008.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to villa plot sales, Mr Fitzwilliam explained in his witness statement that at <span style="font-style:italic">“the beginning of 2008 the income from villa plot sales was about US$2m per month”</span>, but that he expected that this was <span style="font-style:italic">“set to increase dramatically from additional villa plot sales at… much higher prices”</span> as a result of an<span style="font-style:italic"> “unexpected rise in land prices in Dubai”</span> which saw Plantation receiving interest at <span style="font-style:italic">“around the AED 700/800 per sq ft level”</span> as opposed to the somewhat more modest AED 70 per sq ft which he had originally expected to secure. He was plainly very optimistic at this stage that sales would be achieved. As Mr Anderson QC reminded me in closing, Mr Fitzwilliam explained in the course of his evidence that:</p>

The truth, however, is that Mr Fitzwilliam, again perhaps characteristically, appears to have operated on the basis of his instinct as a businessman rather than on the basis of hard data. It is in this respect that Mr Anderson QC’s criticisms in relation to the various cost projections which were prepared by Plantation have some resonance. I agree with Mr Anderson QC that, whilst there is no reason to suppose that the building costs projections which were prepared by Plantation’s in-house quantity surveying department were anything other than appropriate, the financial projections which dealt with the financing of such building costs and which were prepared by Ms Sutherland and Plantation’s project management team, lacked the sophistication which might have been expected in relation to a project the size of the Plantation Project. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In particular, based as they were on anticipated villa plot sales, the projections took no account of the possibility that such sales would not be achieved. An example to which Ms Sutherland was taken by Mr Anderson QC during the course of cross-examination is a schedule which was prepared in July/August 2007 and so immediately prior to the RSA. This document provides projected figures over a six-year period, Ms Sutherland confirming that the first of those years was intended in the document to be 2006 meaning that the final year was 2011. The first page sets out the <span style="font-style:italic">“Development Costs”</span> and as such is based on figures provided by Plantation’s quantity surveyors. The second page, entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“Consolidated Cashflow Statement”</span>, then sets out the projected revenue figures as well as sales, marketing and maintenance costs. The important point to note, for present purposes, is that by far the largest entry for revenue is <span style="font-style:italic">“Villa Sales”</span> with the bulk of the revenue from this source coming in years two and three, namely AED 1,275,353,000 and AED 1,289,750,000 respectively. Other revenue entries include modest amounts for <span style="font-style:italic">“Equestrian Activities”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“Equestrian Events”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“Apartments Rents”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“Maintenance Fees” </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">“Boutique Offices Rent”</span> together with something described as a <span style="font-style:italic">“Project Management Fee on Villa Construction”</span>. As to the villa plot sales, it was apparent from the answers given to Mr Anderson QC during the course of Ms Sutherland’s cross-examination that Plantation’s view that sales would be achieved at the rate contemplated in this document was not a view which was based on any market research carried out by Plantation but, as Ms Sutherland put it, was <span style="font-style:italic">“based on being in the market at the time”</span>. Furthermore, as previously noted, although in the previous year (2006) when Jasper Capital were seeking to obtain the AED 100 million Construction Loan it was apparently contemplated that the villas would all have been sold within a three-year period, in the consolidated cash flow statement the figures were based on a 6-year period (as was the case with the Jasper Capital proposal which immediately preceded the parties’ entry into the RSA in August 2007). In my view, this serves to underline the fact that no particular efforts were made on Plantation’s behalf to arrive at a reliable assessment as to the rate of sales which would be achieved. </p>

For example, and focusing on the position in 2008, Ms Sutherland was taken by Mr Anderson QC to the attachment to an email dated 10 May 2008 which she sent to DIB, described by her as <span style="font-style:italic">“the Sales and Revenue file”</span> which she had altered after much to-ing and fro-ing with DIB. That document set out at the top of the page details of the villa plots which had to date been sold and then went on lower down the page to set out details of the projected villa plot sales from March 2008 onwards, apparently ending in the third quarter of 2010. Accordingly, throughout, both in 2007 and 2008 and no doubt before this, Plantation’s financial projections hinged on its ability to achieve villa plot sales at the anticipated rate. If such sales could not be achieved as, and at the rate, contemplated, then, the projected revenues would not be secured. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, there being no dispute that the Project suffered substantial delays which inevitably had a monetary impact, for example delay on the part of Dubailand in relation to the availability of infrastructure, there was an unavoidable effect on progress and so on Plantation’s ability to make villa plot sales. I shall come back to this topic. However, this was not the only aspect concerning Dubailand which is relevant since it is also to be borne in mind that Plantation was a party to an agreement, the Profit Share Agreement, which needed to be factored into any financial projections. It will be recalled that under clause 5 of that agreement Plantation was required to pay Dubailand 15% of <span style="font-style:italic">“the selling price”</span> of any villa plot sales. It is apparent that there was a dispute between Dubailand and Plantation as to the time at which payment was due since there was correspondence in the period from September 2006 to January 2007 concerning this issue. Ms Sutherland was taken to this correspondence during the course of cross-examination, including a letter from Dubailand to Mr Fitzwilliam at Plantation dated 1 February 2007 in which Dubailand stated that they were <span style="font-style:italic">“eager to close”</span> the matter <span style="font-style:italic">“at the earliest before we move on with 2007”</span>. It was Ms Sutherland’s understanding that further correspondence ensued, although that does not appear to have been the case since no other exchanges are in existence. Be that as it may, it would appear as though Dubailand ceased, as Mr Anderson QC put it in closing, to press the point. What matters, for present purposes, however, is that at some point, whether sooner (as Dubailand considered was agreed in clause 5) or later (as Plantation considered had been agreed), Plantation would have to pay Dubailand 15% of the villa plots’ sales prices, yet in none of the financing projections produced by Ms Sutherland and Plantation was anything included in relation to this 15%. Ms Sutherland accepted that this was the position, explaining nonetheless that <span style="font-style:italic">“it wasn’t not talked about or understood, that it was going to be there … it was a flat figure that would be going on at the end of all the production”</span>. She acknowledged that<span style="font-style:italic"> “absolutely correctly, probably in the costs that should have been reflected”</span>. Her point was that DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“never wanted it on there”</span>. I agree with Mr Anderson QC, however, that, in order for Plantation’s projections to show an accurate picture, they needed to include an accrual in respect of this liability. The fact that they did not do so inevitably undermines their reliability, certainly when gauging the ultimate financial condition of the Project. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Importantly also, actual (as opposed to projected) villa plot sales were not quite what they might have appeared. These were the subject of a careful analysis in the written closing submissions which were produced by Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards. That analysis was based on the spreadsheet which Ms Sutherland attached to her email dated 10 May 2008, <span style="font-style:italic">“the Sales and Revenue file”</span> to which I have previously referred. At the top of that spreadsheet, which is plainly highly relevant since it was prepared only a month or so before the 9 June 2008 letter came to be sent, details were set out concerning the sales which had been made to date. Plot numbers were given, together with the identity of the individual purchasers, the dates when the relevant contracts of sale were signed, the size of the plot, the price and the payments which had been received. Included were the plots which Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland had themselves purchased: plot nos. 107 and 26 respectively. Also included were the two of the three plots which DIB had purchased: plot nos. 103 and 86. I assume that the reason why the third plot (no. 87) was not included is that this sale was taking place at about this very time. This does not matter for present purposes since, like the sales involving Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland, the sales to DIB can hardly be viewed as villa plot sales which are relevant when trying to ascertain the revenue which Plantation was deriving from this source of funding. The same applies, albeit for a different reason, in relation to three other plots which were listed in the spreadsheet, namely plot nos. 97, 98 and 108, in relation to which the purchaser was identified as a Mr Simon Welsh. The purchase price in the case of these plots added up to something in the region of AED 60 million: specifically AED 16,636,744 in respect of plot no. 97, AED 17,620,476 in respect of plot no. 98 and AED 25,142,620 in respect of plot no. 108. However, nothing had been paid by Mr Welsh as at March 2008 since, as Ms Sutherland explained in cross-examination, those <span style="font-style:italic">“sales fell through completely”</span> since Mr Welsh had decided, after <span style="font-style:italic">“negotiations backwards and forwards”</span>, not to continue based on <span style="font-style:italic">“legal advice”</span>. It follows that these sales should not be taken into account when considering the position as at June/July 2008. As Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards explained, removing from Ms Sutherland’s spreadsheet the sales involving Mr Fitzwilliam, Ms Sutherland, Mr Welsh and DIB results in a table as follows:</p>

Furthermore, again as pointed out by Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards, there is some doubt whether in the case of Ms Andrea Lee Williams she should be regarded as a purchaser at all in circumstances where the agreement which she signed on 31 July 2007 was merely an option agreement and there is nothing to indicate that she exercised the option before it lapsed on 1 March 2008. That said, it does appear (at least based on what was shown in Ms Sutherland’s spreadsheet) that she paid not only an initial AED 3,000,000 in August 2007 but that she went on to pay a further AED 1,359,420 in March 2008. This rather suggests that Ms Williams did, indeed, exercise her option. In contrast, the purchaser of plot no. 104, a Mr Dasmal as listed in Ms Sutherland’s spreadsheet, was not shown in that spreadsheet to have paid anything up to March 2008. Ms Sutherland explained, when this point was put to her by Mr Anderson QC, that <span style="font-style:italic">“he was one of the mortgage applications”</span> meaning that he was not expected, initially at least, to make a payment. Ms Sutherland went on to explain that Mr Dasmal agreed to purchase the neighbouring plot (no. 105) to that of his father-in-law (Mr Fattahi) and that, after Mr Fattahi’s <span style="font-style:italic">“wife was diagnosed with a very advanced case of breast cancer”</span>, they <span style="font-style:italic">“relocated to America, and we didn’t think it was quite correct to be hassling him to come back and formalise a final payment for his plot”</span>. In the circumstances, it is somewhat doubtful that the sales to Mr Dasmal and Mr Fattahi were ever going to come to fruition. Combined, these sales amounted to approximately AED 30 million: AED 12,726,180 in respect of plot no. 104 (Mr Dasmal) and AED 17,071,830 in respect of plot no. 105 (Mr Fattahi). Stripping these sales out of the combined total price of AED 269,347,457 brings the total down still further to AED 239,549,584. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, in addition, the point that, as Mr Kelly made very clear in the evidence which he gave, it is likely that purchasers such as Mr Kelly and his wife who did not see progress in line with their expectations would be reluctant to make payments in accordance with the agreed instalment mechanisms. Mr Kelly is clearly an astute businessman. As he wrote in an email to Ms Sutherland on 30 January 2007, albeit that the message was intended for Mr Fitzwilliam, in view of the delays in the schedule which were being experienced at the time, in particular in relation to the road infrastructure for Phase 1, something which he attributed in part at least to <span style="font-style:italic">“the lack of co-ordination between consultants you have chosen and the inefficiency of the Plantation organisation generally”</span>, he was not willing to continue making payments until progress had been made. As he explained when this message was put to him by Mr Anderson QC, he was <span style="font-style:italic">“being robust …  in my position”</span> in what he regarded as <span style="font-style:italic">“a negotiation”</span>. I am in little doubt that other purchasers in Mr Kelly’s position, whether or not they had his experience in business, would, if necessary, have taken a similar stance. It follows that, as Mr Anderson QC submitted, the mere fact that other purchasers appeared still to be willing to purchase does not mean that Plantation would have received what was due when it was due. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another aspect which needs to be borne in mind in this context is that, as demonstrated by Ms Sutherland’s spreadsheet, there had been no villa plots sales since the end of January 2008 when a number of contracts were apparently signed: specifically the three contracts signed by Mr Welsh (plot nos. 97, 98 and 108), two contracts signed by a Mr Mustapha (plot nos. 20 and 82), a contract signed by a Mr Karim (plot no. 75) and a contract signed by a Mr Rama (plot no. 76). No contracts had been entered into in the intervening period leading up to Ms Sutherland’s preparation of her 10 May 2008 spreadsheet. It follows that the suggestion made by Mr Fitzwilliam in his witness statement that at <span style="font-style:italic">“the beginning of 2008”</span> villa plot receipts were running at <span style="font-style:italic">“about US$2m per month but was set to increase dramatically from additional villa plot sales at the much higher prices”</span> is open to considerable doubt unless Mr Fitzwilliam intended to refer in this regard just to January 2008. The following table prepared by Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards, again based on Ms Sutherland’s spreadsheet, demonstrates that in the period from October 2007 to March 2008, a period which might be thought to be a better reflection of the rate of receipts, the monthly average was below US$1 million:</p>

However, they include receipts from Mr Welsh for the three plots which it is known that Mr Welsh was not going to proceed with. They include also an amount in respect of plot no. 27 (Ms Williams) although, as I have explained, this may be legitimate notwithstanding the apparent absence of any signed reservation contract (as opposed to the earlier option which was entered into). In addition, there is an amount (AED 4,068,891) in respect of plot no. 28 where the purchaser was a Mr Soufan in relation to which no account is taken of the fact that the relevant contract provided for 10% instalments to be paid quarterly meaning that the correct figure ought to have been AED 1,356,297. The consequence is that, rather than the AED 11,462,014 stated in the spreadsheet by Ms Sutherland, a more appropriate figure would have been AED 2,809,437. This is substantially less than the US$2 million to which Mr Fitzwilliam referred in his witness statement. Additionally, Plantation’s HSBC bank statements reveal the receipt of just AED 2,557,818.40 in respect of villa plot sales, which again serves to confirm that what Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland were apparently expecting was unrealistic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, not only were there no sales (and so no receipts from such sales) between the end of January 2008 and when Ms Sutherland prepared her spreadsheet in May 2008, but that remained the position until 1 July 2008. It was on that date that Dressage Investments Ltd (‘Dressage’) signed a reservation contract, albeit that some weeks earlier, on 14 May 2008, Dressage wrote to Plantation formally accepting Plantation’s <span style="font-style:italic">“offer of 70% of the purchase price of Plot No. 70”</span>. Ms Sutherland was asked about this but explained that she was unable to comment as she was not involved with this transaction. Indeed, the letter dated 14 May 2008 was sent to Mr Thomas Woolf who was responsible at Plantation for handling sales at the time. As Mr Anderson QC submitted, however, the fact that Plantation was willing to provide financing to Dressage at all, especially to so substantial a degree, rather suggests that Plantation was not finding it particularly easy to find purchasers for its villa plots. Indeed, I agree with Mr Anderson QC that Plantation’s willingness to enter into an arrangement such as the one which it did with Dressage provides further support for the view that Plantation was at this time in real need of funds. This was, of course, Mr Bitar’s contemporaneous understanding and the reason why DIB purchased a third villa plot. The other feature of the Dressage sale which is relevant for present purposes is the price per sq ft which is involved which was AED 600 per sq ft. As Mr Anderson QC submitted, the fact that Plantation was willing to enter into a sale contract at this price makes it unlikely that in June/July 2008 Plantation would have achieved as much as the AED 1,200 per sq ft which at trial (in his oral evidence rather than in his witness statement) it was suggested by Mr Fitzwilliam would have been obtainable. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This, then, is the position as regards villa plot sales. Clearly, they were somewhat limited, as were the funds which they generated. Theoretically, however, the limited amount of revenue coming into the Project would not have mattered were it not for the fact that, unsurprisingly in the circumstances, the Project very much needed money in order to take the development forward and to operate. Realistically by this stage, it was too late for Mr Fitzwilliam and Plantation to operate <span style="font-style:italic">“the tap”</span> or, as Mr Fitzwilliam put it earlier when dealing with the position after, again as he put it, <span style="font-style:italic">“being told by the bank that we were about to receive 50 million”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“slow down our expenditure”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“hit the brakes”</span>. At this point, very substantial debts had been incurred and were continuing to be incurred. In this context, I have again found helpful the analysis carried out by Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards as part of their written closing submissions because that analysis draws together the various points which were explored in some detail with, in particular, Ms Sutherland when she was being cross-examined. The short point, however, is that the approximately US$12 million monthly cash demand during 2008 to which Mr Fitzwilliam referred in his witness statement was simply too high to be met by the revenue levels which I have described. Mr Fitzwilliam was, however, there describing the expenditure which Plantation would have been incurring in working on the Project. On one view, the right approach would be to take account of this higher figure since, after all, if Plantation had scaled back its activities, it is most improbable that any new purchasers would have been persuaded to enter into reservation contracts and existing purchasers such as Mr Kelly would quite obviously have withheld payments. However, even focusing just on overhead costs, which Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards recognised would inevitably have been rather less, still the amounts involved can hardly be described as inconsiderable. Some indication as to what such overhead costs would have been in June/July 2008 can be gleaned from the fact that by October 2008, whilst Mr Fitzwilliam was still in custody and after DIB had taken the action which it did in August 2008, only essential staff had been retained by Plantation and even this cost AED 279,633.50 in October 2008. This can be seen from the list which Mr Ilahi sent to Mr Waugh under cover of an email dated 20 November 2008. That list set out the salaries for October and November. It excluded (under a heading <span style="font-style:italic">“Staff who will not be paid”</span>) certain employees, including three polo players each of whose monthly salary was AED 3,442.50 and Mr Fitzwilliam (AED 350,000) and Ms Sutherland (AED 49,505). As Mr Anderson QC and Mr Edwards pointed out, there would also have been running costs such as the cost of diesel for generators and horse feed, which would have added a further substantial monthly sum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even ignoring these sorts of costs, however, the position of the Project was very difficult as at June/July 2008. There were very substantial outstanding creditor liabilities, as detailed in a document described as an <span style="font-style:italic">“Aged Creditors Analysis (Summary)” </span>which was dated 12 May 2008 and which was sent by Ms Sutherland to Mr Nemer Khalifa the following day in an email in which she referred to the document as <span style="font-style:italic">“the current statement of account of payables”</span>. This analysis listed Plantation’s various creditors, setting out details of the individual liabilities (in each case in AED) and indicating how long each of those liabilities (in separate 30-day periods) had been outstanding. The total added up to AED 8,724,710, with the largest single amount (AED 2,847,812) attributable to Bait Lahem Contracting Co. LLC (‘Bait Lahem’), Plantation’s roads and infrastructure works contractor. Specifically, AED 1,002,489.02 was shown as being <span style="font-style:italic">“Current”</span>, AED 508,848.25 was shown as having been due for over 30 days (described as <span style="font-style:italic">“Period 1”</span> in the document but, as Ms Sutherland explained, this was a reference to a 30-day period) and the balance (AED 1,336,475.67) as having been due for over 60 days (<span style="font-style:italic">“Period 2”</span>). Within a few months, on 17 September 2008, Plantation prepared an updated <span style="font-style:italic">“Aged Creditors Analysis (Summary)” </span>in which the Bait Lahem liabilities had increased to AED 4,504,704.46 out of a total of AED 12,779,837.73. Although not entirely matching, the AED 4,504,704.46 is nearer to what Bait Lahem was telling DIB in an attachment to a letter sent to Al Tamimi dated 19 August 2008 which listed payments covering the period from 31 January 2008 to 30 April 2008 (and so covering the period up to and, as it happened, including 13 May 2008) adding up to AED 4,349,774. Thereafter, between 15 May 2008 and 15 July 2008 four further payments were identified as having not been made totalling just over AED 1.1 million. Although, in the circumstances, it is not possible to marry up these various figures, what is clear is that a substantial amount of money was due to Bait Lahem. Indeed, Ms Sutherland fairly accepted in cross-examination that by September 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">“there had been a very large sum of money outstanding to Bait Lahem for a very long period of time”</span>. That undeniably was the case. It was also the case in relation to certain of the other creditors which were listed alongside Bait Lahem, adding up to a further AED 5,876,898.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, then, in addition, the position of Dubailand to consider.

It is apparent, however, that notwithstanding this provision Dubailand was intent on passing to Plantation infrastructure-related costs. Mr Anderson QC explored, in particular, with Ms Sutherland the question of electrical substation costs. He referred in this context to a letter which Tatweer (essentially Dubailand) sent to Mr Fitzwilliam dated 3 April 2008. Headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Cost Recovery for Plantation shared substation”</span>, the letter stated as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The accompanying invoice referred to an amount calculated as 46.71% of the total cost of AED 260,196,512.29, resulting in a demand for AED 124,631,366.96. Mr Fitzwilliam replied to this letter on 14 April 2008. He made the point that Dubailand had previously told Plantation (in a letter which he stated was dated 28 February 2006 but which was in fact dated 26 February 2006 and was sent, as the fax transmission details indicate, on 26 February 2007) that <span style="font-style:italic">“our cost share would be AED 64.5 million”</span> and questioning why, even allowing for <span style="font-style:italic">“some price increase over the past years”</span>, the price should <span style="font-style:italic">“have doubled”</span>. Mr Anderson QC asked Ms Sutherland why no specific provision had been made for such a cost in the financial projections which she had prepared. She suggested that it was because there was no obligation under the Lease to make any such payment - a reference, in other words, to clause 4.1.3. It was pointed out, however, that this was not a point which was made by Mr Fitzwilliam in his response to Tatweer. His focus was, rather, on the amount payable. As Mr Anderson QC pointed out, Dubailand (and Tatweer) held the whip hand in negotiations since if Plantation wished to have the infrastructure it so obviously needed provided, it was going to be in a very weak bargaining position. Ms Sutherland essentially acknowledged this when she referred to Plantation<span style="font-style:italic"> “being held over a barrel in regards to getting infrastructure put on”</span>. As Ms Sutherland put it, <span style="font-style:italic">“Dubailand was threatening with the non-supply of infrastructure, if it wasn’t paid”</span> and so <span style="font-style:italic">“at this stage we had very little choice”</span>. Whether or not Ms Sutherland ought to have included a figure in her financial projections is nonetheless not the critical point at this juncture. Nor is the fact that it appears that it was not until 7 May 2008, as recorded in Mr Bitar’s internal progress report the same day, that Mr Fitzwilliam told DIB that <span style="font-style:italic">“Dubai Land has recently sent him an invoice for AED 120 million for the future construction of the Projects [sic] electrical substation”</span> and that he <span style="font-style:italic">“met with Dubai Land on May 7 raising an objection to the payment terms and requesting a deffered [sic] payment plan”</span>. What matters is that ultimately, after a meeting which apparently took place on 14 May 2008 and the further meeting which took place two weeks later on 28 May 2008, Plantation agreed with Dubailand and Tatweer that it would pay AED 107,109,165.32 as a contribution to the electrical substation, starting with a 30% payment on 30 June 2008 (AED 32,132,749.30) followed by two further 30% payments on 1 December 2008 and 1 June 2009 and a final 10% payment on 1 December 2009. This was set out in an email which Ms Sutherland sent to Mr Khalifa and Mr Bitar at DIB on 28 May 2008. Although Ms Sutherland was inclined to suggest in cross-examination that this was merely a <span style="font-style:italic">“worst-case scenario”</span> and that Mr Fitzwilliam was hoping to <span style="font-style:italic">“get changes in the payment schedules”</span>, propositions about which I am somewhat doubtful, what is important is that just a month or so later, on 30 June 2008, a substantial liability to Tatweer/Dubailand would accrue. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As far as Ms Sutherland was concerned, she explained in her evidence, this would have to be paid using the <span style="font-style:italic">“$50 million loan”</span> from DIB. This was a reference to the facility set out in a letter dated 13 April 2008, which was issued by DIB at a time when it was unaware of there being any liability in respect of the substation. It is instructive that Ms Sutherland should refer to a <span style="font-style:italic">“$50 million loan”</span> when, in fact, for reasons which I have explained, the facility was not something which entitled Plantation to anything like US$50 million. In fairness to Ms Sutherland, although given her job description she might have been expected to know about such things, it was Mr Fitzwilliam who was really in charge of obtaining such external financing. Both Ms Sutherland and Mr Fitzwilliam should, however, have appreciated that the financial position in June/July 2008 in which Plantation found itself was precarious to say the least. Plantation had debts totalling AED 42,359,421 (equating to US$11.4 million), namely AED 4,349,774 in respect of Bait Lahem, AED 5,876,898 in respect of the other trade creditors identified in the 13 May 2008 analysis and AED 42,359,421 in respect of the electrical substation costs payable to Tatweer/Dubailand. On top of this, there were more modest (but not insubstantial) liabilities to pay salaries and running costs. Plantation simply did not have the means to meet this level of expenditure: its sources of revenue were at that stage insufficient and it did not have enough money in the bank since in its main HSBC bank account there was only a very modest AED 467,012 as at 30 June 2008. </p>

As to the latter, it will be recalled that it is DIB’s case that Plantation would, in any event, have failed in view of its precarious financial position and what are described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the wider economic realities by mid-2008”</span>, with the consequence that the loss in relation to which Plantation now seeks to recover would have come about regardless of any breach of the RSA on the part of DIB.</p>

This is an issue which has considerable significance to the case generally, even though I detected something of a shift in the reliance which was placed on it by Mr Cakebread by the time that he came to make his closing submissions when Mr Cakebread explained that the Chescor deal was not, in fact, relied upon by Plantation because it did not happen and was not going to happen in the light of Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest. He clarified, however, that the Chescor deal remained relevant because <span style="font-style:italic">“if that deal was mooted and would otherwise have taken place, it places the valuation on Plantation at around $2 billion”</span>. Mr Cakebread’s position was nonetheless that, in the circumstances, the extent to which Mr Anderson QC, during the course of cross-examination and in submissions, sought to discredit Mr Bacon was <span style="font-style:italic">“disproportionate to the issue in the context of Plantation’s case overall”</span>. I do not agree. On the contrary, I agree with Mr Anderson QC when he submitted that the Chescor issue is highly significant. I can hardly overlook the fact that it was Plantation which chose to call a witness, Mr Bacon, who gave evidence concerning the issue specifically, so demonstrating Plantation’s reliance on the deal in relation to which, according to Mr Bacon, an agreement in principle had been reached. Mr Fitzwilliam himself gave evidence that he was <span style="font-style:italic">en route</span> to London to meet Chescor’s principals. Indeed, according to Mr Fitzwilliam, this is why he was at the airport in Dubai when he came to be arrested. This point goes still further because in the amended Particulars of Claim, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out in closing, the allegation is made that DIB procured Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest in order to <span style="font-style:italic">“enable it to instigate and/or procure the perfection of the conditional assignment and thereby appropriate the Land and the Plantation Project for its own commercial benefit”</span>, Mr Kamal having been made aware that Mr Fitzwilliam was to travel to London in order to secure US$600 million of equity funding during the course of a telephone conversation between Mr Kamal and Mr Fitzwilliam. </p>

I am clear that the reason for Mr Cakebread’s change of position by the time of his closing is an appreciation on the part of Mr Cakebread that Mr Bacon’s evidence did not, to put things mildly, go smoothly.</p>

One of these four potential investors at this high level was a fund affiliated to a corporate finance and consulting group known as Chescor Capital (‘Chescor’). Its group chairman and executive director, who effectively owned this fund, was Dr Amin Badr-El-Din. Dr Badr-El-Din was a polo patron and a real estate investor and I considered that his fund would be a natural fit for Plantation. I therefore contacted Stephen Mallet, by then the Chief Investment Officer of Chescor and a former colleague at Alcazar, and as such in charge of its mezzanine fund. A mezzanine fund basically lends money, looking for rates of return that are geared to the underlying performance of the business so it is a blend of debt and equity. Often the mezzanine lender will have the right to convert the debt into equity. Due to the debt element of the investment (and therefore the reduced risk), the time needed to put the investment in places also reduced.</span>

However, as a patron, Dr Badr-El-Din brought more to the project than just investment and I thought that he would be the preferred choice of investor. Arthur agreed with my assessment.</span>

At the time I did not know what he meant, though in retrospect it is clear he knew of my impending arrest and/or the Bank’s intention to manufacture an event of default in order to seize the security. I am sure the security police would have known of my reasons for going to London and whom I was going to meet. Telephone monitoring is standard practice in Dubai, and the main way of gathering evidence. I had been abroad several times since the arrest warrant had been issued, and so could have been arrested at any time prior to this, at the airport or elsewhere.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The reference to an arrest warrant in respect of Mr Fitzwilliam is a matter to which I shall return. The significance of the evidence set out in these passages of Mr Fitzwilliam’s witness statement is, however, that Mr Fitzwilliam was here, like Mr Bacon, giving evidence concerning a deal with Chescor which would have entailed payment of US$600 million for a 30% stake in Plantation and which involved a meeting with Dr Badr-El-Din in in the UK in early June 2008. As to what Mr Kamal was told by Mr Fitzwilliam about that meeting, these passages do not state, in terms, that Mr Fitzwilliam told him that he was travelling to this country to finalise a deal involving US$600 million and 30%. This is in contrast to Plantation’s pleaded case in which it is specifically stated that Mr Fitzwilliam told Mr Kamal that he was going to be flying to London on 6 June 2008 in order <span style="font-style:italic">“to sell part of his interest in plantation to raise funds to pay all the monies due under the RSA”</span>. It is in contrast also with a witness statement which Mr Fitzwilliam made in the context of the trial before Flaux J since in that witness statement Mr Fitzwilliam stated that he told Mr Kamal more precisely why he was travelling to London. Asked about the matter in cross-examination, Mr Fitzwilliam essentially, although somewhat equivocally, intimated that he told Mr Kamal in express terms the reason why he was travelling. The fact that Mr Fitzwilliam was so equivocal leads me to conclude that he did not, in fact, tell Mr Kamal about the Chescor deal. This conclusion is underlined by the fact that Mr Kamal, who was pressed on the matter by Mr Cakebread during the course of cross-examination, explained that, having left the Task Force some months earlier, any conversations with Mr Fitzwilliam which he might have had in June 2008 would have been very rare and, accordingly, he would therefore have remembered such a conversation had it occurred.</p>

I am satisfied that it is evidence which was essentially made up in an effort to support Plantation’s case that, contrary to what DIB has suggested, Plantation was in a sound financial condition as at June/July 2008 and, moreover, to provide a foundation for Plantation’s central complaint (indeed, the topic to which the vast majority of Mr Cakebread’s and Ms Levy’s written closing submissions were devoted) that DIB brought about Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest and the Project’s demise for DIB’s own purposes. As will appear, in the case of Mr Bacon, but not Mr Fitzwilliam because there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the matter, my criticism goes further since I consider that evidence which he gave concerning flight details apparently obtained from his Emirates Airlines account was manufactured. That evidence, which was initially proffered in the morning of the second day of his cross-examination, was persisted in both that day and when he returned some weeks later to complete his testimony. I set out my reasons for rejecting Mr Bacon’s and Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence concerning Chescor in what follows.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I find it impossible to accept the evidence given by Mr Bacon concerning his interaction with Chescor. There is no evidence before me from anybody at Chescor which confirms that Mr Bacon had the dealings with Chescor which he described in his evidence. On the contrary, Mr Moore’s email rather points in the opposite direction. Had there been such dealings, it ought to have been relatively simple for such corroborative evidence to have been adduced, even allowing for any commercial sensitivities on Chescor’s part. I bear in mind in this context the evidence which Mr Bacon gave in his witness statement, as repeated in his oral evidence, concerning Mr Mallet’s role at Chescor. I have previously explained how Mr Bacon failed to mention that he and Mr Mallet were business partners at the relevant time. This was the matter which I asked Mr Bacon about during the course of cross-examination and the matter which Mr Moore, one of Chescor’s principals, confirmed in his email to Plantation’s solicitors, David Wyld &amp; Co, sent on 10 November 2016. I have also expressed the view that it is hard to see why Mr Bacon should have chosen to describe Mr Mallet in his witness statement as Chescor’s Chief Investment Officer in circumstances where Chescor asked Mr Fitzwilliam and Mr Mallet for assistance since, if Mr Mallet really had been in that role at Chescor, it would have made no sense for Chescor to make any such request to Mr Fitzwilliam and Mr Mallet. The point goes further, however, since Mr Moore’s email dealt with what Chescor’s mezzanine fund entailed and what came of it. Mr Moore said this:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“To the best of my knowledge, Stephen Mallet and Nicholas Bacon were both engaged by Chescor Capital in the Middle East to assist in the development, structuring and placing of a specialist mezzanine finance fund that Chescor Capital was trying to develop sometime around 2008. This was for a relatively short period (I believe about three months). The fund did not get placed and the concept was subsequently abandoned.”</span>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">What Mr Moore had to say here makes it abundantly clear that Mr Mallet can never have been Chescor’s Chief Investment Officer since, if he had been, Mr Moore would have been bound to have said so in what, after all, is an email which was obtained on Plantation’s behalf by Plantation’s own solicitors. However, the email is also highly instructive in relation to what it says about the Chescor’s mezzanine fund never getting placed: quite clearly the fund never became operative, something which, in fact, Mr Bacon himself acknowledged when the point was put to him by Mr Anderson QC since he confirmed that <span style="font-style:italic">“the fund did not actually launch”</span>. I agree with Mr Anderson QC that, if the mezzanine fund had really been on the cusp of entering into the deal which Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam would have it was about to be concluded at a meeting in Hertfordshire which was to start on 9 June 2008, it is inconceivable that this would not have been mentioned by Mr Moore in his email. Although it seemed very likely that Mr Moore would have had explained to him by David Wyld &amp; Co why he was being asked for assistance, I was told by Mr Cakebread that this was not the case and that no mention of Plantation was made when Mr Moore was asked to assist. Clearly, had Mr Moore been made aware of the context in which he was being approached, the absence of any mention of the proposed Plantation/Chescor deal in Mr Moore’s email would have been particularly striking. However, even if Mr Moore was not made aware of the reason for the inquiry, the point remains that his reference to the mezzanine fund not getting placed is at odds with its being about to enter into a deal involving Plantation since, if the mezzanine fund did not get placed, it is difficult to see how it could have been in a position to have agreed in principle to pay US$600 million for a 30% stake in Plantation during discussions with Mr Bacon in advance of the meeting which, according to Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam, was to take place in Hertfordshire. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, although really this point is linked to the first reason why I cannot accept Mr Bacon’s and Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence concerning Chescor, there is a complete dearth of documentation indicating that there were the dealings between Mr Bacon and Chescor which Mr Bacon described in his witness statement, whether in advance of the alleged Hertfordshire meeting or in its wake. Mr Bacon was asked, in particular, during the course of cross-examination about the valuation discussions which he said that he had with Dr Badr-El-Din. He explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“I would have reported directly - I would have reported defining strategy to Arthur”</span> but that <span style="font-style:italic">“the documents are missing”</span>. Although it is the case that documents and computers remained on the Plantation site after DIB took it over, and so Plantation has not had access to documents which might have touched on this issue, for there nonetheless to be no documents at all, including any which even hint at the discussions referred to by Mr Bacon, is striking. The more so, in circumstances where Mr Bacon referred in his evidence to <span style="font-style:italic">“a draft termsheet”</span> having<span style="font-style:italic"> “been reached”</span> as well as to there inevitably needing to be <span style="font-style:italic">“lots of going back and forth”</span> when dealing with<span style="font-style:italic"> “a careful institution, which is internationally exposed”</span> such as Chescor, yet there is not a single document which evidences such exchanges between Mr Bacon and Chescor. It is worth remembering in this context that, according to Mr Bacon, several meetings took place between Dr Badr-El-Din and him during the course of May 2008, followed by two days of pre-meetings which, he suggests, took place on 4 and 5 June 2008. Again, there is no documentation showing that such meetings, in fact, happened. This is all the more surprising given that the meeting which, according to Mr Bacon, was to take place in Hertfordshire starting on 9 June 2008 and lasting two days was a meeting which was intended <span style="font-style:italic">“to close the deal”</span>. Given that this was the purpose of the meeting, there simply must have been documentation produced, indeed on both sides and in all probability involving also professional advisers such as accountants and lawyers, but none has been produced. This was a very substantial deal which, according to Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam, was to reach a conclusion at this meeting. It is wholly inconceivable that documentation was not brought into existence. If that was the case, it is equally inconceivable that no documents now exist. </p>

This emerged on the fifth day of the trial and so a week or so before Mr Bacon started his evidence. The document was a hard copy document; it was not available in soft format. Mr Anderson QC cast doubt in closing on its provenance, highlighting in particular how the document was in pristine condition despite its age and length of time in storage. Although, in the circumstances, given in particular what I come on to say concerning Mr Bacon’s Emirates Airlines account information, I have some reservations over the document’s provenance, I do not feel able to reject Mr Bacon’s explanation as to how it came to be found. For present purposes, the valuation does not, in any event, assist Plantation’s cause since, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out in closing, it is so lacking as a valuation that, if it had been shown to Dr Badr-El-Din (whom Mr Bacon described as a <span style="font-style:italic">“very experienced and savvy businessman”</span>), which Mr Bacon stated unequivocally it was not, then, I am confident that Dr Badr-El-Din, like any other sophisticated potential investor, would have seen that it was deficient and would not have placed any reliance upon it as justification for a valuation of Plantation which would support an equity raise in as high as a sum as that sought by Mr Bacon on Mr Fitzwilliam’s behalf. As I have mentioned, Mr Bacon did not, in fairness, suggest that the valuation was shown by him to anybody at Chescor. Indeed, given that the valuation refers to financial data contained in Plantation’s draft financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 and that financial data was not available to Mr Bacon before 29 May 2008, the document cannot have been before Mr Bacon when he had his meetings with Dr Badr-El-Din in May 2008 since those meetings took place before that date, specifically on 12, 19 and 20 May 2008. Be that as it may, the real point for present purposes is that, as Mr Anderson QC submitted, the valuation was very lacking and would inevitably have caused the potential investor in Dr Badr-El-Din’s position not simply to agree to what Mr Bacon was offering, as it would appear from Mr Bacon’s witness statement he was suggesting Dr Badr-El-Din did since there is no mention by Mr Bacon of any counter-offer having been made, though it is fair to point out that in cross-examination Mr Bacon suggested that his <span style="font-style:italic">“experienced team … went through the documentation, questioned me over it”</span>. The valuation is in a very substantial sum: US$2.103 billion. This compares to a valuation which [DTZ] prepared in August 2007 which saw Plantation valued at AED2.45 billion or approximately US$1 billion. Mr Bacon confirmed during the course of cross-examination that he arrived at his US$2.103 billion figure by using the 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">“Projected Culmulative [sic] Free Cash Flow”</span> figure of AED1.137 billion and multiplying that by a <span style="font-style:italic">“Valuation Multiple”</span> of 7.5, so as to give a value of AED 8.529 billion, which was then converted to US dollars at a rate of 0.2739, to give a value US$2.336 billion which was then discounted by 10%. Mr Anderson QC criticised each of these aspects. As to the multiplicand, he highlighted how Mr Bacon’s figures in his ‘Projected Cumulative Free Cash Flow’ did not represent sustainable future earnings but merely the projected <span style="font-style:italic">“Cumulative Free Cash Flow”</span> for <span style="font-style:italic">“Year 2”</span> in a <span style="font-style:italic">“Consolidated Cashflow Statement”</span> produced by Miss Sutherland on or about 13 June 2007 without paying any regard to whether villa plots sales had in the intervening year lived up to Ms Sutherland’s expectations. Mr Anderson QC also criticised the use of a multiplier of 7.5 or a discount of 10%, describing both as being entirely arbitrary. I consider that these various criticisms were justified, as were further criticisms concerning Mr Bacon’s somewhat confused, and anyway random, use of other data which saw him refer in one part of the valuation to a <span style="font-style:italic">“cash in hand and at bank”</span> figure taken from the audited balance sheet as at 31 December 2007, and refer in another part of the valuation to <span style="font-style:italic">“net book value of plant machinery vehicles etc”</span> information derived from the accounts for the previous year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly and perhaps most critically, there is the evidence which Mr Bacon, in particular, gave concerning the Hertfordshire meeting which, according to him, was to take place on 9 and 10 June 2008. There are a number of very considerable difficulties with Mr Bacon’s evidence in this regard. As I shall explain, I consider that Mr Bacon gave evidence on this topic which cannot be explained as having been given in error and which, in the circumstances, must have been given, I am driven to conclude, dishonestly. Mr Bacon cannot, in short, merely have been mistaken when he stated that he flew from Dubai to London in order to attend the meeting with Dr Badr-El-Din. He either did fly or he did not; there is no room for ambiguity. Equally, given that he was very specific in stating that the reason why he travelled to this country from Dubai in early June 2008 was to meet Dr Badr-El-Din and other representatives of Chescor, they can be no room for ambiguity or scope for misrecollection: either Mr Bacon was telling the truth about this or he was not.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bacon’s evidence in his witness statement was clear and unequivocal. It was that, after meetings with Dr Badr-El-Din and agreement in principle, it was agreed that there would be a meeting at the Hertfordshire home of Dr Badr-El-Din which Mr Fitzwilliam would attend. This meeting, which supposedly Mr Fitzwilliam was to attend, was, Mr Bacon explained in his witness statement, preceded by meetings which he alone (without Mr Fitzwilliam) had with Chescor representatives. Mr Bacon was very specific about this, explaining that he arrived in this country on 4 June 2008, having the previous two days (2 and 3 June 2008) had discussions with Mr Fitzwilliam as to <span style="font-style:italic">“how we would deal with Chescor”</span>. This evidence was explored in considerable detail on the second day of Mr Bacon’s cross-examination. Mr Anderson QC started this part of his cross-examination by pointing out to Mr Bacon that no airline tickets or credit card statements had been produced showing his travelling arrangements for the relevant time. Mr Bacon answered by saying that he had not been asked to produce such documentation, albeit pointing out that he would no longer have flight tickets. As for his passport, he explained that he might possibly still have his old passport but that it would not have been stamped because he had a visa which enabled him to deal with things electronically. Mr Anderson QC then took Mr Bacon to certain diary entries. Mr Bacon explained that the entries were taken from a diary which was <span style="font-style:italic">“just sort of my social home diary”</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic">“all of my work would have been conducted electronically via Outlook”</span>. He added that the diary which, therefore, Mr Anderson QC was looking at was essentially a diary which let <span style="font-style:italic">“my wife know where I was”</span>. Mr Anderson QC asked Mr Bacon, in particular, about the entry for (Wednesday) 4 June 2008 which has at the top of the page a reference to Chescor followed by an entry stating <span style="font-style:italic">“1000 hrs”</span>. This was the day when, according to Mr Bacon, he travelled to the UK. Mr Anderson QC asked which airline he would have used to travel. Mr Bacon explained that it would have been either Emirates Airlines or British Airways, and that typically he would use an overnight flight arriving at Heathrow at 6 am. There was, however, in the diary for either 3 or 4 June 2008 no reference to any flight. This is in contrast to certain other entries on other days where such details are given, as well as on occasion hotel details. The absence of such details for 3 or 4 June 2008 may not be critical, however, given Mr Bacon’s explanation as to the function which this particular diary was designed to serve. Taken together, however, with the entries which follow for the days which followed, the position, in my view is clear: Mr Bacon did not fly to this country when he said he did, and the meeting which he insisted he held with Chescor in Hertfordshire did not take place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Starting with the entries for the afternoon of 4 June 2008, there are references to <span style="font-style:italic">“Stephen – Chescor”</span> and then (again) to <span style="font-style:italic">“Chescor”</span>. These are, however, as consistent with a meeting taking place in the UK between Mr Mallet (<span style="font-style:italic">“Stephen”</span>) as they are with a meeting taking place in Dubai, or indeed as consistent with discussions other than in a meeting taking place between Mr Mallet and Mr Bacon in London or Dubai. They certainly do not justify in and of themselves a conclusion that Mr Bacon must have been in the UK on the afternoon of 4 June 2008. There is no evidence from Mr Mallet stating that he met with Mr Bacon that afternoon in the UK. Furthermore, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out in his closing submissions, in the light of what Mr Moore had to say in his email to David Wyld &amp; Co on 10 November 2016, there is no reason necessarily to suppose that the references to <span style="font-style:italic">“Stephen – Chescor”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“Chescor”</span> are references to discussions with Chescor as opposed to references to Mr Mallet and Mr Bacon merely discussing Chescor’s mezzanine fund having been asked to provide Chescor with the type of assistance described by Mr Moore. I agree with Mr Anderson QC also that subsequent entries to <span style="font-style:italic">“Merchant Bridge”</span> on (Monday) 9 June 2008 and (Tuesday) 10 June 2008, the days when Mr Bacon insists the Hertfordshire meeting should have been taking place, as well as on the following Wednesday and Thursday (11 and 12 June 2008), do not provide support for Mr Bacon’s evidence that he travelled to the UK. Mr Bacon suggested that <span style="font-style:italic">“Merchant Bridge”</span> was the project name which was given to the proposed deal with Chescor. However, I reject that evidence, in circumstances where MerchantBridge &amp; Co Ltd is the name of an English private equity firm which invests in the Middle East with which Mr Bacon had professional contact. I consider it very unlikely indeed that Mr Bacon and Mr Mallet would have decided to adopt the same name for the Chescor deal. It would have made no sense at all to do so. It is much more likely that the various <span style="font-style:italic">“Merchant Bridge”</span> references have nothing whatever to do with any Chescor deal involving Plantation and instead reflect Mr Bacon’s dealings with MerchantBridge &amp; Co Ltd. The fact that such entries appear where they do, in particular on 9 and 10 June 2008, is a strong indication that Mr Bacon was not in the UK on those days but was in Dubai. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Other more mundane entries also point to Mr Bacon being in Dubai at the relevant time. To take an example, on (Thursday) 5 June 2008 there is a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“School Run”</span>. Later on, after a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Chescor”</span> just before lunch, there are two entries for <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation”</span> which are admittedly as consistent with Mr Bacon dealing with Plantation matters from the UK as they are with him doing so in Dubai. However, in the evening there is then a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Desert Palm Hotel”</span> which is the hotel near which Mr Bacon and his family lived. The following day (Friday) 6 June 2008, there are references to <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Riding”</span> in the morning and to <span style="font-style:italic">“Home”</span> in the afternoon followed by an entry in the evening which refers to <span style="font-style:italic">“Raffles”</span>, the hotel or restaurant in Dubai and mentions, as Mr Bacon explained, two friends of his. On (Sunday) 8 June 2008 there is another reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“School Run”</span> followed by an entry which states <span style="font-style:italic">“Abu Dhabi Chescor”</span> and so suggesting that, rather than being in the UK, Mr Bacon travelled from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, in all probability for discussions concerning the setting up of Chescor’s proposed mezzanine as described by Mr Moore rather than to discuss a deal concerning Plantation in relation to which there was to be a meeting the next day in the UK. Then, on (Monday) 9 June 2008, besides the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Merchant Bridge”</span>, there is an early entry which states <span style="font-style:italic">“Run”</span> followed by a reference to a meeting concerned with Plantation. Then, before an afternoon reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Merchant Bridge”</span>, Mr Bacon has stated that he has eaten, or planned to eat, <span style="font-style:italic">“Sushi”</span>. (Tuesday) 10 June 2008 again starts with a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“Run”</span> before containing entries for Plantation and<span style="font-style:italic"> “Merchant Bridge”</span> both for the morning and the afternoon with a lunchtime engagement at <span style="font-style:italic">“Grosvenor House”</span>, another establishment in Dubai. In the evening the following entry appears: <span style="font-style:italic">“7.30 Home Novatis Call”</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These various entries seem to me to make it abundantly clear that throughout this time period Mr Bacon remained in Dubai, albeit with an excursion to Abu Dhabi on 8 June 2008. Perhaps the most significant entry, however, is one which I have not mentioned, namely a reference on (Thursday) 5 June 2008 as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">“1000 hrs Tatweer”</span>. This was a meeting concerning White Water Dubai which certainly took place in Dubai because amongst certain emails which were disclosed from Ms Sutherland’s personal computer after she had finished giving her evidence are exchanges between Mr Bacon and a Mr Ulrike Schwarz-Runder of Tatweer. Specifically, Mr Bacon sent Tatweer an email on (Monday) 2 June 2008 in which he began by referring to the fact that he had left <span style="font-style:italic">“a voice message earlier to see if you were able to catch up over a coffee”</span> and asking that he be given <span style="font-style:italic">“a call if you are free at all this week”</span>. He ended his email by stating that he understood <span style="font-style:italic">“that there will be a meeting of [sic] Thursday when progress towards the MOU and land allocation will be discussed, however I would be very happy to catch up beforehand if you are free”</span>. It is very difficult to see how Mr Bacon could have sent an email in these terms if he had been intending to travel from Dubai to London the following day, 3 June 2008, or indeed at any time that week. The email thread then continues with an email from Ulrike Schwarz-Runer to Mr Bacon on 5 June 2008, the day of the diary entry to which I have referred, stating that it <span style="font-style:italic">“was good to see you again”</span>. Significantly, Mr Bacon responded the same day saying this: <span style="font-style:italic">“Thank you for your time today”</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The position is clear: Mr Bacon must have been in Dubai on 5 June 2008. Mr Bacon, indeed, appeared to acknowledge this after the exchanges had been put to him, explaining that he had based his witness statement on his diary entries and <span style="font-style:italic">“can only imagine that I in fact travelled that weekend”</span> which was a reference to the weekend immediately after 5 June 2008. This nonetheless did not explain the entries for subsequent days, specifically 6 to 10 June 2008, which I have already described. I am clear that these entries are to be regarded as demonstrating that Mr Bacon did not travel to the UK when he said that he did. This is a conclusion which I would have reached, in any event, based on the material to which I have referred. However, Mr Bacon’s evidence then took an unexpected turn. The following day, the third day of his cross-examination, Mr Bacon returned to court to continue to be cross-examined by Mr Anderson QC. That cross-examination took all day but had still to be completed by the end of the day. Accordingly, Mr Bacon returned to Court for a fourth day. He had, however, overnight been looking into the position concerning his Emirates Airlines account. It is fair to say that Mr Bacon looked tired and troubled as he was about to resume his evidence. In my view, this was because he appreciated that the position which he now found himself in was somewhat difficult and, perhaps, appreciated or feared that it was about to become more difficult still. Mr Bacon had earlier that morning sent Ms Levy an email in which he stated as follows:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bacon was asked about this by Mr Anderson QC, albeit plainly Mr Anderson QC was not in a position to deal with the matter in any depth and essentially confined himself to asking Mr Bacon for the necessary information to enable his Emirates Airlines account to be accessed. Mr Bacon explained that he had not <span style="font-style:italic">“brought the details with”</span> him and that he had only managed to obtain the information which he had obtained by resetting <span style="font-style:italic">“a whole load of details”</span>. Mr Bacon had a pre-arranged meeting for the afternoon and so time was short. As a result, arrangements were made for access to be had to Mr Bacon’s Emirates airlines account, the details of which I need not set out here. Ultimately, however, DIB sought an order requiring Emirates Airlines to provide certain information concerning Mr Bacon’s flights record. This came in the form of a letter to Baker &amp; McKenzie from a Dr Abdulla Al Hashimi, the Divisional Senior Vice President of Emirates’ Group Security. That letter, which was dated 29 November 2016, attached the relevant account <span style="font-style:italic">“travel summary for the period 22-Apr-2006 to 10-Aug-2009”</span> and went on:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Anderson QC submitted in closing that the attached details demonstrate clearly that Mr Bacon manipulated the Excel spreadsheet which he downloaded from the Emirates Airlines’ website, so as to alter the details of flights that he took on 29 and 31 May 2008 (to Heathrow from Dubai, and return) to make them look as though they took place on 8 and 10 June 2008.  He then converted the document to a PDF file in order that his changes could not be traced, producing the document he then provided to Ms Levy. This is the point which he put to Mr Bacon when he returned to Court on 1 December 2016 in order to be asked about this matter and for his re-examination to be completed. Mr Bacon denied Mr Anderson QC’s allegation. He explained, in particular, that his laptop operated <span style="font-style:italic">“over our corporate VPN network … so file size is important”</span> and that saving in PDF form involves smaller files. Although I do not doubt that that is the general position, nonetheless I am equally in no real doubt that it suited Mr Bacon in the present case to save the download in PDF format because it enabled him to make changes. In short, I found Mr Bacon’s denials wholly unconvincing. I accept, without hesitation, the accuracy of the information which has been provided by Dr Al Hashimi. Mr Cakebread highlighted the fact that the Dubai government has an interest in both DIB and Emirates Airlines, hinting at DIB having conspired with senior management at Emirates Airlines to present false documentation. There is, however, no reason to suppose that there has been any such conspiracy. The position seems to me to be clear: entries 135 and 136 in the schedule which he has provided, showing flights taken by Mr Bacon in business class from Dubai to London Heathrow on 29 May 2008 and returning from London Heathrow to Dubai on 31 May 2008, do not appear in the PDF document which Mr Bacon created using the Excel document he downloaded from Emirates Airlines’ website. Instead, flights are described as having been taken on 8 June 2008 (Dubai to London Heathrow) and on 10 June 2008 (London Heathrow to Dubai), both in business class. The flight immediately before the 8 June 2010 entry in Mr Bacon’s PDF document is given as a flight on 15 May 2008 from Amman to Dubai. That flight appears also in Dr Al Hashimi’s schedule. The flight which comes after the 31 May 2008 flight referred to at entry 136 of that schedule is a flight on 9 July 2008 described as having been from London Heathrow to Dubai. That same flight appears in Mr Bacon’s PDF schedule. What has plainly happened here is that Mr Bacon has changed the dates for the intervening two flights from Dubai to London Heathrow and returning from London Heathrow to Dubai so that, instead of the flights being shown as having been taken on 29 and 31 May 2008 respectively, they appear as flights which were taken by Mr Bacon on 8 and 10 June 2008. The alterations were, no doubt, easily made in the Excel spreadsheet which Mr Bacon had access to. They are, of course, not able to be identified in a PDF document. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bacon, in essence, returned to Court for a fourth day of cross-examination having doctored evidence so as to support a version of events which he knew to be untrue. Matters did not stop there, however, since, in returning to be asked about these matters on 1 December 2016, Mr Bacon was asked by Mr Anderson QC whether he would be agreeable to hand over the laptop on which the Emirates Airlines’ PDF documents had been created on 11 November 2016 so that an image could be taken of the hard drive and examined by specialists. He agreed to this, having confirmed in the meantime that the computer concerned was the computer which he used when accessing his account. Subsequent analysis revealed, however, that it was <span style="font-style:italic">“extremely unlikely”</span>, as DIB’s specialist put it, that the laptop which had been examined (a Lenovo Yoga machine running the Microsoft Windows operating system) had been used to create the PDF files since the PDF file properties of the document which Mr Bacon had provided to Ms Levy on the third day of his evidence (11 November 2016) indicate that that document was created using a Macbook, rather than any other type of computer, running Max OS X 10.11.6 Quartz PDF Context. Mr Cakebread responded to this point, which was made in Mr Anderson QC’s written closing submissions, in an email which was sent to me, with my permission, after the trial had concluded. In that email it was explained that Bishop Group, Plantation’s forensic computer experts, had been informed that Mr Bacon had told Ms Levy that his employer’s VPN <span style="font-style:italic">“operates in an exclusively Apple environment”</span> and that, in such circumstances, if Mr Bacon <span style="font-style:italic">“remote-controls his work computer over the VPN, then that is most likely where the flight material and internet history will reside”</span> whereas if Mr Bacon <span style="font-style:italic">“simply uses the internet connection at his office over the VPN, the data will most likely be on the laptop and not the work computer as he is using the web browser, pdf creator etc. on the laptop and not his work computer”</span>. In order to ascertain the position, apparently <span style="font-style:italic">“it would be prudent to examine both if possible”</span>. Accordingly, Mr Cakebread submitted, the use of Mr Bacon’s employer’s VPN may provide an explanation as to why the PDF was downloaded in an Apple environment. I must reach a view on this matter and, viewing the evidence in the round, faced with having to make a choice between Mr Bacon having made alterations to the Emirates Airlines’ account, on the one hand, and DIB conspiring with Emirates Airlines to create a false document, on the other, I regard the choice as clear: it was Mr Bacon who did the manipulation. I bear in mind in this context that Mr Cakebread went on in his email to describe the work which had been done by Bishop Group in relation to Dr Al Hashimi’s schedule. He explained that they had ascertained that this had been created by a user named Anf Ahamed who created it by printing it from Microsoft Excel 2010 on 28 November 2016. They apparently made the point that, in order to undertake any meaningful analysis, they required the original .XLSX spreadsheet from which Mr Ahamed produced the PDF file since, without looking directly at the Emirates Airlines’ flight database system, <span style="font-style:italic">“the original spreadsheet is where we would find any data omitted from the PDF file”</span>. They, therefore, required <span style="font-style:italic">“access to the original Excel spreadsheet from which the PDF was generated at Emirates”</span>. Such a request having been made of Baker &amp; Mackenzie, their response on behalf of DIB was that it was not possible to provide the Excel file <span style="font-style:italic">“as the data was extracted in a different format, i.e. from a database which was reformatted and presented in a PDF format”</span>. Mr Cakebread reported that Bishop Group had not expected such a response but that<span style="font-style:italic"> “there may be a plausible explanation”</span>. The only way of finding out the true position would be to access the Emirates Airlines database <span style="font-style:italic">“to see if it contains the 2008 dates and to see if that has been tampered with by looking at the older back-up copies of the database that would have to exist”</span> but that<span style="font-style:italic"> “would be an expensive operation”</span>. I should record that Plantation did not seek any order permitting such access to be given; nor, as far as I am aware, was it sought on a voluntary basis from DIB. In the circumstances, for the reasons which I have given, I am left in the position which I have described already and have arrived at the conclusion which I have: that Mr Bacon, rather than Emirates Airlines in conjunction with DIB, made the alterations which I have described on the morning of 11 November 2016 as he was about to resume his evidence. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that, as I have previously observed, he looked as troubled as he did that morning: he had embarked on a course which entailed serious misconduct.</p>

In that case, the Court of Appeal struck out an unfair prejudice petition on the basis that the controller of one of the petitioner companies had forged documents as part of his object of frustrating a fair trial.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“… I adopt, as a general principle, the observations of Mr Justice Millett in Logicrose Ltd v Southend United Football Club Limited (The Times, 5 March 1988) that the object of the rules as to discovery is to secure the fair trial of the action in accordance with the due process of the Court; and that, accordingly, a party is not to be deprived of his right to a proper trial as a penalty for disobedience of those rules - even if such disobedience amounts to contempt for or defiance of the court - if that object is ultimately secured, by (for example) the late production of a document which has been withheld. But where a litigant's conduct puts the fairness of the trial in jeopardy, where it is such that any judgment in favour of the litigant would have to be regarded as unsafe, or where it amounts to such an abuse of the process of the court as to render further proceedings unsatisfactory and to prevent the court from doing justice, the court is entitled - indeed, I would hold bound - to refuse to allow that litigant to take further part in the proceedings and (where appropriate) to determine the proceedings against him. The reason, as it seems to me, is that it is no part of the court's function to proceed to trial if to do so would give rise to a substantial risk of injustice. The function of the court is to do justice between the parties; not to allow its process to be used as a means of achieving injustice. A litigant who has demonstrated that he is determined to pursue proceedings with the object of preventing a fair trial has forfeited his right to take part in a trial. His object is inimical to the process which he purports to invoke.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are additional reasons why I reject Mr Bacon’s evidence concerning the Hertfordshire meeting and the alleged Chescor deal. The first of these is that I find it unrealistic to suppose that Mr Bacon can really be right when he gave evidence that he, along with Dr Badr-El-Din and the others at the meeting which he maintains took place, simply waited for Mr Fitzwilliam on 9 June 2008, doing nothing to try to find out what had caused Mr Fitzwilliam’s non-attendance. Such a reaction would simply have made no sense at all. This was a deal which, on the basis of Mr Bacon’s evidence, was wanted by Chescor. The notion that, in those circumstances, nobody would have done anything is utterly implausible. There is, however, nothing to indicate that anything was done. There is no sign of any email having been sent to Ms Sutherland, for example, to ask where Mr Fitzwilliam was. Nor does Mr Bacon or anybody else say that they made such contact. On the contrary, it would appear, based on Mr Bacon’s evidence, that the participants in the meeting simply waited for Mr Fitzwilliam to arrive and then dispersed without a single effort being made, either at the time or in the days or weeks which followed, to find out what had happened and, indeed, to inquire whether the deal could be revived. In fact, according to Mr Bacon, the first that he heard about that Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest was not for another two or three weeks. It appears that Ms Sutherland decided to keep the fact that Mr Fitzwilliam had been arrested from Mr Bacon, instead telling him that Mr Fitzwilliam had had to travel to Greece to deal with certain family matters. It is significant, however, that it was only in cross-examination that Mr Bacon stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“there was an absolute conversation with her the next-either that day or the next day about Arthur’s whereabouts and how angry”</span> he was that Mr Fitzwilliam had not turned up at the meeting in Hertfordshire. This was in response to Mr Anderson QC asking why there is nothing to indicate in the documents that Mr Bacon got in touch with Ms Sutherland to ask what had happened to Mr Fitzwilliam. I found Mr Bacon’s evidence in this regard entirely unconvincing. If Mr Bacon really had got in touch with Ms Sutherland or anybody else at Plantation in the immediate aftermath of the meeting or indeed whilst still in Hertfordshire awaiting Mr Fitzwilliam’s attendance at the meeting, it is difficult to see why there is nothing in the documentation to indicate, or even hint, that such an inquiry was made. I am quite clear that Mr Bacon did not ask any such question at all. This, despite the fact that Mr Fitzwilliam had failed to attend a very important meeting concerning a very large and critical deal which had come to nothing through Mr Fitzwilliam’s ‘no show’. Mr Bacon only somewhat vaguely suggested, when asked by Mr Anderson QC, that Ms Sutherland had said something to him about Mr Fitzwilliam having travelled to Greece to deal with family matters. This was, I repeat, only as a result of questions from Mr Anderson QC asking why there are no documents indicating that any such inquiry was made by Mr Bacon of anybody at Plantation. Nor, it is worth bearing in mind also, is there any evidence from anybody else who attended the meeting in Hertfordshire, specifically from Chescor personnel, to indicate that they raised any query concerning Mr Fitzwilliam’s whereabouts. If the Chescor deal really was about to be finalised in Hertfordshire and this only failed to happen because of Mr Fitzwilliam’s non-attendance at the meeting, somebody would have been bound to ask why it was that Mr Fitzwilliam did not attend. The fact that nobody did provides strong support for the conclusion that Mr Bacon’s evidence concerning the meeting simply cannot be right.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, and crucially, there are documents showing that in the days which followed the alleged meeting in Hertfordshire there was contact between Mr Bacon and Plantation, specifically Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf, in which the complaint was made that there had been no contact with Mr Bacon <span style="font-style:italic">“since Thursday afternoon”</span>. I refer here to an email which Mr Woolf sent Mr Bacon, copying in Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland, on Saturday, 14 June 2008. In that email Mr Woolf asked Mr Bacon to <span style="font-style:italic">“call to provide us with an update of where things are at from your side”</span>, explaining that attempts had been made to contact him <span style="font-style:italic">“via call, email and SMS on several different occasions since Thursday afternoon without response”</span>. Mr Bacon’s response the same day was to email saying that he had <span style="font-style:italic">“just got into Kuwait, to try a final tactic”</span>. He then went on to make no mention of the Chescor deal and in particular the Hertfordshire meeting which Mr Fitzwilliam had failed to attend and instead raised matters in connection with a different project altogether namely something called the Holly Bolly project. There is not the slightest hint in either of these email exchanges that Mr Bacon had only recently returned from the UK having been at a meeting with Chescor which collapsed owing to Mr Fitzwilliam’s non-attendance. Subsequent email exchanges the following day involved Mr Bacon explaining that the Holly Bolly efforts he was making in Kuwait had come to nothing. It should be noted that there is no equivalent email exchange from Mr Bacon in the wake of the meeting which, according to him, took place in Hertfordshire the previous week. That Mr Bacon’s evidence in relation to the Hertfordshire meeting cannot be relied upon is additionally supported by certain emails which passed between Mr Bacon, Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf in the days which followed. These emails, which came from Ms Sutherland’s own computer, were only disclosed during the course of the trial, indeed after Ms Sutherland had completed her evidence. Significantly, on 16 June 2008 Mr Bacon sent Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf an email headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Resourcing Plan Plantation Equity Raise”</span> in which he referred to the fact that to <span style="font-style:italic">“take this on will be a full-time commitment from me”</span>. He went on to set out details which, far from being consistent with a deal such as the Chescor deal having already reached an advanced stage (only then to have failed in Hertfordshire), demonstrate that Mr Bacon (contrary to the evidence which he gave) was only instructed to find a purchaser for Mr Fitzwilliam’s equity interest in Plantation a week later, on 16 June 2008, and so after (albeit not apparently known to Mr Bacon at the time) Mr Fitzwilliam had been arrested. Interestingly, in a further email also sent on 16 June 2008 Mr Bacon asked Ms Sutherland to seek Mr Fitzwilliam’s approval in relation to various points, including Mr Bacon’s stated need to have <span style="font-style:italic">“Arthur in Europe at various points in July and August”</span>. Had Mr Fitzwilliam only recently failed to attend a meeting in Hertfordshire, Mr Bacon would have been bound to have made reference to this fact in that email. The fact that he did not do so is, accordingly, instructive. Even if the topic of an <span style="font-style:italic">“equity raise through Plantation”</span> had been discussed between Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam previously, it is perfectly obvious that it had not advanced to the stage of the type of meeting which Mr Bacon insisted was to have taken place in Hertfordshire. This is made plain by an email which Mr Bacon sent Mr Fitzwilliam, Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf on 18 June 2008. In that email he said this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This material makes it inconceivable that Mr Bacon’s evidence concerning the Hertfordshire meeting can have been true. In short, I am left in no doubt that the evidence given by Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam concerning the Chescor deal should not be accepted. It is that deal which has been my focus in this section. However, it is convenient to go on, relatively briefly, to address Mr Cakebread’s submission that, as he put it in the course of his closing, there was <span style="font-style:italic">“substantial interest by potential investors with the means to acquire either whole of or a major stake in Plantation”</span>. He had in mind, in particular, deals about which Mr Bacon gave evidence concerning Arbah Capital and Noor Capital. Mr Bacon’s approaches to these parties came later, when Mr Fitzwilliam was in prison. Mr Cakebread nonetheless prayed them in aid when seeking to refute Mr Anderson QC’s suggestion that Plantation was in so poor a financial state in mid-2008 as to be of no interest to third-party investors. Mr Cakebread suggested, in particular, that Noor Capital was willing to enter into a deal in late 2008 which would have seen Noor Capital pay US$720 million with full knowledge of Mr Fitzwilliam’s incarceration. Mr Bacon was asked about this matter in re-examination. Specifically, he was taken by Mr Cakebread to an email which he sent to Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf on 30 October 2008. In that email he described having <span style="font-style:italic">“had a long chat to Arthur today”</span> and to their agreement that <span style="font-style:italic">“I should go to Abu Dhabi today to open up more detailed negotiations with the second option”</span>. The <span style="font-style:italic">“second option”</span> was, Mr Bacon explained, a reference to Noor Capital since Noor Capital were based in Abu Dhabi. Mr Bacon had previously explained in his witness statement that earlier in October 2008 he travelled to Abu Dhabi to meet Noor Capital’s principals, in the company of Mr Michael Williams and Mr David Mapplebeck from Novati, and that this meeting led to work being carried out with Noor Capital’s investment subsidiary, Gulf Cap. This work resulted in a proposal put together by Novati which entailed Noor Capital (described by Mr Williams in his letter to Mr Fitzwilliam dated 3 November 2008 as being Novati’s <span style="font-style:italic">“co-investor”</span>) purchasing the entirety of Mr Fitzwilliam’s equity interest in Plantation for <span style="font-style:italic">“around US$720m - enough to pay the debt to the Bank, and preserve some value for Arthur”</span> who would <span style="font-style:italic">“remain as the principal with control of the development”</span>. It was Mr Bacon’s opinion, as stated in his witness statement, that if DIB had not taken physical possession of the Plantation site on 4 November 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">“there is a very strong likelihood that this transaction was completed in a very quick timescale as Noor both had the capital requirement and local understanding to complete the transaction”</span>. Mr Bacon confirmed in re-examination that, as far as he was concerned, the US$720 million was <span style="font-style:italic">“a firm figure”</span>. He did so after Mr Cakebread had taken him to certain correspondence between DIB and Novati, specifically a letter from Mr Fahad bin Fahad, DIB’s Chief Risk Officer, to Mr Williams concerning a possible consultancy arrangement between Novati and DIB, which was followed by an email sent by Mr bin Fahad to Mr Nidal Shomali, DIB’s Head of Collections and somebody to whom I shall be referring shortly, on 22 December 2008 in which he referred to it having been <span style="font-style:italic">“decided yesterday not to pursue an agreement with Novati based on our meeting with Noor capital and their preference of having a direct dialogue with DIB regarding their interest in the plantation project”</span>. Mr Bacon was also shown an internal DIB email exchange involving Mr Ilahi on 25 January 2009 in which Mr Ilahi referred to his being <span style="font-style:italic">“happy to receive the CEO of Noor Capital”</span> in response to an email referring to a meeting with him which was to take place on 27 January 2009. That email described Noor Capital as being <span style="font-style:italic">“the potential buyer of the Plantation Land”</span> and stated that Noor Capital’s Chairman would also most likely attend the meeting. Mr Bacon suggested in re-examination that the fact that such a meeting was planned <span style="font-style:italic">“would suggest that everything was fairly well advance between the two parties”</span>. In truth, however, it seems to me that the amount of weight which can be placed on the Noor Capital discussions is relatively slight since it is not obvious to me that any such deal was going to be concluded. The most that can be said is that Mr Bacon and Novati were in discussions with Noor Capital which DIB took further forward, initially alongside Novati and subsequently without Novati’s involvement. Those came to nothing and, although Mr Bacon was minded to suggest in his witness statement that Noor Capital only <span style="font-style:italic">“had some further due diligence of its own to complete”</span>, I feel unable to place much significance on what Mr Bacon had to say in this regard in view of my doubts concerning his reliability as a witness generally. Mr Bacon went on in his witness statement to refer to Noor Capital as having been <span style="font-style:italic">“committed to making the investment”</span>, but again this is not evidence that I consider ought to be accepted without rather more documentary corroboration than exists. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The same applies in relation to Arbah Capital, which withdrew their interest in November 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">“citing”</span>, as Mr Bacon put it in an email sent to Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf on 25 November 2008, <span style="font-style:italic">“market conditions and the changes to the circumstances of the transaction”</span>. Mr Bacon explained in re-examination that in this regard Arbah Capital were being <span style="font-style:italic">“professional and polite”</span> since, in his view, the real reasons for Arbah Capital’s withdrawal were <span style="font-style:italic">“the continuing situation with Arthur”</span> which had become <span style="font-style:italic">“public knowledge”</span> and the fact that DIB had by that stage taken over physical possession of the Plantation site. It appears that Mr Bacon had made contact with Arbah Capital in September 2008. Indeed, following a meeting held at the offices of Norton Rose, Arbah Capital’s solicitors, Mr Bacon sent Ms Sutherland and Mr Fitzwilliam a document which he described as an <span style="font-style:italic">“Arbah Termsheet”</span> and which had been prepared by Norton Rose. That document described the <span style="font-style:italic">“Investment amount”</span> as being US$600 million which was to be paid in respect of 60% of the <span style="font-style:italic">“common stock”</span> of Plantation. It went on to refer to certain <span style="font-style:italic">“Pre Contract Conditions”</span> which included the following in particular:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The Directors of Plantation Holdings FZ LLC warrants that they are not subject to any criminal proceedings in the United Arab Emirates or any other jurisdiction.”</span>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is instructive that this proposed deal involved, as Mr Bacon acknowledged during the course of cross-examination, effectively half of what, according to him, had been envisaged would be achieved through the Chescor deal. Aside from this, however, it is perfectly obvious that the pre-condition quoted above would represent a considerable difficulty for Mr Bacon and Plantation in seeking to bring the Arbah Capital deal to fruition, even though it is right to acknowledge that Mr Bacon’s solution in re-examination was that all that needed to happen was for Mr Fitzwiliam to be removed as a director. Another difficulty was the fact that the term sheet envisaged that 20 villa plots would be released onto the market by 17 December 2008. As Mr Bacon himself pointed out in an email which he sent to Norton Rose on 27 September 2008, <span style="font-style:italic">“having to commit to 20 villa sakes [sic] by 17/12/08 is a little premature at this stage”</span>. In any event, just a month later, on 28 October 2008, Mr Bacon was pressing Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf to speak to Mr Fitzwilliam in relation to a matter which he described as urgent and which, he confirmed in cross-examination, involved his concern that Arbah Capital were about to pull out of the proposed deal. This, indeed, is why two days later, on 30 October 2008, Mr Bacon sent Ms Sutherland and Mr Woolf his email in which he referred to having spoken to Mr Fitzwilliam and to their agreement that Mr Bacon should travel to Abu Dhabi <span style="font-style:italic">“to open up more detailed negotiations with the second option”</span>, namely with Noor Capital. The proposed deal involving Arbah Capital was, accordingly, short-lived and not a transaction which was ever going to result in investment at any level. It was also, I should mention in passing, a transaction which Mr Bacon was driven to accept during the course of cross-examination he pursued in his personal capacity rather than on behalf of Novati. Mr Bacon insisted, however, that his colleagues at Novati were made aware of what he was doing in relation to Arbah Capital. This is not a matter about which I need to express a concluded view. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In conclusion, before I come on to deal with Plantation’s case concerning deliberate breach on the part of DIB, I am quite satisfied that Mr Cakebread’s submission that there was substantial interest by potential investors with the means to acquire either whole of or a major stake in Plantation during the course of 2008 is simply not borne out by the evidence. The truth is that Plantation was in a bad financial state in June/July 2008 with little prospect of being able to attract the type of investment which would have enabled it to continue, even leaving aside the economic crisis which was about to envelop the worldwide business community. This is relevant both to DIB’s case that by June/July 2008 there had been an Event of Default under clauses 18.1(e), (f) or (g) of the RSA and to the case which is put forward by Mr Anderson QC in relation to causation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I turn, then, to Plantation’s case on deliberate breach and, as part of that case, the suggestion that DIB was somehow responsible for Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest. That arrest took place on Friday, 6 June 2008 and followed the arrests of Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius which had taken place the previous month. Specifically, as Flaux J explained in his judgment at [61] and [62], Mr Cornelius was arrested at Dubai airport on 21 May 2008. Mr Fitzwilliam explained in his witness statement that at the time Mr Cornelius was on his way to Pakistan and that he was in the middle of a telephone conversation with Mr Cornelius at the precise moment of his arrest. Mr Ridley was then arrested six days later on 27 May 2008. The following day, again as noted by Flaux J at [62], a letter was sent by the General Directorate of State Security to Mr Al Zarouni, Assistant Public Prosecutor, in relation to the receipt of bribes by Mr Marooj, who was then arrested either the same day or the following day. As for Mr Fitzwilliam, he explained in his witness statement that, though he was unaware of it at the time, an arrest warrant had been issued in respect of him on 9 April 2008. That arrest warrant was valid for only seven days, and so had expired by the time that he came to be arrested in early June 2008. Be that as it may, as Mr Fitzwilliam went on to explain, immediately after his arrest he was interviewed for five hours, before being held incommunicado in state security cells for 10 days. He thought that, as he put it in his witness statement, his arrest <span style="font-style:italic">“was just another Arab mess up that would resolve itself as the police and prosecutor learned more of the facts”</span> but that, when he <span style="font-style:italic">“saw the false evidence being produced against me sometime later”</span>, he<span style="font-style:italic"> “realised someone wanted me to be kept in prison”</span>. Explaining that<span style="font-style:italic"> “Dubai is not a western democracy, governed by the rule of law, with an independent judiciary or legal system”</span> but <span style="font-style:italic">“is an emirate governed by the Emir … who holds absolute power and rules largely through members of his family and chosen functionaries”</span>, he went on to express the view that the <span style="font-style:italic">“almost immediate service of the breach notice on Plantation fitted exactly with the decision taken very high up in the state”</span>. Specifically, Mr Fitzwilliam went on in paragraphs 70 to 72 to say this:</p>
	  </content>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“… It has to be appreciated that all of the bodies involved, the FAD, the Bank, public prosecutor, the state police, or reported to the same person, the Sheikh’s placement, Al Shaibani. … The issue is not whether there might be a document supporting the allegation that the Bank sought my arrest rather than the FAD or the public prosecutor. None of these bodies act independently. They are all part of the same state apparatus reporting to Al Shaibani and ultimately the Emir. In this respect it has to be understood that the stiff sentences handed out to Ridley, Cornelius and the corrupt bank officials reflected the fact that they had stolen from an organ of the state and therefore effectively the Emir himself. That is how things are understood in the Gulf. Seems to be simply fanciful to suggest that the breach notice was ‘co-incidentally’ served at the same time as I was arrested. It is plain and obvious that they were part of a scheme organised from the highest echelons of the Emirate to punish those who had betrayed Dubai by engaging in the original fraud and then being party to an agreement which sought to provide a smokescreen for the guilty.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">During the course of cross-examination, Mr Fitzwilliam added that, as he was being interviewed post-arrest, he was told that <span style="font-style:italic">“If you sort this with the bank, it will all go away”</span>. It is, in short, Mr Fitzwilliam’s strongly held opinion that DIB was behind his arrest and that his arrest was part and parcel of a strategy which involved the service of a default notice on 9 June 2008 followed, ultimately, by the taking of the assignment in mid-July 2008. More specifically, Plantation’s case is that, after Mr Al Shaibani became DIB’s non-executive Chairman in early March 2008, there was a change in DIB’s attitude brought about by his taking the view that Mr Fitzwilliam (along with Mr Ridley and Mr Cornelius and others) had defrauded DIB. It is then said that Mr Al Shaibani, through his position in the government of Dubai, was able to bring about the arrest and prosecution of Mr Fitzwilliam (and the others) in order to enable DIB to seize the Project.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This same contention was put forward in the trial which took place before Flaux J. His conclusion was that DIB did not procure Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest and that if any party did so it was the FAD. Specifically, Flaux J summarised his conclusion at [93] as follows:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“My overall conclusion in relation to the arrests and prosecutions is as follows. The overwhelming weight of the documentary evidence, confirmed by the evidence of Lt. Col. Belhaul to the Public Prosecutor, is that it was the FAD and Dubai State Security (not the Bank) which provided the report and file to the public prosecutor setting out the results of the investigation which the FAD had been conducting since the autumn of 2007. In other words, to the extent that anyone other than the Public Prosecutor's office itself procured the arrests, it was the FAD, not the Bank. In due course, based on the investigation the FAD had conducted, prosecutions of those individuals ensued.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In his witness statement Mr Fitzwilliam criticised this conclusion as having <span style="font-style:italic">“missed the point”</span>. In his submissions, Mr Cakebread similarly criticised Flaux J’s conclusion. He made the point, in particular, that Flaux J did not have certain documents before him which were before me. Mr Cakebread additionally highlighted events in the immediate lead-up to Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest which, he suggested, pointed to there having been <span style="font-style:italic">“heightened activity”</span> within DIB which is consistent with DIB knowing that Mr Fitzwilliam was about to be arrested. These events, suggested Mr Cakebread, particularly when viewed alongside a consideration of what Al Tamimi had been asked by DIB at the time to do, point strongly towards DIB not only procuring Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest but engineering a situation where DIB could take over the Project. Specifically, it was Mr Cakebread’s submission that, even if Mr Fitzwilliam did not have the conversation with Mr Kamal in which Mr Fitzwilliam stated that he was going to be travelling to the UK to close the Chescor deal, DIB should be regarded as having knowledge of Mr Fitzwilliam’s imminent arrest. Mr Cakebread, furthermore, pointed to subsequent events as demonstrating what Mr Cakebread described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the close relationship between the Bank, the Diwan and the prosecutor”</span> as well as <span style="font-style:italic">“the ruthless attitude adopted by the Bank towards [Mr Fitzwilliam], [Ms Sutherland] and Plantation and others which are perceived to be a threat to water have caused damage to it”</span>. In this last respect, Mr Cakebread placed particular significance on the evidence which was given by Mr Ilahi. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These are all matters which I come on now to address. As I shall explain, I cannot accept the case which has been advanced on Plantation’s behalf. There are a number of reasons for this. First, there is the position of Mr Al Shaibani, who was described by Mr Cakebread in closing as having been <span style="font-style:italic">“tasked with cleaning up the Augean stables” </span>which was the RSA. Although I make it clear that I have not in any sense regarded myself as bound by any of the conclusions which were reached by Flaux J since Plantation was not a party to the earlier proceedings, nonetheless I agree with Flaux J when he stated in his judgment at [49] that there is no evidence that Mr Al Shaibani <span style="font-style:italic">“concerned himself with the day to day running of the Bank, including the administration of the RSA, which is not surprising for a non-executive chairman”</span>. Furthermore, again as noted by Flaux J, <span style="font-style:italic">“there is simply no evidence that, as Chairman of the Bank he influenced the course of an investigation by the FAD into the CCH fraud and the payment of bribes to Bank employees, which had clearly begun before he returned from London and became Chairman”</span>. As Mr Anderson QC pointed out in closing, Mr Kamal’s evidence was that he was not aware of Mr Al Shaibani having any direct involvement in DIB. Furthermore, Mr Kamal explained very clearly, when asked about the involvement of the Dubai government in the running of DIB, that DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“was managed totally independently</span>”. He explained, in particular, that there <span style="font-style:italic">“was a board and the bank management reported to the board, so there was no direction, let me say that, from the government towards Dubai of what to do and what not to do”</span>. It was, he clarified, <span style="font-style:italic">“entirely for the executive management to develop the business plans, execute them, and report to the board on the general items that are reported as and when they were due”</span>. As far as Mr Kamal (who no longer works for DIB) was concerned, DIB operated <span style="font-style:italic">“as an independent entity since the day I joined until the day I left”</span>. Mr Al Sharif gave evidence to the same effect, drawing a clear “<span style="font-style:italic">distinction between the board of directors and the executive management”</span> and explaining that day today management was the responsibility of a Mr Al Kamda, the Group Managing Director (alternatively known as the CEO), in the relevant period in 2008. There is, in truth, nothing to demonstrate that Mr Al Shaibani, in his lofty position as DIB’s non-executive Chairman and as man who apparently has many other non-DIB related activities within Dubai, involved himself in management issues. As will appear, he did obviously perform functions such as the signing of resolutions, but it does not follow from this type of activity that he would have been engaged in RSA-related matters as Mr Cakebread suggested. As Mr Anderson QC submitted, Plantation’s case assumes that Mr Al Shaibani must have known about the RSA in not insignificant detail, yet there is no indication that this was the case. Nor, indeed, was this even suggested to DIB’s various witnesses. Furthermore, again as pointed out by Mr Anderson QC, the RSA and the misuse of DIB’s funds which led to it, whilst involving substantial sums of money, needs to be seen in the context of a bank whose balance sheet for the year to 31 December 2006 shows total assets of US$64.4 billion and shareholders’ equity of US$8.1 billion. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, although this point is linked to the role played by Mr Al Shaibani, Mr Cakebread emphasised what he described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“change of management”</span> at DIB needs to be viewed alongside what he called the disbandment of the Project Stallion Task Force and the formation of the new Task Force in about April 2008. Mr Cakebread highlighted, in particular, the introduction of Mr Shomali, DIB’s Head of Collections, as a member of the Task Force, pointing to Mr Kamal’s evidence that Mr Shomali was in charge of <span style="font-style:italic">“special accounts”</span>, namely <span style="font-style:italic">“accounts where the bank had problems collecting the debts”</span>, and that in this role Mr Shomali <span style="font-style:italic">“would interact with the relevant authorities, with the court, the lawyers, and negotiate with obligors to reach a settlement arrangement with the bank and pull off implementation of these arrangements”</span>. This, Mr Cakebread suggested, indicates that there was, therefore, <span style="font-style:italic">“a move from implementing the RSA and working in partnership with Plantation to build out the project”</span> to a stance which involved <span style="font-style:italic">“taking aggressive enforcement action against it, and other parties”</span>. There are a number of difficulties with this suggestion, however. First, as Mr Lyons explained during examination-in-chief, the original Project Stallion Task Force, which had been set up pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">“Resolution No. 31 for the year 2007”</span>, the document signed by Dr Muhammad Khalfan bin Khirbash on 6 November 2007, had on it seven or eight people, two of whom left DIB at the end of that year (2007), one of whom left no later than March 2008 and two of whom left during the summer of 2008. It is obvious, therefore, that the Task Force needed new members and this, Mr Lyons explained, is why its membership changed in April 2008 to include, alongside Mr Shomali, Mr Abdullah Al Hamli (as Chairman), Mr Fahad bin Fahd and Mr Al Sharif. The fact that, as both Mr Lyons and Mr Waugh explained in their evidence, instructions thereafter (including in the case of Mr Waugh the instructions to send the default notice on 9 June 2008) came from Mr Shomali is neither sinister nor surprising. Somebody had to give such instructions and, as DIB’s Head of Collections, Mr Shomali was probably the most suitable person to do so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cakebread’s point, however, goes further since it is not confined to the membership of the Task Force but importantly covers also its remit. In this context, Mr Cakebread relied heavily during the course of Mr Al Sharif’s cross-examination on a document which appeared in the chronological trial bundles either at the end of March 2008 or the beginning of April 2008.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Cakebread highlighted the references to <span style="font-style:italic">“the CCH indebtedness recovery case” </span>and to management, continued development and operation of the Project Plantation land and project, manage, continue developing<span style="font-style:italic"> “as deemed necessary” </span>or<span style="font-style:italic"> “required”</span>. He contrasted these references with what appeared in the resolution setting up the ‘Project Stallion Task Force’ dated 6 November 2007. That earlier resolution did not contain such references. Mr Cakebread put to Mr Al Sharif that this document was, indeed, a document which dated from April 2008. Mr Cakebread did, however, inform Mr Al Sharif of the fact that DIB’s position was the document came later, specifically in November 2008. Mr Cakebread asked Mr Al Sharif whether the document was <span style="font-style:italic">“a fair recollection of the task that the Task Force was set in April 2008”</span>. Mr Al Sharif’s answer was that it was, something which he repeated in answer to a question which I put to him immediately after he gave his first answer. In such circumstances, Mr Cakebread submitted that, whether the document dates from April 2008 or November 2008, the role of the ‘Project Stallion Task Force’ in April 2008 onwards had changed from the role described in the 6 November 2007 resolution signed by Mr Al Shaibani’s predecessor. I agree with Mr Anderson QC, however, that, in the circumstances, given the uncertainty over the dating of the document, Mr Al Sharif’s evidence provides only slender support for Mr Cakebread’s submission. It is clear to me that Mr Anderson QC must be right when he suggested that the document is a November 2008 document and not a document which came into being in April 2008. Mr Anderson QC was able in this regard to refer to an email dated 25 November 2008 which Mr Shomali sent to his fellow Task Force members and in which he referred to the Word attachment as being <span style="font-style:italic">“the revised mandate after taking out the power of development”</span>, asking for <span style="font-style:italic">“your views on the same”</span>. Although the attachment did not appear in the trial bundles next to this email, it is tolerably clear that the document to which Mr Al Sharif was taken by Mr Cakebread in cross-examination is the attachment to that email. Mr Cakebread submitted that, even if that were the case, there must have been an earlier resolution which had <span style="font-style:italic">“the power of development”</span> in it, suggesting that that earlier resolution, which has not been disclosed by DIB, would show that the mandate of the Task Force must at an earlier stage have changed in the manner set out in the document which he put to Mr Al Sharif. I do not agree. It seems to me likely that in his email on 25 November 2008 Mr Shomali was referring to a draft resolution which contained the <span style="font-style:italic">“power of development”</span> rather than to an actual resolution post-dating the original resolution dated 6 November 2007 and pre-dating a later resolution made in late November 2008. There is nothing to indicate that the Task Force was as early as April 2008 set on taking over the Project. On the contrary, DIB was at that stage engaging with Plantation in relation to the US$50 million facility. This is not something which is consistent with a decision having by then been made to take over. The resolution which Mr Cakebread put to Mr Al Sharif is much more consistent with having coming into being after DIB took over physical possession of the Project, which happened on 4 November 2008, than with having pre-dated that event by some six months or so. In any event, I agree with Mr Anderson QC when he submitted in closing that Mr Al Sharif can have had no cause to consider the evolution of the Task Force’s mandate over time for many years and, as such, it is doubtful that he can now remember the precise chronology. Accordingly, I place no weight on the answers which Mr Al Sharif gave in this regard. I am quite clear, in short, that when Mr Al Shaibani took over from Dr bin Khirbash in the spring of 2008 there was no change to the remit of the Task Force at that stage, and that the remit only changed towards the end of 2008. Although it is right to acknowledge that no resolution has been produced which records the appointment of new members to the Task Force in about April 2008, including Mr Shomali, which might suggest that the undated resolution relied upon by Mr Cakebread should be treated as dating from that time rather than from November 2008, I consider the likely explanation for this is that either there was no other resolution in about April 2008 at all, on the basis that there was no need for a resolution dealing only with appointment of members of the Task Force, or that there was a resolution which was confined to the appointment of new members and the reason why the resolution which was put by Mr Cakebread to Mr Al Sharif listed the membership of the Task Force was because it made sense to do so given that the Task Force’s remit was changing. In my view, it does not follow from the fact that the only resolution listing the new members of the Task Force deals also with the new remit of the Task Force that the resolution must have been made in about April 2008 rather than in November that year.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Mr Cakebread relied upon the role which was played by Al Tamimi. It was Mr Cakebread’s submission that Mr Al Shaibani’s arrival as Dr bin Khirbash’s successor coincided with a change in the nature of the instructions given by DIB to Al Tamimi. The submission was essentially wrapped up with Mr Cakebread’s cleaning up the ‘Augean stables’ submission to which I have previously referred. There is, in fact, no dispute that Al Tamimi were instructed in circumstances where DIB was concerned about whether the various RSA obligations would be performed, and that Al Tamimi were instructed to look for loopholes in the RSA in the sense of areas where there was default by parties other than Mr Cornelius, Mr Ridley and Mr Nil. Specifically, as Mr Waugh explained in his witness statement, Al Tamimi’s <span style="font-style:italic">“job was to assist senior management of the Bank to understand the terms of the RSA and, more particularly, to assist with signing and perfection of local security which had not been implemented as agreed by the parties to the RSA”</span>. He clarified during the course of cross-examination that, the RSA having been put together by Lovells on behalf of DIB, and there having been <span style="font-style:italic">“changes within the bank”</span> (clearly a reference to the arrival of Mr Al Shaimani), he understood that DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“wanted a local law firm to give them a fresh view on the RSA”</span>. As he went on to explain, <span style="font-style:italic">“culturally many clients in the Middle East get comfort from dealing with Arabs or Emiratis as is the case, and in this case they wanted a fresh pair of eyes and essentially a second opinion”</span>. This included giving <span style="font-style:italic">“personnel within the bank that weren’t familiar with the RSA … a summary of key terms”</span>. This Al Tamimi did, explaining that <span style="font-style:italic">“at a certain point in time I believe Nidal [Shomali] raised with us the issue that they hadn’t received any repayment proceeds from the sales, and asked us to look at the RSA in that respect”</span>. Mr Cakebread went on during the course of cross-examination to explore with Mr Waugh what he knew about particular breaches of the RSA, specifically those which came to be identified in the letter dated 9 June 2008 which he drafted on DIB’s behalf. The short point, in essence, was that Mr Waugh was reliant on what he was told by Mr Shomali in particular as to whether, for example, Plantation (as opposed to Mr Fitzwilliam) had registered for Law No. 8 of 2007 purposes. Mr Cakebread suggested that this was somehow odd, but I do not agree since it seems to me that it must commonly be the case that a lawyer in the position of Mr Waugh relies upon what his client tells him. In terms of timing, Mr Cakebread put to Mr Waugh that the focus moved on from summarising the terms of the RSA to looking at the question of whether the RSA had been complied with by the parties to it in about mid-May 2008. This appears likely given that on 11 May 2008 Al Tamimi (specifically Mr Waugh’s partner, Mr Khalid Al Hamrani) were included amongst a list of recipients of an email from Mr Khaled Al Kamda at DIB. The first addressee of this email was Mr Shomali and it was, indeed, an email to him from Mr Bitar which was forwarded by Mr Kamda. That email attached <span style="font-style:italic">“the progress reports on plantation in Bahrain projects”</span> which Mr Shomali had asked Mr Bitar to send him. Mr Kamda stated in his email to Mr Hamrani and the others that <span style="font-style:italic">“It is clear from the report that there are [sic] pressure from Dubailand on the owner, we need to move quickly to protect the bank’s interests”</span>. The report which Mr Bitar had sent Mr Shomali, and which was forwarded by Mr Kamda, set out details in relation to progress on the Project, focusing mainly on the requirements for the standby loan facility and Plantation’s compliance with those requirements. At the end, under <span style="font-style:italic">“Other Issues”</span>, the following was stated:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cakebread submitted that Al Tamimi’s instructions thereby entailed what he described as an inexplicable expansion to include consideration of breach of the RSA on part of Plantation. I struggle to see, however, that this is an appropriate characterisation of the position. Al Tamimi were simply doing what lawyers typically do, which is to advise their clients as to their legal entitlements. DIB had entered into the RSA and had since developed concerns not only as to whether the obligations which it was owed under the RSA would be performed but as to the circumstances of the fraudulent behaviour which had led to the RSA in the first place. As the progress report to which I have referred illustrates, however, since it was primarily concerned with Plantation’s ability to comply with the standby loan facility requirements, at this stage DIB was apparently focused not on taking over the Project but on working with Plantation to make the Project a success. In short, I reject the submission that Al Tamimi’s involvement at this juncture is consistent with DIB having determined to extricate itself from the RSA. Flaux J dealt with a similar submission in his judgment at [56] and [57], saying this:</p>

Mr Al Hamrani thought those instructions were in November 2007 but I consider he must be wrong about that and prefer the evidence of his partner Mr Jody Waugh that the firm were instructed in May 2008. Mr Mallin sought to portray this as somehow sinister, supporting a case that the Bank was seeking to get out of the RSA and not honour it. I do not see the instruction of Al Tamini [sic] to look for loopholes in the RSA as in any sense sinister. It is perfectly normal for commercial parties to seek legal advice on ways of extricating themselves from contracts that, for whatever reason, have become disadvantageous, not by breaching the contract but by seeking advice on whether there has been a breach by the other party. </span>

Far from that being a breach of the RSA, that is the Bank relying upon the provisions of the RSA intended to give it protection, if there was a default under the RSA by the other parties to it.”</span>

I agree with Mr Anderson QC that the Bank was prepared to and did offer Plantation and Mr Fitzwilliam the Standby Loan Facility and the allegation that there was a repudiatory breach of the RSA by the Bank in failing to lend to Plantation is unsustainable. To begin with, since under clause 11.1 of the RSA, provision of the Standby Loan Facility was always subject to such consideration, based on due diligence of the Plantation Project, as a commercially reasonable lender would be expected to have, there was no obligation on the Bank to lend to Plantation. In fact, pending formal financing being put in place, in February 2008 the Bank agreed to purchase one of the Plantation Villa plots for AED12 million in order to tide Plantation over and make funds available to pay contractors and staff. The Bank was under no contractual obligation to make that purchase.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, although this point leads on from the last matter, as to the <span style="font-style:italic">“heightened activity”</span> which Mr Cakebread suggested immediately preceded Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest, reliance was placed on various exchanges within DIB involving Mr Shomali and Mr Nemer Khalifa in early June 2008 before Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest on 6 June 2008. Specifically, Mr Cakebread highlighted how on 1 June 2008 Mr Khalifa sent Mr Shomali <span style="font-style:italic">“the last updated study for Plantation”</span> which consisted of details concerning villa plots sales and budget figures, and that later the same day Mr Khalifa forwarded an email which he had received from Ms Sutherland on 28 May 2008 in which she had set out details of the <span style="font-style:italic">“final payment plan”</span> which had been agreed with Dubailand/Tatweer concerning the electrical substation issue. The next day, Mr Cakebread pointed out, Mr Khalifa forwarded an even earlier email from Ms Sutherland which had been sent to him on 26 March 2008. The attachment to that email was an earlier version of the financial information which Mr Shomali had been sent the previous day by Mr Khalifa. As such, Mr Cakebread observed, Mr Shomali would have been able to compare the two versions. Then, on 3 June 2008, replying to Mr Khalifa’s email in which he forwarded Ms Sutherland’s 28 May 2008 email, Mr Shomali noted that <span style="font-style:italic">“there is a substantial amount due from Arthur on the 30</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as per the below payment schedule”</span> and wondering <span style="font-style:italic">“what would be sources of repayment”</span> before asking <span style="font-style:italic">“can we know if more plots has [sic] been sold recently, this is the only source I can think of!”</span>. Two days later, on 5 June 2008, the day before Mr Fitzwilliam was arrested, Mr Khalifa asked Ms Sutherland if she would send him <span style="font-style:italic">“copies of the sale contracts related to the sold Residential plots in Plantation to date”</span>. Ms Sutherland responded stating that <span style="font-style:italic">“we have sent them to the bank at least twice before”</span> and adding that <span style="font-style:italic">“If you can’t locate then let me know”</span>. That same day, apparently after a telephone conversation, Mr Khalifa sent Mr Shomali a schedule detailing villa plots sales in the format which had previously been used by Ms Sutherland but adding calculations which Mr Khalifa had performed <span style="font-style:italic">“according to your instructions”</span>, namely converting AED figures into US$ figures and then deducting US$150,000 per month so as to arrive at <span style="font-style:italic">“Amounts to be Received from Sales After deducting”</span> that monthly amount. It was Mr Cakebread’s submission that this level of activity within DIB, in particular because it involved Mr Shomali as the Head of Collections and a prominent member of the Task Force, strongly points to DIB knowing that Mr Fitzwilliam was about to be arrested. I disagree. There is no suggestion in the exchanges that that is knowledge which Mr Shomali possessed. It seems to me that the exchanges are consistent simply with DIB gearing up to send, through Al Tamimi, the notice which was ultimately sent on 9 June 2008. This explains also why there was, as Mr Cakebread, characterised it, <span style="font-style:italic">“heightened activity”</span> on 9 June 2008 itself. DIB and Mr Shomali in particular were getting ready to send that notice. The fact, therefore, that Mr Cakebread is able to point to a number of exchanges on 9 June 2008 is hardly surprising. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I fail to see how the sending of this notice can sensibly be thought to support the proposition that DIB procured Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest, which leads me to a fifth point. In his evidence Mr Fitzwilliam sought to make much of the timing of the arrest as indicating DIB’s involvement in it. The timing needs, of course, to be taken into account. I can quite understand that when Mr Fitzwilliam learned about the notice which DIB sent to Plantation on 9 June 2008, he would obviously have noted that this was very shortly after he had been arrested. On analysis, however, as Mr Anderson QC submitted, it is difficult to see why DIB would have wanted Mr Fitzwilliam to have been arrested when he was or, indeed, at all. Certainly on the basis of Mr Fitzwilliam’s evidence, and that given by Mr Bacon, namely that DIB (specifically Mr Kamal) knew that Mr Fitzwilliam was going to be travelling to the UK to finalise the deal with Chescor (whether or not Chescor’s identity was known which I did not understand it to be suggested was the case), for DIB to have taken action to have Mr Fitzwilliam arrested at this particular time would have been a most curious thing to have done. If that deal, involving Mr Fitzwilliam reaping as much as US$600 million, had come about, it would surely only have been a good thing as far as DIB was concerned. Even leaving aside the Chescor deal, however, the evidence in relation to which after all I have rejected, there is another reason why I consider it distinctly unlikely that DIB knew, in advance, that Mr Fitzwilliam was about to be arrested, still less that DIB wanted him arrested, which is that, as Mr Anderson QC submitted, if DIB really had been attempting to procure an RSA default on the part of Plantation, it would have made much more sense for DIB to ensure that Mr Fitzwilliam was arrested sooner than he was. Again, I find myself in agreement with Flaux J on these matters. He said this in his judgment at [86] and [87]:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“There are other matters which also point away from the Bank having procured the arrest of Mr Fitzwilliam. To begin with, if the Bank had really known that he was on the way to London to sell a shareholding in Plantation for US$600 million, the inference that the defendants invite the Court to draw that the Bank then decided to thwart that sale by having Mr Fitzwilliam arrested, apparently so that the Bank could enforce against Plantation, makes absolutely no commercial sense. That is all the more so given that, at the end of May 2008, only days before the arrest, as is clear from the correspondence between Mr Taylor and Al Tamini [sic] confirmed by Mr Taylor's own evidence, the Bank was indicating an unwillingness to talk to the second and third defendants, unless there was a proposal for repayment of the outstanding Rescheduling Amount. If Mr Fitzwilliam's evidence about the US$600 million were true, it is inconceivable that the Bank would not have seized on that whole heartedly, as a means of obtaining complete repayment of the outstanding amount quickly. The Bank would hardly have preferred having Mr Fitzwilliam arrested in order to enforce against Plantation, the sale of which might take some time in circumstances where, since the RSA is governed by English law, any sale proceeds in excess of the outstanding Rescheduling Amount would be payable to Plantation anyway.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Furthermore, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out, internally the Bank was still considering the documentation required to progress the Standby Loan Facility to Plantation as late as 4 June 2008, which is hardly consistent with a desire on the part of the Bank to get out of its obligations under the RSA by having Mr Fitzwilliam arrested. As Mr Anderson QC said and I have already noted, if these arrests were all part of some overall plan on the part of the Bank to get its hands on the ultimate prize of the Plantation land, as the defendants suggest, and the arrest of Mr Fitzwilliam was part of that plan in order to ensure that there was default by Plantation, the Bank would surely have procured his arrest first before the second and third defendants or, at least, before serving the first cure notice, lest he try to leave Dubai without passing through the airport.”</span>

The suggestion, in the circumstances, that it was only because Mr Al Shaibani took over from Dr bin Khirbash in March 2008 that the RSA came under scrutiny cannot be right. As Mr Lyons explained, the FAD was deeply suspicious of the RSA. Since, as I have already explained, the FAD was under a statutory obligation to pass information to the public prosecutor, whatever role DIB might have played in relation to the arrest of Mr Fitzwilliam and the others, the public prosecutor was always going to be involved if the FAD unearthed anything which the FAD regarded as necessary to disclose to the public prosecutor.</p>

This refers to the second defendant’s arrest and states that that day they had received a file from the General Directorate of State Security at Police Headquarters relating to three individuals accused of fraud, the second, third and fourth defendants [Mr Cornelius, Mr Ridley and Mr Nil].

Nothing in the Minute suggests that it was the Bank, as opposed to the FAD and the police, which conducted the investigation or decided to arrest the second defendant. The reference to the case file ‘concerning a complaint by the Bank’ is consistent with the Bank being the victim of the fraud and therefore, in one sense, the complainant, but it does not begin to demonstrate that the Bank was actively seeking the arrests.”  </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Flaux J went on to deal with various other matters relied upon by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley in support of their contention that DIB was behind their arrests and, indeed, the arrest of Mr Fitzwilliam. These included so-called ‘cash for freedom’ negotiations which followed the arrests of Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley: see the judgment at [75] to [84] in which Flaux J concluded that the negotiations did not support the contention that DIB procured the arrests. These negotiations were not relied upon by Mr Cakebread before me. Therefore, I need say nothing about them. There are, however, two further matters which are relied upon by Mr Cakebread and which were also prayed in aid by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley before Flaux J. I deal with these before coming on to address Mr Cakebread’s heavy reliance on a particular document which was not before Flaux J. First, Mr Cakebread points out that the arrest warrant under which Mr Fitzwilliam was arrested on 6 June 2008 and which had, in fact, expired by the time that it came to be executed, had been issued in the sense that it was sent by the Public Prosecutor, Mr Al Zarouni, to Bur Dubai Police Station, two months previously on 9 April 2008. Mr Cakebread submitted that the fact that the warrant, described as a<span style="font-style:italic"> “Provisional Confinement Order”</span>, coincided with Mr Al Shaibani taking over from Dr bin Khirbash is significant, allied also with the change to the remit of the Task Force which Mr Cakebread contended came about at the same time. I cannot accept these submissions. I have previously dealt with the changing remit point. It follows that this does not assist Mr Cakebread’s argument. In addition, contrary to what Mr Cakebread went on to submit, it is clear, again as I have previously explained, that the FAD had already been investigating matters for several months by this stage. Mr Cakebread’s suggestion, therefore, that the arrest warrant cannot have had anything to do with the FAD’s investigations is simply not tenable. Flaux J addressed a similar submission in his judgment at [88] where he said this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“Mr Mallin sought to address that point by referring to the fact that there seems to have been a Preventative Detention Order directed to the police to detain Mr Fitzwilliam for the period 9 to 15 April 2008, on charges of fraud and appropriation of others’ money, although he was not detained in that period (this apparently tying in with Mr Fitzwilliam's own assertion that he was eventually arrested on an expired warrant). Mr Mallin submitted that this demonstrated that the Bank had sought to have Mr Fitzwilliam arrested in April 2008, in other words before the second and third defendants. In my judgment it demonstrates nothing of the sort. The Preventative Detention Order is issued by the Public Prosecutor's office which ties in with the other evidence that it was the Dubai public authorities and, specifically, the FAD and the Public Prosecutor who were looking to arrest and prosecute Mr Fitzwilliam. Furthermore, the suggestion that the Bank was looking to arrest Mr Fitzwilliam on 9 April 2008 makes no sense at all, given that the letter offering the Standby Loan Facility for the equivalent of US$50 million was issued to Plantation on 13 April 2008.”</span>

In any event, even taking the certificate at face value, if the Bank filed this criminal complaint on 1 June 2008, that can hardly have led to the arrests which occurred prior to that, on 21 and 27 May 2008. Next, the complaint number 12042/2008 is not a complaint filed by the Bank but the criminal complaint referred by the FAD to the Public Prosecutor, as stated in Mr Amiri’s letter.”</span>

The response was that <span style="font-style:italic">“there are no copies of the complaint filing form available”</span> and so <span style="font-style:italic">“the request could not be satisfied”</span>. Mr Cakebread highlighted that it was not stated that no such complaint had ever been made, merely that a copy of the complaint was unavailable. Whatever the true position, however, seems to me that Mr Cakebread’s submissions place too great a reliance on references to a complaint having been made by DIB. As Flaux J put it in his judgment at [69], reference to DIB having made such a complaint is likely simply to reflect <span style="font-style:italic">“the fact that it was the Bank which was the victim of the fraud”</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Besides this certificate, Mr Cakebread relied very heavily on a certificate which was not before Flaux J and which he suggested DIB’s witnesses (specifically Mr Kamal and Mr Al Sharif) had accepted was accurate. This is a certificate dated 16 October 2012, and so pre-dating the certificate issued on 29 May 2013. Like that later certificate, as appears from the rubric at the end of it which mirrors what was stated in the other certificate, it was again issued by Mr Shareef <span style="font-style:italic">“on the accused lawyer’s request”</span>. Since the <span style="font-style:italic">“accused”</span> to which this certificate relates is Mr Fitzwilliam, it is to be assumed that the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">“lawyer’s request”</span> was made by a Dubai-based lawyer acting for Mr Fitzwilliam. That request has not, however, been disclosed. Nor has any explanation been given as to why the request was made. However, as Mr Anderson QC observed in closing, it appears quite possible that Mr Fitzwilliam’s lawyer’s purpose in seeking the certificate was to obtain proof that Mr Fitzwilliam had been acquitted of the charges which he had faced. It is hardly surprising that, in the circumstances, Mr Fitzwilliam would wish to have something officially recording the fact that he had been acquitted. Whatever the precise reason for the certificate being sought, Mr Cakebread relied upon it as proof that DIB had levelled a complaint against Mr Fitzwilliam on 1 June 2008, and so just five days before Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest. The certificate is in the following terms:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“Dubai Public Prosecution certifies that on 01-06-2008, Dubai Islamic Bank lodged crime report no. 9588/2008 Bur Dubai against Arthur Fitzwilliam Panayotis - a British national. The report was registered with Public Prosecution under number 12842/2008 (penal). On 27/04/2011, Dubai Court of First Instance ruled in the presence of the defendant that he was innocent of the charges made against him and dismissed the civil case brought against him on charges of participating in a crime, fraud, taking possession of others’ property and falsification of non-official documents. On 26/10/2011, the Appeal Court ruled in the presence of the defendant to accept the appeal in form and dismiss it in content, upholding the ruling that had been appealed against. On 26/12/2011, the Court of Cassation ruled to dismiss it and uphold the contested ruling. The case is still being tried at the Appeal Court, the next hearing being scheduled for 27/11/2012.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Although, as Mr Al Sharif confirmed in cross-examination, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of what was stated in this certificate, despite the fact that it was prepared by somebody (Mr Shareef) who was not himself actively involved in the underlying prosecution, to suggest as Mr Cakebread, in effect, did that Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest on 6 June 2008 was the result of DIB levelling a complaint on 1 June 2008 and had nothing to do with the on-going investigations carried out by the FAD is not a submission which I can accept. As I have explained, an arrest warrant was issued in respect of Mr Fitzwilliam almost 2 months previously, on 9 April 2008. That arrest warrant was, I have found, the consequence of the FAD’s investigations rather than anything which was done by DIB. Furthermore, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out in closing, the certificate’s reference to the report which was <span style="font-style:italic">“registered with Public Prosecution”</span> bore the number 12842/2008 which is the same case number to which Mr Amiri referred in his letter to the Public Prosecutor dated 15 June 2008. I agree with Mr Anderson QC, therefore, that the link between Mr Fitzwilliam’s prosecution and the activities of the FAD is very clear. Put another way, I do not agree with Mr Cakebread that it is possible to treat the FAD as having no role in Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest. On the contrary, like Flaux J, I am clear that it was the FAD rather than DIB which played the central such role.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Cakebread submitted that the speed with which this order was obtained suggests that DIB must have been instrumental in its having been sought. I see no basis for this suggestion. The application was made by the Director of the General Department of State Security at Dubai Police General Headquarters, not by DIB. The fact that, as Mr Cakebread observed, the order had the effect of safeguarding DIB’s position in circumstances where DIB had been defrauded by Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley and the monies which had been stolen from DIB had found their way into the Project, does not seem to me to justify the conclusion that it was DIB which was behind the arrests. Mr Cakebread in this context relied on the fact that the following month, when DIB took the steps which it did concerning the assignment of the Lease, Al Tamimi were able to secure the agreement of the Public Prosecutor that the order did not prevent the assignment without any apparent difficulty, relying for these purposes on certain exchanges between Dubailand and Al Tamimi on 15 and 17 July 2008 from which it is clear that such agreement was obtained albeit that the letter from the Public Prosecutor containing such agreement is no longer available. In my view, this does not of itself demonstrate that DIB was the instigator either of the freezing order/attachment or the various arrests. Indeed, it is to be noted that, when the point was raised by Dubailand in its letter dated 15 July 2008, the response of Al Tamimi the same day was to point out that they <span style="font-style:italic">“did not receive the copies of the letters from the Public Prosecution referred to as enclosures in your letter”</span>, which is somewhat surprising if DIB was really the prime mover in relation to the freezing order/attachment, and to make the point that, whilst they noted that the advice received by Dubailand was that the assignment was affected by the freezing order/attachment, nonetheless as far as they were concerned it did not prevent the assignment taking place. In short, the letter from Al Tamimi reads very much as though they, and so DIB also, had nothing to do with the seeking of the freezing order/attachment which was obtained. </p>

Mr Cakebread submitted that this email shows that DIB could even bypass the prosecution authorities when required. I disagree with Mr Cakebread about this. There is nothing to indicate that DIB was able to insist on the prosecution authorities taking particular action. Nor do I read Mr Shomali’s request to Mr Al Hamli as suggesting that Mr Al Hamli was in a position to interfere in steps or decisions taken by the prosecution authorities. As for the point concerning <span style="font-style:italic">“COD”</span>, this appears to be a reference to something internal to DIB and so it is not clear to me who it is suggested by Mr Cakebread was bypassed, but, in any event, my reading of the email (along with the thread to which it is a response) is that Mr Chua was, in effect, merely telling Mr Shomali that, as far as he was concerned, the notice from the Central Bank should be treated as applying to the escrow account set up by Plantation for the purposes of Law No. 8 of 2007, and not just the account set up in Plantation’s sole name.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cakebread went on to make various points concerning the way in which the freezing order/attachment was subsequently treated by DIB in relation, for example, to the steps which were taken to have the Project valued in late 2008 when no mention was made of the freezing order/attachment’s existence. Similarly reliance was placed by Mr Cakebread on Mr Shomali’s response to a question posed by the Central Bank asking whether DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“had the legal rights to sell or not”</span>, the response being that <span style="font-style:italic">“On the legal side of Plantation and our right to sell the answer is definitely YES but of course Dubai Land approval is required”</span>. Mr Cakebread made the point that that answer suggests that, as far as DIB is concerned, the freezing order/attachment was not an obstacle. Mr Waugh, when asked about the matter in cross-examination, agreed with Mr Cakebread that it ought to have been disclosed. Mr Cakebread relied also on the failure to mention it when engaged in discussions with Mirage Holdings, a prospective purchaser, in the early part of 2010, despite being sent, and answering, a series of very specific <span style="font-style:italic">“Legal &amp; Operational Questions”</span> which were concerned with disposal entitlements. Mr Cakebread also highlighted how DIB’s Group Internal Audit Department was not told that there was any impediment faced by DIB in dealing with the Lease, and nor was an impediment mentioned when Mr Shomali and Mr Ilahi discussed the contents of the audit report to be submitted in various exchanges between 23 and 30 March 2010. He relied, in particular, on the fact that, in answer to question 3 (<span style="font-style:italic">“If tomorrow Plantation is acquired fully, do the committee has [sic] any plan for the disposal of the investment in terms of further development or sell as it is?”</span>), Mr Shomali and Mr Ilahi answered that <span style="font-style:italic">“The bank prefers to sell as it is but due to current situation, we cannot find buyer”</span> without making any reference to the freezing order/attachment. Then, in answer to question 4 (<span style="font-style:italic">“At the time of acquisition of Plantation, whether there was any bank account in the name of company? If yes what is the status this money?…</span>), it was stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“DIB has acquired only Land from Dubailand and has not taken over the company. Assets &amp; Liabilities of the company or other properties of Arthur not acquired by DIB. All bank accounts of Plantation company blocked per court order”</span>. Again, there was no mention of any bar on DIB’s ability to deal with the Lease. In contrast, in answer to question 21 (<span style="font-style:italic">“Most of horses are getting old and their value is decreasing day by day. Have we officially requested the court to decide the case rapidly to avoid loss of value of assets due to delay as well as to reduce the cost of management?”</span>), the answer was: <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation assets, including horses were attached by Prosecution. We finally managed to obtain no objection from Prosecution to sell horses. Now waiting for a court order to do this”</span>. In relation to horses and Plantation’s assets, therefore, Mr Shomali and Mr Ilahi were pointing out that there were obstacles in terms of disposal. No such obstacle, in the form of the freezing order/attachment, was identified in respect of the Lease itself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cakebread suggested that, in circumstances where DIB did not apparently consider that there was any such obstacle, I should conclude that the freezing order/attachment was an invention on the part of DIB and that, in any event, if it did exist, it was only something which was obtained by DIB as part of the efforts which it was making in June 2008 to secure Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest and cause the Project the very real difficulties which ensued in the wake of that arrest. I reject these submissions: it is clear to me that the freezing order/attachment was obtained without DIB’s direct involvement and certainly not at its instigation, but instead at the instigation of the party which sought it, namely the General Department of State Security at Dubai Police General Headquarters. It is wholly implausible that the documentation showing its being sought and then granted is anything other than genuine. The exchanges between Al Tamimi and Dubailand on 15 and 17 July 2008 are, equally, only consistent with this. The fact that Mr Shomali and Mr Ilahi failed to make reference to it is explained by a point which was made by Mr Waugh during the course of cross-examination when Mr Cakebread was putting to him the absence of any mention of the freezing order/attachment when valuations were being sought. Mr Waugh explained that “<span style="font-style:italic">at the time we thought that if you mentioned to a valuer that the land can’t be transferred, it must means the valuation is redundant because they could never be a sale”</span> and, accordingly, <span style="font-style:italic">“there was, for the purpose of the valuation, it assumes that the attachment would be lifted and therefore allowing a sale subject to these provisions excluding the attachment”</span>. As he later clarified, therefore, <span style="font-style:italic">“the valuation was done on the basis of the bank would be to get that consent to lift it”</span>. Although Mr Waugh rightly acknowledged that there should have been reference made when dealing with the Central Bank as part of the audit process, I consider it likely that Mr Shomali and Mr Ilahi would have thought in a similar way when providing the information which they did. Mr Waugh made essentially this point in that context later on in his cross-examination. Although Mr Cakebread suggested that the reason why Mr Waugh spoke in terms of DIB being able to have the freezing order/attachment lifted is that it was DIB which had obtained it, it seems to me that all that Mr Waugh was really saying was that, for any valuation to be meaningful, the assumption to which he referred needed to be made, and not DIB would necessarily be able to have the freezing order/attachment lifted. When Mr Ilahi was cross-examined on these issues by Ms Levy, it is fair to say that there was an element of confusion in the answers which he gave. He was, however, adamant that he had not intended to mislead in his dealings with the Central Bank or as part of the audit process. I am clear that he was not intending to mislead at any point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Lastly, Mr Cakebread submitted that DIB’s involvement in Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest is supported by the <span style="font-style:italic">“ruthless attitude”</span> which, he suggested, can be seen to have been adopted by DIB on other occasions in relation to Plantation and those involved with it. This included reliance on an episode which involved DIB (through Al Tamimi) contemplating bringing a prosecution against Plantation, Mr Fitzwilliam and Ms Sutherland in respect of certain monies involving Dressage which it was wrongly suggested were received by them (as opposed to DIB), as demonstrated by a later email which Mr Ilahi sent Mr Shomali on 20 December 2008 and which clarified that the monies had been paid into the escrow account which had been set up with DIB. In particular, Ms Levy explored with Mr Ilahi at some length during the course of cross-examination the role which he played when he became involved with the Project after DIB took physical possession of the site. It was suggested to him that, contrary to the impression given in his evidence, he was involved in evidence gathering to assist in the criminal prosecution of Mr Fitzwilliam. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An example which was put to Mr Ilahi is an email which Mr Shomali sent to him on 12 November 2008. In that email, Mr Shomali asked Mr Ilahi to <span style="font-style:italic">“advise further what it [sic] the 4.8m transfer of debit balance to Arthur account”</span> entailed, specifically whether it meant <span style="font-style:italic">“that Arthur took this money personally and went to his personal account”</span>. This was in response to an email which Mr Ilahi had sent the day before in which he set out details of <span style="font-style:italic">“the Shareholders Account”</span>. Mr Ilahi was also taken to an email which he sent Mr Shomali on 23 November 2008, in which he set out details of various suppliers and contractors as well as consultants, and specifically what had been paid to them. He denied that this was at Mr Shomali’s request, explaining that he was merely helping the accountant whom the Diwan auditors had asked for such information. He explained that <span style="font-style:italic">“it was only just to help her to put it properly the way normally the Diwan auditors want”</span> and that the <span style="font-style:italic">“information was prepared by her completely from her own records”</span>. He insisted that Mr Shomali had not asked him to do this and that he had helped simply because he had <span style="font-style:italic">“a good understanding with the Diwan and I know how they want”</span>. He was clear that he <span style="font-style:italic">“was not assisting the Diwan”</span> but was <span style="font-style:italic">“just ensuring that the information which is going from plantation is proper information at the accountant was giving to them and in agreement with the books of accounts”</span>. In the same email he described as an <span style="font-style:italic">“Interesting Fact”</span> that <span style="font-style:italic">“Miss Leila (HR Head) had received commission on 7 June 08 (Dh. 100,000), 7 Sept 08 (Dh. 100,000) and 28 Sept 08 (Dh. 150,000)”</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although I consider that Mr Ilahi did somewhat downplay his role in assembling information which the Diwan, no doubt, would have found of assistance in its investigations, as illustrated, for example, by an email which he sent directly to a Mr Mustafa Hussain of the Diwan on 12 January 2009 setting out <span style="font-style:italic">“details of sales were plot numbers and contact details of buyers”</span>, nonetheless I reject the suggestion that what Mr Ilahi was doing, and was tasked by Mr Shomali to do, was to go out of his way to assist the Diwan and the prosecution authorities. Mr Ilahi clearly had to provide information if it was requested; he could hardly refuse such requests. As he put it later in his cross-examination, <span style="font-style:italic">“the thing is we were working with the Diwan auditors in such a way that we had to provide them whatever they ask, the information”</span>. He explained that he had no <span style="font-style:italic">“detailed knowledge”</span> of the CCH fraud or the cases which ensued from it <span style="font-style:italic">“because the bank has kept it very secret and confidential”</span>. I accept that evidence and, accordingly, reject the suggestion that the role played by Mr Ilahi and DIB involved a level of assistance to the Diwan and prosecution authorities which went beyond what might normally have been expected. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor do I accept the suggestion that DIB (and Mr Ilahi in particular) adopted an overly vindictive approach. Ms Levy put to Mr Ilahi a number of what she and Mr Cakebread themselves described in closing as <span style="font-style:italic">“trivial matters”</span>. One example concerned a client whom he had been told by a Plantation employee, as he reported to Mr Shomali in an email on 8 September 2009, had not paid for a saddle and bridle. Mr Ilahi asked that the police be informed. He explained that he was merely reporting the matter to his superior, Mr Shomali. I suspect that he was doing rather more than that, hence his apparent request that the case be reported to the police. However, even if that were the position, it does not seem to me to justify a conclusion that it was DIB which, through its ruthless attitude, procured Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest.</p>

The overwhelming weight of the documentary evidence, confirmed by the evidence of Lt. Col. Belhaul to the Public Prosecutor, is that it was the FAD and Dubai State Security (not the Bank) which provided the report and file to the public prosecutor setting out the results of the investigation which the FAD had been conducting since the autumn of 2007. In other words, to the extent that anyone other than the Public Prosecutor's office itself procured the arrests, it was the FAD, not the Bank. In due course, based on the investigation the FAD had conducted, prosecutions of those individuals ensued.</span>

Given that the Bank was under a positive duty under Law No. 3 of 2007 to report any wrongdoing it discovered to the FAD, it cannot be criticised even if, in doing so, it was motivated in part by its own commercial interests. This conclusion essentially flows from or is akin to the principle which Mr Anderson QC relied upon, that no term can be implied into the RSA that the Bank would not report any wrongdoing to the FAD if it was required to do so, since such an implied term would be illegal and contrary to public policy: see by analogy William Cory &amp; Son Ltd v London Corporation [1951] 2 KB 476 at 484 per Asquith LJ.”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“Both parties to a contract are taken to contract on the footing that they wish the contract to be performed, and accordingly must be taken to have agreed that neither will actively prevent performance. It is possible that the duty does not rest upon the implication of a term, but may be a positive rule of the law of contract that conduct of either the promisor or the promisee, which can be said to amount to himself of his own motion bringing about the impossibility of performance, is itself a breach of the contract. However, since ultimately the rule of law (if such it is) depends upon the intention of the parties, it is submitted that it may properly be categorised as an implied term. The essence of the prevention principle is that the promisee cannot insist upon the performance of an obligation which he has prevented the promisor from performing. The classic formulation of the implied term is that of Cockburn C.J. in Stirling v Maitland (1864) 5 B &amp; S 841: </span>

The claimants argue that it is an implied term of every, or almost every, contract between A and B (and certainly of this contract) that A shall not prevent or disable B from performing the contract and vice versa, and that this was just what the corporation did by the act in question. In general, no doubt, it is true that a term is necessarily implied in any contract whose other terms do not repel the implication, that neither party shall prevent the other from performing it, and that a party so preventing the other is guilty of a breach.</span>

This is, of course, the very point made by Flaux J in his judgment at [94] and it seems to me to be unanswerable. I agree, therefore, with Mr Anderson QC, that DIB cannot have been under any implied obligation <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to tell the prosecution authorities about wrongdoing which was suspected by DIB. If, therefore, DIB made a complaint concerning Mr Fitzwilliam, whether to the prosecution authorities or to the FAD, and, even if that complaint was the reason why Mr Fitzwilliam was arrested on 6 June 2008, this cannot properly be regarded as having been in breach of any implied obligation to which DIB was subject.</p>

This meeting took place at Clifford Chance’s offices. As Mr Waugh explained in his witness statement, its focus was on a request made by Plantation for <span style="font-style:italic">“further time to repay the debt owed to the Bank”</span>. No mention, Mr Waugh observed, was made of any deal under which Mr Fitzwilliam was to receive US$600 million for part of his interest in Plantation. Be that as it may, what happened next is that Mr Cornelius and Mr Ridley made an interim injunction application to the Commercial Court in London on the evening of (Sunday) 6 July 2008. They were concerned that the 15 business days which Plantation had been given in the notice served on 9 June 2008 to remedy the breaches which were alleged in that notice were about to expire. Their particular concern was that DIB would, therefore, imminently declare an Event of Default under clause 18.1 of the RSA. Simon J granted the interim relief sought, ordering that DIB should not exercise any rights under the notice given on 9 June 2008 until the return date (Wednesday, 9 July 2008). In the event, the <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> took place on Thursday, 10 July 2008 before Tomlinson J who reserved judgment until 14 July 2008. Flaux J summarised what happened at that hearing in his judgment at [118] to [120]:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“In the event, the return date was 10 July 2008, when the matter came before Tomlinson J. The second and third defendants (as claimants in those proceedings 2008 Folio 682) had issued a Claim Form seeking declarations (i) that the notice dated 9 June 2008 had not been properly served (a point on which they lost before Tomlinson J and which has not been pursued before me) and (ii) that there had been no breach of the RSA by them or Plantation entitling the Bank to declare an Event of Default. The Bank resisted the continuation of the injunction, filing witness statements from Mr Lyons and Mr Waugh. In his witness statement, Mr Waugh dealt with the suggestion in the evidence of Ms Caldicott that Plantation had not paid over the Plantation Villa Proceeds because the Bank was in breach of an obligation to lend money pursuant to a letter of intent sent to Mr Fitzwilliam on 19 August 2007. Mr Waugh pointed out that the Bank had in fact made the offer of the Standby Loan Facility in its letter of 19 April 2008 and that the reason no lending was made under that facility was because Plantation failed to comply with the conditions precedent, so that there was no foundation for any suggestion that the Bank was in breach of that agreement. He also pointed out that, even if the Bank were in breach of any lending obligation, that would not afford Plantation with a defence to its obligations under the RSA, including its payment obligations. </span>

Indeed, as recorded in Flaux J’s judgment after that trial at [6], less than a month before the trial began, Plantation made an application that its claim be heard at the same time as DIB’s claim. Flaux J refused that application on the basis that it was made too late and that it would be impossible for the trial of DIB’s claim to go ahead as planned if Plantation’s claim were to be tried at the same time. Plantation’s application to the Court of Appeal in relation to Flaux J’s refusal to accede to the joinder application failed. Accordingly, Plantation took no part in the trial before Flaux J. Subsequently, in February 2015, Teare J dismissed Plantation’s summary judgment application, and so the matter proceeded to trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I did not understand it ultimately to be in dispute between Mr Cakebread and Mr Anderson QC that Plantation’s case depends on its being able to establish that DIB had no entitlement, pursuant to clause 18.2 of the RSA, <span style="font-style:italic">“to exercise its rights under the Plantation Security”</span> (namely the Conditional Assignment) when it (through Al Tamimi) wrote to Dubailand on 14 July 2008 notifying Dubailand of <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> (again for clause 18.2 purposes) and shortly thereafter secured Dubailand’s acknowledgement of the effectiveness of the assignment. Clause 18.2, it will be recalled, provides that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Bank may not exercise its rights under the Plantation Security until the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>. It follows that the first question which I must determine, a question which goes to the liability of DIB, is whether, when DIB purported to <span style="font-style:italic">“exercise its rights”</span> in writing to Dubailand on 14 July 2008, there had by that stage been <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>. If the answer to this question is that there had been <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>, Plantation’s liability case must fail unless DIB is to be regarded as being precluded from relying upon such an occurrence through waiver or estoppel; if the answer is that there had not been <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>, Plantation will have established liability. In that event, however, a further question then arises, a causation question, namely whether there would have been <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> subsequently. If not, the last question which needs to be considered is what (if any) loss Plantation has suffered and so what damages are payable by DIB.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should explain that I have characterised Breach 1 as involving only a failure to pay monies to DIB despite the fact that in the 9 June 2008 letter the first of the breaches identified was (with the word <span style="font-style:italic">“or”</span> emphasised by me rather that in the original wording) that <span style="font-style:italic">“up to April 2008, in relation to the RSA Plots Plantation was required to deposit the aggregate amount of AED 14,738,815.30 with DIB in repayment of the Rescheduling Amount </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to be retained in the escrow account with DIB”</span>. This is because the alleged failure to pay monies into an escrow account is the express subject of Breach 3. It, therefore, avoids confusion to deal with matters in this way, although when I come on to address Breaches 1 and 3 I shall do so together precisely because of the overlap between them. I should mention in this regard that Mr Cakebread suggested that, in drafting the 9 June 2008 letter, Mr Waugh was seeking to advance two different contentions which were inconsistent with each other. This submission, however, overlooked the <span style="font-style:italic">“or”</span> which I have highlighted. Mr Waugh was clearly framing Breach 1 in two alternative ways, the latter of which finding its echo in Breach 3 which should, therefore, also be regarded as primarily an alternative alleged breach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That said, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out both in opening and in closing, there is what he described as <span style="font-style:italic">“a temporal point”</span> which arises in view of the manner in which Law No. 8 of 2007 came into operation. Specifically, as Mr Anderson QC explained in his opening submissions, were I to take the view that Law No. 8 of 2007 applied to villa plots sale receipts (contrary to the primary position adopted by DIB in these proceedings, if not contemporaneously) but that it only applied to monies received after 28 December 2007 (for reasons which I shall come on to explain) and that registration under Law No. 8 of 2007 was achieved by Plantation in March 2008, then, it would be open to me to conclude: that there was a breach of clause 7.2(d) in respect of the period before 28 December 2007; that between 28 December 2007 and March 2008, there was a breach of clause 16.1(f) because registration ought to have been effected by 28 December 2007; and that from 28 December 2007 onwards (including after March 2008) there was a breach of the RSA because proceeds from villa plots sales were not paid into an escrow account. This means that it is theoretically possible for Plantation by April 2008 to have been in breach of an obligation to pay monies to DIB as well as in breach of an obligation to pay monies into an escrow account.</p>

The same applies in relation to Breach 5, the breach which was not identified in that letter. Although ultimately whether Plantation was in breach in these various respects is a matter for me rather than through these DIB witnesses, it is nonetheless instructive to have regard to the position, as it were, ‘in real time’ and ‘on the ground’. That position is, in any event, relevant when considering the waiver/estoppel issues which arise.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to (a), it was Mr Cakebread’s submission that, having regard to commercial realities and so considering the approach to construction advocated by Lord Clarke in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</span> [2011] UKSC 50, [2011] 1 WLR 2900 at [14]-[30], the parties should not be taken as having intended that there was an obligation on the part of Plantation to make the payments described in clause 7.2(d) at a stage when the Project was still being developed since it was clearly understood that US$150,000 per month was not enough to fund the development costs which Plantation was incurring at the time that the RSA was entered into and would thereafter be incurring. Accordingly, Mr Cakebread submitted, <span style="font-style:italic">“clause 7.3 must have been intended to be the governing clause during the development phase”</span>. The difficulty with this argument is threefold. First, clause 7.2(d) does not seek to distinguish between development and post-development situations. Mr Cakebread’s distinction is not, therefore, readily apparent from the wording of the provision. Secondly, clause 7.2(d) has proviso-type wording (<span style="font-style:italic">“provided that such sum has been disbursed or committed to the purposes of the development of Plantation Project”</span>) which positively suggests that, contrary to Mr Cakebread’s submission, clause 7.2(d) applies to the development stage of the Project and not to the post-development stage. Thirdly, clause 7.3 is under a sub-heading which reads: <span style="font-style:italic">“Application of surplus Plantation Project and Pakistan Project cash”</span>. Although clause 2.2 of the RSA earlier states that the <span style="font-style:italic">“title of any provision of this Restructuring Agreement shall not affect the meaning of that or any other provision”</span>, this sub-heading serves as a useful pointer to what clause 7.3 is addressing, namely surplus cash generated by the Project as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Villa Proceeds”</span> which, as Flaux J put it in his judgment at [114], are “<span style="font-style:italic">ring fenced by clause 7.2(d)”</span>, in other words, the provision which expressly deals with <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Villa Proceeds”</span>, making it clear that any such proceeds in excess of US$150,000 per month must be paid to DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“in mandatory prepayment of the Rescheduling Amount”</span>. In effect, as Flaux J explained, “<span style="font-style:italic">only the first US$150,000 per month can be expended on working capital requirements [see clause 7.3(a)] for the development of the Project”</span>. Any other approach to clauses 7.2(d) and 7.3 would, I agree with Mr Anderson QC, mean that clause 7.2(d) was essentially a dead letter. There is nothing to suggest that clause 7.2(d) was intended to be read as somehow subject to clause 7.3. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the obligation to pay villa sale proceeds into an escrow account, in my view, there was such an obligation under the RSA albeit that it is not as obvious as it might have been. I say this for essentially two reasons. First, under clause 16.1(f) Plantation was under an obligation, described as a covenant, to <span style="font-style:italic">“obtain, observe and renew all such authorisations consents and licenses which are required in relation to its business”</span>. This would include, as I see it, compliance with Plantation’s obligations under Law No. 8 of 2007. Secondly, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out, once the RSA definitions in respect of <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Villa Proceeds”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">“Earmarked Plantation Proceeds”</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> “Escrow Proceeds”</span> are read into the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Villa Proceeds”</span> contained in clause 7.2(d), Plantation’s mandatory prepayment obligation becomes a requirement that it pay (ignoring any villa proceeds in respect of sales made prior to the Effective Date (2 October 2007):</p>

This is concerned with the applicability of the provisos contained in clause 18.1(a) of the RSA. It will be recalled that clause 18.1 is in a section of the RSA headed <span style="font-style:italic">“Events of Default and Enforcement Events”</span>, specifically under a sub-heading of <span style="font-style:italic">“Events”</span>. Sub-paragraph (a) is concerned with <span style="font-style:italic">“an Event of Default”</span> where <span style="font-style:italic">“any amount payable in respect of a Repayment Date is not paid in the manner and at the time provided in this Restructuring Agreement”. </span>This is a reference to Schedule 2 which, again it will be recalled, sets out details of payments which it was agreed would be made on particular dates expressed in each case as a number of days from the Effective Date. Translated into actual dates, taking the starting point (the Effective Date) as to October 2007, the payment obligations in Schedule 2 entailed the following: an obligation to pay US$25 million on 30 January 2008; an obligation to pay a further US$25 million on 29 May 2008; an obligation to pay US$70 million on 1 October 2008; an obligation to pay US$110 million on 2 October 2009; and an obligation to pay US$270 million on 2 October 2010.

The first proviso is, however, relevant. The reason why this is the case is that, again as has previously been set out, the RSA defines <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> as being a “<span style="font-style:italic">breach of the provisions of the following sub-paragraphs of clause 18.1(Events): sub-paragraph (a) and, where such breach is caused by the default of Plantation, sub-paragraphs (c) - (k), in the case of sub-paragraphs (a), (c) - (e) or (h) - (k) subject to the provisos at clause 18.1(a) (Events)”. </span>In short, not all <span style="font-style:italic">“Events of Default”</span> constitute a <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> or, put another way, there can be an <span style="font-style:italic">“Event of Default”</span> which is not a Plantation Enforcement Event. The reason why, in turn, this matters is that, as I have previously explained, clause 18.2 of the RSA only gives DIB the entitlement to <span style="font-style:italic">“exercise its rights under the Plantation Security”</span> if there has been <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>. Again, putting the matter differently, without <span style="font-style:italic">“the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>, DIB had no entitlement to do what it did on 14 July 2008 when Al Tamimi wrote to Dubailand. That, indeed, is what Flaux J decided in his judgment at [150] to [152], referring at [150] to the first of the clause 18.1(a) provisos and recording the submission made on Mr Cornelius’s and Mr Ridley’s behalf that<span style="font-style:italic"> “since, at that time in June 2008, they had paid more than 90% of what was due at the 2 June 2008 240 day Repayment Date under Schedule 2 (US$60.4 million having been paid when US$50 million was due), that proviso operated to exclude the occurrence of a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>.

He submits that the words: ‘subject to the provisos at clause 18.1(a)’ in the definition of Plantation Enforcement Event are intended to prevent the Bank from improperly characterising a payment default under clause 18.1(a) as a default under another sub-clause of clause 18.1 in order to bypass the protection afforded by the provisos to clause 18.1(a).”</span>

There is nothing inherently uncommercial in that. Furthermore, so far as Mr Anderson's point about cocking a snook at the RSA is concerned, the risk of that is more apparent than real, given that the breach of clause 7.2(d) by Plantation is an Event of Default under clause 18.1(d) for the reasons given in the previous section of the judgment. If that default remained unremedied (as it did in the present case), then under clause 18.4(a) the Bank would be entitled to serve a further notice accelerating the debt, the effect of which would be, inter alia, that a Plantation Enforcement Event had then occurred, for the reasons given in the next section of the judgment. </span>

Whilst it is certainly true, as Mr Mallin accepted, that the meaning of a contractual provision will yield to commercial common sense, it will not do so to the extent of rewriting the contract, which as I say would be what would be required to achieve Mr Anderson’s construction.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Anderson QC submitted that Flaux J was wrong about this matter. He made the point that, whilst the provisos which appear in clause 18.1(a) make obvious sense in relation to the payment obligation contained in that provision, they make rather less sense in relation to certain of the other clause 18.1 <span style="font-style:italic">“Events”</span> which are listed in the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> as being <span style="font-style:italic">“Events”</span> to which the provisos are applicable, specifically subparagraphs (c), (d), (e), (h), (i), (j) and (k) (but not (f) and (g)). To illustrate his point Mr Anderson QC cited the example of sub-paragraph (h) which is in the following terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Anderson QC drew attention to the fact that a breach of the type contemplated by sub-paragraph (h) is necessarily not tied to any particular date since the time when it becomes unlawful to perform will, unlike a date for payment, not necessarily be readily identifiable. He suggested that the same distinction applies to other sub-paragraphs. In addition, Mr Anderson QC pointed out, the sub-paragraph (a) provisos take as their reference points dates and timings which have nothing to do with the date of a breach falling within the ambit of sub-paragraph (h). In my view, there is considerable force in these submissions. It is far from easy to discern why the sub-paragraph (a) provisos can have any sensible application to other clause 18.1 <span style="font-style:italic">“Events”</span>. Indeed, as Mr Anderson QC went on to point out, the provisos themselves are very specific in their applicability being limited to sub-paragraph (a). This is demonstrated by the opening words of the first proviso (and <span style="font-style:italic">“there shall not be an Event of Default under this clause 18.1(a) …”</span>) as well as the opening words of the second proviso <span style="font-style:italic">(“no Plantation Enforcement Event shall arise consequent upon an Event of Default under this clause 18.1(a) …”</span>). Focusing still on sub-paragraph (h), Mr Anderson QC postulated that in order for the first of the provisos to operate, it would need to be reworded as follows:</p>

The difficulty with this submission, however, is that the definition does just that and in very specific terms. If Mr Anderson QC were right, then, there would be no need for sub-paragraphs (c) to (e) and (h) to (k) to have been mentioned at all. Nor would there have been any need to exclude sub-paragraphs (f) and (g) from the list. Indeed, there would probably have been no need to have had any mention of the sub-paragraph (a) provisos since they would, in any event, obviously apply to sub-paragraph (a) regardless.</p>

However, I have sympathy with Mr Anderson QC’s submission that applying the provisos to other sub-paragraphs leads to an odd result, namely that, as long as payments have been made in accordance with Schedule 2 or unless the provisos are applicable, then there can only ever be a Plantation Enforcement Event if reliance is able to be placed on sub-paragraphs (f) or (g) (the provisions which are not listed in the <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> definition). As was submitted, this would mean that even the most egregious failure on the part of Plantation to perform its obligations under the RSA would not be capable of amounting to a <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>. Mr Anderson QC gave the example of sub-paragraph (c) which is in the following terms:</p>

I am not clear, however, whether Mr Anderson QC’s submission at that stage focused only on scenarios in which <span style="font-style:italic">“Events of Default”</span> came about because of non-compliance with financial obligations. Certainly, in paragraph [151] of the judgment, where Flaux J records the ‘cock a snook’ submission, the example recorded as having been given by Mr Anderson QC was a failure on the part of Plantation to <span style="font-style:italic">“pay over to the Bank many millions received as Plantation Villa Proceeds”</span>. It is not obvious that Mr Anderson QC made a more broadly based submission to Flaux J by reference, as he did before me, to sub-paragraphs (c) and (h). Indeed, another example would seem to me to be sub-paragraph (d) insofar as the relevant failure to perform for the purposes of that provision is, as in the case of alleged Breaches 2 and 4, failures to provide DIB with sales contracts and to register under Law No. 8 of 2007. These, again, are matters which are not financial in nature, yet DIB’s ability to rely upon them (through sub-paragraph (d)), if Plantation’s argument is right and if Flaux J was right, would depend on the application of the sub-paragraph (a) provisos concerning payment of the Rescheduling Amount. </p>

Put differently, it was not open to DIB to seek to characterise a non-payment within the scope of sub-paragraph (a) as something which comes within sub-paragraphs (c) to (e) and (h) to (k), and thereby to seek to circumvent the sub-paragraph (a) provisos. In my view, this construction makes better commercial sense and entails no undue violence to the <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Enforcement Event”</span> definition. I, therefore, disagree with the conclusion which was reached in this regard by Flaux J.

It seemed to me they had some difficulty in formulating their case as to how the RSA could be construed in that way, which is scarcely surprising since in my judgment that case is untenable. Once there has been acceleration under clause 18.4, the Repayment Schedule in Schedule 2 and clause 18.1(a) necessarily fall away because the Bank is entitled to say the whole outstanding Rescheduling Amount is payable immediately. It follows that the provisos under clause 18.1(a) no longer operate. By definition clause 18.4 only comes into play when there is already an unremedied Event of Default under clause 18.1 and clause 18.4 simply overrides clause 18.1. Mr Mills really recognised this when he said that clauses 18.1 and 18.4 have to be dealt with in sequence. </span>

In those circumstances, the defendants cannot rely upon the proviso, because what they had paid was only about 12% of what was due (US$60.4 million as a percentage of US$501 million), nothing like 90%. It follows that the Bank was entitled to rely upon or declare a Plantation Enforcement Event as at the date of that notice, 21 July 2008 and the notice they actually served was only a day early. </span>

In the present context, it seems to me that argument is misconceived. All the reference to clause 18.2 in clause 18.4(a)(ii) is doing is making it clear that there cannot be enforcement against Plantation unless there is a Plantation Enforcement Event. For example, if there had been a material change in the financial condition of one of the Guarantors other than Plantation which amounted to an Event of Default under clause 18.1(k), entitling the Bank to accelerate the debt under clause 18.4, the Bank could still not enforce against the Plantation security because that default under clause 18.1(k) would not have been caused by any default of Plantation, so there could not be a Plantation Enforcement Event. However, contrary to Mr Mallin’s submissions, what the reference to the provision being subject to clause 18.2 is not doing is preserving the provisos in clause 18.1(a) which have necessarily fallen away once the full outstanding Rescheduling Amount is immediately due and payable.”</span>

I am quite clear that sub-paragraph (ii) merely provides that there cannot be enforcement unless there is a Plantation Enforcement Event.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I need now to address certain issues concerning the applicability of Law No. 8 of 2007. The first question is whether this is a law which applied to villa plots sales at all. As Mr Cakebread observed in his opening submissions, DIB has adopted something of a <span style="font-style:italic">“shifting”</span> position in relation to this question. Specifically, despite Mr Kamal confirming in his oral evidence that, as far as he was concerned, Law No. 8 of 2007 applied in the present case, Mr Anderson QC submitted before me, supported by a Dubai law expert, Mr Abdulwahid Alulama, that it did not apply because it does not apply to a sale of a bare land plot where the developer does not also build on that land. This first issue also entails my dealing with certain factual issues concerning how the applicability of Law No. 8 of 2007 to the Project was contemporaneously addressed, not only by Plantation and DIB but also by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (‘RERA’) in Dubai. The second issue is whether, if Law No. 8 of 2007 did apply, it did so in respect of the period leading up to 28 December 2007. Mr Michel Chaloub, Plantation’s Dubai law expert, considered that what he described as the ‘spirit of the law’ meant that, after Law No. 8 of 2007 had been passed in June 2007, in the transitional period which ended on 28 December 2007, developers who had not established an escrow account ought nonetheless to have opened an account in the name of the relevant project and paid the sales proceeds into that account, so complying with the ‘spirit of the law’. Mr Alulama did not agree about this: his position was that if in this period Plantation was not registered, then, there was no obligation, actual or within the ‘spirit of the law, to pay into any type of quasi-escrow account. There is then a third question which relates to the period after 28 December 2007 when Mr Alulama’s view (not shared by Mr Chaloub) is that the obligation to pay sales proceeds into an escrow account was absolute.</p>

This is that, as Mr Alulama explained in his report, the Dubai real estate market having gone through an unprecedented boom during the early 2000’s, some developers abandoned projects as the market started to slow down during the course of 2007. This left buyers, typically who had purchased apartments, left out of pocket and without the properties which they had purchased. It was in the circumstances that Law No. 8 of 2007 was introduced with the broad intention of protecting purchasers who had paid money ‘upfront’ by ensuring that that money was protected, isolated and earmarked for the construction of the project rather than used for other purposes.</p>

Furthermore, having looked at a sample convertible lease agreement of the type which villa plot purchasers entered into, Mr Alulama pointed out in his supplemental report that such purchases had no ownership interest in any of the Project’s common areas such as the equestrian facilities which were to be built, but merely an entitlement to access to such areas. Accordingly, he explained, it cannot be said that that entitlement changed matters.</p>

Anything that is within this project is going to be considered an off-plan unit. Off-plan not because it is itself off-plan, yes, I agree a bare plot is there, you can sell it immediately. No, off-plan because it is within the whole of the project too.”</span>

This purchase price should go in the escrow account in order for the rest of the project to be complete too, otherwise they take the bare plots of land, the purchase price of the bare plots of land, they don’t put it in the project and then the project is not complete because they don’t have the finances for it.

I am satisfied, in short, that Law No. 8 of 2007 applied to villa plot sales which were effected by Plantation. It seems to me, indeed, that this accords with the rationale for the introduction of Law No. 8 of 2007 which Mr Alulama explained in his report. The matter needs to be viewed realistically and with common sense. The purchasers of the various villa plots were plainly as deserving of protection as were purchasers of individual apartments in a block. Both sets of purchasers needed to be protected against the risk that the developments were not completed with the consequence that they lost their purchase money. That is the risk which Law No. 8 of 2007 was designed to combat, and it was a risk which was no different for villa plot purchasers than it was for the purchasers of apartments. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add that I reach this conclusion without having recourse to a particular point which was made by Mr Chaloub concerning a different law, namely Law No. 13 of 2008 which regulates Dubai’s Interim Property Register. Article 3 of that Law is in the following terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The term <span style="font-style:italic">“Real Property”</span> is defined as follows (Mr Chaloub confirming in cross-examination, agreeing with Mr Anderson QC and Mr Alulama that <span style="font-style:italic">“and/or</span>” is appropriate despite the translation next to his report simply stating <span style="font-style:italic">“and”</span>):</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This definition, with its reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“land and any fixed structure constructed on it”</span>, replaced an original definition which was in essentially the same terms as that contained in Law No. 8 of 2007 as a result of a change made by Law No. 9 of 2009. Mr Anderson QC relied upon this as demonstrating that it is not possible to derive assistance from Law No. 13 of 2008 in understanding the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“Real Property”</span> in Law No. 8 of 2007. I agree with Mr Anderson QC about this. Indeed, if anything, it seems to me that the fact that there was a change to the definition in one of the Laws but not the other, far from supporting Mr Chaloub’s view on the <span style="font-style:italic">“off-plan”</span> issue, tends to support the view held by Mr Alulama. In the final analysis, however, since the two Laws are dealing with different matters, in my view, little assistance is to be derived from looking at Law No. 13 of 2008. Focusing on Law No. 8 of 2007, which is what matters for present purposes, I remain of the view which I have described, namely that Mr Chaloub is right that that Law applied to the villa plot sales which were made by Plantation in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the circumstances, strictly speaking, I need not go on to address Plantation’s reliance on the position which RERA adopted in relation to Plantation, which was that Law No. 8 of 2007 applied to the Project, and the contention that this determination is legally determinative of the matter. The context in which this point arises is that Mr Fitzwilliam was seeking to argue during the period leading up to 28 December 2007 that Law No. 8 of 2007 did not apply to the Project since, as the point was described in a DIB Action Plan dated 11 November 2007, Plantation was <span style="font-style:italic">“developing the infrastructure and [selling] villa plots and not units or villas”</span>. As this document noted, however, RERA<span style="font-style:italic"> “is not accepting plantations [sic] argument, and accordingly, Plantation is required to get the approval from the land department by 28 December 2007 as per the law”</span>. In his report Mr Chaloub dealt with a question asking whether Plantation could have lawfully refused to comply with a determination by RERA that the Law <span style="font-style:italic">“applied to the project and the bare villa plots it was selling”</span> by stating: </p>
	  </content>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“No, Plantation could not have refused to comply with that determination. Once a developer has been accredited and licensed, it will be subject to Law No. 8 of 2007 and RERA’s oversight in respect of the project it is developing. …”.</span>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In cross-examination, however, Mr Chaloub agreed with Mr Anderson QC that there is nothing in Law No. 8 of 2007 making RERA’s view as to whether the Law is applicable binding. He confirmed that he was not suggesting that RERA’s determination is binding and had not stated in his report that this is the case, although in re-examination Mr Chaloub suggested that what he meant when he referred to RERA making a binding determination is that Plantation was obliged to do as RERA told it to do but that this could be challenged in due course. It would appear, notwithstanding the clarification given in re-examination, that, as Mr Anderson QC put it in closing, all that Mr Chaloub was meaning to do in the passage set out above was to make the point that, once a developer is registered with RERA, the developer becomes subject to RERA’s oversight. This is not the same thing as saying that RERA’s determination that a developer should be registered because Law No. 8 of 2007 is applicable to the project which the developer is undertaking represents a binding determination. In such circumstances, the point made by Plantation falls away, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to address Mr Anderson QC’s reliance on any <span style="font-style:italic">kompetenz-kompetenz</span> point.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Chaloub’s view was that, after Law No. 8 of 2007 came into force, which was on 28 June 2007, and during the six-month period stipulated in Article 18 prior to what he described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“infrastructure”</span> being put in place, by which he meant registration by a developer and the setting up of the relevant escrow account, a developer such as Plantation “<span style="font-style:italic">would have had to open a bank account in the name of [the] project and make sure not to mingle the revenue with any other project”</span>. This, according to Mr Chaloub, was necessary <span style="font-style:italic">“in order to comply with the ‘spirit of the law’”</span>. He explained, when asked about this by Mr Anderson QC during the course of cross-examination, that his thinking was that since developers would have known, after Law No. 8 of 2007 was passed, <span style="font-style:italic">“what the effect of that law is going to be”</span>, were they to <span style="font-style:italic">“choose to go against that law, it is a fraud to the law”</span>. Pressed by Mr Anderson QC, Mr Chaloub acknowledged that he was not in a position to point to any case in which his ‘spirit of the law’ approach had been applied, explaining that he had not <span style="font-style:italic">“researched that particular matter”</span>, but that as far as he was concerned it <span style="font-style:italic">“is a general principle of you do not try and obviate the application of the law by doing something that it tells you not to do before it gets into force”</span>. For my part, I am unpersuaded by the point since there is absolutely nothing in Law No. 8 of 2007 which even hints at developers being under an obligation to comply with its requirements or its ‘spirit’ prior to the expiry of the six-month period stipulated in Article 18. On the contrary, the fact that Article 18 is in the terms which it is points compellingly to the conclusion that developers had six months within which to comply. Furthermore, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out, the suggestion that developers such as Plantation were under any obligation in the meantime is somewhat at odds with the agreement between Mr Chaloub and Mr Alulama in their joint statement that:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“During this six-month period, the Developer shall not be held liable under the Escrow Law for any violation pursuant to Article 18. However, the Developer may be held liable under any other laws (depending on the facts) in the event that it, during this six-month period, intentionally applied funds to the detriment of third parties and/or other than in accordance with the Escrow Law, in anticipation of it coming into force.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I agree with Mr Anderson QC that this amounts to an agreement that developers cannot have been under any obligation to apply sales proceeds as provided by Law No. 8 of 2007 in the period starting at the end of June 2007 and ending on 28 December 2007, assuming that no escrow account had been established during this period, unless this entailed a breach of some other legal obligation arising independently of Law No. 8 of 2007.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, I reject the suggestion made by Mr Chaloub that Plantation was under an obligation to comply with Law No. 8 of 2007 before the end of the six-month period which followed its being passed, which is to say before 28 December 2007. It follows that, in my view, Plantation was not obliged to register with the Land Department/RERA before that date. Nor was Plantation under an obligation to open an escrow account before 28 December 2007. As a result, there was nothing to stop Plantation paying over proceeds from villa plots sales to DIB in this period. On the contrary, clause 7.2(d) of the RSA specifically required that this be done, since the consequence of my decision in this regard is that such proceeds did not amount to <span style="font-style:italic">“Earmarked Plantation Proceeds”</span> within the definition contained in Article 1 of the RSA and I have already determined the argument advanced by Mr Cakebread concerning clause 7.3(a) (<span style="font-style:italic">“amounts retained for the reasonable working capital requirements of the respective projects”</span>) against Plantation. I should just add in this context that, although the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“Earmarked Plantation Proceeds”</span> refers to <span style="font-style:italic">“amounts of Plantation Villa Proceeds that are: (a) Escrow Proceeds; or (b) required by law to be applied the building or other specified purposes”</span>, so suggesting on the face of it that there might be some other Dubai law which enables a developer subject to Law No. 8 of 2007 to spend villa plot sales proceeds <span style="font-style:italic">“for building or other specified purposes”</span> without having to put villa plot sales monies into an escrow account set up under the Law, it appeared to be agreed between the Dubai law experts (strictly in relation to Article 9 rather the <span style="font-style:italic">“Earmarked Plantation Proceeds”</span> definition) that a developer would not be allowed to bypass the obligation to pay the monies into the escrow account.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This brings me on to the period after 28 December 2007, and so the third question which I identified at the beginning of this section. In relation to this, clearly there was an obligation on the part of developers such as Plantation to comply with Law No. 8 of 2007. The transitional period in Article 18 having come to an end, it is obvious that this is the position. As a result, a developer either had to do what was required by Law No. 8 of 2007, and so register with RERA and set up an escrow account, or had to refrain from receiving sales proceeds from villa plots until such time as this could be done. Another option expressly mentioned in Article 18 would be to obtain from RERA an extension of the transitional period. Mr Chaloub suggested, however, that it was open to Plantation, again in the ‘spirit of the law’, <span style="font-style:italic">“to do something in the middle, probably open an account for [the] project …, get the money in it, and disburse money in the interests of the project itself”</span>. Mr Chaloub agreed with Mr Anderson QC that this would not be an account which would be immune from attachment as an escrow account set up by Law No. 8 of 2007 would be. Nor would it be subject to RERA audit. I struggle, in the circumstances, to see that it can, therefore, really be right to suggest that this was what the ‘spirit of the law’ required developers such as Plantation to do. I recognise that from a practical perspective what Mr Chaloub had in mind might make sense. This does not, however, mean that Plantation can be regarded as having been under any sort of obligation to adopt such a course. If there was no such obligation, then, it must follow that in the period after 28 December 2007 Plantation was obliged to register with RERA and open an escrow account in compliance with Law No. 8 of 2007. I agree with Mr Alulama that this obligation was an absolute obligation. </p>

I shall endeavour, in the circumstances, as much as possible to avoid complexity and instead to keep things simple.</p>

Despite this, for ease of presentation I have characterised Breach 1 as entailing only the former rather than also the latter which I have labelled Breach 3. It is nonetheless convenient to deal with Breaches 1 and 3 at the same time given that, in my view, DIB’s case in relation to both of them cannot succeed for a single reason. This is that, whether the villa plot sales proceeds ought to have been paid directly to DIB (as I consider should have happened in the period before 28 December 2007) or into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007 (as I consider should have happened in the period after 28 December 2007), it was nonetheless not open to DIB to assert that such payments were not made in circumstances where DIB is to be taken as having known that no such payments had been made and as having taken no exception to this being the position.</p>

Mr Anderson QC’s point was in the Amended Particulars of Claim the relevant estoppel pleaded in paragraph 37 was the following:</p>

On the contrary, although it is true that the estoppel case as pleaded included a prominent allegation that DIB operated on the basis that Law No. 8 of 2007 applied to the Project, in my view, the case entailed more than just this as the wording at the beginning of paragraph (a) made clear with its allegation that DIB <span style="font-style:italic">“knew about and/or expressly approved of and/or acquiesced in the use and/or payment of all villa plot sales proceeds by Plantation </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">for the purpose of the Plantation Project</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prior to June 2008”</span> (my emphasis). That this is the position is confirmed by what is stated in sub-paragraphs (iii)a and b where reference is made to DIB’s awareness that villa plot sales proceeds were used for purposes which did not include payment to DIB or (save somewhat obliquely through the reference to monies being applied <span style="font-style:italic">“and/or for Earmarked Plantation Proceed purposes”</span>) payment into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007. </p>

Specifically, in paragraph 71(a)-(c) Plantation repeated the points made in paragraphs 43(a)(i) and 43(iii) concerning DIB’s awareness as to the fact that villa plot sales proceeds were being used for the purposes of the development of the Project and were not being paid into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007.

That, it should also be noted given that Mr Anderson QC was minded to suggest that the case had for the first time been put in this way only during the course of Mr Cakebread’s oral closing submissions, is also how the point was put in Mr Cakebread’s and Ms Levy’s written opening submissions, paragraph 100 of which stated as follows (with my emphasis):</p>

Indeed, as I have explained, DIB (in conjunction with Al Tamimi and the GIA Department) looked at precisely this type of information when preparing that notice. The fact, therefore, that Plantation was neither paying villa plot sales proceeds to DIB or into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007 would have been clear and obvious. This would have been the case, I repeat, throughout the period which followed the parties’ entry into the RSA. In truth, of course, DIB would know whether or not it had been paid any such monies. Mr Anderson QC nonetheless submitted that DIB cannot be taken to have known whether Plantation was complying with Law No. 8 of 2007 by paying villa plot sales proceeds into an escrow account as required by that Law because, he submitted, the Plantation bank accounts through which the monies passed were held not with DIB but with HSBC and, accordingly, DIB had <span style="font-style:italic">“no visibility”</span> in respect of the payments. This is, however, in my view, an artificial submission. It is obvious that anybody who looked at the financial information which Plantation supplied to DIB on numerous occasions in the period after the RSA was entered into would have seen that it was the revenue from the villa plot sales which Plantation was relying upon to fund the development of the Project. Indeed, as Mr Anderson QC pointed out and as explained earlier in this judgment, there was no other revenue or source of funding which was available to Plantation to carry out the development works. In the circumstances, it is unrealistic for Mr Anderson QC now to suggest that DIB might have been under the impression that villa plot sales proceeds were being paid into an escrow account set up under Law No. 8 of 2007. That very obviously cannot have been what was thought by the people at DIB looking at the various schedules supplied by Ms Sutherland. It is plain to me that, in the circumstances, the estoppel case advanced by Plantation must succeed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am satisfied, in short, that Mr Cakebread was right when he submitted that Plantation and DIB are to be taken as having acted on the basis of an assumption that, at least until such time as an escrow account was set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007, Plantation was free to use villa plot sales proceeds for development works connected with the Project. This is an assumption which probably emanated from Plantation but which was acquiesced in by DIB. It is an assumption which, furthermore, was, in my view and as elaborated on shortly in relation to a particular submission made by Mr Anderson QC concerning Mr Fitzwilliam, clearly relied upon by Plantation in the sense that Plantation did, in fact, use the villa plot sales proceeds for the purposes of the development.  It should not be overlooked in this context that the notice which was sent on 9 June 2008 specifically relied upon non-payment either to DIB or into an escrow account <span style="font-style:italic">“up to April 2008”</span>. It, therefore, had as its focus a time period when, on any view and as was known by DIB, no escrow account had been set up by Plantation with DIB. As a result, consideration of Breaches 1 and 3 does not turn on what the position might have become after an escrow account had been set up. The position is much simpler than that: in the relevant period, there being no relevant escrow account in place, DIB is to be taken as having known that villa plot sales proceeds were not being paid either to DIB or into an escrow account set up under the Law. I might add that the notion that DIB could have thought that Plantation was paying such monies into an escrow account with another bank is, in the circumstances, not sustainable. DIB knew, at least from January 2008, that Plantation was intending to set up an escrow account with DIB itself. DIB knew also that Plantation had taken no steps to register with RERA by the end of 2007, and so it cannot have been the case that DIB was under the impression that Plantation was working with some other bank to open an escrow account.</p>

In the light of the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Globe Motors Inc v RTW Lucas Varity Electric Steering Ltd </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 396, this is unsurprising.

A clause such as Article 6.3 in this case may have considerable practical utility, if only because it is likely to raise in an acute form the question whether parties who are said to have varied the contract otherwise than in the prescribed manner really intended to do so. As a matter of principle, however, I do not think that they can effectively tie their hands so as to remove from themselves the power to vary the contract informally, if only because they can agree to dispense with the restriction itself. Nor do I think this need be a matter of concern, given that nothing can be done without the agreement of both parties; and if the parties are in agreement, there is no reason why that agreement should not be effective.”</span>

Mr Anderson QC added that, since Ms Sutherland acknowledged in the course of her evidence that <span style="font-style:italic">“it wasn’t my remit to be analysing the RSA”</span>, the same applies to her. The key decision maker, Mr Anderson QC observed, was not Ms Sutherland but Mr Fitzwilliam. I reject this submission. As far as Ms Sutherland is concerned, it is perfectly clear that, as Plantation’s Chief Financial and Operations Officer, she had the requisite authority, actual or ostensible or otherwise, which Mr Anderson QC suggested was absent. The fact that Mr Fitzwilliam was behind her does not rob her of such authority. In any event, I am far from clear that clause 25.6 has the effect suggested by Mr Anderson QC. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As far as Mr Fitzwilliam was concerned, he considered that Plantation could spend the money on the cost of the development and was not under any obligation to pay villa plot sales proceeds to DIB.  He made this very point when Mr Anderson QC put to him a passage in the original version of the Particulars of Claim dating from July 2013 where it was stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation was entitled to retain the sums in question for the reasonable working capital requirements of the respective projects which it had done”</span>. Mr Fitzwilliam agreed that <span style="font-style:italic">“that has always been my view, and that hasn’t changed”</span>. Mr Anderson QC submitted that, in such circumstances, Mr Fitzwilliam can hardly be taken as having relied upon any action on the part of DIB capable of amounting to a relevant common assumption. Mr Anderson QC went so far as to suggest that, as he put it in his written closing submissions, <span style="font-style:italic">“there is no evidence that he was aware of any of the communications with”</span> DIB. Again, however, I regard that submission as being unrealistic. Mr Fitzwilliam may have left detailed financial matters to Ms Sutherland, but he clearly remained closely engaged with what was happening with the Project. Critically, as far as he was concerned, the villa plot sales proceeds were what were funding the development. He, therefore, must be taken as having appreciated that DIB was approaching matters in the same way. He obviously knew that Ms Sutherland was sending DIB the type of financial information which she provided, not least because he would obviously have been aware that DIB was working with Ms Sutherland closely, for instance in relation to the standby loan facility arrangements. Mr Anderson QC pointed to a document which Mr Dooley at Lovells sent to the various solicitors acting for the RSA parties, including Mr Davies at Clifford Chance, Plantation’s then solicitors, on 19 October 2007. He referred specifically to the attachment, which was a document entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“DIB-CCH Restructuring Implementation Steps”</span> and which referred under the <span style="font-style:italic">“Task”</span> column at point 7 to procuring <span style="font-style:italic">“that net proceeds are paid to DIB from the following sources”</span> including <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Villa proceeds exceeding US$150,000”</span>. Mr Anderson QC suggested that it was inconceivable that Clifford Chance did not pass this on to Mr Fitzwilliam and observed that, since Mr Fitzwilliam apparently took no notice of what was stated in that document, it should be assumed that he placed no reliance on any common assumption. I do not agree. As I see it, if Mr Fitzwilliam had been shown the document prepared by Mr Dooley, as to which there is no evidence either way, it does not change matters since the truth is that it is merely one document which falls to be considered. I do not consider it appropriate to reject Plantation’s reliance case on the basis of such an isolated piece of evidence. The evidence that DIB and Plantation proceeded on the basis that villa plot sales proceeds would not need to be paid to DIB or into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007 is, frankly, overwhelming. </p>

I should explain that I reach this conclusion without having to address a particular argument in relation to Breach 3 concerned with the delay in setting up the escrow account with DIB caused by the name in which RERA went about registration.

He suggested that, since they did not do so, it must follow that the entity which was registered was the natural person, Mr Fitzwilliam, and not Plantation, the company. In my view, this does not follow at all. Mr Kamal confirmed during cross-examination that, as far as he was concerned, the registration was, in Mr Cakebread’s terms, in the <span style="font-style:italic">“joint name”</span> of Mr Fitzwilliam and Plantation. </p>

RERA was aware of the position in relation to Mr Fitzwilliam and Plantation. RERA chose to reflect this in the way that the certificates described the developer as<span style="font-style:italic"> “Arthur Fitzwilliam (Plantation)”</span>. This may not formally be accurate, but it is what RERA chose to do. It is not Plantation’s fault that RERA made that choice. The truth is that RERA plainly regarded Plantation as having done what was required by Article 4 of Law No. 8 of 2007, and the only concern was that expressed by DIB, specifically by Mr Masood. Indeed, the point having been raised with RERA, no change to the certificates was apparently considered necessary or appropriate by RERA, so underlining the fact that, as far as RERA was concerned, Plantation had done enough to comply with the Law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This brings me to Breach 4 and DIB’s contention that Plantation failed to comply with clause 16.1(e) of the RSA by not providing DIB with copies of villa plots sales contracts which were requested by DIB on 5 June 2008, and so the day before Mr Fitzwilliam came to be arrested and only a few days before the notice was sent to Plantation’s solicitors, Clifford Chance, on 9 June 2008. Mr Anderson QC referred in his written closing submissions to an earlier request which was made to Ms Sutherland on 9 October 2007 and to a request which in her witness statement Ms Sutherland suggested was made at some point in February 2008, as well as to the fact that in re-examination Ms Sutherland referred to there probably having been oral requests for copies of sale contracts made in the period between October 2007 and June 2008 (something, Mr Anderson QC noted, which was not mentioned in her witness statement). It is, however, not necessary for me to address these matters since Mr Anderson QC accepted that the request which is important for present purposes is the request which was made by DIB on 5 June 2008. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As for that request, this was made by Mr Khalifa early in the morning on 5 June 2008 in an email which asked for<span style="font-style:italic"> “copies of the sales contracts related to the sold residential plots in Plantation to date”</span>. This was answered by Ms Sutherland very shortly afterwards (14 minutes later to be precise) by an email in which she stated:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">No response was received to this email prior to the letter which was sent on 9 June 2008. Mr Anderson QC suggested in closing that that letter was, in effect, a response to Ms Sutherland’s email, bearing in mind that it called upon Plantation to remedy the various defaults which were identified (including in relation to clause 16.1(e) within 15 days. Mr Anderson QC was, in a sense, right about this but only, in my view, in a technical sense. I am quite clear that Ms Sutherland’s email called for a specific response if it really was going to be suggested a few days later that Plantation had failed to comply with a request for information made by DIB. The fact that Mr Khalifa did not revert to Ms Sutherland to say that, notwithstanding what she was telling him about DIB having been sent copies of the sales contracts <span style="font-style:italic">“at least twice before”</span>, he required them to be sent again, whether because he could not locate them or for any other reason, is curious. I reject the suggestion, in particular, that Ms Sutherland was in her email refusing to comply with the request which Mr Khalifa had made. I do not consider that she was doing anything of the sort. She was merely putting the ball back into Mr Khalifa’s court, inviting him, if necessary, to come back to her. The fact that Ms Sutherland did not send copies of the sale contracts between 5 June 2008 and 9 June 2008 is readily explained by Mr Khalifa’s silence in response to her email. In the circumstances, it is nothing to the point that Ms Sutherland might have been able to dig out the relevant sales contracts and send them to Mr Khalifa in relatively short order, as Mr Anderson QC suggested, since I am clear that as far as she was concerned, having not heard back from Mr Khalifa in response to her very prompt email, Mr Khalifa had managed to locate copies of sales contracts which Plantation had previously supplied to DIB.</p>

As to Mr Anderson QC’s suggestion that the 15-day period identified in the 9 June 2008 notice is relevant for present purposes, I disagree. DIB was only entitled to give such notice if there had been a breach of clause 16.1(f), and I do not consider that there was for the reason which I have given. Since there was no such breach as at 9 June 2008, it follows that the 15-day notice purportedly given under clause 18.1(d) of the RSA ought not to be regarded as a legitimate notice under that provision.</p>

In doing so, it is as well to set out again what the various provisions have to say. Starting with clause 18.1(e), this provides that there is an Event of Default if <span style="font-style:italic">“any Indebtedness of a Guarantor … becomes due and payable or capable of being declared due and payable prior to its due date or any Indebtedness of a Guarantor … is not paid on its due date”</span>, with <span style="font-style:italic">“Indebtedness”</span> being defined in Article 1 as being <span style="font-style:italic">“any obligation for the payment or repayment of money, whether actual or contingent, present or future, incurred as principal or as surety”</span>. Clause 18.1(e) is not, in view of the conclusion which I have reached previously concerning the application of the provisos mentioned in clause 18.1(a), subject to such provisos unless what is relied upon by DIB is a non-payment which properly falls within clause 18.1(a). </p>

Mr Anderson QC submitted, in my view rightly and not controversially as far as I could tell, that the references to the stopping of payment and the ceasing or threatening to cease to carry on business were intended to cover the situation where Plantation found itself unable to secure the financing which it needed and was, accordingly, minded to mothball the Project until such time as financing became available. More controversially, however, Mr Anderson QC went on to highlight the similarity between the <span style="font-style:italic">“deemed unable to pay its debts”</span> wording of the provision and section 123(1)(e) of the Insolvency Act 1986, which provides that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">He submitted that this demonstrates a clear linkage, and that, accordingly, in considering clause 18.1(f), it is appropriate to have regard to how section 123(1)(e) is approached. Specifically, Mr Anderson QC highlighted how for the purposes of this statutory provision the non-payment of an undisputed debt gives rise to an inference of inability to pay, even if the company in question has a surplus of assets over liabilities (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Cornhill Insurance plc v Improvement Services Ltd </span>[1986] 1 WLR 114), and an inability to pay debts as they fall due encompasses more than what has fallen due by a particular point in time, but extends to cover <span style="font-style:italic">“debts falling due from time to time in the reasonably near future”</span> (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL plc</span> [2013] UKSC 28, [2013] 1 WLR 1408 at [37] per Lord Walker)</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This leaves clause 18.1(g), which provides that there is an Event of Default <span style="font-style:italic">“if a Guarantor … becomes insolvent or is in liquidation or administration or subject to any other insolvency procedure in any jurisdiction or a receiver, manager, trustee, custodian or analogous officer is appointed in respect of all or any part of its property, undertaking or assets”</span>. Mr Anderson QC submitted that the fact that there is this separate provision dealing with the situation where Plantation<span style="font-style:italic"> “becomes insolvent”</span> demonstrates that the parties’ intention in entering into the RSA should be taken as having been to extend the circumstances where there could be an Event of Default to a situation where there is balance-sheet insolvency, applying the test under section 123(2) of the 1986 Act, since otherwise there would be no need to make separate mention of <span style="font-style:italic">“insolvency”</span> in view of the fact that clause 18.1(f) has the <span style="font-style:italic">“deemed unable to pay its debts”</span> wording. I did not understand Mr Cakebread to take issue with this. Indeed, like Mr Anderson QC, Mr Cakebread referred me to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">In the matter of Cheyne Finance Plc</span> [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), in which at [51] to [57] Briggs J (as he then was) gave the following explanation as to the modern (Mr Cakebread described it as<span style="font-style:italic"> “holistic”</span>) approach:</p>

It is clear from that brief review of the Australian decisions that in an environment shorn of any balance sheet test for insolvency, cash flow or commercial insolvency is not to be ascertained by a slavish focus only on debts due as at the relevant date. Such a blinkered review will, in some cases, fail to see that a momentary inability to pay is only the result of a temporary lack of liquidity soon to be remedied, and in other cases fail to see that due to an endemic shortage of working capital a company is on any commercial view insolvent, even though it may continue to pay its debts for the next few days, weeks or even months before an inevitable failure. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Returning to the English legislation, it is, in my view, critical to note that when separating out balance sheet insolvency from commercial insolvency in 1985 the legislature did not merely remove the requirement to include contingent and prospective liabilities in framing s.123(1)(e) out of its predecessor, but added what in Australia have always been regarded as the key words of futurity, namely the phrase ‘as they fall due’. In that context ‘fall due’ is, in my judgment, synonymous with ‘become due’.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Mr. Trower submitted that the existence of the balance sheet test in s.123(2) makes an Australian type of approach to the commercial insolvency test unnecessary, because a company will always be balance sheet insolvent in circumstances where a review of future debts shows that it is commercially insolvent. I disagree. First, I can see no good reason why the developed understanding in Australia of the nature of the exercise required by the phrase ‘unable to pay debts as they become (or fall) due’ should not be recognised when the same phrase is, for the first time, deliberately inserted into the English insolvency test. The Australian approach makes commercial sense, whereas the blinkered approach of ignoring the future does not. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Secondly, a company may not always be balance sheet insolvent where an Australian style test for commercial insolvency is satisfied, as in this example: The company has £1,000 ready cash and a very valuable but very illiquid asset worth £250,000 which cannot be sold for two years. It has present debts of £500, but a future debt of £100,000 due in six months. On any commercial view the company clearly cannot pay its debts as they fall due, but it is, or would be, balance sheet solvent. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">In my judgment, the effect of the alterations to the insolvency test made in 1985 and now found in s.123 of the 1986 Act was to replace in the commercial solvency test now in s.123(1)(e), one futurity requirement, namely to include contingent and prospective liabilities, with another more flexible and fact sensitive requirement encapsulated in the new phrase ‘as they fall due’.</span>

First, Mr Cakebread relied upon <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ED &amp; F Man Commodity Advisers Ltd and another v Fluxo-Cane Overseas Ltd and Another</span> [2010] EWHC 212 (Comm). In that case, which involved an issue as to whether a sugar broker (‘MCA’) was entitled to liquidate the position of its customer (‘FCO’) under an agreement which entitled close-out in the event that, under clause 16.1.14, MCA <span style="font-style:italic">“reasonably considere[ed] it necessary or desirable for our own protection”</span>. MCA’s primary case was that it was entitled to close out in reliance on another provision of the relevant agreement, clause 14, under which it was open to MCA to require FCO <span style="font-style:italic">“to provide margin”</span>. David Steel J decided that MCA’s reliance on this provision was premature, before then going on to consider whether MCA could rely upon clause 16.1.14. He dealt with that question at [56] to [61], as follows: </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Despite a premature reliance on the failure to pay margin, is MCA entitled to justify the liquidation on the basis of Clause 16.1.14 of the Customer Agreement to the effect that closing out FCO's position was permitted if MCA were to ‘reasonably consider it necessary or desirable for our own protection’?</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The first point taken by FCO is that, on the basis that MCA did not rely on (or even have in mind) Clause 16.1.14 in embarking on the liquidation, it cannot now rely on the clause. This, it was said, was further exemplified by the threshold to Clause 17 to the effect that the entitlement to liquidate in such event was ‘at [MCA’s] discretion’.</span>

By clause 47.1 therefore, Sucden was entitled to without prior notice to close out Fluxo-Cane’s various transactions, which is what it proceeded to do. On the facts as I find them to be, this is not a case in which the claimant is seeking retrospectively to rely on an Event of Default upon which it did not rely at the time. Despite the fact that neither point is mentioned in the letter of default, I am satisfied that in taking the action that it did, Sucden had in mind both Mr Garcia’s repudiatory statement of 18 January 2008, and the necessity to protect itself. I am satisfied on the facts that the situation demanded such action. Essentially the same conclusion was reached in ED &amp; F Man at [58]. In that case also, the justification advanced by the brokers at the time was non-payment of margin, but no such default had occurred: ‘But’, as David Steel J said, ‘there is nothing to inhibit reliance on any other event of default’.

That principle is summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> at paragraph 24-014, as follows:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic">“One party to a contract may, by reason of the other’s breach, be entitled to treat himself as discharged from his liability further to perform his own unperformed obligations under the contract and from his obligation to accept performance by the other party if made or tendered. The expression ‘discharge by breach’ is commonly employed to describe the situation where he is entitled to, and does, exercise that right. Nevertheless, the expression is not wholly accurate, at least without further explanation. In the first place, not every breach of contract has this effect. Discharge from liability is not necessarily coincident with a right to sue for damages. The rule is usually stated as follows: ‘[a]ny breach of contract gives rise to a cause of action; not every breach gives a discharge from liability’. Thus the main question discussed in this chapter is whether a party who admittedly has a claim for damages is also relieved from further performance by the other party’s breach. Secondly, although sometimes the innocent party is referred to as ‘rescinding’ the contract and the contract as being ‘terminated’ by the breach, it is clear that the contract is not rescinded ab initio nor is it extinguished by the breach. The innocent party, or, in some cases, both parties, are excused from further performance of their primary obligations under the contract; but there is then substituted for the primary obligations of the party in default a secondary obligation to pay monetary compensation for his non-performance. Thirdly, the innocent party is not ordinarily bound to treat himself as discharged: if the contract is still executory, he may elect instead to treat it as continuing. He may also waive his right of discharge, accept the defective performance of the other party, and content himself with damages, which are his remedy in any event.”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">‘It is now possible to turn directly to the first issue posed, namely whether non-performance of an obligation is ever as a matter of law capable of constituting an act of acceptance. On this aspect I found the judgment of Phillips J. entirely convincing. One cannot generalise on the point. It all depends on the particular contractual relationship and the particular circumstances of the case. But, like Phillips J., I am satisfied that a failure to perform may sometimes signify to a repudiating party an election by the aggrieved party to treat the contract as at an end. Postulate the case where an employer at the end of a day tells a contractor that he, the employer, is repudiating the contract and that the contractor need not return the next day. The contractor does not return the next day or at all. It seems to me that the contractor's failure to return may, in the absence of any other explanation, convey a decision to treat the contract as at an end. Another example may be an overseas sale providing for shipment on a named ship in a given month. The seller is obliged to obtain an export licence. The buyer repudiates the contract before loading starts. To the knowledge of the buyer the seller does not apply for an export licence with the result that the transaction cannot proceed. In such circumstances it may well be that an ordinary businessman, circumstanced as the parties were, would conclude that the seller was treating the contract as at an end. Taking the present case as illustrative, it is important to bear in mind that the tender of a bill of lading is the pre-condition to payment of the price. Why should an arbitrator not be able to infer that when, in the days and weeks following loading and the sailing of the vessel, the seller failed to tender a bill of lading to the buyer he clearly conveyed to a trader that he was treating the contract as at an end?’</span>

I accept that is a possibility in an appropriate case but, as Mr Mallin himself accepts, generally inactivity or acquiescence will not amount to acceptance. It all depends on the circumstances. The essential difference between Vitol and the present case is that, in that case and the examples Lord Steyn gives, after the repudiatory breach, if the contract was still on foot, it was incumbent on the innocent party to perform a positive obligation under the contract, there the tender of the bill of lading by the seller. </span>

First, he submitted that, since DIB had not alleged affirmation in advance of trial, it was not open to DIB to run a case that Plantation had not accepted DIB’s repudiatory breach. This is a bad point, however, because it overlooks the fact that it is for Plantation, as the party contending that the RSA came to an end, to demonstrate that DIB’s repudiatory breach was accepted by it. It is not for DIB to have to prove affirmation. Secondly, Mr Cakebread referred to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Stocznia Gdanska SA v Latvian Shipping Company Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 889 and specifically the following passage in the judgment of Rix LJ at [99] and [100]:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“99.  It seems to me that an affirmation of a repudiatory actual breach may differ from an affirmation of a merely anticipatory repudiatory breach in that the former breach is complete at the time it occurs whereas the latter breach looks to the future. An affirmation of an actual breach may therefore be said to leave nothing outstanding for the future, in that the worst has already occurred, whereas an affirmation of an anticipatory breach still leaves the future open. Prima facie an election or waiver looks to the past, even if it is possible, in a very clear case, to waive one’s rights for the future too. Two views might therefore be taken as to the effect of an affirmation of an anticipatory breach. One is that it is a waiver for the future as well: that was what Colman J decided and Mr Glennie submitted. The other is that the affirmation prima facie relates only to the past, leaving open the question of a continuing or renewed anticipatory breach. It seems to me that the latter view is to be preferred, and is inherent in the decision in Safehaven v. Spingbok and in the decision already taken in relation to this case. That would still leave open of course the question of how one tells whether an anticipatory breach is a continuing one, and the correct way of viewing silence. Professor Treitel highlights the undesirability of subverting considerations of substance or policy to the accidents of negotiation (at 26). I wonder whether each case does not in truth have to be decided on its own facts. However, substance and principle suggest that silence should not in this context be too readily regarded as equivocal; and that against the background of an earlier anticipatory repudiation it should not take much further to prove continuing repudiatory conduct.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an argument which is hopeless. First, I do not accept that DIB should be regarded as being in continuing repudiatory breach: DIB did what it did in July 2008 and that was a single action. The fact that the consequences continued does not mean that there is more than one breach. Secondly, Mr Cakebread’s contention would, in any event, only be relevant if he could point to an acceptance by Plantation in advance of 1 October 2008. He cannot do this; indeed, he did not even suggest that there was an acceptance in that timescale. On the contrary, it is instructive that shortly after that date, on 13 October 2008, Denton Wilde Sapte, then acting for Plantation, wrote to Al Tamimi and Lovells asking to be provided with copies of certain instructions which had been sent to certain valuers. In doing so, an entitlement was being asserted under clause 18.3(b) of the RSA, indicating that Plantation was not at that stage treating the RSA as having come to an end. If the RSA was not at an end at that stage, it cannot have been at an end before 1 October 2008. Furthermore, the day before this, Galadari &amp; Associates wrote to DIB attaching a letter from Plantation dated 11 October 2008 which made a settlement proposal and stated, in part, as follows:</p>

The answer will turn on the language of the clause in question understood in the context of the contract as a whole and its commercial background. Sometimes, as in Lockland Builders v Rickwood, the parties will have intended to give a remedy of a limited nature for breaches of a certain kind; in other cases the terms of the contract may reflect an intention to treat the breach as going to the root of the contract with the usual consequences, however important or unimportant it might otherwise appear to be.

It is important to remember that any clause in a contract must be construed in the context in which one finds it, both the immediate context of the other terms and the wider context of the transaction as a whole. The court is unlikely to be satisfied that a party to a contract has abandoned valuable rights arising by operation of law unless the terms of the contract make it sufficiently clear that that was intended.

Once that provision and the standstill provision in clause 3 have fallen away as they do upon termination, what is left is an unqualified obligation under clause 4.4 that all of the Advances (i.e. the Rescheduling Amount as the opening words of clause 4.1 make clear) are immediately due and payable.

Mr Anderson QC’s submission was that this was an entirely wrong approach since ‘stopping the clock’ in this way would involve affording Plantation compensation on a basis which ignored reality, specifically the fact that as at 1 October 2008, when the next instalment of the Rescheduling Amount became due, a Plantation Enforcement Event would have occurred in any event.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Golden Victory</span> case was such a case. In that case, charterers repudiated a 7-year time charter some three years after it was entered into and some 14 months before the outbreak of the Second Gulf War in March 2003. Their argument was that the damages payable to owners should reflect the fact that under a provision in the charter (clause 33) there was a right to cancel in the event of such a war. Accordingly, they contended, the damages should be limited to the period up to March 2003 when the Second Gulf War broke out and should not extend to 6 December 2005 when the charter would, had its run its full course, come to an end. The majority (Lord Scott, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown) held that the principle that damages should be assessed as at the date of breach is not inflexible and that the desirability of achieving certainty in commercial contracts is subject to the overriding compensatory principle that the damages awarded should represent no more than the value of the contractual benefits of which the claimant had been deprived. Therefore, if by the time that damages come to be assessed, an event has happened which would have resulted in the termination of the contract or which otherwise reduces the contractual benefits enjoyed by the innocent party, then, this would need to be taken into account in assessing the damages payable. It followed, the majority decided, that since the event entitling the charterers to terminate the charterparty under clause 33 had happened before the damages had been assessed and the owners’ right to receive the hire rate and profit share provided for by the charterparty would thereby have been brought to an end, the owners were not entitled to damages in respect of the period thereafter. Lord Scott, in particular, explained the rationale as follows at [29] to [32]:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">My Lords, the answer to the question at issue must depend on principles of the law of contract. It is true that the context in this case is a charterparty, a commercial contract. But the contractual principles of the common law relating to the assessment of damages are no different for charterparties, or for commercial contracts in general, than for contracts which do not bear that description. The fundamental principle governing the quantum of damages for breach of contract is long established and not in dispute. The damages should compensate the victim of the breach for the loss of his contractual bargain. The principle was succinctly stated by Parke B in Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Exch 850 , 855 and remains as valid now as it was then: </span>

If the charterparty had not been repudiated and had remained on foot, it would have been terminated by the charterers in or shortly after March 2003 when the Second Gulf War triggered the clause 33 termination option. But the owners are claiming damages up to 6 December 2005 on the footing, now known to be false, that the charterparty would have continued until then. It is contended that because the charterers' repudiation and its acceptance by the owners preceded the March 2003 event, the rule requiring damages for breach of contract to be assessed at the date of breach requires that event to be ignored.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">That contention, in my opinion, attributes to the assessment of damages at the date of breach rule an inflexibility which is inconsistent both with principle and with the authorities.

He is entitled to be put in the same position, so far as money can do it, as if the contract had been performed. The assessment at the date of breach rule can usually achieve that result. But not always.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“37.  My noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham, in what has been rightly described as a strong dissent, has referred, in para 9, to the overriding compensatory principle that the injured party is entitled to such damages as will put him in the same financial position as if the contract had been performed. On the facts of the present case, however, the contract contained clause 33 and would not have required any performance by the charterers after March 2003. It should follow that, in principle, the owners, the injured party, are not entitled to any damages in respect of the period thereafter. As at the date of the owners’ acceptance of the charterers' repudiation of the charterparty, the proposition that what at that date the owners had lost was a charterparty with slightly less than four years to run requires qualification. The charterparty contained clause 33. The owners had lost a charterparty which contained a provision that would enable the charterers to terminate the charterparty if a certain event happened. The event did happen. It happened before the damages had been assessed. It was accepted in argument before your Lordships that the owners’ charterparty rights would not, in practice, have been marketable for a capital sum. The contractual benefit of the charterparty to the owners, the benefit of which they were deprived by the repudiatory breach, was the right to receive the hire rate during the currency of the charterparty. The termination of the charterparty under clause 33 would necessarily have brought to an end that right.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The arguments of the owners offend the compensatory principle. They are seeking compensation exceeding the value of the contractual benefits of which they were deprived. Their case requires the assessor to speculate about what might happen over the period 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 regarding the occurrence of a clause 33 event and to shut his eyes to the actual happening of a clause 33 event in March 2003. The argued justification for thus offending the compensatory principle is that priority should be given to the so-called principle of certainty. My Lords, there is, in my opinion, no such principle. Certainty is a desideratum and a very important one, particularly in commercial contracts. But it is not a principle and must give way to principle. Otherwise incoherence of principle is the likely result. The achievement of certainty in relation to commercial contracts depends, I would suggest, on firm and settled principles of the law of contract rather than on the tailoring of principle in order to frustrate tactics of delay to which many litigants in many areas of litigation are wont to resort. Be that as it may, the compensatory principle that must underlie awards of contractual damages is, in my opinion, clear and requires the appeal in the case to be dismissed. …”.</span>

He did not, however, at that stage explain why he considered that to be the position. The explanation came in closing when Mr Cakebread engaged in something of a re-characterisation of the nature of the claim advanced by Plantation. Mr Cakebread explained and I quote directly from his oral submissions, that DIB having decided <span style="font-style:italic">“to take the Lease without there being a Plantation Enforcement Event”</span>, damages should be assessed on the basis that there had been a <span style="font-style:italic">“conversion of Plantation’s property”</span>. Mr Cakebread went on to suggest that Mr Anderson QC’s submission confused what Mr Cakebread described as <span style="font-style:italic">“a simple act of conversion” </span>with a claim for <span style="font-style:italic">“contractual damages for loss of the benefit of a contract”</span>. Mr Cakebread did not, therefore, take issue with the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The ‘Golden Victory’</span> case as such, nor obviously could he. His only point was that the present case involved a claim in conversion albeit <span style="font-style:italic">“in the context of a contract”</span>, and so merited a different approach to the assessment of the damages payable (namely an approach which is analogous to the approach adopted in conversion cases).</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“There are, however, authorities, and over a very long period, where the concurrent liability is for breach of contract and in the tort of conversion. Here it is thought that a claimant should be entitled to tortious damages where these are higher than the contractual. This is because the two claims are not for the same type of default, as with negligence, but with different types of default, the one being the breaking of a contract concerning goods, the other being the conversion of those goods. The cases have concerned, as defendant, a seller or a carrier of goods who has so dealt with them as to be liable in conversion to the other contracting party. Actions of conversion have been brought where a seller of goods has, after the property has passed to the buyer, refused to deliver them or has resold them to a third party, and where a carrier of goods has delivered them on their arrival to the wrong person, has improperly sold them in transit or has made a short delivery to the claimant. In such cases the market value of the goods at the time and place of due delivery, which is the normal contractual measure, will generally be the measure for conversion, since the latter measure also looks to market value and since the time and place of conversion is generally the time and place at which the goods should have been delivered. There are, however, two possible variants that could arise. (1) In the first place the goods may have been sold by the claimant to a third party at a price higher than the market value at due delivery and the claimant, without a market available to him in which he could buy equivalent goods, has been unable to carry out this contract. In the absence of knowledge of this contract, the defendant seller or carrier would not generally be liable to the claimant for his loss of profit in an action for breach of contract.”</span>

The particular aspect highlighted by Mr Cakebread related to other shares in the same company which the client had deposited with the stockbrokers as margin, only to find out later that the stockbrokers had sold those shares also. When the client closed his account, the stockbrokers went into the market and bought shares in the same quantity as the shares which had been deposited with them by the client.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“As to the deposited shares, in the circumstances of the case the company never had any right to deal with them. If the transaction had been originally honest, the company would only have had a special property which, on the facts of the case, even had the transaction been honest throughout, would not have given them the right to dispose of the shares, for there never had been default. But on the actual facts of a mandate accepted for the express purpose of being fraudulently misused by the agent, the agents never had the right to claim or to hold security, still less to dispose of it. Their disposal of the deposited shares amounted to nothing short of conversion, and the client on each occasion on which the shares were sold had vested in him a right to damages for conversion which would be measured by the value of the shares at the date of the conversion. How, then, is his position affected by the fact that, not knowing of the conversion, he received from the wrongdoer, and has retained, the very goods converted or their equivalent? It appears to their Lordships that the only effect is that he must give credit for the value of what he has received at the time he received it, and that the damages are reduced by this amount. …</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">It does not require argument to show that the amount by which the damages are reduced must be the value of the goods when returned. In the result, therefore, the plaintiff appears to be entitled to retain the sum for which he recovered judgment under the order of Kerwin J. It is objected that this will be to put him in a better position than if he had not been defrauded at all, and this appears to have influenced the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Ontario. All that this amounts to is to recognize that fraudulent brokers have often sounder judgment than their clients as to the future course of markets. If the shares had been converted and not returned, there can be no question that the client would have been entitled to receive the proceeds of the conversion though he himself had planned to hold and thought he had succeeded in holding the shares until a time when the value was nothing. Fortunately for the commercial community the law has many effective forms of relief against dishonest agents, and no injustice is done if the principal benefits, as he occasionally may, by the superior astuteness of an unjust steward in carrying out a fraud.”  </span>

In that case, a certificate being a bonus issue of a substantial number of shares in a particular company, together with certain executed blank transfers, were deposited with the defendant as security for an existing or prospective loan to the company by the defendant. The defendant irreversibly converted the certificate and shares by selling them to a third party in return for a post-dated cheque representing the market value of the shares at that time, although the defendant never presented the cheque for payment. The defendant, subsequently, at a lower price purchased shares in the company to replace those in the certificate. The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant for damages for conversion, the judge at first instance awarding them the difference between the value of the shares at the date of conversion and the value of the replacement shares at the date of replacement. The defendant appealed but was unsuccessful in both the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

A different consideration will apply when the property is irreversibly converted and the plaintiff loses that property. The plaintiff loses the value of the property at the date of conversion and the general rule is that the measure of damages is the value thus lost. To depart from that rule in the present case would be inconsistent with Solloway v. McLaughlin [1938] A.C. 247. Mr. Evans-Lombe submitted that in that case Lord Atkin was only concerned to deprive the defendant of a profit. But Lord Atkin's judgment is inconsistent with this submission. Mr. Evans-Lombe also sought to argue that the effect of Solloway v. McLaughlin has in some way been modified by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, joined with the decision in the Brandeis case [1981] Q.B. 864.

Terms of years grew up outside this system of estates. Originally they were regarded not as property (as object of ownership) but as personal contracts binding only on the parties. The leaseholder was not fully protected against other persons until the end of the 15th century, and the nature of the remedy (the action of ejectment) marked off leaseholds from the other estates. When they became fully protected by the law of property they became estates, but it was too late for them to be classified with the others.”</span>

This is because, as Mr Anderson QC explained, the assessment of tort-based damages entails, like the assessment of contractual damages, the application of the compensatory principle. Thus, to take an example of some antiquity, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Livingstone v The Rawyards Coal Company</span> (1880) 5 App Cas 25, a trespass case involving the owner of a small feu, Lord Blackburn stated as follows at page 39:</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“The point may be reduced to a small compass when you come to look at it. I do not think there is any difference of opinion as to its being a general rule that, where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation. That must be qualified by a great many things which may arise—such, for instance, as by the consideration whether the damage has been maliciously done, or whether it has been done with full knowledge that the person doing it was doing wrong. There could be no doubt that there you would say that everything would be taken into view that would go most against the wilful wrongdoer—many things which you would properly allow in favour of an innocent mistaken trespasser would be disallowed as against a wilful and intentional trespasser on the ground that he must not qualify his own wrong, and various things of that sort. But in such a case as the present, where it is agreed that the Defenders, without any fault whatever on their part, have innocently, and, being ignorant, with as little negligence or carelessness as possible, taken this coal, believing it to be their own, when in fact it belonged to the Pursuer, then comes the question, - how are we to get at the sum of money which will compensate them?”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“However, I do not think that either Diplock LJ or Evershed J were intending to do more than state a general rule. Neither of them is to be taken as envisaging that in detinue the value of the goods was always to be assessed, whatever the circumstances, at the date of judgment. Such a rigid, inflexible approach would accord ill with the compensatory objective underlying awards of damages. Whatever may or may not have the been the practice in past centuries, I cannot think by the mid-twentieth century the old forms of action, in ruling us from their graves, still retained sufficient vigour to compel an award of damages in a sum assessed as at the date of judgment if, in the particular circumstances and applying ordinary principles of causation and mitigation, the loss to the plaintiff fairly to be attributed to the non-return of his goods was a lesser sum. Indeed, in the Rosenthal case itself Evershed J envisaged (at page 379) that although a bailee who has parted with the goods is estopped from so asserting in answer to a claim in detinue for delivery up, yet if the bailor knew of the conversion at the time he might not be able to rely on a claim in detinue for the current value of the goods. That flexible approach was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Sachs v Miklos [l948] KB 23. Lord Goddard CJ (at page 39) stated that, in assessing damages for detinue or for conversion, the damages are not necessarily and in all cases the value of the goods at the date of judgment: ‘The question is what is the plaintiff’s loss, what damages he has suffered, by the wrongful act of the defendants.’ There the court held that if the plaintiff, who had a cause of action against the defendant bailee in detinue as well as in conversion, knew or ought to have known that the furniture was going to be sold by the bailee, he could not recover the rise in price of the furniture after the date when it was sold.”</span>

I have previously analysed Plantation’s financial position as at June/July 2008 in considerable detail, concluding that it was precarious to say the least since its sources of income were insufficient to meet its expenditure commitments. I have rejected the evidence given by Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam concerning the alleged Chescor deal. I have decided that there was no Chescor deal, and that the evidence given by Mr Bacon and Mr Fitzwilliam was essentially made up in order to support a case that, notwithstanding the apparent precariousness of Plantation’s financial position, Plantation would have had access to a substantial source of funding were it not for Mr Fitzwilliam’s arrest. I have also considered the evidence given by Mr Bacon concerning other third party interest in Plantation, specifically his evidence concerning Arbah Capital and Noor Capital. I have concluded that there is nothing in the suggestion that during the course of 2008 there was substantial interest by potential investors in Plantation, still less that there would have been any deal in place in time to enable Plantation to meet the obligation which arose on 1 October 2008. It is fanciful to suppose, in the circumstances, that proviso (i) to sub-paragraph would have come to Plantation’s rescue since application of that proviso would still have required 90%, and so a very substantial sum of money, to have been repaid. Plantation was, quite simply, in no position to pay anything like the amount of money which it would have had to pay on 1 October 2008. </p>

In these circumstances, Mr Anderson QC must be right when he submitted that Plantation has no entitlement to damages which take no account of what would, in any event, have happened even if DIB had not taken the action which it did in July 2008. The most that it is open to Plantation to seek by way of damages is a sum representing the loss suffered by reason of DIB having given itself what Mr Anderson QC described as a ‘paper title’ between mid-July and 1 October 2008, yet Plantation has put forward no such case as I shall explain when dealing with the damages issue. </p>

It is that, assuming that Plantation had done as required under the RSA and paid villa plot sales proceeds into an escrow account set up pursuant to Law No. 8 of 2007, such an account having been set up with DIB in May 2008 in the name of <span style="font-style:italic">“Plantation Arthur Fitzwilliam”</span> (albeit that, through no fault of its own, Plantation had problems using it which manifested themselves during the course of July and August 2008), then, the source of funding for all the polo facilities and Plantation’s other overhead costs would have abruptly ended, which would have meant that there was an immediate drying up of Plantation’s cash flow and an inevitable default for the purposes of clauses 18.1(e), (f) or (g) of the RSA. Specifically, Mr Anderson QC pointed out that Regulation 6.3 of the Trust Account Regulations which were issued by RERA in relation to Law No. 8 of 2007 imposed limits on what could be spent on management expenses (5% of approved construction costs) and marketing expenses (5% of <span style="font-style:italic">“sold value”</span>). Mr Anderson QC went on to highlight how in the Project Cost &amp; Revenue Certificate produced for RERA by Plantation’s auditors, Horwath Mak, as at 31 December 2007, marketing costs were shown as being estimated at AED 105,924,426, which equates to 5% of the estimated construction cost (AED 2,118,488,512) rather than, as required by Regulation 6.3, as 5% of <span style="font-style:italic">“sold value”</span>. In circumstances where the same document gave a figure of just AED 52,310,402 as the<span style="font-style:italic"> “Cash Received from Customer AED”</span>, Mr Anderson QC submitted, in my view with justification, that this would have been a more appropriate base figure to have used. Had that been done, then, the 5% marketing costs would have been a very much more modest AED 2,615,520. However, even leaving this curiosity to one side, the Certificate gave a<span style="font-style:italic"> “Paid Cost AED”</span> figure for marketing costs which exceeded the estimated costs by approximately AED 8 million (AED 113,918,184 as compared with AED 105,924,425). This means that Plantation would not have been permitted to spend more on marketing out of the escrow account. Since the evidence was that Plantation treated its expenditure on polo and equestrian activities as marketing expenditure, the rationale being that this would attract people to purchase villa plots, and since these activities were themselves loss-making, it was Mr Anderson QC’s submission that, absent external finance, Plantation would for this reason also have become unable to pay debts relating to the polo and equestrian activities which would have meant, in turn, that Plantation would have become insolvent in short order. Again, this may well be right, but I do not find it necessary to reach a concluded view on the matter.</p>

Since, as I have explained, the Project was loss-making in this period, it is very difficult indeed (if not impossible) to see how Plantation can really have suffered any loss which would merit an award of anything more than nominal damages. Plantation has, however, made no attempt at quantifying its loss by reference to that period, even in the alternative. Given this, it would have been open to me to take the view that no damages should be awarded at all. I am, however, persuaded that it would be appropriate, in the circumstances, to make an award of damages, albeit only in a nominal amount.</p>

This is that, although the respective valuation experts (Mr Donald Bradley for Plantation and Mr Simon Townsend for DIB) were essentially agreed on the appropriate valuation for Plantation as at June 2008 (and, as I understand it, also July 2008), Mr Townsend in fact taking the view that the appropriate valuation was AED 2,934,491,309 and so higher than Mr Bradley’s valuation of AED 2,870,000,000, those valuations assumed the existence of a market and there was none at that time.</p>

For example, a special purchaser may be an adjoining landowner or investor with a specific requirement for the proposed sector.

I had discussed the matter with my agency colleagues at CBRE who have specialised in the disposal of land and buildings in Dubai since 2006. Their assessment is in line with my own opinion that, at these dates, there was and is very limited demand, not just for the Plantation project but for large developments within Dubai and Dubai Land generally.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">At all the four valuation days there was a very limited group of investors who would have the financial resources to acquire land in the range of the Market Value, noting that any investor that acquired such a project would then have to spend the infrastructure monies to service the land to facilitate the plot sales. Investors with resources of this scale can secure large land parcels and potentially more attractive locations to develop assets more in line with market demand - one such example is Damac which acquired the now Akoya schemes. Not only was this land parcel acquired by Damac at a discount, the payment terms were very advantageous by being spread over a period of several years as opposed to a single initial capital payment on sale date. I simply do not believe that the Plantation project was always attractive to the very limited number of investors willing to purchase at this level. In addition to the issue of financial resources, there was also the question of the availability of investors with a willingness to take on a large scale projects [sic] and I would, again, can it in this respect, there would have been and remain a very limited demand across all the four dates. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I found Mr Bradley’s evidence not to be altogether satisfactory. It was argumentative and unnecessarily defensive. In addition and more substantively, whilst I make no criticism of the exercise performed by Mr Bradley, which involved him reviewing and commenting upon a valuation undertaken by Jones Lang LaSalle in August 2008 which resulted in an AED 4 billion valuation of the Plantation site, rather than performing his own valuation, Mr Townsend having agreed in the Joint Statement that <span style="font-style:italic">“this was an appropriate approach”</span>, the simple fact is that, unlike Mr Townsend, Mr Bradley did not in his report deal with the existence of a market issue in any depth. He plainly did do so to some extent in his discussions with Mr Townsend, as reflected in the Joint Statement which followed those discussions. Even then, however, Mr Bradley did not provide the information which he suggested to Mr Anderson QC during the course of cross-examination he had available to him. I have no hesitation, in the circumstances, in preferring the evidence given on this issue by Mr Townsend. Not only did Mr Townsend address the existence of a market issue head-on in his report, but I bear in mind also that he has very considerable experience of the Dubai property market which dates back to 2001 when he became Resident Partner &amp; Head of Valuation at Cluttons in Dubai and which takes in his subsequent experience, in the period from 2004 to 2008, as Director/Head Valuation &amp; Advisory at CBRE in Dubai (as well as other Dubai-based roles up to the present day). Mr Bradley, on the other hand, as Mr Anderson QC demonstrated during the course of cross-examination, had rather less Dubai-specific experience since his career (including in 2008 when, as he explained in his report, he was <span style="font-style:italic">“CEO of Knight Frank Middle East, supervising all teams in 18 MENA countries”</span>, as well as at the present time in his role as <span style="font-style:italic">“CEO at Savills Northern Gulf”</span>) has involved, as he acknowledged, <span style="font-style:italic">“a very wide ambit”</span>. I consider that, in the circumstances, there is substance in the submission made by Mr Anderson QC that Mr Bradley’s experience lay at something of a remove from the realities of the Dubai market in 2008. Furthermore, it should, in any event, be noted that in the Joint Statement Mr Bradley is recorded as merely saying that, in his opinion, the activity described in paragraph 4.13 <span style="font-style:italic">“potentially means that there would be a market”</span>. This, in fairness to Mr Bradley, is not entirely unequivocal.</p>
