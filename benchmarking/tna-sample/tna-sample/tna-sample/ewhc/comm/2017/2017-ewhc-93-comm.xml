	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants are collectively referred to in this judgment as MasterCard; it is not necessary to distinguish between them for the purposes of the issues which I have to decide.  MasterCard sets the level of fees to be charged for its credit and debit card transactions.  Such fees are known as multilateral interchange fees or “MIFs”.  The MIFs are (indirectly) paid by the merchants with whom cardholders use their cards to purchase goods or services.  Although MasterCard sets the MIFs, it does not receive them; the MIFs are paid to the institutions which issue the payment cards to cardholders.  The issuers are typically, but by no means exclusively, banks.  The Claimants are well known high street retailers who collectively claim to have paid a total of about £437 million by way of MIFs in the relevant period (broadly speaking since 2006).  The central issue in these cases is whether the MIFs set by MasterCard for credit and debit card transactions by consumers in the relevant period, and in the relevant territories (UK, Ireland and cross border transactions between EEA countries), are tortiously anti-competitive in breach of UK, Irish and EU competition law; and if so by how much.  </p>

The trial before me was to determine a number of issues which were selected and framed to determine all issues of liability and some issues affecting quantum (if relevant), in what was referred to as “the Phase 1 trial”.  Other questions relevant to quantum have been left for consideration (if appropriate) at a subsequent hearing (“the Phase 2 trial”).  </p>

In practice there are no material bilateral agreements, and so the MIF always applies.  This is not surprising: in a putative bilateral negotiation between an issuer and an acquirer the issuer has no incentive to accept less than the default MIF and the acquirer no incentive to offer more.   </p>

But within such groups (in the territories in issue and elsewhere) MasterCard also differentiated MIFs according to a variety of different factors, such as whether the transaction was face-to-face, online, or made by mail or telephone order; whether the card and/or the payment terminal had chip and pin functionality; how the payment was verified; whether cards were premium cards; and by the category of merchant. </p>

The expression acquirer’s margin was used sometimes to reflect this profit element, and sometimes to represent the difference between the MSC and the interchange fee so as to include scheme fees.  The evidence established that the acquirer’s margin on relevant transactions, in either sense, was a small proportion of the MSC; the MIF, which was to be passed on to the issuers, typically comprised over 90% of the MSC.  In the agreements between the Claimants and their acquirers in evidence in this case, a common charging structure for the MSC was for it to be expressed simply as interchange plus scheme fees plus acquirer’s margin, in which it was only necessary to quantify the latter as the element of the agreement between the merchant and the acquirer which was bespoke.   </p>

It is this aspect of the MIF which forms the central complaint of the Claimants in these proceedings.  By creating such a floor when setting default MIFs, MasterCard is said to have unlawfully restricted competition on the market between acquirers and merchants, with the result that the merchants have had to pay too much to accept MasterCard’s credit and debit cards.  </p>

These are not perhaps rigid categories, but by “premium” cards what is generally meant is a number of specifically designated MasterCard products (which in the relevant period have been called MasterCard World, MasterCard World Signia, and MasterCard World Elite) which have historically attracted higher MIF rates than MasterCard’s “standard” consumer credit offering.  Cards issued by Amex and Diners Club are described as premium cards because their merchant fee was much higher than the MasterCard MIF.  Premium cards are often reward cards: they reward cardholders for spend on those cards, for example in the form of cashback, loyalty points or air miles.  However, the converse is not the case: many reward cards offered to consumers are standard cards (both MasterCard and Visa), subject to the same MIF rates as other standard credit cards that offer no rewards (but perhaps, for example, more attractive interest rates, or balancetransfer terms).  There was evidence that at various times during the claim period in the UK about one third of credit and charge cards were premium cards.  Of four party scheme cards these were mostly MasterCard cards: although Visa offers a premium credit card, such cards have only a small market share, likely to be less than 1%.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:0.00in">The card industry distinguishes between two types of credit card user: “revolvers” and “transactors”.  Transactors pay off their bill in full at the end of every month, and so do not make use of a credit facility above and beyond the interest-free period.  Revolvers, on the other hand, roll over some or all of their debt at the end of the month, and thus pay interest.  Premium cards and reward cards are generally aimed at transactors, who by definition have no real need of extended credit: the rewards are an incentive for them to use credit cards despite that fact.  </p>

The MIF is set as a default MIF in the Scheme Rules, which comprise part of the contractual terms between MasterCard and each issuer and acquirer.  The payment of the MIF is made pursuant to the terms of the agreements between MasterCard and its licensees.  Moreover the payment of the MIF at the levels set by MasterCard was a concerted practice.  This was not in issue in anything other than a formal sense: the Claimants were also alleging that MasterCard constituted an association of undertakings; in the course of the trial it was agreed between the parties that the Claimants would not pursue such an allegation in return for MasterCard’s undertaking that it would advance no argument against the proposition that there was a relevant agreement or concerted practice.  This was not a formal concession, but MasterCard’s position was plainly realistic: the setting of the MIF was pursuant to an agreement between undertakings and was a concerted practice.

MasterCard’s argument to the same effect was successful before the Competition Appeal Tribunal: see particularly paragraphs 130 to 137 of its judgment.  The Claimants, on the other hand, argued that the relevant market was confined to the market in acquiring services alone; all that was required to be proved was a restriction in the market between acquirers and merchants; and that provided that such a restriction was made out, the effect of the MIFs on the issuing and inter-system market, and any benefits there created, were matters for consideration within the framework of Article 101(3), not 101(1).  This was the conclusion reached by the Commission in the <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span> Commission Decision: see paragraph 316.  It is not necessary for me to address these rival arguments, because in the course of final speeches MasterCard conceded that I was bound by a recent decision of the General Court dated 30 June 2016 in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Groupement des Cartes Bancaires (CB) v Commission</span> Case T-491/07 RENV to hold that the Claimants were right on this point and that the relevant market was solely the acquiring market.

It arises where there is a main operation which is neutral or pro-competitive but has as one of its constituent parts what would be a restraint on the autonomy of the parties if considered in isolation.  The ancillary restraint will not offend the prohibition in Article 101(1) if it is directly related and objectively necessary to the implementation of the main operation and proportionate to its objectives: see the Article 101(3) Guidelines paragraph 29.  The requirement of objective <span style="font-style:italic">necessity</span> means that it must be shown that in the absence of the ancillary restraint the main operation would be impossible to carry out; it is not sufficient if it would merely be more difficult or less profitable.

Contrary to what the appellants claim, the fact that that operation is simply more difficult to implement or even less profitable without the restriction concerned cannot be deemed to give that restriction the ‘objective necessity’ required in order for it to be classified as ancillary.

This is referred to as the “ancillary restraint” counterfactual.  However the test for choosing the ancillary restraint counterfactual is slightly different from that which determines choice of the restriction counterfactual.

For the ancillary restraint doctrine it is enough for a person complaining of infringement to point to one or more counterfactuals which <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> arise, by comparison with which the ancillary restraint is not necessary for the survival of the main operation.  By contrast, in order for the prohibition in Article 101(1) to bite on the restriction, it must be a restriction on competition by comparison with a restriction counterfactual which <span style="font-style:italic">likely would</span> arise.

In particular, the new regime aimed to decentralise the enforcement of EU competition law by devolving authority to NCAs and/or national courts.  The NCAs and national courts are charged with applying EU competition law consistently and uniformly across the Member States and in close cooperation with the Commission: see Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation 1/2003.  </p>

First, I am not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and although it is sometimes possible to discern the evidence before the Commission which informed its conclusions, that is by no means generally the case.  There is a logical flaw in the suggestion that this court should follow another tribunal’s findings of fact unless it can identify a specific and material difference in evidence when this court is not in a position to identify the extent of the evidence before that tribunal.  There was, for example, a lively debate on whether by reference to the memorandum referred to at recitals 626ff and in Annex 7 the Commission had considered UK MIFs.  It remains unclear exactly what aspect of this evidence the Commission took into account or how, without an understanding of which it is impossible to assess the validity of any “read across”.   </p>

The state of the markets was not identical and the data which I have had to work on is time specific and was not addressed by the Commission.  It is also the case that economic theory has developed over the relevant period in a way which was simply not considered by the Commission.  Moreover the link between MasterCard and the issuing and acquiring banks has also changed.  For most of the period considered by the Commission the licensees could be closely identified with MasterCard in terms of economic interest.  All acquirers were issuers, and MasterCard was owned by the issuers and acquirers; it was in substance the issuing and acquiring banks which were setting the MIFs.  The terms of the Commission Decision suggest that this was a commercial reality which it regarded as important, and which is reflected in its language throughout: see, by way of example, the language of paragraph 13 referring to “MasterCard’s member banks” setting the MIF.  Following an Initial Public Offering on 25 May 2006 (“the IPO”), the banks’ shareholding was reduced to a substantial minority shareholding (41%) with no voting rights, but a right to appoint three members of the Global Board of directors (eight being appointed by public investors and a charitable foundation).  Bank equity in MasterCard declined to 15% in June 2010 and thereafter the banks had no right to appoint any directors.  Since 2010 the banks’ equity interest has continued to decline so that today MasterCard licensees hold less than 2% of the economic interest in MasterCard, with no voting rights.   </p>

To give some examples, the UK credit card market sits in a culture of free banking, compared with say France where typically cardholders pay a substantial annual fee; the number of card payments and average spend per cardholder per inhabitant in the UK in 2014 (167 transactions totalling €9,996) is more than double that for the average in Europe (79 transactions totalling €4,055), and the position is more pronounced if one compares the UK market over the claim period with Europe prior to 2007; the same is true of the number of cards per person, with UK inhabitants averaging over 2.5 cards compared with the European average of 1.5; this comparatively higher degree of penetration of cards in the UK is potentially relevant to competition between issuers and schemes in circumstances where cardholders can choose between cards they hold in making payment; credit cards accounted for around 11% of overall consumer transactions in the UK in 2014 compared with 4% in the rest of Europe; the UK has a disproportionately high share of online card sales compared with the rest of Europe: some 25% of all European e-commerce sales.  These are but a few examples.  It would be an unduly difficult and burdensome exercise first to try to identify all differences between the markets over a period of almost 25 years and then seek to attribute weight or significance, or the lack of it, to each difference.   </p>

Insofar as it made findings of law, I am not bound by its decision, but I naturally accord it considerable respect, coming from a body chaired by a judge of coordinate jurisdiction and which has very considerable competition law experience.  However I have had the benefit of argument from a different legal team on the Claimants’ side, and of argument on both sides addressed specifically to the reasoning expressed in the CAT Judgment.  This has inevitably resulted in different formulations and refinements of the legal arguments from those which were presented to the CAT, and in one instance an important authority being brought to my attention which was not before the CAT. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:0.00in">There is also, of course, a very substantial overlap between the factual issues decided by the CAT and those I have to decide.  Here too I am not bound by the findings, although the parties agreed I should take them into account and give them such weight as I thought appropriate.  It is important to keep in mind in this context that the evidence before me was not the same as that before the CAT in important respects.  For example, the CAT Bilaterals counterfactual, which is at the heart of the CAT’s conclusion, was a construct of the Tribunal itself; it had not been addressed in the witness statements or experts reports of either party and had not been put to factual witnesses.  By contrast the parties put before me detailed factual and expert evidence on the point, tailored specifically to the findings and reasoning in the CAT Judgment, which was all to the effect that such bilaterals were unrealistic.  Moreover there was no identity between expert evidence in the two trials: Dr Niels gave evidence for MasterCard in both cases but different experts gave evidence on behalf of the respective claimants.  They were not expressing the same views.  For example, in the CAT proceedings Sainsbury’s and its expert accepted that a MIF at some positive level was lawful; whereas the Claimants before me and their expert contended that any MIF above zero was unlawful.  Nor was there anything like identity in the factual evidence put before the CAT and this court, either documentary or oral.  The CAT had documentary material which was not in evidence before me and vice versa.  The CAT heard from four Sainsbury’s witnesses whose evidence I did not have; whereas I heard from a variety of Claimants’ witnesses whose evidence was not before the CAT.  Some MasterCard witnesses were common to both sets of proceedings but some were not.  The experience of having arguments and evidence tested in the Sainsbury’s proceedings inevitably led to fuller or more focused evidence before me on some points, both factual and expert; for example Dr Niels had the opportunity to consider over time, and address in writing, points which he had faced in cross examination in the CAT without forewarning.  Even where the evidence was materially similar, I must make my own assessment of the witnesses and the other evidence before me; it would be an abdication of judicial responsibility simply to accept findings of fact made by the CAT. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">The value of the claims in these actions lies overwhelmingly in the dispute over UK domestic MIFs for credit cards.  The UK is much the largest of the relevant markets, accounting for about 98% of the claim.  Between 98% and 99% of card transaction volumes in the UK are generated by domestic transactions to which the UK MIFs applied, rather than cross border transactions which would include, amongst others, transactions to which the intra EEA MIFs applied.  Ireland is a smaller and far less mature payment market than the UK, having one of the highest usages of cash and cheques in Europe.  The claim is heavily weighted towards credit card transactions because MasterCard’s share of the UK debit card market after 2009 was very small following the near collapse of the Maestro brand in circumstances considered more fully below; and the Irish debit card market has also been dominated by Visa, so that over 94% of the claims are referable to credit card transactions.  The upshot is that the parties naturally devoted the bulk of their energies and evidence to the UK market and to credit card transactions, with the result that the evidence and analysis was more developed in those respects. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.83in;margin-right:0.00in">Over the period, the proportion of cards issued and of card spend became more heavily weighted towards debit cards and against credit cards.  In 2006 there were 69.5 million credit cards issued (spend £150 billion) and 68.7 million debit cards (spend £348 billion).  In 2015 there were 59 million credit cards issued (spend £178 billion) and 95.7 million debit cards (spend £670 billion).  This increase in the use of debit cards is explained in part by the use of debit cards replacing the use of credit cards, but to a much greater extent it reflected a drop in the use of cash; debit cards were replacing the use of cash at the tills and in online sales.  A similar but more recent trend from credit to debit card use is apparent in Ireland.  </p>

The project identified various options which were presented to the MasterCard Executive Committee in February 2008.  Of these only a hybrid new business model was thought potentially feasible as an alternative to the MIF setting structure.  That model involved charging higher fees to acquirers and using the revenue to provide financial incentives to both issuers and merchants to issue and accept cards pursuant to bilateral agreements with them.  This model was subsequently found to face both regulatory opposition and legal difficulties which caused it to be put aside.  The option adopted was to reduce EEA MIFs pending the appeal from the Commission Decision.  </p>

This was called Project Alhambra, and focussed on MasterCard’s four key domestic markets in Europe, being UK, France, Spain and Germany.  Project Alhambra had in mind the options considered by Project Porsche, discussed below, and other possibilities, but in particular was set up to explore the potential introduction of a premium product which was exclusively fee based and which would not attract interchange. </p>

Project Porsche absorbed Project Alhambra.  It took account of options considered by Project Forward and Project Alhambra, but was seen as a clean slate to consider all potential business responses to the current environment.  It considered as potential alternatives (1) non interchange fee based models (including the Project Alhambra fee based model, which had been trialled in Germany); (2) exclusive licencing of a single issuer; (3) a three party model; and (4) a domestic franchising model.  For varying reasons none were regarded as sufficiently viable from a legal, commercial and regulatory perspective.   </p>

Such a rule is necessary because if there were no such rule, and no bilateral agreement reached in advance, the issuer could hold the acquirer to ransom by refusing to pay unless and until the acquirer agreed to whatever deduction was demanded by the issuer.  The Honour All Cards Rule means that the merchant has to accept the issuer’s cards for all transactions, so that the merchant needs to be paid by the acquirer and the acquirer by the issuer; but if there is no agreement in place, the acquirer has to pay whatever the issuer demands.  This was described by the experts as “the hold-up problem”.  As Mr Dryden explained, and this was not controversial, a system with no MIF and a prohibition on ex post pricing is the same in its practical and economic effect as a system with a MIF with the MIF set at zero, because it is a default clearing rule which provides that the issuer is bound to pay in full absent a bilateral agreement.   </p>

This is because if MasterCard set its MIFs at zero, or even at a positive but significantly lower putatively lawful level, the MasterCard scheme would collapse: the issuers would in a short period of time all switch to issuing Visa cards; and the competition from Amex would reinforce the outcome.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The contention that the death spiral argument applies equally to the issue of restriction of competition is in my judgement correct.  In the way it was framed, it assumes that the relevant acquiring market is in MasterCard cards alone, not all four party scheme cards including Visa.  If so, the elimination of the MasterCard scheme eliminates the whole of the comparator market and the MIFs cannot be more restrictive of competition on that market than if it did not exist.  The contention holds good even if the relevant acquiring market is defined to include Visa cards, in which case the death spiral counterfactual world would involve a market on which acquirers could only compete for merchants’ Visa card business as the only available four party scheme.  The MasterCard MIFs cannot be a restriction of competition by reference to that counterfactual unless the elimination of the MasterCard scheme would result in Visa’s MIFs being lower than both (a) those which MasterCard set and (b) those which Visa set.  Despite the evidence that the inter-system market created an upward pressure on MIFs, there was nothing in the evidence which enabled me to conclude that in the absence of the MasterCard scheme, Visa’s MIFs would reduce to an appreciably lower level than that at which MasterCard’s had been set, or an appreciably lower level than existing Visa MIFs.  It would be for the Claimants to prove such difference and they did not seek to do so.  Indeed in the context of the ancillary restraint argument Mr Lowenstein accepted that the starting point was that the existence of the MasterCard scheme (ignoring the MIF) was at least neutral if not pro-competitive.  If so, the non-existence of the scheme could not be treated as procompetitive on all markets, including the acquiring market.   </p>

This was because the parties perceived that the order in which the points were addressed mattered when it came to the assumptions which should be made about Visa’s MIFs for the purposes of the death spiral argument.  Mr Lowenstein submitted that the restriction of competition issue should come first, because the ancillary restraint argument was only logically relevant to the outcome if the MIFs were a restraint which would otherwise be a restriction of competition and so engage Article 101(1).  He pointed to the language of paragraph 91 of the MasterCard CJEU Judgment which talks of the ancillary restraint doctrine as involving “… determining whether an anti-competitive restriction can escape the prohibition laid down in [Article 101(1)] …”; and to the terms of paragraph 29 of the Article 101(3) Guidelines.  Mr Hoskins QC pointed out that the ancillary restraint doctrine as articulated in paragraph 89 of the same Judgment applies to “restrictions on commercial autonomy”, which would include anything as simple as a contractual obligation, not restrictions of competition as such; and that European courts had often addressed the ancillary restraint issue first (as for example in the MasterCard CJEU Judgment), or as the sole issue without determining whether there is a restriction of competition (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Gottrup-Klim Grovvareforeni v Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab AmbA</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">(DLG)</span> (1992) C-250/92).  </p>

The Commission’s solution to the holdup problem presented by pure bilaterals was to import into the counterfactual hypothesis a scheme rule which prohibited any fee deduction in the absence of prior agreement; this was the so called “prohibition on ex post pricing” (see paragraph 554).  As I have explained, it is for practical purposes the same as a MIF set at zero.  This was the Claimants’ primary case and I will refer to it as the no MIF or zero MIF counterfactual. </p>

This posits the emergence of voluntary bilateral agreements between each pair of issuers and acquirers, reached by negotiation between all issuers and acquirers in advance of the time of settlement (“ex ante”), which would provide for a positive interchange fee.  This was the counterfactual adopted by the CAT, which concluded that in a world of no MIF with a prohibition on ex post pricing there would emerge voluntary bilateral agreements between issuers and acquirers under which a positive interchange fee would be agreed to be deductible by issuers at a level below that of the MIFs as set by MasterCard.  These bilateral agreements might potentially arise in the face of a zero MIF set by MasterCard, or in the face of a scheme with no MIF and a prohibition on ex post pricing, which is the same in practice.   </p>

The first relates to the conclusion of the CAT that such a prohibition on ex post pricing is already inherent in Rules 8.2 and 8.3 of the existing Scheme Rules in the absence of a positive MIF: see the CAT Judgment at paragraphs 141-146.  MasterCard pressed me with English authority on the availability and applicability of the “blue pencil” test to contractual provisions in arguing that the CAT’s conclusion was erroneous.  This is an arid debate for the purpose of the issue under consideration.  The question is whether a prohibition on ex post pricing is realistic and likely as a restriction counterfactual if there were no MIF setting by MasterCard (or realistic and one which might arise for the purposes of the ancillary restraint counterfactual).  That is a hypothetical question.  The current scheme rules, which are drafted in the context of positive MIFs being set by MasterCard, are unlikely to shed light on what hypothetically would be contained in the scheme rules if MasterCard were leaving it to the issuers and acquirers to determine pricing.  Moreover, since a scheme rule prohibiting ex post pricing is equivalent to a scheme rule in which MasterCard sets the MIF but does so at zero, it seems to me immaterial whether that effect was achieved by one or other of the two routes.  The question is whether a scheme which has that practical effect is one which is realistic.  </p>

MasterCard did not consider such a rule because it equally did not consider a “pure bilateral" situation in which such a solution would have been necessary to avoid the hold-up problem.  If the survival of the scheme required such a rule, because of the hold-up problem, I have little doubt that it would have been adopted.  But in any event, if the same result is achieved by having scheme rules which are exactly as in the current form with MasterCard explicitly setting the MIF at zero, the realism or otherwise of a specific prohibition on ex post pricing is neither here nor there as an alternative route to achieving the same result.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.00in">The fundamental premise of the CAT’s conclusion is that merchants would be willing to pay a positive interchange fee in order to avoid a Visa monopoly of four party schemes.  It is implicit in this premise that merchants would perceive that they would be better off with inter-system competition from MasterCard than if there were a Visa monopoly.  However the evidence before me from both experts was that the competition between Visa and MasterCard on the inter-system market put upward pressure on interchange fees.  That was also the view of the Commission in relation to intra EEA MIFs: see the MasterCard Commission Decision at paragraphs 467-470.  Although this might seem counterintuitive, it is the result of the fact that the two sided platform operates to create the maximum use of the scheme as a whole (”system output” in the economic jargon), if more cards are issued.  The more MasterCard and Visa can persuade issuers to issue their respective cards, the greater MasterCard’s and Visa’s respective revenue, because the scheme operator’s revenue in the form of licencing fees is maximised by maximising system output.  MasterCard charges issuers and acquirers for clearing and settlement services on a per transaction basis as well as other fees to licensees for participation.  The result is that it is in the interests of both Visa and MasterCard when competing with each other to offer higher MIFs to issuers in order to encourage them to issue their own cards.  This obviously has some natural upper limit at the point where merchants decline to pay for the benefit of accepting their cards, but within that boundary the inter-system competition puts upward pressure on MIFs.  Accordingly the CAT’s implicit premise that merchants as a whole would perceive that they would be better off with competition from MasterCard in the inter-system market was not a sound one on the evidence before me.  In theory it might be the case that merchants would desire the competition in respect to card functionality which would exist from competition between MasterCard and Visa, but there was no evidence before me of any distinctions in functionality which would make that so, or that if they existed they would outweigh the upward pressure on MIFs of a market with both schemes.  The evidence before me does not support a conclusion that merchants would have had, or perceived, an incentive to keep the MasterCard scheme going, which the CAT identified as the primary motivation for merchants volunteering to pay a bilaterally agreed interchange fee.  It is noteworthy that when MasterCard lost almost all the debit card market represented by Maestro to Visa in 2009 to 2011, there was no move from merchants to help MasterCard stay in the debit card market because of fears of a Visa monopoly.  Whether the collapse was primarily due to price (as MasterCard contend) or differences in functionality (as the Claimants contend), or both, the point is that merchants appear to have regarded the potential disappearance of MasterCard from the debit card market with equanimity.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.00in">Even assuming that it would be collectively in the interests of merchants to preserve the existence of the MasterCard scheme, it was the combined view of the experts before me that no such collective move to agree positive interchange fees would emerge from the behaviour of individual merchants, absent some agreement or concerted practice which was itself unlawfully anticompetitive.  Each merchant would be individually unwilling to pay an interchange fee which was any greater than that of its competitors.  Faced with the default position that it need not pay any interchange fee at all, it would not be likely to agree to pay one, let alone at 0.5%, unless confident that this would be a level playing field with its competitors.  Yet there is no plausible (lawful) mechanism under which this would come about.  This expert evidence is consistent with the evidence of Mr Douglas, who considered it very likely that merchants would award their business in the hypothetical world (as they do in the real world) to an acquirer who could offer the lowest price.  I found convincing the views of both experts that individual merchants would be highly likely to be attracted by offers of zero interchange, since they would be at a competitive disadvantage if their competitors did so and they did not.  The same point was encapsulated in another way by Mr Dryden, who said that even if merchants and acquirers collectively benefit from positive interchange fees, each individual merchant would prefer to free-ride on other merchants paying interchange fees, and transfer their acquiring business to acquirers who do not pay interchange fees, and so charge lower MSCs. An individual merchant agreeing to pay interchange fees (via MSCs) would bear all of the cost of the interchange fee but would get only a fraction of the benefits, and thus would risk disadvantaging itself compared to other merchants because of the free-rider problem.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, if one looks at it from the perspective of acquirers, it was the convincing evidence of both experts that as a matter of economic analysis, and on the reasonable assumption that the acquiring market is competitive, competition amongst acquirers would produce the outcome that merchants want, i.e. zero interchange fees.  An acquirer which attempted to recover a positive interchange fee through a higher MSC would lose business to acquirers which did not do so.  Faced with such a competitive threat, acquirers would therefore have no incentive to pay positive interchange fees to issuers.  This was supported by the evidence of Mr Willaert and Mr Douglas.  As Mr Willaert put it in his evidence: “…it would be suicidal for an individual acquirer unilaterally to charge a higher price to merchants than its competitors.” </p>

The CAT was faced with conflicting and anecdotal evidence of the number of issuers and acquirers in the UK market, from which it concluded that there were no more than 20 issuers and no more than 10 acquirers.  It did not identify the extent of overlap between issuers and acquirers but concluded that “substantially all UK domestic MasterCard transactions could be caught by relatively few bilateral agreements” (paragraph 184). </p>

Given the HACR, there would have to be bilateral agreements in place between all pairs of issuers and acquirers, not just substantially all.

In none of those projects were bilaterals seriously considered as a viable option. Mr Willaert convincingly explained why the systems in the two jurisdictions in which bilateral agreements were employed, Sweden and Estonia, were underpinned by particular local circumstances which did not pertain to the UK, Ireland and cross border EEA transactions, and formed no useful comparator as to what might emerge in the territories with which I am concerned.   </p>

The question of whether MasterCard would have been driven out of the market if there were a differential of 0.3% between its credit card interchange fee and Visa’s credit card MIF was not the subject of any evidence before the Tribunal.  These were figures arrived at by the CAT after the hearing had finished in the course of drafting its Judgment.  Unlike the Tribunal, this court has had the benefit of evidence on this issue.  My conclusion, for the reasons discussed more fully below when addressing the death spiral argument, is that a differential of this amount would still lead to issuers switching to Visa and to the MasterCard credit card scheme collapsing.   </p>

It does not assist the Claimants merely to say that something would have been done, without identifying what.  The Claimants did not contend, for example, that any of the possibilities contemplated by Project Porsche or Project Alhambra was realistic or should be taken as a specific counterfactual.

They imposed a floor below which the MSC could not fall, because acquirers had to pay at least that much to issuers and had to recoup it from the merchants, which in turn led to higher prices charged by acquirers to merchants through the MSC than if the MIF were lower or zero.  Such a floor restricts competition because it interferes with the ability of acquirers to compete for merchants’ business by offering MSCs below such floor.  It is no different in kind from a collective agreement by manufacturers to maintain inflated wholesale prices, which prevents wholesalers competing on the retail market below those prices. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hoskins challenged this conclusion on a number of grounds.  First he submitted that the fact that a higher price is produced by one methodology rather than another is not in itself a sufficient criterion for establishing a restriction of competition; he gave as an example an auction, which is specifically designed to achieve a higher price for the seller but is not anti-competitive for that reason alone.  This is true, but irrelevant to the current debate.  What makes the increase in price anti-competitive in this case is the effect it has on the ability of acquirers to compete for merchants’ business.  The analogy with an auction is a false one, because an auction involves a single seller, not a group of sellers who reach a collusive agreement.  An auction is merely a platform on which competition between buyers is maximised vis a vis a single seller.  Even in an auction with a reserve, in which a seller sets a minimum price, there is nothing anti-competitive because a single seller is free to set a price, absent abuse of a dominant position.  The difference between a seller’s auction reserve and the MIF is that the former does not involve a relevant collusive agreement or concerted practice, whereas what engages Article 81 is a “collective act” (see <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard </span>Commission Decision at paragraph 457).  The only collective act or collusion is the agreement between buyers and sellers for the auction process to take place; that is not collusion on a given or minimum price but collusion to set a competitive process for determination of the price.  By contrast, setting the MIF involves a collusive agreement to set a minimum price for the MSC without any such process.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly Mr Hoskins submitted that the evidence of both experts was that competition in the acquiring market is not affected by the level of the MIF.  This was a mischaracterisation of the evidence.  Mr Dryden’s evidence was not that there would be no material difference in competition <span style="font-style:italic">on the acquiring market</span>, but merely that the level of the MIF did not affect the ability of acquirers to compete with each other <span style="font-style:italic">on the acquirer’s margin</span>.  His evidence was that the MIF <span style="font-weight:bold">did</span> restrict competition by creating a floor, a restriction which is not removed or mitigated by the ability to compete on margin.  Dr Niels stated that “Even if the MIF has the effect of raising the price in the acquiring market, this does not restrict acquirer’s ability to compete on the level of acquiring margin.  Acquiring competition would be the same whether the MIF is set at say zero or at 1%.”  This reasoning is fallacious because it conflates competition on “the level of the acquiring margin” with “acquiring competition” as a shorthand for competition on the acquiring market.  It ignores the restriction on an acquirer from setting a MSC below the MIF.  It is equivalent to saying that a manufacturers’ pricing agreement which inflates the price charged to wholesalers is not a restriction of competition on the retail market because wholesalers are free to compete on the margin of profit they charge in the retail price to customers, a proposition whose falsity is self-evident.   </p>

The provision under scrutiny gave the partnership preferential broadcasting rights in respect of certain programmes produced by the parties to the agreement.  They argued that it was objectively necessary to have such a restriction because the object of the partnership was to break into the market for the broadcasting of satellite pay-TV programmes and services in digital mode.  The General Court upheld the Commission’s decision that the competition faced by the partnership in breaking into the new market was irrelevant in determining whether the restriction was objectively necessary for the operation of the partnership: the ancillary restraint doctrine was a relatively narrow and abstract one in which the inquiry was directed simply to whether the restraint was necessary to implement the main operation, not whether it was necessary to make the main operation a commercial success.

Indeed the essence of the whole passage from that decision which is quoted above is that it was the competition faced by the purchaser from the vendor which was capable of rendering a non-competition clause necessary as an ancillary restraint.  Mr Lowenstein pointed out, correctly, that the relevant competition in that case, to which the Court was referring in paragraph 18, was competition between the two parties to the agreement, not competition from third parties in the market.  But this seems to me to be a distinction without a relevant difference.  I can see no logical reason for confining the inquiry into the effect of competition to only one source of competition.  If competition from the other party to the agreement is relevant in determining whether the ancillary restraint is necessary for the survival of the main operation, it is difficult to see why competition from third parties which makes it equally necessary should be irrelevant. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This conclusion seems to me to be consistent with the purpose of the ancillary restraint doctrine and its rationale within the framework of the control of anticompetitive activity laid down in Article 101.  Where an operation has a neutral or positive competitive effect, it is not objectionable; therefore it ought not to be rendered unlawful by reason of some constituent element being a restriction if taken in isolation from the greater operation of which it forms a necessary part.  If it is a necessary part of a desirable whole, the restraint “escapes” the application of Article 101(1): it is simply outside the scope of the type of restraints which are offensive to EU competition law.  The doctrine is aimed at permitting the main operation where it would be unable to function if the constituent part were removed.  That involves choosing a counterfactual which is “realistic”.  If the main operation would be unable to survive in the realistic counterfactual world as a result of competition, the policy of the doctrine is engaged.  There is no logic in drawing a distinction between non survival which arises from something inherent in the structure of the main operation itself and non-survival arising from external pressures on the main operation in the realistic counterfactual world.  It is clear from paragraph 111 of the <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span> CJEU Judgment that the inquiry has to address whether the operation is “economically viable”.  To include economic consideration of all kinds other than competition is illogical, and moreover likely to be impractical in many cases.  Further, such exclusion is inconsistent with the concept of the counterfactual being “realistic”.  An ancillary restraint counterfactual which ignores what would in fact happen when the counterfactual assumptions are made can hardly be regarded as realistic. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lowenstein’s explanation of the rationale for the restrictive approach for which he was contending was that at the Article 101(1) stage, all one was concerned with was whether the restraint was necessary for the main operation to function at all, because if it is argued that the restriction is to benefit competition with third parties, that is an argument about the pro-competitive benefit of the restriction, which falls to be analysed under Article 101(3).  This echoed what was said in paragraphs 107 and 108 of <span style="font-style:italic">Metropole</span> which immediately precede the passage relied on.  But the approach dictated by <span style="font-style:italic">Remia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Gottrup-Klim</span> does not cut across the scheme of Articles 101(1) and 101(3) and does not require any weighing up of pro- and anti-competitive effects which is the function of Article 101(3).  It requires an analysis of whether the main operation requires the ancillary restraint to be in place in order to be able to operate in the realistic counterfactual world.  It starts from the premise that the main operation is desirable in competition terms because it has positive or neutral competitive effects.  If that is so, the restrictive part falls outside the scope of Article 101 altogether if it is a necessary part of the desirable main operation.  In deciding whether it is necessary, one examines what would happen realistically without it.  If competition would kill off the main operation without the restriction being in place, the restriction is necessary for the main operation.  That does not involve weighing pro and anticompetitive benefits, or making a value judgement in relation to such benefits; it is a binary question whether the main operation would survive at all in the realistic counterfactual world, taking account of such competitive pressures as would exist in that counterfactual world. </p>

The case concerned restrictions in franchising arrangements for selling wedding dresses.  At paragraphs [14] to [15] the Court identified the legitimate pro-competitive aspects of a franchise distribution agreement in permitting a franchisor to take advantage of his business experience and acumen in building up his know-how and commercial methods, which meant that it was not by itself a restriction on competition.  At paragraphs [16] to [22] the Court identified restrictions in the franchising agreement which were justifiable as objectively necessary for the franchisor’s business and fell outside the scope of Article 101(1); these included restrictions on the franchisee from opening a shop in an area where he would be in competition with another franchisee.  They were outside Article 101(1) because they were objectively necessary for the franchisor’s business in preserving the legitimate protection of his know-how.  At paragraphs [23] to [24], on the other hand, the Court addressed a clause which required the franchisee to sell the franchised goods only at the named location, the vice of which was that the franchisee was prevented from doing so at a second location; and because this was a term for all franchisees it involved the franchisor determining the geographical division of the market for the franchised goods.  As the Court put it: “The juxtaposition of clauses of this type results in a kind of market partitioning between the franchisor and the franchisees or among the franchisees and thus restricts competition within the network.”  It was for that reason that the clause was held to be a restriction of competition falling within Article 101(1).  </p>

The passage comes at the end of an analysis of what is necessary for <span style="font-style:italic">the franchisors’</span> business and in particular necessary for the existence of such a franchise business which taken as a whole is neutral in competition terms.  As the terms of the preceding paragraphs make clear, the passage is addressed to the question whether the franchisor could escape the operation of Article 101(1) by invoking the benefits to a franchisee of such a restriction, so as to justify the restriction <span style="font-style:italic">from the point of view of the franchisor’s operation as one which attracted franchisees</span>.  In the language of the ancillary restraint doctrine, the “main operation” being considered was that of the franchisor, not the franchisee.  In that context, the competition faced by the franchisee was a consideration which fell within Article 101(3) rather than 101(1) because it was a franchisor asserting that the restriction conferred a benefit to it, the franchisor, in attracting franchisees; but that benefit could not take the franchisor outside the scope of Article 101(1) because the franchisor could not suggest that it was objectively necessary for his operation; it was therefore a benefit (to the franchisor) which fell to be weighed in the Article 101(3) exercise.  The Court was not concerned with whether the term was objectively necessary for the survival of a franchisee, and the passage relied on was simply not addressed to an issue of whether competition faced by the franchisee made the restriction objectively necessary for the franchisee’s operation.  It tells one nothing about the relevance or otherwise of market competition to that question, or to the issue which arises before me.   </p>

One can ignore for present purposes whether the MasterCard MIFs would be saved by exemption under Article 101(3) because if they are exempt under Article 101(3), the death spiral argument now under consideration is irrelevant.  So the counterfactual of a MasterCard zero MIF assumes that the materially identical Visa MIFs are a restriction of competition unless saved by an equivalent death spiral argument to the effect that they would have been necessary for the Visa scheme to survive in the face of competition from MasterCard’s actual MIFs as set by MasterCard.   </p>

But if the schemes are materially identical, Visa’s MIFs, which are also a restraint, could only be justified as an ancillary restraint if necessary for the survival of the Visa scheme, which could only be established in the face of MasterCard’s MIFs being as set, rather than, as required by the counterfactual world in which the argument arises, a zero MasterCard MIF.

Mr Hoskins accepted that such an argument would not be available, but on the grounds that cartels were restrictions <span style="font-style:italic">by object</span>, which were unlawful per se irrespective of effect, which would not apply to a consideration of agreements said to be anti-competitive <span style="font-style:italic">by effect</span> only.

If one posits a “cartel” agreement which on its particular facts had an anti-competitive effect, there is no reason why it should be saved by a rival “cartel” agreement which was anticompetitive by effect any more than if either or both were anti-competitive by object.  If it were established that the terms of the anti-competitive agreements were materially identical, it would be a surprising result if each escaped unlawfulness by reference to competition from the other.

The Tribunal did not abstain from making presumptions; it made a presumption about Visa’s MIFs in the counterfactual, namely that they would be as set.  That must involve one of two assumptions: either it involves assuming that the lawfulness of Visa’s MIFs is irrelevant to the argument, a proposition which I have rejected and which ultimately was not pursued by MasterCard; or it assumes that Visa’s MIFs as set were lawful, which for the reasons I have endeavoured to explain is not a sound assumption if the premise of Mr Lowenstein’s argument is correct, namely that there is no material distinction between the schemes. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">I cannot accept that this is the right approach in either respect.  In order for the premise to hold good, the features of the two schemes must be <span style="font-style:italic">materially</span> identical.  In this context what is material is whether and to what extent the Visa MIFs as set constituted an unlawful restriction of competition infringing Article 101; or, put another way, what MIFs could lawfully have been set by Visa without infringing Article 101.  That requires a consideration of all the features of the scheme which might affect the lawfulness of Visa MIFs, not just those which arise under Article 101(1) issues; it includes those which are relevant to Article 101(3) issues as they would apply to the Visa scheme.  Unless the features of both schemes are identical in all respects which would affect the outcome of that legal inquiry, they are not <span style="font-style:italic">materially</span> identical.  If, for example, there were features of the Visa scheme which would impact on the putatively lawful level of MIF determined as exemptible under Article 101(3), which differed from the MasterCard scheme, the schemes would not be materially identical for the purposes of the present inquiry.  If Visa credit card MIFs were a restriction of competition at the levels set but would have been lawfully exemptible at say 0.7%, to take a hypothetical example, that is the lawful level of Visa MIF which would have to be taken as that with which MasterCard would have been competing, in a MasterCard zero MIF counterfactual, for the purposes of analysing the death spiral argument; or with which a putatively lawful MasterCard MIF, which on this hypothesis might be might be lower and different, would have been competing in the putatively lawful counterfactual.   That would be the Visa MIF with which to populate what Mr Lowenstein called the counterfactual world of lawfulness.  It is not sufficient, as Mr Lowenstein argued, to posit material identity between the schemes only in respect of aspects which are relevant to the restriction of competition issue under Article 101(1) and ignoring aspects which may affect a lawful level which is exemptible under Article 101(3).   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the burden of proof on the material identity of the schemes, it is ultimately the Claimants who would fail on the relevant issue if the burden were not discharged.  It is true that insofar as the issue arises for the purposes of the ancillary restraint argument, that is an argument on which MasterCard bears the evidential burden of proof.  However the issue also arises for the purposes of the restriction of competition argument, on which the Claimants bear the burden of proof; and because MasterCard potentially succeeds on the Article 101(1) issue if the death spiral argument works for either ancillary restraint (making the MIFs necessary for the main operation) or restriction of competition (making the counterfactual one in which there is no acquiring market), it is the Claimants who must ultimately establish material identity between the schemes for the purposes of the death spiral argument.  Moreover, even for the purposes of the ancillary restraint argument, the evidential burden would fall on the Claimants to establish the unlawfulness of Visa’s MIFs and so therefore, in the light of the way the argument has been put, would the evidential burden on material identity of the schemes.  This is because the default position for the realistic counterfactual is the real world, and the court treats conduct as lawful unless and until it is shown to be unlawful.  If the Claimants had not asserted the unlawfulness of Visa’s MIFs, on the grounds of material identity, MasterCard would not have needed to address the question and would not have failed in discharging its evidential burden on the ancillary restraint issue merely by failing to adduce evidence of Visa lawfulness.   </p>

Mr Lowenstein asserted that issuer pass-through to cardholders must be the same for both schemes, but I do not understand why that should be so.  The extent of pass-through of the interchange fee to cardholders is likely to be affected by the rewards and benefits attached to particular cards in particular schemes and be scheme specific.  MasterCard operated premium credit cards during the period, branded as World or World Signia or World Elite, for which much higher MIFs were charged than for other credit cards (for example the UK MIF for chip and pin credit cards transactions in 2010 was 0.8% for standard cards, 1.3% for World cards and 1.5% for World Signia cards).  Whilst issuers had some latitude as to exactly what benefits to offer with such premium cards, MasterCard set the rules concerning what sort of customers could hold such cards, the minimum spend on the cards and the percentage of the spend which had to </p>

There was also evidence before me that at various times during the claim period about one third of credit and charge cards in the UK were premium cards, but that they were mostly MasterCard cards because although Visa offered a premium card it had only a small market share, likely to be less than 1% of the market.  Premium cards are not the only cards by which rewards and benefits are passed through from issuers to customers, but the mix of premium and non-premium cards is potentially relevant.   The mix of such cards, and the extend of the rewards offered, is scheme specific, and influences both the weighted average of the MIFs charged and the extent of issuer pass-through, both of which inform the exempt or exemptible level of a MIF for the purposes of Article 101(3).   It simply cannot be assumed that the pass-through to cardholders was identical or similar in both schemes.   </p>

It would not be right, however, to treat this as a concession on a point which was not even raised by Mr Lowenstein until final submissions.  Mr Hoskins no doubt took that stance because Dr Niels did not make any adjustment to his adjusted MIT MIF to take account of anything less than 100% issuer pass-through, whereas Mr Lowenstein’s case (which I have accepted when considering the Article 101(3) analysis in the later section of my judgment) was that issuer pass-through was less than 100%.   </p>

None of the parties to either set of proceedings supported the idea of their being heard together.  That did not put these Claimants at an insuperable disadvantage in the current context.  They shied away from asking me to make any findings about the lawfulness of Visa’s MIFs and instead sought to make good their case by advancing what they contended were logical assumptions which the court was bound to make.  In this trial they could have adduced and relied on the necessary evidence in relation to the Visa scheme and invited me to make findings about the lawful level of Visa MIFs by reference to that evidence, at least so as to establish material identity.  That need not have involved the same evidence as that which would be before Phillips J, and no findings of mine would be binding on Visa or the claimants in those proceedings; but nevertheless there was an opportunity for the Claimants to address the issue in evidence and argument before me.  The risk of inconsistency to which Mr Lowenstein refers arises not so much out of case management but from the Claimants’ approach to how to prove their case and meet MasterCard’s defences before me. </p>

If so, that would itself be a recognition that there are aspects of the evidence about the Visa scheme in that trial which are relevant to the lawfulness of the Visa MIFs and which I cannot assume would produce the same answers for the MasterCard scheme.

The argument is dependent on making a finding, not an assumption, that the schemes were materially identical.  If they were materially identical, my finding that MasterCard’s MIFs were unlawful would inevitably amount to a finding that the materially identical Visa Scheme’s MIFs were equally unlawful.  Mr Lowenstein’s disavowal may be explained by his submission that I had to assume at this stage of the analysis a restriction of competition by MasterCard and all he was asking me to do was assume a similar restriction of competition by Visa; but for the reasons I have tried to explain, that is not sufficient to treat the Visa MIFs in the counterfactual as constrained to the same level as MasterCard’s.   </p>

I have addressed the evidence above when considering whether there is some other relevant counterfactual.  That is the proper context in which it falls to be considered, not the context of the death spiral argument.  This is because if the alternative involved something other than the existing four party scheme, it is not part of the counterfactual world being considered.  If, for example, MasterCard would have survived as a three party scheme, that is irrelevant to the current inquiry: it would involve a different counterfactual, not advanced by the Claimants, which would fall to be addressed on its own terms.  Similarly if the survival of the MasterCard scheme depended upon significant changes to the model or the scheme rules, that would involve a different counterfactual which is not in play in these proceedings.  The question is whether the MasterCard scheme in its current form but adjusted only for a zero MIF, would have survived in a counterfactual world of unconstrained Visa MIFs.

If they would have killed the MasterCard scheme, it does not matter whether it would have been a quick death or a slow death.  The two observations are these.  First, the period of time over which the issuers would have perceived that the differential would continue to exist bears upon the question whether issuers would have switched to Visa. For these purposes the counterfactual world assumes a differential over the whole claim period, and so must assume a perception on the part of issuers of such a differential over the whole claim period.  Secondly, if the effect of Visa competition would have been only to produce a slow decline in the MasterCard scheme, that may inform the question whether it would have been sufficient to be terminal or whether other developments might have occurred to prevent the competition having a terminal effect. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">It is instructive to look first at the sums of money involved for issuers in a differential between MasterCard zero MIFs and Visa actual MIFs. The CAT took Visa’s weighted average credit card MIFs over its claim period to be 0.8%.  In fact Visa’s average was higher than this throughout almost all the claim period, between 2006 and 2014, with the average being brought down by the lower rates in 2015-2016 under the IF Regulation.  I had evidence of a figure for 2012 of about 0.84%.  If one were to take 0.84% as illustrative, it would reflect a difference of around £441 million per annum to all issuers in 2007, rising annually over the period (£616 million, for example, in 2011).  For debit cards, taking the evidence before me of a weighted average for Visa of 0.3% in 2012, the difference would be an annual figure of £226 million for all issuers.  These are annual figures; an issuer would look prospectively at the cumulative effect on revenue over the whole period in deciding whether to switch to Visa.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">Looking at it from the perspective of individual issuers, there can be little doubt that the economic effect on the larger issuers would give rise to a very large incentive to switch.  In 2007 HSBC’s gross dollar value of UK MasterCard transactions was about $44 billion for credit cards and $72 billion for debit cards.  At 0.84% and 0.3% respectively, that would represent about $370 million and $216 million respectively in lost interchange fees if MasterCard’s MIFs were zero compared with Visa.  That is for a single year.  The effect over time would run into several billions of dollars.  Even a relatively small issuer would suffer a significant loss of revenue.  Conister Bank Ltd, for example, one of the smallest issuers in 2007, with gross dollar value of $20.9 million for all cards, would suffer an annual loss of over $100,000 if one assumed for these purposes a weighted average for Visa across both types of card of 0.5%.  Again the cumulative effect of an annual figure of this size over the claim period would be substantial.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">The cost to issuers of switching would involve (a) the administrative costs of replacing customers’ cards and (b) any additional costs in acquiring and running a processing platform for Visa cards.  As to the former, switching might take the form of immediate replacement of all MasterCard cards amongst customers; or what was described as “forward flow”, namely switching at the natural expiry of the cards in the system, which would occur over a period of two to three years.  The costs of forward flowing to Visa cards would likely not be significantly greater than those of reissuing MasterCard cards for those issuers already using Visa’s processing platform.  Most MasterCard issuers are likely to fall into this last category of already having Visa processing platforms:  so far as credit cards are concerned, it was Mr Douglas’ unchallenged evidence that most issuers issued both Visa and MasterCard credit cards during the claim period; very few were exclusive to one or the other, and most were already familiar with Visa cards and operationally set up to issue them to take advantage of the best offer from each for credit products.  Moreover all major UK issuers except Barclaycard process credit transactions on outsourced processing platforms such as Tsys and First Data, which would make switching between schemes straightforward from the issuer’s perspective.  As to debit cards, the majority of retail bank issuers issuing MasterCard credit cards are likely already to have been issuing Visa debit cards to its customers from 2010 or so, because of Visa’s dominance of the debit card market following the collapse of Maestro.  The switching costs to issuers, particularly if by forward flowing, are therefore unlikely to have formed a serious deterrent to switching if the price differential justified it. The collapse of Maestro between 2009 and 2011, which I consider further below, shows that issuers were prepared to bear the costs of switching, whether the switch was on that occasion motivated by a price differential or differences in functionality or both. </p>

The first was that “it is not clear why some issuers (especially those with lower spending customer bases) might not keep some of their customers (the lower spenders) on MasterCard at least for a period of time.”  Mr Dryden does not suggest that this point would prevent collapse, merely that it might delay it “for a period of time”.  Given the counterfactual assumes a substantial differential between the MasterCard MIF and the Visa MIF over the whole period of the claim (around 10 years), it is clear that collapse would occur over this period.  Mr Willaert convincingly explained, based on his experience of actual migrations between credit card schemes, that the cost of flipping lower spenders would not prevent this from happening.  Banks did not in practice migrate only part of a portfolio: if they decide to switch schemes they migrate all their customers. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Dryden’s second point was that “there would be issuers with very low spending customer bases who might fall far enough below the average spend not to [switch] at least for a period of time.”  Again, Mr Dryden did not suggest that this would prevent a collapse; merely that it might delay it. The size of the sums involved indicate that for even the smaller issuers the migration would make financial sense.  If there were a rump of one or two issuers, merchants would be unlikely to continue to accept such cards: this is the “spiral” element in the death spiral argument.  In any event, if all that remained were one or two issuers issuing a very small number of cards, it is not realistic to think that the scheme in its current recognisable form would have been maintained by MasterCard for the benefit of them or their cardholders.  If anything were to be salvaged of MasterCard’s UK business it would have to be some different model.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, Mr Dryden suggested that brand loyalty on the part of some customers to MasterCard would mean that banks would continue to offer MasterCard cards to those customers.  This theoretical possibility was ruled out as a practical or realistic one by Mr Willaert’s evidence that whilst issuers will obviously take into account cardholders’ preferences for brand and particular product features, if they stand to make a lot more money from one card this will inevitably dictate their decision and override cardholder preferences for brand/product features.  On the basis of his experience from working with issuers and having gone through many migrations from Visa to MasterCard, the number of customers who might wish to stay with a particular scheme out of brand loyalty would be “very, very limited”.  This limited number of such customers would not prevent a complete migration from one scheme to the other because of the expense and work involved in maintaining a scheme just for those few customers. </p>

The Claimants, on the other hand, submitted that the switch was primarily driven by differences in functionality and factors other than the price differential, and accordingly provided no relevant guidance in the context of the current issue. </p>

In April 2007 MasterCard launched its own Debit Card at an ad valorem rate which was equivalent to a little more than Visa’s debit fixed rate; the issuers were resistant to the ad valorem element and it was relaunched a few months later with a fixed price MIF very similar to Visa’s.   </p>

This last point is a powerful one: where there is no price differential in Netherlands and Germany, Maestro has held its market share, suggesting that the price differential was the single most important factor in the UK.  The detail of this evidence was not challenged, but I bear in mind that Mr Willaert was not at MasterCard at the time of the switch and that the acceptance deficiencies of Maestro were recorded as one of the relatively few contributing factors in both the contemporaneous documents identified above, suggesting that they were regarded as a significant factor.  This impression is reinforced by a later UK Debit Strategy document of 24 October 2011 in which overseas acceptance was described as “the main weakness” of Maestro versus Visa debit and Debit MasterCard (although the document recorded that there had been some decline in acceptance over the intervening years based on a belief that Maestro was being phased out).  Limited international acceptance was, in my judgement a significant factor in the decision to switch away from Maestro.   </p>

We find the contention that it was the Interchange Fee differential between Visa and Maestro that was the main cause of the collapse of the Maestro market in the UK to be unsubstantiated by the facts, and we reject it. Helpful although we found the evidence of MasterCard's witnesses in general, we do not accept their evidence on this point, preferring the analysis in MasterCard's own contemporaneous documents. We find that MasterCard has established no more than that Maestro's lower Interchange Fee was one of a number of factors which led to the decision of HSBC and RBS to reject MasterCard's bid in the procurement processes. Taking the evidence as a whole, we consider that the combined Maestro/Debit MasterCard offering was unattractive to these banks compared with the simplicity of the well-established Visa Debit offering.” </p>

While the Tribunal noted these were averages over the entire claim period (2006-2015), it describes them as “instructive” and appears to have treated them as showing that banks had chosen Visa Debit over Debit MasterCard despite Debit MasterCard having higher interchange fees.  If so, the evidence before me shows that the Tribunal was mistaken.  The average interchange fee figures used by the Tribunal were produced by the Tribunal itself after the trial and were not, therefore, the subject of evidence or submissions.  As a result, the Tribunal appears to have been unaware that, as explained by Mr Willaert in his evidence to me, in July/August 2007 the average interchange fee for Debit MasterCard was set at an almost identical level to that for Visa Debit, and as can be seen from a MasterCard 2011 analysis of the debit card market, the average interchange fee for Debit MasterCard remained close to the same level as Visa Debit until January 2013.  It was only after January 2013 that Debit MasterCard began to offer materially higher rates than Visa Debit.  It is this which results in the average interchange fees quoted by the Tribunal being higher for Debit MasterCard than Visa Debit.  Looking at a single average for the entire claim period, therefore, concealed the fact that Debit MasterCard and Visa Debit had comparable rates from 2007 to 2013.  It was not, therefore, the case, that the HSBC/RBS decision to move to Visa Debit rather than to Debit MasterCard was despite Visa Debit having lower interchange fees.  When the decision to migrate was made at the end of 2007 (and for the following five years), Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard had close to identical rates.  Therefore, all this shows is that, having decided to migrate from Maestro (with its low interchange fees), faced with two cards with almost identical interchange fees, RBS and HSBC chose to migrate to the established Visa Debit product rather than Debit MasterCard for reasons other than a MIF differential.  This does not provide any indication that the lower interchange fees offered by Maestro were not an important factor in the decision to move from Maestro.  </p>

This would be substantial over a period of years and would easily outweigh costs of switching.  Taking HSBC’s gross dollar value of MasterCard transactions in 2007 of about $44 billion for credit cards and $72 billion for debit cards, the revenue loss at 0.2% would amount to $232 million.  That is for a single year.  The effect over time would easily exceed a billion dollars.  Even one of the smallest issuers in 2007 with gross dollar value of $20.9 million for all cards, would suffer an annual loss of over $40,000.  Again the cumulative effect of an annual figure of this size over the claim period would be substantial.  Looking at the entire cohort of issuers as a whole it is clear that the very substantial sums involved at a differential of 0.2% would provide a very powerful incentive to switch.   </p>

I found this cogent and convincing evidence that wholesale and ultimately fatal switching would occur at a differential somewhere between 0.1% and 0.3%.  The Claimants sought to criticise Mr Willaert in crossexamination for failing to provide any detail or examples to support this evidence, but the criticism was misplaced.  Mr Douglas, whom the Claimants chose not to cross examine on this evidence, supported his views by an exposition of the financial analysis which issuers would carry out and gave a number of specific examples of switching taking place at substantially lower differentials than the 30 basis points considered by the Tribunal.

That is not the counterfactual I am considering, having rejected the CAT Bilaterals counterfactual.  In the counterfactual I am considering MasterCard would still be setting the MIF in just the same way as now, albeit at a lower putatively lawful level, and there would be no restructuring of the market in accordance with different and innovative pricing structures. </p>

The aim of the Community competition rules is to protect competition on the market as a means of enhancing consumer welfare and of ensuring an efficient allocation of resources. Agreements that restrict competition may at the same time have pro-competitive effects by way of efficiency gains. Efficiencies may create additional value by lowering the cost of producing an output, improving the quality of the product or creating a new product. When the pro-competitive effects of an agreement outweigh its anti-competitive effects the agreement is on balance pro-competitive and compatible with the objectives of the Community competition rules. The net effect of such agreements is to promote the very essence of the competitive process, namely to win customers by offering better products or better prices than those offered by rivals. This analytical framework is reflected in Article 81(1) and Article 81(3). The latter provision expressly acknowledges that restrictive agreements may generate objective economic benefits so as to outweigh the negative effects of the restriction of competition.” </p>

A direct causal link exists for instance where a technology transfer agreement allows the licensees to produce new or improved products or a distribution agreement allows products to be distributed at lower cost or valuable services to be produced. An example of indirect effect would be a case where it is claimed that a restrictive agreement allows the undertakings concerned to increase their profits, enabling them to invest more in research and development to the ultimate benefit of consumers. While there may be a link between profitability and research and development, this link is generally not sufficiently direct to be taken into account in the context of Article 81(3).” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgement the Claimants’ submission on this point is sound.  MasterCard is correct in its general approach that consumer welfare does not form the totality of welfare benefits which are potentially relevant, as the wording of Article 101(3) makes clear, and as indeed the Claimants concede: see the authorities considered above.  However benefits to the parties to the restrictive agreement are excluded.  This follows as a matter of principle as well as being supported by the authority cited.  It is difficult to see why the profits made by parties to an anti-competitive agreement should be included within the pool of relevant pro-competitive benefits which fall to be taken into account in determining whether they outweigh the anti-competitive effects on those adversely affected by the restriction.  If the agreement in question is an anti-competitive restriction, the profits thereby made by the parties cannot easily be categorised as pro-competitive benefits or “efficiencies” in order to undertake the balancing exercise which forms the rationale behind Article 101(3).  Moreover, if such profits were relevant benefits, it would have the surprising result that the greater the profit from the restrictive agreement, the easier it would be to establish exemption on the grounds that such profits were benefits which outweighed the anti-competitive effects.  Of course what is done with revenues received by the parties to the restrictive agreement is capable of conferring relevant benefits on others which fall to be taken into account; but any benefit retained in the hands of a party to the anti-competitive restriction is not a relevant benefit for Article 101(3) purposes. </p>

There is no room for consideration in this case of some more general social benefits beyond those to the MasterCard merchants and cardholders.  This was the system output argument rejected in the Commission proceedings, and generally the problems of identification, and of the need for a direct causal link to the MIF, have no more been overcome before me in relation to any of the MIFs with which I am concerned than they were in those proceedings in respect of the intra EEA MIFs.  For example, the wider social costs of cash, such as tax evasion or the cost of printing money, which are reduced by card use, are to a significant extent charged by banks to users through bank charges.

Insofar as they are benefits to cardholders in the way of lower costs or rewards (eg airline flight points): if there is no issuer pass through of the MIF in the form of lower costs or rewards, they are not benefits to cardholders directly attributable to the MIF; and insofar as there is issuer pass through of the MIF to confer such benefits on cardholders, it would not be such as to render the merchants’ benefits from the MIF an unfair share of the overall benefits provided that the threshold requirement is satisfied and merchant benefits at least matched the MIF: if the merchants are paying no more than the value of the benefit they receive from the MIF, I would not regard it as unfair that cardholders may also benefit to some extent from the MIF.

MasterCard’s submission was that if it were necessary to decide the issue (which it did not invite the court to do), there is no requirement to establish that the benefits of the MIF to merchants exceed the disadvantage to merchants; it is sufficient that the benefits to all relevant consumers exceed the disadvantages to merchants.  This was said to be expressly stated in paragraph 241 of the MasterCard CJEU and to follow as a matter of logic that if it were necessary to prove that the benefits to merchants exceeded the disadvantages to them, there would be no need to consider any other relevant market.  Had I been asked to decide this point I would have rejected it.  Paragraph 85 of the Article 101(3) Guidelines makes clear that it is a minimum condition of fulfilment of the fair share requirement that the net effect on the consumers who are subject to the restriction must be positive.  The passage referred to in the MasterCard CJEU Judgment is addressed to the benefit requirement, not the fair share requirement.  The argument from logic does not hold good, because as I have explained, net compensatory effect on the consumers affected by the restriction is a necessary condition for fulfilment of the fair share requirement, but not, as a matter of principle, a sufficient condition.  As a matter of principle, if merchants were to bear an unfair proportion of the cost compared with others on whom the restriction conferred relevant benefits, they would not be getting a fair share of the benefits.  As a matter of logic, therefore, it is, or at least may be, necessary to quantify the benefits to others who are beneficiaries of relevant benefits in accordance with the benefits requirement.  However for the reasons I have identified it is not necessary to do so in the particular circumstances of this case. </p>

It is not material that the benefits produced by a restrictive agreement do not entirely compensate each particular consumer if the average consumer does enjoy that compensation and the agreement therefore produces a beneficial or neutral effect on the market generally: see Case T-131/99 <span style="font-style:italic">Shaw and Falla v Commission</span> at paragraph 163 and the Article 101(3) Guidelines at paragraph 87.  Mr Lowenstein argued that to be Article 101(3) compliant it was necessary to set MIFs for different size categories of merchant, who had different cost/benefit ratios from use of cards.  Larger merchants, for example, would have lower costs of cash through economies of scale and so gain a smaller benefit from a customer using a card in place of cash.  This approach is not only contrary to principle and authority but impossible of application.  Mr Lowenstein chose the merchant size categories which were adopted by the Commission’s 2015 Survey (see below), but there was no logic or principle to such a choice.  I can see no principled basis for subcategorising merchants so as to require differentiated MIFs for each category stopping short of examining the position of every single individual merchant.  </p>

This is important because there are evidential difficulties which infect the Article 101(3) issues.  The data upon which the issues turn was in significant respects lacking or incomplete.  A number of issues had to be addressed at a level of generality which reflected not only the paucity of data but also the nature of the exercise and the constraints of the legal process.  Time and resources did not allow for the analysis of every permutation of the many interconnected issues.  To take one example, the parties addressed their arguments, and the experts their evidence, with a view to determining the level of an exemptible MIF as two single figures in each territory, one for credit and one for debit.  Although the data used was taken from various points of time over the claim period, it was often treated as if it reflected the position throughout, and there was no attempt to identify different exemptible/exempt MIFs for different parts of the period.  Equally, although in practice there were many MIFs for both credit and debit cards at any given time, broken down, for example by transaction type, there was no attempt to identify more than a single MIF as a blended weighted average of such MIFs when examining both the MIFs as set by MasterCard and those levels which would be exemptible.  It was a recurrent theme of Mr Lowenstein’s submissions on many aspects of the Article 101(3) arguments that MasterCard had not adduced any or any sufficient evidence to address a point with the result that it should be determined in the Claimants’ favour.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">MasterCard is correct in contending that the Claimants bear the burden of proof in relation to the exemptible level of the MIF.  The issue of exemptibility is only relevant to the quantum of the assessment of damages.  If the MIFs as set are not exempt, it follows that any exemptible MIF must be lower.  In those circumstances the Claimants would have established the necessary ingredients of tortious liability, namely breach of duty and the suffering of some damage (subject to arguments in relation to pass through to customers which were rejected by the CAT and with which I am not concerned in this phase 1 trial).  Whilst exemption of the MIFs as set is a liability issue, the exemptibility of a lower MIF is relevant solely to quantification of damages.  It is trite law that a claimant bears the burden of proving the extent of its loss.   </p>

He also relied upon Article 101(2) which has the effect of rendering the MIFs void if they are not exempt under Article 101(3).  He submitted that when it came to compensation this made the starting point that the Claimants are entitled to the full amount of the MIFs (indirectly) paid through the MSC. </p>

The Claimants do not establish that the extent of their loss is the full amount of the MIF merely by establishing that the MIFs as set were unlawful.  The extent of their loss is measured by the extent of MasterCard’s tortiously unlawful activity, as required by the principles of causation.  It is for the Claimants to establish the extent of their loss by reference to the extent of the unlawfulness.  Put another way, their loss is to be measured not by the amount of the MIF they were required to pay, but the amount of the MIF they were unlawfully required to pay.   </p>

He does not prove his loss at the total amount paid for the goods or services merely by establishing the tortious inducement and the fact of payment; he must prove that he was induced to pay more for the goods or services than he otherwise would in the absence of the tort, usually by proving he has paid more than the market value, the difference being the measure of his loss: see for example McGregor on Damages 19th edn. at paragraph 47-055.  If he makes no attempt to do this he has not proved his loss.  In this case, the market value of the services for which the Claimants have had to pay by indirectly bearing the MIF can be treated as that which MasterCard could lawfully have charged by setting an exemptible MIF.

If there were a claim for restitutionary relief by a party to such an agreement, Article 101(2) might well be the starting point.  The Claimants, however, were not party to the agreement in the Scheme Rules by which the MIF was set, and do not make any restitutionary claim.  The infringement of Article 101 is a tort, and it is this tort which founds the Claimants’ claim for damages.  The voiding effect of Article 101(2) cannot affect the requirement for the Claimants to prove their loss in a tortious claim for damages.

The alternative case is that the Overcharge is the difference between the MIFs as set and what the Court holds to be lawful exemptible levels.  This plea of quantification of damage correctly recognises that it is for the Claimants to establish the extent of the “Overcharge” above the level which could lawfully be exempt.  </p>

It would lie on MasterCard on each of the criteria when seeking to prove exemption but on the Claimants when seeking to prove exemptibility.  Each party would be carrying the burden of proof on the issues at the same time.  This is indeed the result on many of the issues which arise under Article 101(3).  However the principled allocation of the burden of proof should not be discarded merely because of apparent difficulties or anomalies in its application.  It is not unheard of for one party to bear the burden of proof on a particular issue for one purpose and the other for another purpose.  If the burden of proof is determinative of the issue, the consequence is that each party fails where it bears the burden.   </p>

This to impose greater weight on the language used than it will bear.  The passages are directed to a party in breach of Article 101(1) seeking to establish exemption, not to a lawful level of exemptibility for a damages claim, where different considerations are at play, as I consider below.  The language used was in contradistinction to what was characterised as mere “assertion” on the part of MasterCard, an argument without any evidential basis at all.  In the context of exemption the requirement for “substantiation” is no more than a requirement for evidence, and the suggestion that it needs to be empirical and convincing means no more than that it must be based on evidence, not speculation, and be sufficient to convince the court to the requisite standard of proof which is the balance of probabilities.  If the epithet “robust” is intended to add more and connote an enhanced standard of proof, it is difficult to discern any legal basis for such an approach, and especially so when it comes to exemptibility which was not being considered by the Commission.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgement these are not sound objections.  MasterCard’s argument that charging positive MIFs led to an increase in the use of cards and therefore an increase in the amount of the benefits enjoyed by merchants as a result of the use of cards is made good on the evidence before me.  So too is its case that because cardholders received benefits from issuers which were funded by the MIF, the benefits to merchants of card use are to some extent directly caused by the MIF.  That does not mean that all the benefits enjoyed by merchants are directly attributable to the level of MIFs charged by MasterCard.  It does, however, mean that a MIF at some positive level is directly causative of some benefits to merchants.  That is the starting point for the Article 101(3) process.  There then remains to be addressed the difficult quantification exercise involved in valuing those merchant benefits which are directly attributable to the MIF.  This raises difficult questions, which I address below, but none of them were issues which MasterCard sought to address before the Commission, or which the Commission, General Court or CJEU needed to address.  The unsuccessful argument advanced by MasterCard before the Commission was that that the MIF contributed to an increase in the use of cards (“system output”) and that that was in itself sufficient to prove exemption for the MIFs at the levels set.  There is nothing in the Commission decision or General Court Judgment which precludes the conclusion on the evidence before me that a positive MIF contributes to some extent to merchant benefits.   </p>

The theory, in a nutshell, is that payment card systems can exploit merchants’ fears of losing business, so as to cause them to be willing to pay higher interchange fees than are justified by the benefits received by taking a card payment in place of cash payment.  This was characterised as the “must take cards” phenomenon.  The view that this creates system “inefficiencies” assumes (a) that business stealing is an irrelevant merchant benefit, and (b) that merchant benefits are to be measured by reference only to the difference between cash and card transactions, neither of which are correct assumptions for the reasons which I explain below.   </p>

Merchants receive a benefit from MasterCard card acceptance by virtue of the reduction in the number of transactions which would otherwise take place with three party scheme cards, predominantly Amex but also Diners Club.  The merchant service fee for these cards is considerably greater than the MIF element of the MSC for MasterCard cards.  </p>

In my judgement these are real and valuable benefits to merchants who pay the MIF.  Not all merchants took credit cards during the claim period.  For example the supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl, with whom a number of the Claimants were competing, did not do so for much of the claim period.  When Aldi chose to accept cards from 11 October 2014, its decision was explained as a means of winning more business from its rivals.

What are being considered for the purposes of the benefit requirement are “efficiencies” i.e. benefits from the standpoint of what contributes to greater competition.  The MIF is borne only by those who take MasterCard cards.  Such cards promote competition amongst all merchants, whether or not they take those cards.  They do so by being attractive to those providing goods and services because they assist in promoting sales to customers.  They are in this respect no different from the many commercial tools by which providers of goods and services seek to make themselves more competitive by comparison with their rivals: they may compete on price, on quality of service, by providing car parking, helpful staff, attractive retail layouts, by advertising or promotions and in numerous other different ways.  Accepting cards is just another one of these competitive tools available to merchants.   </p>

Fraud is a problem in the case of both credit and debit cards. Where a card is only ostensibly valid (i.e. is a “clone” or forgery) or where the card is valid, but has been stolen from the Cardholder, the Cardholder typically does not pay. As between the Issuing Bank and the Merchant, this loss is typically borne by the Issuing Bank, to the obvious benefit of the Merchant.” </p>

In relation to the fraud guarantee, the Claimants suggested in crossexamination of some MasterCard’s witnesses of fact that, even absent the MIF, MasterCard would have taken other steps to deploy measures to combat fraud, such as education programmes, or by including requirements in the Scheme Rules for merchants to adopt procedures in the use of cards to minimise fraud.  This did not address the central benefit to merchants, however, which is the guarantee of payment by the issuing bank despite the fraudulent use of a card presented to the merchant.  While Mr Willaert accepted that MasterCard would have sought to deploy anti-fraud technology even if interchange revenue had not been available, it was never put to Mr Willaert that MasterCard or issuing banks would or could continue to honour the fraud guarantee.  Indeed, Mr Willaert, while accepting that anti-fraud technology could still be deployed, maintained his evidence that in a hypothetical world without interchange, MasterCard would have to make changes to allow the Scheme to remain competitive such as changing the scheme rule providing for a payment guarantee.   </p>

The first is the Merchant Indifference Test (“MIT”), also known as the tourist test.  It takes its name from the premise that the only benefit to merchants of taking cards which can justify an interchange fee is the amount which would make the merchant indifferent to whether the customer paid in cash or by card.  To avoid taking account of the advantages of repeat trade, the customer is assumed to be a tourist.  The premise is that the merchant’s incremental cost of processing a cash payment is greater than that of processing a card payment, and it is the difference between the two which makes him indifferent to the method of payment if it has to be paid by way of a MIF.  As described by Mr Dryden, in its most basic form the MIT is applied as follows: </p>

Merchants may benefit when a buyer pays with a card instead of cash. Yet it is the buyer who makes the choice of which payment instrument to use for a given transaction. If the merchant does not charge the buyer different prices for the goods or services purchased depending on the choice of payment instrument, the buyer will not take into account the merchant’s benefits of the various payment alternatives. The buyer will only take into account his or her own costs and benefits, which (except by coincidence) will not be the same as the merchants’.

The tourist test was a response to what was described as the “must take cards” argument advanced by regulators and retailers, namely that merchants could not afford to refuse to accept cards because it put them at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers; and so were forced to pay a higher fee than that which reflected the cash/card alignment benefit of customers paying by card.  Rochet and Tirole identified the tourist test as a valid proxy for establishing a MIF by eliminating any such consideration because it assumed a customer who was already in the store and who had not therefore been attracted to the merchant by the fact that it took cards.  Rochet &amp; Tirole concluded that the tourist test was in theory an exact measure of TUS if the “must take cards” factor was eliminated in this way. </p>

It drew the distinction between use of credit cards for “ordinary purchases” where the customer might as happily use a debit card or cash, and credit purchases where credit was necessary or a factor in the sale taking place, such as impulse purchases, or purchases for which the customer does not have the cash or funds immediately available.  The authors expressed the view that taking credit cards allowed merchants to make sales they would not otherwise have made and this was the major reason why they accepted such cards and were prepared to pay higher interchange fees for doing so than for debit cards.

Higher interchange fees incentivise issuers to offer rewards in the way of cash back, bonuses or other benefits, equivalent to negative fees, and this encourages the use of credit cards for ordinary purchases.  Since a merchant cannot distinguish between the ordinary purchases and those which are driven by the availability of credit, it can only achieve the same benefit by its own system of store credit, which would have the same effect.   </p>

The cap might be set by reference to the cost to the issuer of providing credit, or the avoided cost to the merchant of not having to provide in-store credit.  The latter should be used because it is informationally challenging to calculate the issuer cost, which will only provide the lower bound of possible interchange fees which will maximise TUS. </p>

In that paper he emphasised that the tourist test failed to take into account the benefits which accepting cards conferred on merchants in avoiding missed sales in two different ways.  First it ignored the competitive advantage of accepting cards, whereas the fact that a merchant accepted cards was a significant benefit in increasing sales.  Secondly, where credit cards were used, the merchant received advantages from sales which would not otherwise have taken place.  In both these respects the relevant comparison for the benefit conferred by cards was with no sale taking place, not a cash sale; this had been underexplored in the economic literature and was not taken account of in the tourist test.  The conclusion was that an interchange fee which reflected the benefits to merchants of card use lay somewhere between that derived from the tourist test, and what merchants were in fact prepared to pay because of the “must take cards” considerations of maintaining the competitive position vis a vis their rivals in attracting customers to shop with them.  The paper also considered the tourist test on its own terms, and concluded that for various reasons it was probably a conservative test for a socially desirable interchange fee if the measure was total welfare: amongst other things it did not take account of the beneficial impact on social welfare of the long term impact of industry profit on “entry, innovation and end-user welfare”, or of the social disadvantages of cash use such as tax evasion. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">The MIT methodology depends upon data establishing and categorising merchant costs in order to analyse the benefits to them of card use.  In 2015 the Commission published its Survey on merchants’ cost of processing cash and card payments, Final results, (the “Commission Survey”).  This was based on a survey of merchants’ costs of processing payments by cash and cards undertaken by Deloitte on the Commission’s behalf (the “Deloitte Study”).  The Commission quantified what the MIT MIF would be based on that data.  Although the underlying data is not all available, the Commission Survey is sufficiently detailed to provide the best data available for calculating merchant benefits from card use and therefore the best starting point for quantification of any exempt or exemptible MIF.  It is supplemented by the data contained in the survey responses of these particular Claimants, which have been disclosed in the proceedings, and by data from these Claimants in response to a Request for Further Information served by Visa in the Visa proceedings.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">The Commission originally intended to collect information from a large representative sample of European merchants.  However it soon discovered that it would not be possible to carry out the survey on such a large scale because much of the detail required to apply the MIT test was not readily available to merchants.  Accordingly the study targeted 500 merchants in the EEA area, who were all large merchants.  The Commission complemented this with a less detailed survey targeted at a wider and more representative group of merchants.  The response rate for this wider survey was poor (about 1,300 responses out of almost 600,000 merchants approached) and the Commission concluded that it could not extrapolate any reliable results from this wider survey.  Accordingly it based its conclusions as to the appropriate MIT MIF on the survey from the large merchants.  The study took almost 7 years to complete, having commenced in 2008.  In the event only 254 of the large merchants who were targeted completed the survey to the required standard. </p>

The Commission excluded fixed costs.  Whether a cost is fixed or variable depends upon the timeframe being considered for the analysis.  The Commission considered short term (single transaction), medium term (3-4 years) and long term.  The first two were based on the so called “arithmetic” analysis which used the merchant’s own categorisation in their survey responses as to what costs they deemed to be fixed or variable.  The long term analysis by the Commission used a so called “econometric” analysis which does not rely on the merchant’s own judgements as to the fixed versus variable cost split. </p>

It is more likely to capture all costs which vary over time; and it avoids reliance on subjective classification by merchants of costs as fixed or variable (which is both difficult and subject to potential bias). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the first, the Commission recognised that the categorisation of costs as fixed or variable was critical to its calculations of the MIT MIF because in addressing the costs of cash saved by card transactions they included only variable costs and excluded fixed costs.  Costs which are treated as fixed costs over a short period become variable over a longer period.  For example if a cash register requires replacement once a year, the costs of doing so are fixed costs if the time horizon taken is less than a year but a variable cost if a period of longer than a year is taken.  The proportion of merchants’ fixed costs is higher for cash than for cards; accordingly if the exercise does not account for the full range of costs which vary over time, it will systematically underestimate the appropriate MIT MIF.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">In principle all costs of accepting cash should be taken into account in determining the MIT MIF, even if they recur only in the longer term than every 3 to 4 years.  There are some costs which will only be variable if looked at over a period of greater than 3 to 4 years. Costs of cash acceptance include both goods (registers, counterfeit machines etc) and services (e.g. cash transportation).  The goods may need replacing less often than 3 to 4 years.  Similarly, contracts for services may be for longer periods than 3 to 4 years.  A medium term approach would categorise such costs as fixed when they are in reality part of the costs of accepting cash which are saved by taking cards.   </p>

That may be so to some extent, but the risk of bias was mainly in favour of understating variable costs, by comparison with the usual accounting exercise of finance departments.  The invitation letter received by many of the Claimants explained that the survey concerned interchange fees which had been found to restrict competition, and that the information provided could have a significant impact on the analysis of future interchange fees.  Moreover, merchants were informed by Deloitte about the purpose and methodology of the study prior to submitting their responses, and would naturally have desired an outcome in which the MIF was as low as possible.  I do not mean to say that any of the Claimants consciously misrepresented the figures, and no such suggestion was made by MasterCard or put to any of the Claimant witnesses.  However the sampled population of all those who responded to the Deloitte Survey were being asked to make a judgement when conscious that their interests were served by choosing the lowest end of the range for variable costs, and the subjectivity of such judgement is therefore more likely to have underestimated than overestimated the extent of  such costs. </p>

Nevertheless, given the number and variety of different of merchants surveyed, there is no reason to suspect any bias in either direction from using the stated assumption as a reasonable one.   </p>

Dr Niels’ solution was to take a cost of cash based on sizes 6 and 7, on the basis that the costs for the size 6 and 7 merchants were much higher than for the size 8 merchants, and it could be assumed that as one went down the class sizes the merchant costs would continue to increase.  The statistical data for putting classes 6 and 7 as a proxy for the average merchant’s costs was simply not available.  Nevertheless I am satisfied that Dr Niels’ approach is the most reasonable available one in the circumstances, because the cost differences amongst the merchants who were surveyed show a dramatic increase in costs as the size of merchant reduces.

These are cardholders who are categorised as “revolvers”.  For these consumers he has used the cost of Amex as a comparator, on the basis that the customers require the deferred payment element of credit and the alternative would be the use of a more expensive three party scheme card, namely Amex.  For the proportion of transactions which do not use the extended credit facility, where cardholders are “transactors” who pay off the balance at the end of the month without incurring interest, Dr Niels uses cash as a comparator.  </p>

In accordance with Rochet &amp; Wright 2010, Dr Niels took as the starting point for his adjustment in relation to credit functionality, the comparator of merchants providing credit themselves, through store cards.  He then took as a proxy for the cost to merchants of offering store credit themselves, the costs of accepting Amex.  Dr Niels’ analysis of the cost of store credit to a number of the Claimants who offer store credit shows that it is cheaper for merchants to accept credit cards, including Amex, than offer store credit themselves.  Because Amex is cheaper than providing store credit, the use of Amex as a proxy will produce a lower adjusted MIT MIF.  The use of Amex as a comparator also captures some of the cost saving benefit that merchants obtain from customers using MasterCard/Visa rather than Amex.  </p>

The fact that cash is not generally used for online purchasing (although it sometimes may be, for example for pay-on-delivery pizza orders) only serves to emphasise the advantage merchants obtain by taking cards.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.37in;margin-right:0.00in">It was contended by the Claimants that the use of PayPal as a comparator is inappropriate, because 65% of PayPal accounts are in any case linked to a payment card.  The point was that for these accounts, switching from PayPal to payment by a credit card is unlikely, as the customer will in any case obtain the rewards and other incentives available from using a payment card.  These points do not invalidate Dr Niels’ methodology.  They do not touch on the 35% of PayPal transactions which are not linked to a payment card.  The 65% of PayPal transactions linked to a card would likely include a proportion of accounts linked to debit cards.  Credit cards also have some advantages from the cardholder’s perspective over payment made using PayPal, including the availability of protection under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, s.75 so that customers buying online benefit from direct credit card use rather than via PayPal.  The use of PayPal as a comparator actually results in a lower MIT MIF calculation than would be the case if Dr Niels had instead used only Amex as a comparator because Amex is more expensive to merchants than PayPal.  </p>

Mr Dryden concludes that these “switching” transactions will on average be lower value transactions, so the ATV of these “switching transactions” will be below the actual card ATV.  However this analysis ignores all benefits other than the transactional benefit to merchants of a payment being made by card <span style="font-style:italic">rather than cash</span>.  Moreover, even if one were just focused on transactional benefits (and for the reasons set out above, other benefits are also relevant), the actual benefit to merchants will not just arise from transactions switching from cash to card, but also transactions switching from other more expensive payment methods (such as Amex or Paypal) to card.  As Mr Dryden acknowledged, his structure of “switching transactions” and “always card” transactions took no account of the fact that if MasterCard had an uncompetitive interchange fee then transactions would switch to Amex.  If account is taken of the possibility of switching to other payment methods (such as Amex), Mr Dryden’s justification for using a lower ATV cannot stand; the ATV should reflect the transactions which might switch to these alternatives.  The card ATV is a better indication than the retail ATV of the average value of all transactions which will switch to alternative payments. </p>

For credit cards, a significant part of this higher average transaction value is likely to consist of additional expenditure i.e. expenditure which would not have taken place if credit had not been available.  There is also the transactional benefit to a merchant from receiving larger payments with cards.  The relevant UK ATV for cash is less than £10, whereas the relevant UK ATV for credit cards is £60.  Put another way, by using the retail ATV, Mr Dryden is comparing the cost to a merchant of a single cash payment of £20.30 compared to a single card payment of £20.30.  However, in the real world, the average benefit a merchant receives is processing a single card payment of £60 compared to six cash payments of £10.  Since many costs are dependent on the number of transactions rather than the value of the transaction, Mr Dryden’s approach does not capture a significant part of the actual benefit which merchants receive from accepting cards.  </p>

This does not include “front office costs” because in the Survey’s words “front office time costs are rather similar for cash and cards”.  For these purposes “front office costs” means the cost of the staff time involved in processing the payment part of the transaction.  The Commission’s analysis took account of the front office costs of processing card transactions and cash transactions for face-to-face transactions, but not self-service tills or online transactions.  These are substantial omissions – the data for one of the Claimants, Asda, for example, shows that around of transactions in store are at self-service tills and of transactions by value are online.  For other merchants online sales will be a much higher proportion.  The average cost of processing self-service transactions or online transactions will be lower than the cost of processing face-to-face transactions precisely because there is no front office cost involved in processing the transaction.  Consequently, by looking just at face-to-face transactions, the Commission has overstated the average cost of processing transactions.  </p>

However, the overstatement will be much greater in relation to card transactions, since online transactions will largely be card transactions (or an alternative like PayPal), since cash is not a realistic option for most online transactions and there are no front office costs for online transactions.  A similar issue arises in relation to self-service tills i.e. it is likely that a higher proportion of card transactions take place at self-service tills (which again result in no front office costs being incurred) than face to face.   </p>

According to the UK Cards Association, 9% of debit card transactions and 24% of credit card transactions are online.  Using those figures as a guide, I conclude that an adjustment of 1 basis point is required to account for the difference in front office costs from the use of cards. </p>

There is little empirical data available to me to enable the value of this benefit to be accurately quantified.  However it is clear that the competitive advantage of taking cards is a real and substantial benefit to merchants, which for the reasons I have explained is a relevant benefit.  It would therefore be wrong to ignore it in any quantification exercise required by Article 101(3). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The “must take cards” attitude adopted by most larger retailers suggests that they put a significant value on the competitive advantage over those who do not take cards.  The statistics set out in the introductory section of this judgment illustrate that acceptance of cards by merchants is widespread.  There were during the claim period a few major retailers in the UK who did not accept cards (e.g. Aldi and Lidl) but most retailers are prepared to pay the interchange fees which are set.  I do not confuse a willingness to pay the MIF with an acceptance that the charge is reasonable; nor do I conclude that such willingness determines the issue whether the charge is anticompetitive; nor do I equate the amount which merchants are willing to pay with the value to merchants of taking cards.  However I cannot accept Mr Lowenstein’s submission that willingness to pay has nothing to do with benefits because it is “ransom pricing”.  The so called “ransom” is a price paid for a perceived benefit, and the perceived benefit is the competitive advantage which a card taking merchant has over one who does not take cards; or, which is the other side of the coin, the disadvantage he will suffer by not taking cards against merchants who do.  When Aldi chose to accept cards from 11 October 2014, its decision was explained as a means of winning more business from its rivals.  A number of internal documents disclosed by Claimants indicate that they regarded taking cards as conferring a competitive advantage which translated into increased sales.  Mr Dryden’s evidence was that “merchants would stand to lose a large amount of business if they did not adopt MasterCard at all”.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">How is this benefit to be quantified?  The authors of Rochet &amp; Wright 2010 expressed the view not only that taking credit cards allowed merchants to make sales they would not otherwise have made, but also that this was the major reason why they accepted such cards and were prepared to pay higher interchange fees for doing so than for debit cards:</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.59in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.00in">“Thus offering credit allows an individual merchants (sic) to make sales that they otherwise would not make.  The ability to make these sales is, we think, the major reason explaining why merchants accept credit cards and indeed are willing to pay higher fees to do so compared to the fees paid to accept debit cards, and why prior to the widespread use of credit cards, store credit was much more widely used than today (Evans and Schmalensee, 2005, pp 48-51)” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In other words the authors recognised that the credit functionality and business stealing aspects of accepting credit cards were a benefit to merchants which they valued as more significant than the other benefits (such as avoided costs of cash) and justified the differential interchange fee over debit cards.  The difference between the weighted average MIF for MasterCard credit cards in the UK and that for debit cards for the claim period was of the order of 0.6%.  Dr Niels’ adjustment for the credit functionality of credit cards makes a difference of only 0.18%, which suggests that business stealing justifies the remainder. </p>

The competitive advantage of accepting debit cards is a real one: customers perceive security and convenience benefits in carrying and using debit cards rather than cash, and thereby obtain consumer protection remedies for defective goods and services.  Online sales are facilitated by debit card use.  However accepting debit cards is unlikely to confer the same competitive advantage value to merchants as does accepting credit cards; for a debit card purchase the customer can make the same purchase in cash at a rival store, whereas the availability of credit for credit cards makes the difference for transactors between making a purchase and not, and for revolvers gives an advantage over cash by virtue of the interest free period (which is not captured in Dr Niels’ adjustment for credit functionality).  </p>

The figures arrived at immediately above represent the level of MIF which would match average merchant benefits from MasterCard card use.  Because they are based on an adjusted MIT MIF methodology, they assume that the MIF is fully passed through from the issuers to the merchants via the cardholder.  The underlying premise in the Baxter MIT MIF methodology is that the interchange fee is paid by the merchant and passed back through to it in the form of benefits via the acquirer, issuer and cardholder.  That assumes that the MIF is all used by the issuer to provide incentives to the cardholder to use cards so as to produce the merchant benefits.  To the extent that issuer pass through is less than 100%, the benefits are not attributable to the MIF.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Niels based his opinion that pass through was very high on economic theory and the competitive nature of the issuing market: as a matter of economic theory, in a perfectly competitive market suppliers set prices equal to marginal costs; and a single cost change to an industry which is highly competitive results in all or almost all of the cost change being passed on to the consumer; there are a large number of issuers in the UK and in general the UK market is regarded as highly competitive, particularly for credit cards; the FCA November 2015 report concluded that there was strong competition in the credit card market, with competition focussing on rewards and introductory promotional offers; over half of consumers claimed that they shopped around when choosing their credit card with 66% of those using price comparison websites; the competition intensified from the late 1990s with monoline issuers and retailers entering the issuing market; the combination of a large number of competitors, high levels of switching and issuers competing strongly on rewards suggests a highly competitive market in which the economic theory supports high pass through.  In cross examination Dr Niels described the level as “very high” but he couldn’t “pinpoint a number, whether it was 80%, 90% or 100%”.  He drew attention to publicly available information showing that four issuers, RBS, Capital One, Tesco and M &amp; S Bank had reduced or removed their reward offerings in late 2015 and 2016 following the cap imposed by the European IF Regulation.  He was cross examined on one of these (Tesco) which indicated that the reduction in rewards did not approach the level of even 80%; but in my view these examples provided no firm empirical basis to support or undermine his estimate.  They are not a representative sample and do not reflect the end point in any reduction of benefits.  His estimate of 80%-100% was not based on any identified data or calculations.  </p>

He made a further point in relation to pass through, which was that it was not enough for the MIF to be passed through by issuers to cardholders in the abstract; any pass through must be of a nature that could cause cardholders to respond and they must at least have some degree of responsiveness to that pass through.  In other words the pass through of the MIF must be such as to incentivise card use.  This is sound in principle, because a MIF which does not translate into card use cannot have a direct causative effect on merchant benefits arising out of card use.  Mr Dryden and Dr Niels accepted that pass through for credit cards, which were stand-alone products, met this hurdle but Mr Dryden opined that for debit cards it “may not”.  He identified three reasons why the responsiveness of debit cards to changes in the interchange fee may be less than that of credit cards: </p>

Mr Lowenstein devoted a number of submissions towards seeking to establish that this condition was not fulfilled.  In my judgement this analysis does not assist the debate.  Mr Dryden’s framework assumes that the only relevant benefit to merchants is the alignment benefit of not taking cash.  For reasons I have explained, this is a false premise for the Article 101(3) exercise.  The error may be illustrated by one of Mr Lowenstein’s arguments in this context: he submitted that on the basis of the evidence most credit cards transactions did not involve substitution for a cash payment: that 40% of transactions using credit cards were by revolvers, and so by definition were transactions which did not involve switching from cash because those who needed credit could not have paid in cash; and that for the other 60% who did not need credit, the transactors, the vast majority would otherwise have paid with a debit card rather than cash.  This illustrates both the fundamental flaws in Mr Dryden’s framework of Necessary Conditions.  It simply ignores the merchant benefits from the extension of credit which credit cards provide, and all the other relevant merchant benefits from the use of both credit and debit cards which I have identified.  Moreover it ignores Amex as a competitor; whilst a transaction which is dependent on credit will not switch from MasterCard to cash, the evidence established that if MasterCard could not set interchange fees for premium cards at a competitive level for issuers, MasterCard would have lost at least a significant proportion of its premium business to Amex, and possibly all of it.  This is a considerable part of MasterCard’s credit card business in the UK, up to 45% of which was estimated by Project Porsche to be in “the Amex sweet spot”.  I was invited by Mr Lowenstein not to make any finding as to the extent of the loss of business to Amex because the evidence on the issue was directed to the death spiral argument in respect of which Amex competition was not determinative, and because it would be an issue in Phase 2.  I shall accept the invitation because the point I am here addressing is merely illustrative of the flaws in the principle underlying Mr Dryden’s framework.  </p>

Neither side called any witness with substantial contemporaneous experience as an issuer.  The documentary evidence was exiguous.  There was a MasterCard document based largely on 2006 data which estimated that MIF revenues typically represented about 30% of issuers’ credit card income for EEA transactions, and that profits were about 33%.  This was not however a sound guide to the position in the UK, as Mr Douglas explained.  It estimated that card fees accounted for 51% of income, whereas in the UK the figure for that point of time was probably closer to 10-15%: there are generally no card fees for debit cards and only some for some credit cards.  Mr Sidenius, who accepted that he did not have detailed knowledge of actual issuer profitability, estimated that an issuer would typically have made a profit of low 20s% to 40% on its UK credit revolving cards prior to the global financial crisis but the figure would be lower since then.  Mr Douglas gave an estimate of 10% to 40% for issuers’ margins which he estimated would vary from issuer to issuer.  Both suggested that interchange fee might account for about 20% of an issuer’s UK card related income.  The FCA November 2015 report suggests that issuer profit on credit cards is not significantly driven by interchange revenue, but rather by interest payable by revolvers on credit balances.  </p>

The level of profit for issuers is not such as to violate the fair share or indispensability requirements.  A profit at levels which varied across the market between 10% and 40% is not indicative of an unreasonable return on capital for a bank and would not of itself represent such a degree of profit as to cause the fair share or indispensability requirement to be breached if the threshold test of merchant benefit neutrality were fulfilled.</p>

This was the method adopted by MasterCard as part of its process in setting the MIF for credit cards and was used by the Commission in its Visa 2002 Decision.  The costs used by Dr Niels were based on two studies carried out for MasterCard by EDC in 2005 and 2008.  These are likely to underestimate the costs for the period shortly after that because the global financial crisis meant that credit write-off peaked in 2010, but there is no reason to treat them as unrepresentative across the whole of the claim period.  </p>

It was assumed in argument before me that that is a question which affects only quantum of damages recoverable by the Claimants.  However it is not self-evident to me that it is not also relevant to the Phase 1 issues I have been addressing.  If the merchants pass some of the cost of the MIF on to cardholders, the fair share condition would be focusing on a different level of benefit/burden to both merchants and cardholders.  Because these matters were not argued, and may arise in consumer claims against MasterCard, I express no view upon them.</p>
