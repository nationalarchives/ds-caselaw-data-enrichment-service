	      <span style="color:#000000">This case has been very hard fought, culminating in a trial which spanned some thirteen weeks and which entailed written submissions (opening and closing) running, in total, to almost 1,100 pages (not including all the appendices). It involves very serious allegations of fraud made by the claimant corporate group against three of its former directors (two of whom were also previously substantial shareholders). The Claimants allege that the Defendants (I include in this description all three of the Defendants despite the fact that, as I shall come on to explain, the Claimants have settled with the First Defendant) have misappropriated company assets by way of several complex and elaborate frauds involving construction projects and land acquisitions, which have caused the Claimants to suffer losses of in excess of US$ 250 million. The Defendants strenuously deny these allegations, maintaining that they have at all times acted in good faith. The Defendants have also raised a limitation defence. </span>

Mr Andrew Twigger QC (leading Ms Anna Dilnot and Mr Adam Woolnough) drew attention to these aspects (as well as a timing point) during the course of his opening submissions, suggesting that the Court </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is being asked to travel to a distant time and place”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and, specifically, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to look at a large number of complex transactions conducted many years ago in the unfamiliar environment of an emerging country”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Memorably described by Mr Robert Howe QC (leading Mr Jonathan Miller and Mr Daniel Saoul) as the ‘Star Wars’ defence, this, Mr Twigger submitted, makes it necessary to adopt a cautious approach which avoids viewing transactions carried out in Kazakhstan prior to 2010 in the same way as commerce is conducted in London in 2017. I bear this point in mind when considering the evidence in this case, together with Mr Howe’s inter-galactic inspired riposte (although whether acts before 2010 do properly qualify as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a long time ago”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or whether Kazakhstan, or anywhere else, counts as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a galaxy far, far away”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> are not issues which, thankfully, I am required to resolve). What matters for present purposes is simply the point that the case, like so many which become before the Commercial Court, is truly international in nature; indeed, it is litigation which, in truth, has nothing to do with this jurisdiction other than the fact that it has been commenced here. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As is common with fraud cases, there was a substantial dispute as to the underlying facts. In addition, both sides levelled accusations of dishonesty against the other, including accusations of deliberate destruction/deletion of documents (alleged by both sides), and intimidation by way of threats of physical violence (again, alleged by both sides). There were, therefore, a great number of factual and evidential issues to be resolved. I shall in this judgment try to deal with the main points rather than every point since to do that would make the judgment even longer than it is. Similarly, although I confirm that I have considered every submission which has been made and have taken into account all the evidence which was deployed before me, in what follows my aim is not to address everything but to focus on what seems to me to matter most and to seek to set out sufficient detail to enable the reader (including, most importantly, the parties) to see what I have decided and why I have decided it.  </span>

Prior to this, the First Defendant, Mr Baglan Zhunus, and the Second Defendant, Mr Maksat Arip, had been close business associates. Between 1999 and 2000, they had worked together as directors of a telecommunications company in Kazakhstan called Spectrum LLP, before moving on to work as directors of KazTransCom, another telecommunications company, between 2000 and 2003. In 2003 Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip joined the KK Group, then owned by an organisation called Seimar Holdings which was looking to sell the business, Mr Zhunus becoming Chairman of KK JSC’s Board (a position which he held between 2003 and July 2009) and Mr Arip becoming a director and KK JSC’s Chief Executive Officer (between 2003 and April 2008). The following year, in 2004, Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip bought the KK Group, each acquiring a 50% shareholding in KK JSC through Kagazy Invest LLP, a holding company which Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip both owned. The year after that, in 2005, another of their companies, Holding Invest LLP, was introduced into the top of the structure. Subsequently, on 5 March 2007, Mr Zhunus became Chairman of the Board of KK Plc from the date when that company was incorporated, 5 March 2007, until April 2008. He was also indirectly the beneficial owner of 50% of the shares in KK Plc until its entry into the IPO to which I have referred in July 2007 and which involved KK Plc being introduced into the KK Group structure and Kagazy Invest and Holding Invest being removed from it. </span>

This “oil business” was concerned with the exploitation of oil assets in Siberia. Mr Arip served as Exillon’s Chairman from 17 November 2009 until April 2011, with Ms Dikhanbayeva working for the company in a senior role under not only Mr Arip but also a Mr Alessandro Manghi, a previous Chairman of KK Plc and by this stage Exillon’s CEO, a position which he held until his resignation in April 2011 when Mr Arip also resigned as Chairman. </span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">The circumstances in which Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip came to leave the KK Group were that in June 2009 Mr Arip contacted Mr Tomas Werner, suggesting that he might like to acquire an ownership interest in KK Plc. Mr Werner was a businessman based in London who had previously dealt with both Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip when he worked for HSBC as a private banker. Indeed, Mr Arip was one of his clients in that role both at HSBC and after he left HSBC to set up his own wealth management firm, Werner Capital, in April 2008. Specifically, at a meeting in London, Mr Arip provided Mr Werner with a copy of KK Plc’s IPO Prospectus together with audited accounts prepared by BDO for the period ending 31 December 2008, explaining that the KK Group needed to restructure its debt, having run into financial trouble as a result of the global financial crisis, and that he and Mr Zhunus wished to concentrate on their oil business rather than take responsibility for the restructuring required. Mr Werner was interested and so the following month visited Kazakhstan. The month after that, in August 2009, Mr Arip introduced Mr Werner to Mr Vladimir Gerasimov, somebody whom Mr Arip had in mind might work with Mr Werner as his ‘local partner’ dealing with operational matters whilst Mr Werner would focus on the KK Group’s financial needs. Mr Werner decided to go ahead later the same month, with Mr Werner ultimately purchasing not Mr Arip’s shareholding in KK Plc (as he had originally thought would happen) but the shareholding which Mr Zhunus held. So it was that on 2 September 2009 Mr Werner’s acquisition vehicle, Theta Investment Holdings Limited, agreed to pay a minimum of US$ 2.5 million in consideration for Mr Zhunus’s shareholding, and Mr Gerasimov acquired Mr Arip’s interest through another corporate vehicle. </span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">Having made the purchase, Mr Werner arrived in Kazakhstan very shortly afterwards. Mr Arip had by this time already left and Mr Manghi, then serving as KK Plc’s Chairman (as well as Head of Investor Relations) indicated that he, too, planned on leaving to work in Dubai on the venture involving Exillon along with other KK Group personnel (including KK Plc’s Legal Director and other senior employees). Mr Werner decided that he needed help and so appointed SP Angel to assist him in what needed to be done. SP Angel started the following month, in October 2009, by which time the KK Group was facing a number of pressing financial problems. These included falling cash levels which resulted in defaults on loans and threats by lenders to enforce against the KK Group’s assets. In late October 2009, Mr Werner and SP Angel decided to instruct PwC to produce a report </span>
	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to understand the flow of funds expended on investments in land, machinery and company acquisitions…”</span>
	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">. PwC reported back on 3 December 2009, identifying three categories of </span>
	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">, noting in particular: that significant sums had been spent on developing the Aksenger Industrial Park and Akzhal Logistics Park, a significant portion of these costs lacked detailed supporting documents, creating a risk that some of the funds could have been misused or not spent effectively; that the general contractor, Arka-Stroy, had a common director (Mr Bek Esimbekov, sometimes referred to as Mr Bek Yesimbekov) with PEAK which was commissioning the work; that the Astana Contract Group had been acquired by the KK Group for substantially more than its book value; and that land had been bought for substantial sums from companies connected to the prior management. These are matters which I shall have to explore in some detail later when addressing the question of time-bar, specifically as to what Mr Werner should be taken as having found out when he received this report. </span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">Meanwhile, Mr Werner and SP Angel carried on trying to deal with the financial problems which were besetting the KK Group, whilst also trying to run the operational business. These efforts were made all the harder because Mr Gerasimov suddenly wished to dispose of his shareholding. He did so through SP Angel acquiring his shareholding as a stopgap in November 2009. In any event, work continued apace to steady the KK Group’s finances. This proved a lengthy and challenging process. Over three years of negotiations, from December 2009 until December 2012, the KK Group was able to finalise the restructuring of all of its issued bonds and most of its loans. In conjunction with this, after declaring losses of US$ 250 million in 2009 and US$ 50 million in 2010, the KK Group made a small profit of US$ 2 million in 2011. </span>

Mr Werner took legal advice and was told, he says, that there was insufficient evidence of fraud to sustain a claim. In September 2012 Phoenicia issued derivative proceedings against Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip in New York, advancing a claim which is broadly based on what in these proceedings has been described as the ‘PEAK Claim’, although without the same focus as that claim in these proceedings has on the role played by Arka-Stroy. In response to certain motions to dismiss, Phoenicia’s claim was withdrawn in mid-2013.</span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">Throughout this period, again the Claimants maintain, their own investigations continued. Those investigations were made more challenging by what the Claimants say was a lack of relevant documentation and attempts at concealment by the Defendants in conjunction with certain KK Group employees who had remained behind in Kazakhstan after others had left for Dubai. In late 2012, Mr Werner and his relatively new colleague, Ms Viktoriya Gorobtsova, discussed discreetly engaging a construction firm to investigate the nature of the works done at the sites known as Akzhal-1, Akzhal-2 and Aksenger (related to what is now described as the ‘PEAK Claim’). Ms Gorobtsova knew Mr Gafurov, who with his father ran a construction company with suitable experience. Mr Gafurov and his father visited the three sites in December 2012, and Mr Gafurov returned in January 2013 to carry out a more detailed review and analyse relevant paperwork. At the end of January 2013 Mr Gafurov produced a report, which he discussed with Mr Werner, concluding that the amounts paid for the work at Akzhal-1 appeared inflated, with little or no work at all having been completed at Akzhal-2 and Aksenger. Contemporaneous documents purporting to certify certain works (the ‘Acts of Acceptance’) appeared to be seriously inaccurate, recording, for example, earthworks of a scale of which there was no evidence and which it was highly improbable had been carried out. Mr Gafurov’s report also noted the consistent involvement of Arka-Stroy as general contractor. His view was that it seemed likely that a fraud had taken place. </span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">At this point, the Claimants insist, Arka-Stroy’s role and relationship to the Defendants remained unknown. Their position is that this was only discovered when, after Mr Gafurov had delivered his findings, Ms Gorobtsova approached Mr Kuzmenko, the KK Group’s Head of IT, for his assistance in searching for any information related to Arka-Stroy. Mr Kuzmenko thought that Arka-Stroy’s accounting (or 1C) database might have been backed up on to the KK Group’s computer servers. He enlisted another IT department employee, Mr Rasul Khasanov, to assist in the search which resulted in the discovery of Arka-Stroy’s 1C database on the KK Group’s systems, effectively containing its accounting history. Other databases of entities owned or controlled by the Defendants, and implicated in the frauds as set out further below, were also discovered. Mr Khasanov then helped to extract relevant data from the Arka-Stroy database, preparing a list of significant transactions which Arka-Stroy had been involved in. This quickly revealed that it had engaged in numerous payments to entities which Mr Kuzmenko and Mr Khasanov knew had been managed by Ms Dikhanbayeva. </span>

	      <span class="Heading5Char" style="color:#000000">As a result, as at March 2013, the Claimants say, but not before, they had critical evidence that Arka-Stroy had been very substantially overpaid for the work it had done and also that the Defendants had, through Arka-Stroy, received the benefits of those overpayments. A few months later, the Claimants issued these proceedings and, as I shall come on to explain in a moment, obtained a worldwide freezing injunction which remains in place. The Claim Form was issued on 2 August 2013. This, and the Particulars of Claim, were subsequently amended on a number of occasions. At the time of trial, the Claimants’ claims related to three alleged fraudulent schemes. The first of the frauds alleged by the Claimants - the PEAK Claim - entails the case that, between 2005 and 2009, the Defendants dishonestly caused KK JSC, PEAK and Peak Akzhal to make payments in the total net amount of US$ 109.1 million (I should say that the parties used various US Dollar amounts to indicate the size of the payments which were made in Tenge/KZT and I have adopted these but almost certainly there is an inconsistency in exchange rates used and so the US Dollar figures are to be regarded as approximate) to a purportedly independent construction company, Arka-Stroy LLP (‘Arka-Stroy’), for the development of a logistics centre and industrial park on three sites in Kazakhstan (referred to as Akzhal-1, Akzhal-2, and Aksenger). It is alleged that only a minimal amount of construction work was actually done, that Arka-Stroy was secretly controlled by the Defendants and that a total net amount of around US$ 52.9 million was paid on to 16 entities associated with the Defendants. The Claimants say that all the monies paid to Arka-Stroy (the entire US$ 109.1 million) have been misappropriated and/or constitute a loss suffered by the Claimants as a result of breaches of duty by the Defendants. In the alternative, if the Claimants are required to give credit for the limited amount of construction work done by or on behalf of Arka-Stroy, the Claimants say that the quantum of such credit should be no more than between US$ 6.5 million and US$ 16.4 million, so giving a net loss of between US$ 92.7 million and US$ 102.6 million. The Claimants further allege that, as a result of these losses, KK JSC, PEAK and Peak Akzhal have been unable to repay the commercial borrowing which was the original source of the misappropriated funds, and have therefore become liable to their banks and bondholders for interest, default interest and penalties in the sum of around US$ 78 million, which is claimed as damages. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The second of the frauds alleged by the Claimants - the Astana 2 Claim – entails the allegation that, in 2008 and 2009, the Defendants committed a similar fraud (Mr Howe described it as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“re-run of the PEAK Fraud on a slightly smaller scale”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) involving payments purportedly made by Astana Contract for construction work in relation to a project to build a logistics centre with Class A warehouses outside Astana (the capital of Kazakhstan, some 600 miles from Almaty). This breaks down into three parts. First, Astana-Contract paid GS Construction LLP (‘GS’), purportedly an independent contractor but, the Claimants allege, in fact, connected with the Defendants, US$ 18.6 million, of which GS returned US$ 11.9 million, giving a net payment to GS of US$ 6.72 million with GS carrying out only minimal works in exchange. Secondly, Astana-Contract paid TransEnergoServiceStroy (‘TESS’) US$ 4.45 million to design a transport and logistics centre, which it did not do, instead sub-sub-contracting the work for a fraction (just over 10%) of the price it received from Astana-Contract, giving a net amount extracted, so the Claimants allege, from the Claimants of approximately US$ 3.9 million. Thirdly and lastly, the Claimants say that Astana-Contract paid NSA Contract LLP (‘NSA’) US$ 11.014 million for the delivery of goods which were never supplied, NSA returning US$ 750,000 of this to Astana-Contract but paying the majority of the remainder (US$ 9.72 million) to another entity allegedly connected with the Defendants, Ada-Trade LLP (‘Ada-Trade’), which shared a director with Arka-Stroy. The Claimants say that Ada-Trade then channelled back (directly and indirectly) just under US$ 7.5 million of this to KK JSC, and paid on approximately US$ 2.17 million to Holding Invest, which it is common ground was Mr Zhunus’s and Mr Arip’s entity. The net loss on this element of the fraud was, therefore, so it is alleged, US$ 2.83 million. The Claimants’ Astana 2 Claim, therefore, entails a claim, in total, for a loss of US$ 13.45 million. In addition, as with the PEAK Claim, the Claimants allege that, as a result of these losses, Astana-Contract and Paragon have become liable for interest, default interest and penalties in the sum of around US$ 10 million, which is claimed as damages. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">A third claim – the Land Plots Claim – was added by amendment in 2015 and involves the allegation that the Defendants used nominee companies to acquire land plots cheaply from farmers in Kazakhstan which were then re-sold to KK JSC, ostensibly for development, at highly inflated prices. Specifically, the Claimants say that, at the instigation of the Defendants, KK JSC paid out a net total of US$ 52.097 million to three entities associated with the Defendants (Commerce Business Centre or ‘CBC’, Bolzhal and Holding Invest), purportedly in payment for the purchase of fourteen land plots. These three entities then paid on US$ 44.29 million to seven further entities associated with the Defendants, each of which was also a recipient of money in the context of the PEAK Claim. There are no records as to what happened to this money, but it is the Claimants’ case that the entire amount paid by KK JSC to the three entities connected with the Defendants, US$ 52.097 million, has been misappropriated, on the basis that there was no sound commercial reason for the purchase of the land plots. In the alternative, in the event that KK JSC is required to give credit for the limited value of the land plots which it acquired, the Claimants’ case is that they are, in any case, entitled to the difference between the amounts which KK JSC paid out purportedly in payment for purchase of the land plots, and the price at which the land was originally bought from the farmers at the Defendants’ initiative. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is the Claimants’ position that there are a number of significant similarities and telling overlaps between these three claims, including: the use of what Mr Howe described as ‘Connected Entities’, a number of which appear in two or indeed all three of the claims, used as ‘funnels’ to siphon off substantial sums of money from the KK Group; the use of relatives, employees or other people known to the Defendants to act as nominal directors or shareholders of the ‘Connected Entities’ as a device to obscure the connections between those entities and the Defendants; the existence of elaborate webs of payments into the KK Group, out of the KK Group and between the ‘Connected Entities’ for which there is no proper or innocent explanation; and a lack of proper documentation to sit behind (and explain or justify) the various payments. Mr Howe suggested that, although each of the three claims can be considered independently of the others, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the crossover and cross-fertilisation and the common features of all three of them provides a further powerful evidential demonstration that the defendants are indeed involved in all three of them”</span>

In essence, this claim entailed the allegation that the Defendants caused Peak Aksenger to purchase Astana-Contract and its subsidiaries for some US$ 39.3 million more than they were worth; this was said to be a preparatory step to the Astana 2 aspect. HHJ Mackie QC decided that there was no good arguable case in relation to the Astana 1 claim ([2013] EWHC 3618), and it was discontinued in April 2016. As a result, Peak Aksenger is no longer a claimant in these proceedings.</span>

Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva served a joint Defence on 6 February 2015.  In summary, they largely admitted that they were involved in the decisions to enter into the relevant transactions but asserted that those were commercial decisions taken in what was perceived to be the best interests of the KK Group at the time and not in furtherance of any fraudulent scheme.

	      <span style="color:#000000">This denial was maintained before me at trial. Specifically, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva pointed to the fact that the Claimants’ case in relation to the alleged PEAK Claim is that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">all</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> sums paid to Arka-Stroy (less only those sums which can be shown to have been returned to the KK Group) were misappropriated by the Defendants, the contention, therefore, being that a total of US$ 109.1 million is due. Mr Twigger highlighted, however, that the Claimants do not allege how US$ 49.1 million of this total sum is supposed to have been misappropriated by the Defendants. The submission is made that it can be demonstrated that Arka-Stroy paid monies to a wide variety of entities in respect of whom there is no pleaded case of any connection with Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. Accordingly, Mr Twigger suggested, there is simply no case to answer in respect of this US$ 49.1 million. As to the balance, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva pointed out that US$ 37 million was paid to eleven entities which, on the Claimants’ case, were connected with the Defendants and that US$ 23 million was paid to five other entities also alleged to be</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “related to or associated with the First and Second Defendants”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As to the US$ 37 million, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva question how the Court is in any position to make findings about net figures, many of which result from a large number of debits and credits between Arka-Stroy and the various entities. Mr Twigger also highlighted how, in relation to many of the payments made by Arka-Stroy to the eleven entities alleged to have been connected to the Defendants, it has been possible to see what the entity has then done with the money and in many cases it can be seen that the money was used for a legitimate purpose. In relation to the US$ 23 million paid to the other five entities, Mr Twigger submitted that there is no evidence that these entities have any connection with Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva whatsoever. It is equally unclear, Mr Twigger suggested, how the Claimants say (if they say) that the relevant monies paid for the land plots which are the subject of the Land Plots Claim found their way to Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva in circumstances where it is possible to identify the entities to which CBC and Bolzhal (the companies from whom KK JSC purchased the land plots) paid the money received. </span>

Furthermore, he suggested, there is no evidence that the contractors to whom Astana-Contract made payments had any connection with the Defendants, nor that any of the payments found their way to Mr Arip or Ms Dikhanbayeva. Moreover, Mr Twigger emphasised, whereas Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s quantity surveying expert’s conclusion was that substantial work was carried out at the site in Astana, the Claimants’ equivalent expert had been instructed not to consider this claim at all. Mr Twigger submitted that, in such circumstances, the case that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">A further defence, that of time-bar, has also been raised by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. This involves the contention that the claims brought by the Claimants are all time-barred under the law of Kazakhstan, which has a three-year limitation period. Specifically, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva allege that the claims are time-barred on the basis that the Claimants were aware or ought to have become aware of the material facts more than three years before this action was commenced. Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s position is that Mr Werner has pretended that he had insufficient awareness of the Claimants’ claims until the discovery of the Arka-Stroy 1C database in 2013 and that the true position is that Mr Werner knew about all of the necessary elements of the claims at a much earlier stage. Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva rely, in particular, upon the report produced in December 2009 by PwC Russia, contending that, combined with other information available to Mr Werner, this would have enabled the Claimants to launch the Claims much earlier than they did and well before the expiry of the applicable three-year time-bar. Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva suggest that the reason why the Claimants did not pursue the allegations which they now make was because they were concerned about the impact this would have on their attempts to restructure the KK Group. </span>

On the same day, the Claim Form was issued and permission was given to serve Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva out of the jurisdiction. On 13 August 2013, Particulars of Claim were served. The following month, on 2 September 2013, Mr Arip applied to set aside the injunction on the grounds of material non-disclosure and no good arguable case on the merits in two respects, first because the claims of all the Claimants except KK Plc were time-barred, second because one particular fraud claim known as ‘Astana 1’ did not have sufficient merit and third, because the First Claimant’s loss on its claim was merely reflective of that suffered by the other Claimants. Those applications were heard over three days following which HHJ Mackie QC delivered a lengthy reserved judgment. He held that the Claimants (other than KK Plc, for which the </span>application of the reflective loss principle prevented its case from being a good arguable one<span style="color:#000000">) had a good arguable case, which was not prevented from being so due to limitation (i.e. that they were not time-barred) but that there was no good arguable case to support the Astana 1 Claim. He also held that there was no material non-disclosure or, if there was any at all, it was not such as to lead to a discharge of the Injunction. He therefore continued the injunction in the reduced sum of £72 million (i.e. excluding the sums claimed in Astana 1). Both sides appealed and in a judgment given by the Court of Appeal on 2 April 2014, Mr Arip’s appeal and KK Plc’s cross-appeal (on reflective loss) were both dismissed.</span></p>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Subsequently, all three of the Defendants sought summary dismissal of the claims under Part 24 on the basis that there was no real prospect of the Claimants avoiding being time-barred under Kazakh law. In the alternative, they sought the discharge of the Injunction on the basis that there is no good arguable case that the Claims are not time-barred and/or because of deliberate and material non-disclosure. They relied on a number of documents disclosed to them by SP Angel in support of these applications. These applications were dismissed by HHJ Waksman QC for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 27 October 2015. A few months after this, the Claimants settled their claim against Mr Zhunus in February 2016 with the consequence that the claim against him has been stayed. The remaining Defendants subsequently issued a Contribution Notice against Mr Zhunus. Mr Arip also applied for a worldwide freezing injunction against Mr Zhunus. Leggatt J refused to give permission to bring a claim for contribution, and also refused to grant a freezing injunction. However, his decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which granted permission to file and serve a contribution notice ([2016] EWCA Civ 1036).  Subsequently, on 17 February 2017, I directed that for all purposes connected with the Contribution Notice, Mr Zhunus would be bound by all findings made by the Court based on the evidence heard at the trial.

He, correctly, also characterised Mr Werner’s evidence as being of central importance to the issues regarding limitation since his evidence before me addressed primarily his relationship with the Defendants (in particular, Mr Arip) and the discovery of the (alleged) frauds (albeit in addition to what might be described as the architecture of the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims).

Even on a conservative estimate and taking the calculations set out in Mr Howe’s written closing submissions, this is likely in Mr Werner’s case to amount to something in the region of US$ 3.5 million. Mr Twigger’s submission is that, given this incentivisation, the evidence which Mr Werner gave should be treated with some circumspection. I agree with Mr Twigger about this. It does not follow, however, that Mr Werner should necessarily be regarded as somebody who would be prepared to give evidence which he knew to be false. On the contrary, in circumstances where Mr Werner, Mr McGregor and Ms Gorobtsova would inevitably have found themselves giving evidence in any event, given their continuing roles within the KK Group, it would hardly be right to view the only reason why they gave evidence at trial as being their hope that they will be paid the success fees to which victory would entitle them. </span>

Again, I cannot accept that this necessarily follows, however. Mr Werner insisted that “</span>

It seems to me that, ultimately, I must make an assessment of the evidence given by Mr Werner (and by Mr McGregor and Ms Gorobtsova) which takes into account a range of matters not limited to the fact that a success fee is potentially payable. </span>

First, Mr Twigger submitted that Werner became a shareholder of KK Plc knowing that it was in severe financial difficulty but thinking that it would somehow ‘turn to gold’ and that he would make his fortune. Mr Twigger suggested that Mr Werner went to considerable lengths to cling on to that dream, including paying sums which the KK Group could ill afford in order to buy out SP Angel for US$ 750,000 and subsequently Mr Khabbaz, for around US$ 8 million. The realisation, Mr Twigger suggested, that the dream would never come true has left Mr Werner with a sense of considerable resentment towards Mr Arip.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Secondly, Mr Twigger highlighted the manner in which evidence came to be given. It was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner displayed an untrustworthiness and evasiveness, specifically, so Mr Twigger suggested, in often laughing or smiling when answering questions about serious matters to which he failed to give convincing answers, and in adopting an argumentative approach when being asked reasonable questions during the course of cross-examination. I am not persuaded by Mr Twigger’s criticism in these respects. There is, of course, a danger in placing too much reliance on, for example, demeanour since different people react differently to the task of giving evidence in court. It was certainly clear to me that Mr Werner was very much alive to the need to ensure that the evidence which he gave did not harm the Claimants’ case on limitation and that he understood the importance of his own evidence in this regard. He was, at times, indeed, seemingly reluctant to give straightforward answers to questions put to him. As a result, at times he appeared somewhat cagey and there were certainly inconsistencies between what he was prepared to admit that he knew at particular times and what the documentary evidence suggested that he knew. Some of these contradictions may be ascribed to misremembering caused by the natural passage of time since it is obviously not always easy to recall after the event what was known at a particular point in the past. Another possibility, however, is that Mr Werner set out to mislead the Court. Although I am not persuaded that this is what he set out to do, I am nonetheless clear that, because of the importance of this case for Mr Werner and perhaps because also of a desire to avoid criticism concerning his previous actions, Mr Werner was determined in his evidence to say nothing which might be used as indicating that he knew more than he was at trial prepared to admit. This is not quite the same thing as setting out to give evidence which was untruthful, although I recognise that adopting such an approach was not what a witness in Mr Werner’s position ought to be doing. However, I reject Mr Twigger’s suggestion that, as he put it, as an </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“attempt to salvage some part of his ambitions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, Mr Werner sought to fabricate evidence which he gave before the Court – at least when he came to give evidence at trial. I am very clear nonetheless that it is important that I should not accept what Mr Werner had to say in evidence without adopting considerable care to evaluate its reliability by reference to the contemporaneous documents or inherent probability. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger relied on several examples of what he suggested amounted to Mr Werner engaging in fabrication at the pre-trial stage, specifically when seeking injunctive relief at the outset of these proceedings. He pointed out, for example, that Mr Werner’s first affidavit contained a fabricated account of how the Arka-Stroy 1C database came to be discovered. Specifically, Mr Werner claimed in paragraph 63 of this affidavit that he had approached somebody, whom he described as ‘X’ but which was a reference to Mr Kuzmenko, in late February or early March 2013, and that after he had given assurances to X/Mr Kuzmenko about his future, X/Mr Kuzmenko told him that Mr Werner ought to dismiss ‘Y’ (a reference to Mr Khasanov). During cross-examination, Mr Werner conceded that he himself had had no such conversation with Mr Kuzmenko at all and that it was Ms Gorobtsova who had had the conversation and who had given the relevant assurances to Mr Kuzmenko. His explanation was that he wanted to protect Ms Gorobtsova and so did not wish to identify her as the person who had had the conversation which he described in paragraph 63. Although Mr Twigger was understandably critical of this as an excuse, not least because it would have been open to Mr Werner to have protected Ms Gorobtstova by describing her with another letter (almost certainly as Z), I am not persuaded that this is, in and of itself, a reason to conclude that Mr Werner is a witness in whom the Court can have no confidence. It is unlikely that it will ever be justifiable to give evidence, whether orally or in a witness statement or affidavit, which is knowingly misleading. In my view, there was no justification in the present context, but I nonetheless accept that Mr Werner’s explanation was genuine. In short, whilst I agree with Mr Twigger that this incident should make me cautious in accepting everything which Mr Werner had to say at face value, it would be a mistake to treat Mr Werner as a witness who is inherently unreliable.</span>

This concerns the next two paragraphs of Mr Werner’s first affidavit, paragraphs 64 and 65, in which Mr Werner described, after the exchange with Mr Kuzmenko (as is now known, Ms Gorobtsova’s exchange rather than Mr Werner’s) calling Mr Khasanov into a meeting and telling him that he knew that he had been co-operating with the former shareholders and giving him an ultimatum to take sides with the KK Group or leave (paragraph 64), and how subsequently, on 4 March 2013, Mr Khasanov provided </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">him</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (Mr Werner) with copies of relevant 1C databases (paragraph 65). Mr Twigger’s position was that this is evidence which can be shown to be wrong in a number of respects. First, Mr Twigger made the point that Mr Khasanov’s evidence at trial was inconsistent with Mr Werner co-opting Mr Khasanov as he stated in paragraph 64 of his first affidavit since, on the contrary, it was Mr Kuzmenko who had first approached Mr Khasanov to assist in looking for the Arka-Stroy 1C database, which he managed to find in just a few minutes. Secondly, as Mr Twigger pointed out, both Mr Kuzmenko and Mr Khasanov confirmed in evidence that, by the time that the relevant meeting between Mr Werner and Mr Khasanov took place, at the Esentai Tower on 18 March 2013, Mr Khasanov had already found and provided the Arka-Stroy 1C database to Mr Werner. Thirdly, when asked about paragraph 65 by Mr Twigger, Mr Werner gave evidence that he himself did not receive the 1C databases, suggesting that when he used the word </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“I”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> in his written evidence he should not be taken as meaning him as opposed to the KK Group. Mr Twigger submitted that this again demonstrated a willingness on the part of Mr Werner to give evidence which he knew to be untrue, specifically in this instance evidence which, deployed in support of an injunction application, would give the impression that he had needed to exert pressure on KK Group employees before they would co-operate in searching for the Arka-Stroy 1C database, so suggesting that it was not readily discoverable. I agree with Mr Twigger that, in the circumstances, a cautious approach needs to be adopted to the evidence which Mr Werner gave. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me on, however, to another submission which was made by Mr Twigger concerning Mr Werner specifically and the Claimants (and their witnesses) more generally. It was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner has not been candid with the Court about the existence of documents created or received by him which are (or may have been) relevant to Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s limitation defence. Mr Twigger referred, in particular, in this context to Mr Werner’s authorising of the deletion of various email accounts since these proceedings were commenced. Mr Twigger also observed that many of the documents relevant to limitation which were before the Court at trial had not been disclosed by the Claimants but by Phoenicia and SP Angel. He suggested, indeed, that, had the Court been reliant on Mr Werner and the Claimants for documents, the true position on limitation would, as he put it,</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There is, in my view, little merit in Mr Twigger’s criticisms in this regard. They are, indeed, as I shall come on to explain, criticisms which might be regarded as somewhat rich in circumstances where it seems to me that there is very considerable force in Mr Howe’s observation that the disclosure process in this case has been</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “uncommonly one-sided”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is striking that Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s standard disclosure consisted of only 5,434 documents - a figure which came down to under 3,000 once it was appreciated that individually-scanned pages of a single larger document were being treated as individual documents. This compares to the 44,000 documents which have been disclosed by the Claimants after a review of approaching 300,000 documents. It is striking also that neither Mr Arip nor Ms Dikhanbayeva disclosed any emails from or to themselves as part of the standard disclosure process. The Claimants obtained emails involving them not from Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva but from Mr Zhunus after they had reached their settlement with him. Nor, Mr Howe pointed out, did either Mr Arip or Ms Dikhanbayeva search a single desktop computer, laptop, hard drive, tablet or mobile phone as part of standard disclosure. This was only done when the Claimants made an application requiring such searches to be undertaken and, even then, only a fairly modest (some 750) number of additional documents came to be disclosed. Furthermore, and directly relevant to the criticism concerning deletion of emails by the Claimants, Mr Howe pointed out that Mr Arip’s own solicitors, Cleary Gottlieb LLP (‘Cleary Gottlieb’), have referred to Mr Arip deleting</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “large numbers of emails”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> submission, that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva can only disclose what is within their control. He elaborated on this submission by pointing out that Cleary Gottlieb reviewed all emails in Mr Arip’s two email accounts and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s email account within the relevant date range that had not been previously reviewed. There was no deliberate concealment, Mr Twigger explained, highlighting how Mr Arip explained at trial that, during the disclosure process, he provided Cleary Gottlieb with the access details to his email account so that they could review the contents, and that he identified in detail all of the electronic devices that were in his control or had been at any material time and gave all electronic devices still in his control to Cleary Gottlieb to be searched (including old mobile phones which he had given to family members after he had purchased newer models). As to deletion of emails by Mr Arip, Mr Twigger made the point that this took place before commencement of these proceedings and not after, and that the deletion was, indeed, routine because it entailed Mr Arip merely deleting emails from his ‘arip.co.uk’ account when the limit on the relevant mailbox was reached. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Whilst I take on board these various points, it is nonetheless difficult to view too favourably the position concerning the Defendants’ disclosure given the significant disparity between the amount of disclosure given by the Claimants, on the one hand, and Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva, on the other.  Mr Twigger is, no doubt, right that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva can only give disclosure of documents which are in their control. What is surprising is that there are so few such documents. Returning, however, to the disclosure which was given by the Claimants, Mr Twigger made the point, not unreasonably, that there was a delay between the Claimants obtaining injunctive relief in late July 2013, in fact from the time when litigation must have been in contemplation which must have been several months before the injunction was obtained, and a formal instruction being given within the KK Group to preserve electronic documents. That instruction was, somewhat surprisingly, not given until June 2015, which was two months after Allen &amp; Overy LLP (‘Allen &amp; Overy’) took over from Zaiwalla &amp; Co (‘Zaiwalla’). Plainly, this is regrettable. It is not something which should have happened. The fact, however, is that this particular error was made not by Mr Werner or, for that matter, Mr McGregor (and the KK Group) but by the solicitors formerly instructed by the Claimants. Specifically, although it was suggested to Mr McGregor in particular, during the course of cross-examination, that he was at fault as regards the giving of a retention notice, he was not employed by the KK Group until some nine months or so after Zaiwalla had been instructed to act. In my view, when he started at the KK Group, Mr McGregor was entitled to take it that Zaiwalla had given the relevant notice. Although Mr Twigger suggested that he ought to have checked whether this was the case, I consider this an unfair criticism. I appreciate that he was the General Counsel of the KK Group, but to suggest that he should have checked whether a retention notice had been issued in circumstances where an experienced firm of solicitors were acting for the KK Group is, in my view, not realistic. As Mr Twigger reminded me, I asked Mr McGregor during the course of cross-examination why it took almost 2 years for the relevant notice to be issued. Mr McGregor’s suggestion was that there was a lot going on when he arrived in his new job at the KK Group. He explained that there had not been</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “a quiet day really and it was something that was eventually considered at the commencement of - just after Allen &amp; Overy had come on board and we had changed law firms”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr McGregor likened the circumstances in which he joined the KK Group as being akin to “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">parachuting into a battle</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” since he was dealing with Financial Police raids and “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">aggressive</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” enforcement proceedings by various banks. I can understand why, in such circumstances, he assumed steps had already been taken before he joined the KK Group and simply gave no thought to the question of whether a retention notice had been issued.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Coming to Mr Werner, his evidence was that, prior to December 2012, he routinely deleted emails but that he would have kept those which were important. The significance of December 2012 is that Mr Werner initially identified that as the time when litigation was first in contemplation, but in evidence three days later he explained that litigation was in contemplation in September 2012. Furthermore, Allen &amp; Overy had previously, when dealing with the question of litigation privilege, identified the relevant date when litigation had been in contemplation as having been July 2012. Ultimately it does not seem to me that much turns on these date differences, however, in circumstances where it was Mr Werner’s evidence that, even when he did delete emails, he confined that deletion to emails which were not important. I accept that evidence, despite Mr Twigger’s ability to point to certain examples of documents which Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva have been able to obtain from third parties and which are exchanges to which Mr Werner was a party. A particular example of this is a document dated 24 April 2012 setting out workings on </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“impaired receivables”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, which Mr Werner accepted in evidence must have been on his computer since, several months later, in December 2012, he forwarded a version of it to Mr Khabbaz of Phoenicia Capital, a former shareholder in KK Plc which pursued a derivative action in New York in late 2012. Mr Werner was unable to explain why this document (and the email forwarding it to Mr Khabbaz on 17 December 2012) had not been disclosed, having earlier explained (more than once) that disclosure was not something with which he had been involved. The documentation concerned (both the email and its forwarded attachment) had been obtained by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva from Phoenicia Capital rather than from the Claimants. Why that should be the case is not clear. I am unwilling, however, to conclude that it was the result of any deliberate decision on the part of the Claimants to suppress relevant documents relating, in particular, to the limitation issue.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> of his witness statements consisted of commentary and argument on matters in relation to which he had no first-hand knowledge. He emphasised also that, whether as a current employee of the KK Group and a colleague of Mr Werner or because he and Mr Werner are friends, Mr McGregor is not somebody who can properly be regarded as independent. In this context, Mr Twigger pointed (as he had done in relation to Mr Werner) to the fact that Mr McGregor stands to benefit from payment of a not insubstantial success fee in the event that the claimants are successful in these proceedings. Mr McGregor was cross-examined about this, specifically as to the circumstances in which the remuneration committee of KK Plc awarded various individuals, including Mr McGregor, a percentage (2% in Mr McGregor’s case) of the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“net proceeds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of this litigation and as to the nature of the arrangements.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> meaning sums recovered by the Claimants in relation to the PEAK and Land Plots Claims after deduction of the Claimants’ net costs (costs incurred less costs recovered) and the investment of Harbour, the litigation funder.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> which had to be passed before he and the other success fee beneficiaries would receive any of the litigation proceeds, including a payment to the Claimants’ creditors (which he believed to be subject to a cap of circa US$ 20 million), and payments due under the funding arrangements with Harbour. Mr Twigger suggested that Mr McGregor clearly in his evidence wanted to downplay the fact that his 2% success fee could amount to a sum of several million dollars, if the claims succeed. </span>

The Claimants say she played an instrumental part in relation to what they would characterise as the discovery of the frauds in 2013, and it was clear to me that she did, indeed, play a key part in the investigations which took place in late 2012/early 2013.  She gave evidence in relation to these investigations, as well as the circumstances prevailing in the KK Group at this time. Ms Gorobtsova’s evidence was that, within a few months of joining the KK Group, by around August 2012, through general “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Ms Gorobtsova also gave evidence as to her own subsequent investigations into Arka-Stroy, which led to the discovery of the 1C database for Arka-Stroy.

This, combined with the fact that (like Mr Werner and Mr McGregor) Ms Gorobtsova stands personally to gain in the event that the claims succeed, through the 2% success fee which has been awarded to her, Mr Twigger submitted, calls into question her reliability as a witness. In this context, Mr Twigger drew attention to the fact that Ms Gorobtsova has only recently been awarded this success fee by Mr Werner exercising a discretion to make such awards vested in him by the KK Group, suggesting that it cannot be a coincidence that award of it came only shortly before Ms Gorobtsova served a supplemental witness statement for the purposes of trial, having initially not served a trial statement. Although, as with Mr Werner and Mr McGregor, it is appropriate that I should bear in mind that Ms Gorobtsova stands to benefit, not insubstantially, from the Claimants meeting with success in these proceedings, and so to approach her evidence on the basis that it is not wholly impartial, I am not persuaded that I should proceed on the basis that what Ms Gorobtsova had to say is, for this reason, questionable. Nor do I consider that her relationship with Mr Werner makes her necessarily an unreliable witness. I agree that I should not accept Ms Gorobtsova’s evidence without question. I do not, however, start from the premise that she was an unreliable witness. In fact, the evidence which she gave is, to some extent, supportive of the </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“difficult for me to remember the exact dates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since it</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “was a long time ago”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and these were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“normal routine works and jobs”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He was perfectly willing to accept that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“I may be wrong. I may be slightly mistaken with specific dates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It seems to me that this was a sign of an honest witness. Mr Twigger also pointed to the fact that in his fourth witness statement Mr Kuzmenko stated that Ms Gorobtsova approached him in February 2013 about looking for the Arka-Stroy 1C database and that, prior to this, he had no knowledge or suspicion of the fraudulent activity which is alleged in the current proceedings, yet during the course of her evidence Ms Gorobtsova referred to having picked up on gossip within the KK Group after she started work there in May 2012 to the effect that former shareholders </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“were fraudsters”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and identified Mr Kuzmenko as one of the people who was saying this. Mr Twigger submitted that, in the circumstances, the Court should infer that in his fourth witness statement Mr Kuzmenko was seeking to support the impression created by the Claimants that the present claims could not have been advanced prior to the discovery of the Arka-Stroy 1C database, when actually he harboured suspicions (at a minimum) much earlier. I am, however, not persuaded by this submission. It is not a point which was put to Mr Kuzmenko during the course of cross-examination. Furthermore, reviewing the evidence which Ms Gorobtsova gave, during the course of her cross-examination, it is perfectly possible that she was mistaken in thinking that Mr Kuzmenko told her that the former shareholders </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“were fraudsters”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. She explained that it was not a case of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“lots of people”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> telling her that this was the position </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“but people that I used to communicate with a lot”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. True it is that she mentioned Mr Kuzmenko. She, however, went on to refer to others, such as a Mr Berdibekov, an engineer, and </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“some accountants from the group”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, explaining that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in the kitchen when we were having lunch together we were just discussing like - we used to have very nice times, expensive cars and helicopters and lots of money. But they all knew that money was taken from the bank, so it could not - it could have not possibly been nice times, because money was taken from the banks, so something was obviously happening, in the opinion of those people”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was not the most precise evidence. I can quite see, in the circumstances, that Ms Gorobtsova may have been mistaken in recalling Mr Kuzmenko as being one of the people who told her that the former shareholders </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“were fraudsters”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger went on to refer to Mr Kuzmenko’s account of the difficulty encountered in locating the Arka-Stroy 1C database. He submitted that Mr Kuzmenko was wrong to suggest that there was anything like the difficulty which he described. He contrasted the evidence which was given by Mr Khasanov on the topic, pointing out that that evidence was supported by certain screenshots showing the location of particular databases (including the Arka-Stroy 1C database). Mr Kuzmenko, so Mr Twigger submitted, was, therefore, wrong to suggest that Mr Khasanov had to scan through lots of databases individually and open each of them to find out to which company the database related. The explanation for this, in my view, is that, as Mr Kuzmenko explained at the outset of his cross-examination, although he was head of the KK Group’s IT Department, his expertise was not the same as that of Mr Khasanov, who was the manager of what he described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the developers department”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and (unlike Mr Kuzmenko) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the programmer”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Kuzmenko went on to acknowledge, in frank terms, that, whilst he could himself have located the Arka-Stroy 1C database, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it would have taken me much more time”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. If Mr Kuzmenko was somewhat insistent in response to Mr Twigger’s questions on the topic of accessibility, I am clear that it was not because he was trying to be obstructive. On the contrary, my impression was that he was doing his best to describe the technical position from his perspective. I reject the suggestion, or implication, that he was endeavouring to make the process undertaken by Mr Khasanov sound more complicated than it was. Had that been his objective in giving his evidence, then, he would not have acknowledged as readily as he did that, once asked to look for the Arka-Stroy 1C database, Mr Khasanov had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“found it very quickly”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I am in no doubt, in the circumstances, that the suggestion made by Mr Twigger that Mr Kuzmenko’s evidence on this issue was so unreliable as to render all parts of his evidence, which are not supported by contemporaneous documents, unreliable is unrealistic and should not be accepted.</span>

Mr Khashimov gave the principal written witness statement, with Mr Nagashibaev providing a short witness statement confirming he agreed with the witness statement of Mr Khashimov. For this reason, Mr Khashimov gave evidence first, for some 40 minutes, following which Mr Nagashibaev gave evidence but to a much lesser extent, in that he was simply asked to confirm his agreement with Mr Khashimov’s oral evidence (which he did), and made one or two comments of his own. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> and </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, remarking on the absence of transparency as to what the farmers were actually asked or whether they were, in fact, people who sold the land which they claimed once to have owned. Mr Twigger described the security guards as having </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“stuck to their script”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He was right about this and right also to remind me that, when Mr Nagashibaev’s cross-examination proved to be somewhat curtailed, he launched into a speech in which he insisted that he respected older people and </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“could not have done anything else”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although it was not entirely clear what was meant by this, I took it that what Mr Nagashibaev was trying to say was that neither he nor Mr Khashimov was in a position to question what they were being told by the farmers. This was a curious point, however, to have made and leads me to suspect that Mr Nagashibaev was, perhaps, rather overstating the position. I tend to agree with Mr Twigger, therefore, that there is something of a question mark over the way in which the elderly farmers would have perceived being asked to sign a statement presented to them by two physically intimidating security guards. I agree also that it was not altogether satisfactory that the taking of the farmers’ evidence should have been left to two security guards who had no experience, still less any relevant qualification, to gather evidence for use in court proceedings. I consider that Mr Twigger was right to observe that such evidence ought to have been obtained by the Claimants’ solicitors in more conventional ways. Although, in the circumstances, especially since Mr Twigger did not seek to impugn the honesty of Mr Khashimov and Mr Nagashibaev, I decline the invitation to place no weight on their evidence, I consider it right nonetheless to approach the evidence with some circumspection. </span>

Mr Gafurov is a Kazakhstan national who studied in England before joining his father’s construction company in Kazakhstan in 2010. As I have mentioned, he produced a report in early 2013 concluding that the work done on the construction sites in issue in these proceedings were worth far less than the amount paid by the KK Group, and that the former management of the KK Group had executed “</span>

Although Mr Twigger sought to highlight the fact that at the time when he carried out the work about which he gave evidence he was a recent graduate in his early 20s who lacked substantial experience in the construction profession, he nonetheless relied on the fact Mr Gafurov’s evidence was that what he found was </span>

His central submission focused on the absence of any evidence from a witness who was there at the time that the alleged frauds were committed by the Defendants, the sole exception in this regard being Mr Kuzmenko, who (as somebody involved with IT) would have had very limited relevant knowledge about the matters relating to the alleged frauds. Mr Twigger highlighted how the KK Group had around a thousand employees in 2007/2008. These included Mr Tulegenov (a director of KK JSC and PEAK who was closely involved with the PEAK and Astana construction projects as well as the acquisition of the Land Plots), Ms Kogutyuk (a senior manager and subsequently the CEO of KK JSC who was responsible for creating many of the documents at issue and who remained employed well into Mr Werner’s tenure at the KK Group), Ms Yelgeldieva (a key member of the Finance Department who assisted Mr Werner and Mr Gafurov with their investigations), Ms Zhambuzova (a key member of the Legal Department) and Ms Zhondelbaeva (who had acted as an accountant for both the Claimants and Arka-Stroy). Mr Twigger pointed to others also who were outside the KK Group and fully involved in relevant events, such as Mr Mackay, Mr Facey and Mr Fraser of SP Angel, Mr Ferguson of the auditors, BDO, Mr McAllister of PwC and Mr Khabbaz.  </span>

Mr Twigger observed that, had he attended to give evidence, he could have been cross-examined about his knowledge of the three principal allegations, including, for example, his role in relation to Arka-Stroy and the relationship between Arka-Stroy and the KK Group, his involvement in the PEAK and Astana 2 construction projects and his oversight and involvement in the land plots transactions. The submission was made that, in such circumstances, it is appropriate to infer that Mr Tulegenov would not have supported the case now advanced by the Claimants. Mr Twigger submitted, similarly, that other witnesses, such as Ms Yelgeldieva who was not only employed in various finance roles within the KK Group from 2003 until 2014 but also assisted the Claimants in preparing the Lawsuit Narrative to which I shall later refer and Mr Gafurov in preparing his report, could have attended to give supportive evidence. The same, Mr Twigger suggested, applies to Ms Kogutyuk, who between 2003 and 2013 was employed first as a lawyer and later as the CEO of KK JSC and was responsible for drafting the KK Group’s complaint about the former shareholders to the Financial Police in March 2011. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There are, however, certain difficulties with these submissions. The Claimants in this case are alleging fraud which is said to have been committed in the most complex of fashions. This is not, therefore, a straightforward case in which it can safely be said that a particular witness ought obviously to have been called at trial. The position is more involved than that. As regards Mr Tulegenov in particular, as Mr Twigger fairly acknowledged, the Claimants’ case entails Mr Tulegenov himself being at the heart of the alleged frauds. The same obviously applies also to Mr Zhunus, another person whom Mr Twigger submitted ought to have been called as a witness, particularly given that, under the settlement agreement reached between Mr Zhunus and the Claimants, Mr Zhunus was contractually obliged to give truthful evidence if the Claimants required it. As I myself pointed out during the course of opening submissions, however, it is not open to a party to call a witness to give evidence which that party will say is not only wrong but deliberately so.

The party cannot cross-examine his own witness by reference to his proof of evidence or other previous statement unless and until the court has ruled that he is hostile.

In truth, as Mr Twigger observed, the issue is not so much whether it is appropriate for the Court to draw any inference that Mr Zhunus would not have supported the Claimants’ case if called as a witness since presumably involvement in any fraud would have been denied, but whether the Claimants were somehow obliged to have prosecuted their case against him to trial in order to establish their case against Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. This, in circumstances where many of the entities through which Mr Arip is alleged to have misappropriated money were either jointly controlled by Mr Zhunus or were controlled solely by him (or one of his relatives). I agree with Mr Howe, however, that it does not matter whether Mr Zhunus is proceeded against or not since there is no issue that under Kazakh law the principle of joint and several liability for joint wrongdoers, which is familiar to English lawyers, also exists. </span>

He made the point that it was Mr Werner who engaged SP Angel and who worked closely with them throughout the material years. Clearly, Mr Mackay and Mr Fraser (who apparently remain employed by SP Angel), as well as Mr Facey, could potentially have given relevant evidence. Had they done so, then, as Mr Twigger submitted, they could have been cross-examined in relation to their level of awareness of the fraud allegations which are levelled in these proceedings by the Claimants against Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. In my view, however, it does not follow that, simply because these witnesses were not called by the Claimants as witnesses at trial, it is appropriate to draw the inference that they would not have supported the Claimants’ case had they given evidence. That is a possibility, of course, but I am reluctant to conclude that it is anything more than that. In those circumstances, whilst obviously in the absence of evidence from SP Angel personnel I cannot assume that, had such evidence been adduced, it would have supported the Claimants’ case, nor, in my view, should I infer the opposite.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I come on now to deal with the witnesses called by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva at trial. Besides Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva themselves, there were the following further witnesses: Mr Alessandro Manghi; Mr Vladimir Gerasimov; Mr Nikolay Kosarev; Mr Alexander Sannikov; Mr Nurlan Sharipov; Mr Igor Zhangurov; Mr Erzhan Jumadilov; Mr Mamed Mamedov; Mr Rasul Khasanov; and Mr Vladislav Belochkin. Mr Howe submitted that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva were revealed by the evidence which they gave to have been profoundly dishonest and willing to lie on oath repeatedly. He suggested that (with the exception of Mr Kosarev) Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s other factual witnesses gave evidence which was, at best, unreliable and, at worst, knowingly false. Mr Howe highlighted, in particular, how in the case of one of the witnesses, Mr Jumadilov, a land broker, his response, when confronted with his own dishonesty, was the disconcertingly nonchalant </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“C’est la vie”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger saw things somewhat differently. He highlighted how, he suggested in contrast to the approach adopted by the Claimants, the witnesses called by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva were able to give evidence which spanned the entire relevant period and covered a range of seniority, department and subject area. His submission was that each of these witnesses gave evidence which was both honest and truthful. He drew attention in this regard to the fact that none of the Defendants’ witnesses was employed by, or otherwise financially connected to, the Defendants. The fact that two of the witnesses, Mr Manghi and Mr Gerasimov, remain on friendly terms with Mr Arip is, Mr Twigger suggested, neither here nor there since these witnesses were plainly neutral and independent. </span>

Mr Arip could be described as an international businessman. Kazakh by birth, he is now resident in Switzerland, previous to which he was resident in Dubai. He holds citizenship of Cyprus and St Kitts and Nevis, having renounced his Kazakh citizenship, purportedly because having non-Kazakh citizenship makes it easier for him to conduct business internationally.  He has a Bachelor’s degree in law and a Master’s degree in business administration, both from universities in Kazakhstan. He has held senior management positions in at least four companies (including the KK Group). However, his evidence at trial was that, currently, he was not “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">At the risk of stating the obvious, Mr Arip’s evidence was of critical importance since at the heart of this case is the allegation made by the Claimants that Mr Arip (together with Ms Dikhanbayeva) is a thoroughly dishonest individual. Mr Howe submitted in his opening submissions that Mr Arip had repeatedly changed his position in his written evidence to fit the available documents, and that a typical stance taken by him (and Ms Dikhanbayeva) was to make outright denials if they felt they could get away with it (for example, regarding Mr Arip’s connection to CBC and Bolzhal), and then, when it became clear that they could not, to manufacture carefully constructed explanations designed to try to fit the available documents. These points were repeated by Mr Howe in the course of Mr Arip’s lengthy cross-examination. Mr Howe submitted that nothing Mr Arip or Ms Dikhanbayeva said in their statements or orally could be relied upon, save where it was an admission against their interests or where the evidence was unequivocally corroborated by a contemporaneous document. He urged the Court to adopt the approach that, on any given issue, the presumption must be that they were lying to conceal their fraud. </span>

Mr Twigger observed that it was unsurprising that Mr Arip was unable to answer certain questions about the details of several transactions or companies, particularly given that (as Mr Manghi explained when he came to give evidence) Mr Arip managed by delegation, setting objectives, strategy and tactics and then leaving his managers to execute matters with minimal interference. Mr Twigger went on to observe that, as a successful businessman who has been involved in other business ventures since leaving the KK Group some eight years ago, it would be unrealistic to expect him to have a good memory of all of the relevant details. He stressed that, where Mr Arip had made mistakes in witness statements, he had corrected those mistakes in subsequent witness statements and was quite prepared to acknowledge further errors when these were put to him during cross-examination. Mr Twigger furthermore characterised criticism that Mr Arip had not dealt with matters in his witness statements as being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“unreal”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> given that he had had to face, Mr Twigger suggested, allegations by the Claimants which were somewhat broad. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Having reflected on the matter with considerable care, I find it impossible to agree with Mr Twigger’s characterisation of Mr Arip. My overwhelming impression is that Mr Arip was not an honest witness; indeed, that he was a thoroughly dishonest witness. During his cross-examination, Mr Arip often came across as evasive. He sought to avoid answering difficult questions about documents which contradicted his evidence, employing a number of different tactics in this regard as I shall explain in a moment. When pressed to provide a response to the specific questions put to him, he was, on a number of occasions, unable to provide any, and certainly any adequate, explanation for various transactions, or for documents which contradicted his evidence. I am quite satisfied that Mr Arip was intent, when giving evidence, to present a thoroughly misleading picture to the Court in order to try to cover up his role in the alleged frauds.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It became immediately apparent in the course of Mr Arip’s cross-examination that some parts of his written evidence, whilst not necessarily untrue, were misleading in that they omitted certain pertinent facts. For example, Mr Arip stated in his fourteenth witness statement that he joined the KK Group as General Director of KK JSC in October 2003. Later in that statement, Mr Arip stated that he had seen documents which showed that the KK Group had entered into contracts with Arka-Stroy in September 2003, “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">before I was even a shareholder in the Kagazy Group</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. However, Mr Arip admitted in cross-examination that he had, in fact, first become involved in the KK Group in February 2003, as shown from a board resolution dated 12 February 2003 appointing him as “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">board chairman</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. In other words, although Mr Arip’s statement that the KK Group entered into contracts with Arka-Stroy before he became a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">shareholder</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was not actually untrue, it was, on any view, misleading in that it gave the impression that Mr Arip had no involvement at all in the KK Group before that date, and so that Arka-Stroy had become involved with the KK Group independently of him. Similarly, in that same witness statement, Mr Arip stated that Arka-Stroy’s offices were located at the Beis Club, only to accept in cross-examination that he had failed to mention in this statement that Arka-Stroy had also occupied space at KK JSC’s offices. Again, this was relevant to the issue of whether Arka-Stroy was an independent third party contractor or a creature controlled by the Defendants. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It seems to me that Mr Arip’s written evidence missed out relevant facts in order to give a misleading impression of what actually happened. This was economy with the truth which can have been no accident. Furthermore, Mr Arip often appeared evasive when answering questions. At times, he gave very long-winded answers to what were really very straightforward questions. For example, Mr Howe referred him in cross-examination to an email from Mr Makovac, the Managing Director of Arka-Stroy, in which he stated that, for the work on the logistics centre, he needed more employees (an administrator, two project managers, and a driver with a car). Mr Howe asked why Mr Makovac was asking Mr Arip (who, on Mr Arip’s case, was, in effect, the client of Arka-Stroy) for extra employees. Mr Arip’s response was that Mr Makovac was asking for an approval of the budget from the KK Group and he then proceeded to give a long-winded explanation of the budgeting systems in place, and the difficulties with budgeting in the financial climate which prevailed at that time. The giving of long and elaborate answers to simple questions was, in my view, a technique which was adopted by Mr Arip in order to avoid having to answer the question in a straightforward fashion.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Another strategy deployed by Mr Arip when facing Mr Howe’s questions was to feign a lack of understanding as to what the question was. This was what might be described as wilful misunderstanding. Mr Arip is an intelligent man. He understands English well and I am in no doubt that he understood what Mr Howe was putting to him. Mr Howe was admirably clear in formulating his questions (as also, I should observe in the interests of fairness, was Mr Twigger when he was cross-examining the Claimants’ witnesses). For example, Mr Howe referred to a diagram prepared by the Claimants’ forensic accountant, and asked Mr Arip about a payment shown on that chart of US$ 1.9 million made by KK JSC to Holding Invest, US$ 1.8 million of which was then transferred to Trading Company (a company owned by Mr Arip’s mother-in-law), which then sent it on to a company called Sunclub LLP. Mr Arip first stated that he had already explained in his written evidence that Holding Invest had received money from Bolzhal for the sale of its office building. Mr Howe pointed out that he had not been asking about a payment from Bolzhal but a payment from KK JSC. Mr Arip then stated that the diagram was incomplete and that this payment was probably financial aid from Bolzhal. I then again pointed out to Mr Arip that he was not being asked about Bolzhal but a separate payment from KK JSC to Holding Invest. He then suggested that this payment related to lease termination payments, because KK JSC had been occupying office space owned by Holding Invest. Mr Howe explained that the forensic accountants had identified the payments relating to that lease, but that this particular payment (amounting to US$ 1.9 million) was not one of them. Mr Arip’s response to this was that he could not remember what this payment related to. A misunderstanding on Mr Arip’s part concerning the questions which were put to him could have been attributable to nerves or to unfamiliarity with the case. That was not the position with Mr Arip, however. I repeat that Mr Arip is an intelligent man who has been deeply involved in the detail of these proceedings for some time. Indeed, he attended much of the thirteen week trial, showing his heavy involvement in the case. This was deliberate misunderstanding of questions designed to avoid having to answer them. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Another illustration of Mr Arip’s deeply unsatisfactory approach to the giving of his evidence was his attitude to unsigned contracts. Whenever Mr Arip was faced with a contract or agreement which was not signed, his response tended to be that it was meaningless and did not prove anything because it was unsigned. Even when it was put to him that these unsigned contracts, at the very least, showed that someone within the KK Group’s legal team had been instructed to draw up contracts relating to these payments, Mr Arip’s response was that such contracts could just be draft templates and, as such, did not show anything. This was a deeply unimpressive position to adopt. It smacked of obstructiveness and an unwillingness to be open. For example, Mr Arip was shown an (unsigned) agreement on 6 June 2005 between Kagazy Gofrotara (represented by Mr Arip) and Arka-Stroy (represented by Mr Esimbekov). Mr Howe put to Mr Arip that this document showed that Mr Esimbekov was acting as a director of Arka-Stroy at that time. Mr Arip denied that it showed this on the basis that the document was unsigned. When Mr Howe put to Mr Arip that it did, at a minimum, show that someone had drawn up a document stating that Mr Esimbekov was a director, Mr Arip was not even willing to agree this, observing only, unrealistically and frankly disingenuously, that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">a lot of documents would be drafts and they will simply use the same template, so we can’t really say that it is certain that he was a director</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Arip took the same approach when confronted with financial assistance or debt transfer agreements between companies alleged to be connected with him. For example, when presented with an (unsigned) financial assistance agreement between HW &amp; Ltd (‘HW’) (which received payments from Arka-Stroy) and Holding Invest (which Mr Arip accepted was controlled by him and Mr Zhunus), and asked why someone would have drafted such an agreement, his response was that he thought that this transaction had not happened and that the document “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">could be a template which people use a lot</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Arip was also asked about a draft debt transfer agreement between Lotos, Arka-Stroy, Trading Company, and HW, which actually featured a comment bubble stating that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Since there was no basis for the origin of the debt, we decided to specify the reconciliation Report…</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Howe suggested that this comment demonstrated the bogus nature of the contract, yet Mr Arip’s response was that, the agreement could not be bogus because the transaction which the report provided for had not come to fruition and actually happened. For my part, however, I did not find Mr Arip’s explanation that any unsigned contract which contradicted his evidence must simply be an incorrect draft or a template to be satisfactory. My clear view is that he took this stance simply in order to avoid having to answer questions about these documents. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Another tack taken by Mr Arip when faced with certain contracts for financial assistance or other payments (even when signed), or documents referring to such payments, was that these payments may have never actually occurred and that this should be checked against the available bank statements. For example, Mr Howe referred to a resolution of Lotos (a company alleged to be controlled by Mr Arip) to pledge money to Alliance Bank to guarantee the liabilities of Kagazy Processing. He suggested to Mr Arip that this showed that Lotos was treated as a KK Group company. Mr Arip’s response was that he did not know anything about this arrangement and that the Alliance Bank ledgers should be checked to see whether this payment actually occurred. This, in my view, was nothing more than a pretence. It is inconceivable that somebody in Mr Arip’s position would not have known about the arrangement. Mr Arip took a similar approach on a number of other occasions.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is telling also that when, in due course, Mr Howe presented Mr Arip with details of transactions compiled from bank statements, his response was to say that he had not had a chance to prepare a response. I had the impression that what he meant by this, but was obviously unable to say in terms, was that he needed time in which to think what he could say to explain away the obvious. Thus, Mr Howe handed up a table prepared by the Claimants’ forensic accounting expert, compiled from Trading Company’s bank statements, which showed payments to Lotos, Ada Trade, and Kontakt Service Plus (which the Claimants alleged were connected to the Defendants), as well as a number of KK Group companies. Mr Howe put to Mr Arip that payments were being made to these companies because they were all controlled by Mr Arip. Mr Arip’s response was that these payments came from his separate oil business (Barnard Commercial S.A ("Barnard").) and so had nothing to do with the KK Group. He also stated that he did not know exactly what all of the transactions related to, and that he was not in a position to answer questions in such detail about transactions which had happened eight years previously. He insisted that, as he had never seen the table before, he had had no chance to check the underlying contractual documentation. He nonetheless asserted, in the most general terms, that there would have been valid business reasons for the payments.  Again, I found Mr Arip’s response in this regard to be highly unsatisfactory. He ought to have been able to address Mr Howe’s point without needing to delve into the detail of the various payments. The truth is that Mr Arip was unable to provide an answer to what was being put to him because there was no answer which he could sensibly give. His refuge, in the circumstances, to not having had the opportunity to consider the details contained in the document which Mr Howe showed him, was unimpressive to say the least. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">A further tactic deployed by Mr Arip was to deny knowledge of a particular payment or transaction, and to suggest that Ms Dikhanbayeva should instead be asked about this “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">because she was more involved in the financial matters</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Arip was clearly trying to avoid having to answer such questions, and to give the impression that he was not really involved in directing these payments. I found Mr Arip’s approach in this regard, again, to be deeply unsatisfactory. To hide behind his purported ignorance of the detail and direct Mr Howe to Ms Dikhanbayeva demonstrated a deep-rooted unwillingness to be open with the Court which bordered on disdain. Mr Arip must have known about the payments since I am quite clear that he was orchestrating them.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is worth mentioning also that at various points during Mr Arip’s evidence he asked to make further comments on documents or questions which had been put to him previously. This did not involve the sort of clarification in which witnesses sometimes engage. On the contrary, I had the distinct impression that Mr Arip used such opportunities to put forward explanations which he had contrived after having had time during breaks in the proceedings to think about matters further. For example, on the morning of the second day of Mr Arip’s cross-examination, he was asked about an employment contract between Arka-Stroy and its Managing Director, Mr Makovac, dated 1 July 2005, which Mr Arip had signed on behalf of Arka-Stroy, and an email which Mr Makovac had sent to Mr Arip in October 2006. This email set out a draft agreement for the termination of Mr Makovac’s employment contract, which provided that Mr Arip was to sign as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Representative of the Employer”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (i.e. Arka-Stroy). Mr Howe put to Mr Arip that this (as well as various other documents) demonstrated that Mr Arip was controlling Arka-Stroy. Mr Arip’s initial response was that this termination agreement might have related to a separate consultancy agreement between Mr Makovac and Holding Invest because, as well as being the Managing Director of Arka-Stroy, Mr Makovac was also assisting Holding Invest. Mr Howe described this as “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">a startling suggestion which had never previously been made</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. He was right about this. Mr Howe put to Mr Arip that the termination agreement must have referred to the employment contract between Mr Makovac and Arka-Stroy because it referred to a specific clause in that employment contract dealing with early termination provisions, suggesting that Mr Arip had simply invented the idea that there was any additional consultancy arrangement. Mr Howe was plainly right about this also. Indeed, Mr Arip had no answer to the point. He was driven to saying “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">I don’t want to speculate, my Lord, I don’t want to be – I’m sorry, I just don’t know. So I’m not going to deal with that point</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. There matters rested until in the afternoon of that same day Mr Arip said that he wanted to make an additional point in relation to the termination agreement with Mr Makovac. This was that he wanted to make it clear that he had never signed it. Then, the following morning and so after a break, Mr Arip again explained that he wanted to make a further point. This was that the reason why Mr Makovac had referred to him (Mr Arip) as an employee was that he was using “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">casual language</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, adding that respect and sub-ordination is very important culturally in Kazakhstan with the result that people use different language and do things differently. This was evidence which was simply not credible. More than this, it was evidence which Mr Arip persisted in giving despite the fact that he knew it to be wholly false. Mr Howe submitted that, on the topic of Mr Makovac’s departure, Mr Arip’s evidence “</span>

He made matters much worse, in terms of his credibility, by his subsequent efforts to appear plausible since each time he tried by putting forward another explanation his willingness to give misleading evidence became all the more obvious.</span>

Between 1997 and 2001, she worked for the Seimar Investment Group which previously owned KK JSC before KK JSC was sold to Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip in 2004. Ms Dikhanbayeva left Seimar Investment Group in 2001 (at which point she was the financial director) to become the senior financial director at KK JSC, in charge of the finance department. She subsequently became a member of the board of directors of KK JSC in April 2008, and became chairman of the board in September 2008. In July 2009, she left the KK Group to become chief financial officer of Exillon, an oil and gas production company, which, as I have mentioned, is the venture to which all the Defendants moved after leaving the KK Group (formerly named Caspian Minerals Plc). </span>

I agree, instead, with Mr Howe when he submitted that, like Mr Arip, Ms Dikhanbayeva gave untruthful evidence in order to cover up her involvement in the alleged frauds. I agree also with his submission that she repeatedly gave long, evasive answers, often seeking to give pre-prepared speeches to pre-empt aspects of her evidence which she appeared to appreciate presented difficulties. The truth is that Ms Dikhanbayeva repeatedly came up with highly improbable and plainly invented explanations for the documents which contradicted her evidence. She was a deeply unsatisfactory witness who chose to give evidence which she must have known was untrue.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Like Mr Arip, Ms Dikhanbayeva is intelligent. Although initially she came across as less evasive than Mr Arip, it became clear that this was not actually the case as she adopted a default position which typically involved her dealing with questions which she found difficult by asserting that the documents to which the questions related were incorrect or by maintaining that a particular transaction recorded in the document did not come about. For example, Ms Dikhanbayeva was referred to four separate documents which showed Mr Zhekebatyrov (a relative of Mr Zhunus, who owned a number of the companies alleged by the Claimants in these proceedings to have received misappropriated funds) to be the director of Kagazy Gofrotara LLP in 2006. Her response was that he did not become the director until later when the company’s operations had ceased and it was about to be liquidated, and so the documents which she had been shown were incorrect. Ms Dikhanbayeva was also asked about letters dated 15 February 2006, sent from Ms Yelgeldieva,  KK JSC's Chief Accountant, to Alliance Bank, asking it to install “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">an additional service (second signature) per Bank-Client system</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and to “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">reinstall the Bank-Client system to other computers</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” for a number of companies which it is accepted were in the KK Group, as well as other disputed connected entities including HW, TEW, Kontakt Service Plus and Arka-Stroy. Ms Dikhanbayeva’s response was that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">this letter is simply impossible and the bank cannot accept it</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, before going on to explain that the bank would require further authorisation to occur before it could accept such a request and denying, therefore, that this correspondence showed that these entities were treated as being part of the KK Group. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Although there was a certain attraction to the (apparently) straightforward manner in which Ms Dikhanbayeva, on occasion, gave evidence, her repeated assertions that a substantial number of the documents on which the Claimants rely were simply incorrect cannot have represented her genuine belief. As for her evasiveness, an example concerns the evidence which she gave during her examination-in-chief when she corrected part of her sixth witness statement, in which she had said that she had no knowledge of Mr Zhekebatyrov’s relationship with Arka-Stroy. She explained that she now recalled that Mr Zhekebatyrov and Vladimir Khan were the founders and legal owners of Arka-Stroy. Ms Dikhanbayeva accepted that she knew Mr Zhekebatyrov and that he was also employed by KK JSC. She insisted, however, that she had only found out that Mr Zhekebatyrov was an owner of Arka-Stroy in around late 2006 when, in the course of IPO preparations, the auditors had asked some questions about Arka-Stroy because of the large contract it had with the KK Group. She said that she had discussed Mr Zhekebatyrov’s Arka-Stroy connection with the auditors, BDO, at that time, and that representatives of BDO had met representatives of Arka-Stroy and the KK Group to discuss this, but that BDO had eventually been satisfied because Mr Zhekebatyrov owned only 50% of Arka-Stroy and because they received a letter from Ms Dikhanbayeva confirming that KK JSC was not a related party of Arka-Stroy. She claimed that she had forgotten about all of this and that she had only remembered it when recently discussing the case with Mr Arip, saying that she had become “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">emotional</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and remembered these events. Mr Howe put to her that it was not credible that she had had specific discussions with the auditors about this connection, and that the issue of Arka-Stroy’s connections with the KK Group had been a central issue in these proceedings since 2013. She had no satisfactory answer to this point. The fact is that there was no good answer. Ms Dikhanbayeva cannot have forgotten about Mr Zhekebatyrov’s connection with Arka-Stroy. I am clear that she must have deliberately omitted mention of it in her earlier witness statements in order to give the impression that Arka-Stroy was a separate entity to the KK Group.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Another illustration of Ms Dikhanbayeva’s unacceptable approach to the giving of evidence relates to the questions which were put to her by Mr Howe concerning the connections between the KK Group, CBC and Bolzhal. CBC and Bolzhal are alleged by the Claimants to have received misappropriated funds from Arka-Stroy in the context of the PEAK Claim, as well as being the entities from which the KK Group purchased the land plots in the context of the Land Plots Claim. In her witness statements Ms Dikhanbayeva’s evidence was that CBC and Bolzhal were “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">both owned by nominees</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, and that the original nominees were her then husband (Mr Esperov for CBC) and a relative of his (Mr Shabadanov for Bolzhal), who had been put in place “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">to secure the interests of KK JSC in the future sale and purchase transactions with these companies</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. She maintained, however, that, for the purposes of the land plots transactions, CBC and Bolzhal were “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">managed by the real estate brokers who took care of those transactions</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Asked about this in cross-examination, she insisted that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[t]hose companies were used for acquisition of land plots and they were controlled by land brokers … we used those companies, but it doesn’t mean that we controlled their other operations</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[e]ven with my husband as the nominal director of the company, it didn’t mean that I controlled anything there</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. This was, however, evidence which simply made no sense given that Mr Esperov and Mr Shabadanov were merely nominees and given also that Ms Dikhanbayeva also accepted that she controlled Bolzhal and CBC for the purposes of acquiring the Exillon assets from around October 2008. The notion that Ms Dikhanbayeva could control those companies for some purposes but not for the purposes of the land plots transactions is fanciful. Ms Dikhanbayeva tried to get round this difficulty by suggesting that by the time that Bolzhal and CBC started to become involved in the Exillon transaction, in October 2008, those companies had served their purpose in relation to the land plots. The difficulty with this, however, is that, as Mr Howe was able to demonstrate, there are a number of documents which point pretty clearly to the land plots transactions between KK JSC and Bolzhal and CBC still being ongoing during the time when Ms Dikhanbayeva had taken over control of CBC and Bolzhal. For example, as I shall explain later, master agreements for the sale and purchase of the land were concluded on 23 January 2009 and there are, in addition, minutes of a KK JSC board meeting on the same date approving the entry into these contracts. When these documents were put to her by Mr Howe, Ms Dikhanbayeva’s response was that all that was happening, and all that these documents were concerned with, was what she described as “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">registration</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. I cannot accept that this was the position, however. Aside from the fact that this was never mentioned by Ms Dikhanbayeva in any of her witness statements, the documents themselves are plainly dealing with the acquisition of land plots and not merely matters of registration in circumstances where there has already been acquisition. Furthermore, as Ms Dikhanbayeva herself accepted in the course of cross-examination, by January 2009 the price to be paid for the land plots had not been finalised. Even on her own evidence, therefore, it can hardly be said that the land transactions had been finalised by October 2008. My conclusion, in the circumstances, is that Ms Dikhanbayeva was controlling CBC and Bolzhal at a time when the land plot transactions between KK JSC and CBC and Bolzhal had, at the very least, still not been completed. Mr Howe put to her that she had found it necessary to come up with a story about CBC and Bolzhal being controlled by different people for different purposes because the reality was that CBC and Bolzhal were being managed by Ms Dikhanbayeva on the directions of Mr Arip in relation to the land plot transactions in the same way as they were in relation to the acquisition of Exillon assets. She denied that this was the position, but I reject her evidence in this regard. It was unrealistic and implausible. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Dikhanbayeva gave similarly unrealistic and implausible evidence when confronted with a number of documents showing that she was giving instructions for documents to be drawn up relating to financial assistance or debt transfer between various KK Group entities and entities which the Claimants allege are connected to the Defendants. A clear example of this is an email sent by Ms Dikhanbayeva on 5 January 2007 in which she asked Ms Kogutyuk to prepare nine </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“claim assignment agreements dated December 29, 2006”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, including a transfer of a debt of KZT 183,646,033.54 owed by HW to KK JSC which was to be transferred to Arka-Stroy as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“new creditor”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. A signed agreement relating to the transfer of this amount of debt clearly demonstrates that this instruction was carried out. Not unsurprisingly, Mr Howe suggested to Ms Dikhanbayeva that this appeared to be an entirely internal process with no discussions apparently taking place involving the directors of the various (allegedly) non-KK Group entities such as Arka-Stroy and HW. Mr Howe suggested that the reason for this was that all the companies involved were, in effect, shell companies being managed by Ms Dikhanbayeva on the instructions of Mr Arip. Ms Dikhanbayeva denied this, saying that, as the KK Group was expecting an audit, she had looked at the accounts and seen outstanding amounts and asked the directors of the various KK Group entities to provide an explanation, and then the decision was taken to assign the various claims. She said that the KK Group directors would have obtained consent from the directors of the non-KK Group entities, and that this decision was taken before the New Year but because of the holiday period her email had come a little later, once everyone was back in the office. She stated that there was a trading relationship between HW and Arka-Stroy, which was why debts could be assigned between them. I found this explanation wholly unconvincing, however. If the various debt transfers, including the particular one to which I have referred, were genuinely transactions involving entities which were not part of the KK Group, then, it is difficult to see how they could have come about without detailed discussions taking place with the allegedly independent entities. There is nonetheless not a shred of evidence to suggest that any such discussions took place. The clear impression which I derived from Ms Dikhanbayeva’s evidence is that she simply moved monies (or more accurately debts) between various entities without having to engage with anybody else. The fact that she was able to do so is a clear demonstration of the entities amongst which the debts were moved being members of the KK Group.</span>

The email sent on 26 August 2009 timed at 10.23 pm stated as follows:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Manghi is a former director and Chairman of KK Plc (having replaced Mr Zhunus in that role in 2008). Prior to becoming Chairman, he held other senior posts within the KK Group, dating back to 2005. He left KK Plc in January 2010 shortly after the Defendants’ departure from the KK Group in order to continue working with the Defendants on their subsequent project involving Exillon. He was CEO of Exillon from 2009 to 2011. Mr Manghi is a chartered accountant and a former auditor with PwC. He met Mr Arip in the late 1990s/early 2000s, whilst working as a Senior Investment Manager for the Kazakhstan Post Privatisation Fund; Mr Arip was then the General Director of Spectrum LLP which was one of Mr Manghi’s investee companies. He met Ms Dikhanbayeva in 2006 whilst working for the KK Group. He described his relationship with Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva as that of “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">friend and colleague</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Manghi gave evidence relating to Arka-Stroy, the Land Plots Claim and events in 2009 which are relevant to limitation.  Mr Twigger’s submission was that Mr Manghi was a careful witness whose evidence the Court could have confidence in. He submitted, in particular, that Mr Manghi’s account of a meeting which he had with Mr Mackay and Mr Werner in the Rixos Hotel in December 2014 should be preferred to the account given by Mr Werner. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe submitted that Mr Manghi was an unsatisfactory witness, whose impartiality was open to severe doubt. Mr Howe referred, in particular, to Mr Manghi’s professional connections with the Defendants, suggesting that the professional backgrounds were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“inextricably linked”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although I am not altogether convinced by this as a freestanding point since it is often the case that witnesses will be called in commercial litigation such as this who are closely connected to one or other (or both) of the parties, I was nonetheless reminded by Mr Howe that at one point during the course of his evidence Mr Manghi referred to Cleary Gottlieb, Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s solicitors, as “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">our lawyers</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. It seems to me that this did betray the fact that Mr Manghi aligned himself very firmly with Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva and was not in any real sense an independent witness. This impression was underlined by the fact that, in giving his evidence, Mr Manghi adopted an argumentative approach in relation to some of the matters which were explored with him. A particular example concerns Mr Manghi’s refusal to accept that CBC and Bolzhal were related parties of the KK Group given that Mr Esperov and Mr Shabadanov were merely nominees and that CBC and Bolzhal were engaging in very substantial transactions with KK JSC (the main operational holding company of the KK Group) and that, as such, they should have been disclosed in the KK Group 2007 and 2008 Annual Reports. When first asked about this by Mr Howe, Mr Manghi was insistent that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“wasn’t aware of dealings between those companies and KK at the time”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe explained that what Mr Manghi was being asked was whether, had the question of related parties been raised with him, he would have considered that Bolzhal and CBC ought to be regarded as related parties. Mr Manghi’s response was to obfuscate, suggesting that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it is a complicated question, sometimes, determining whether something is a related party or not”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> albeit that he appeared to accept that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“on the face of it, it looks like it”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He then went on, however, to quibble, apparently taking the view that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Maybe they are not related parties if they are acting as nominees”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He maintained that whether a party is a related party is not a straightforward question. Mr Howe expressed some bafflement at Mr Manghi’s stance. I could understand why. In truth, Mr Manghi’s evidence on this point made little sense. It did not reflect well on him and suggested, in my view, an unwillingness to be entirely straightforward with the evidence which he was giving. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">My unease in relation to this aspect of Mr Manghi’s evidence was only heightened by evidence which he gave when shown by Mr Howe an email which he sent to Ms Gulnara Musagalieva, KK JSC’s Deputy Finance Director, on 12 November 2009. The email listed some questions about a spreadsheet which Mr Manghi had been sent. The second of the questions posed was: “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">The payment to Arka-Stroy is a related party transaction, I thought we had stopped using this company years ago and had wound it up</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">.” Mr Howe suggested that Mr Manghi was here acknowledging that Arka-Stroy was, indeed, a related party. Mr Manghi’s response was to dispute this and to assert that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“that statement was actually a mistake”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to say that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“this isn’t the complete email chain, there were some other emails after this, which I haven’t seen in the disclosure”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He suggested that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the subsequent emails might help my explanation”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. There are, however, no such emails in existence. Asked by Mr Howe what was the</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “mistake”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, Mr Manghi then launched into what Mr Howe suggested was a pre-prepared speech. He began by explaining that he sent the email </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“late at night”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that it was one of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“over 50 emails”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which he sent that night, during which he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“received well over 100”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He explained that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was extremely busy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to say that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Basically I saw the name Arka-Stroy on the list and it seemed like a familiar name, but I couldn’t place it at that point in time. And that’s why just assumed: well, this must be one of those former group companies, it is a related party transaction”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It seemed to him at the time, he added, that Arka-Stroy was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“one of the former Kagazy Invest subsidiaries that had been left out of the group after the restructuring”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The subsidiary which he had in mind was, apparently, so he explained, Kazvtorsyrye LLP (‘Kazvtorsyrye’). He was, as he put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“just mixed up”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe challenged him in relation to this explanation, pointing out that in his email he had been very specific in saying that Arka-Stroy was a related party. Mr Manghi maintained, however, that when he sent the email he was very tired and had simply made a mistake. Pressed still further by Mr Howe, he denied that he was making up an excuse, adding that not only was he tired but also that he is mildly dyslexic. This was unconvincing evidence which became even more unconvincing after Mr Howe took Mr Manghi to the spreadsheet which Mr Manghi had been sent and on which he had commented in the email. Mr Howe put to Mr Manghi that it was clear from the spreadsheet what Arka-Stroy was. Also, given that Arka-Stroy was one of the biggest counterparties for the Kagazy Group, it is unlikely that Mr Manghi would have become confused. Mr Manghi struggled to provide a satisfactory answer to this. I am driven, in the circumstances, to conclude that Mr Manghi’s evidence on this issue was made up. Furthermore, I agree with Mr Howe that Mr Manghi was obviously ready with his wholly implausible </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“mistake”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> explanation, and this does not reflect well on his credibility. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Turning, lastly, to Mr Manghi’s account of a meeting which he says that he had with Mr Werner and Mr Mackay of SP Angel in December 2009, evidence which is relevant to the limitation issue, although Mr Twigger submitted that what Mr Manghi had to say about this meeting was obviously right, I was rather less convinced that that is the position. According to Mr Manghi, the meeting took place at the Rixos Hotel and entailed Mr Werner and Mr Mackay telling him that they thought that most of the US$ 70 million paid to Arka-Stroy had not been spent on the Aksenger development but had instead been misappropriated or stolen by the former shareholders, Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip. Mr Manghi also stated that Mr Werner and Mr Mackay suggested that he should cancel the Exillon IPO, which was due to take place at the end of that week. Mr Werner denied that this particular meeting, or any discussion of this kind, took place. I find it difficult to accept Mr Manghi’s account. First, as Mr Howe pointed out, it is striking that Mr Manghi made no mention of the meeting until he came to make his fifth witness statement in September 2016. This is despite the fact that limitation has been in issue in this case since September 2013 and notwithstanding also that, again as highlighted by Mr Howe, the limitation issue was heavily relied upon by Mr Arip when seeking to discharge the freezing order (both at first instance and on appeal), something which was done deploying witness statements provided by Mr Manghi. It is difficult to see why, in the circumstances, Mr Manghi would not have mentioned the meeting, and what he alleges was discussed at the meeting, at an earlier stage if what he had to say at trial was the truth. The fact that the allegation was made in the Defence which was, Mr Howe would say, belatedly served in February 2015, makes it all the more curious that Mr Manghi should not have mentioned it in a witness statement until much later. Mr Manghi’s explanation, when asked by Mr Howe, was that he had failed to mention the matter previously because, at that meeting, he had been made to feel like a fool who was unknowingly playing a part in a massive fraud. He added that he had felt “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">traumatised</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">ashamed</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”; he did not, therefore, like talking about the meeting and had “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">locked away</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” his memories of it. I found these explanations wholly unconvincing, however. First, if what he says happened did actually happen, then, it is inconceivable that Mr Manghi, at the time KK Plc’s Chairman and an experienced businessman, would not have taken steps to investigate the allegations which had been made. Secondly, at a minimum, given his role as Chairman, Mr Manghi would have been duty-bound to have raised the matter with his board and, at the very least, the KK Group’s lawyers. The fact that he did neither of these things, even on his account, causes me to be very sceptical about the veracity of his evidence on the point. He suggested that the reason why he took no such steps is that, soon after the meeting, he decided that Mr Werner must have made up the allegations in order to put pressure on him to waive his notice period (as he put it, to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“tenderise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> him). That explanation does not, however, in my view, ring true. Nor, thirdly, does Mr Manghi’s evidence that he was traumatised and emotional.  I repeat that Mr Manghi was an experienced businessman. I simply cannot accept, in the circumstances, that, if the meeting took place as he now describes it, somebody in his position would have reacted as he would now have it. Fourthly, again as Mr Howe pointed out, Mr Manghi did, as a matter of fact, mention a meeting with Mr Werner at about the time of the meeting which he claims to have had with Mr Werner and Mr Mackay. This was in an email which he sent to Ms Kogutyuk on 21 December 2009. The email, however, said nothing at all about a meeting attended also by Mr Mackay and contained a description of what was discussed which bears no relationship with the account which Mr Manghi gives in relation to the meeting alleged to have taken place at the Rixos Hotel. </span>

He highlighted, in particular, that Regul is a successful company in its own right and that its association with GS was significant given that GS is a large construction company. He drew attention also to Mr Gerasimov’s evidence as to how Regul and GS became involved in the KK Group’s construction projects and how he thereafter became a shareholder of KK Plc for a short period of time.

	      <span style="color:#000000">I did not find Mr Gerasimov to be a very satisfactory witness. He was grudging and far from forthcoming. The reason, I am clear, is that he is a good friend of Mr Arip and has been for quite a long time. His wife was also employed by companies within the KK Group, specifically Kagazy Invest and Trading Company. She was also employed by Lotos which, significantly, when Mr Howe showed him an employment contract involving his wife, Mr Gerasimov did not dispute was a company also within the KK Group. Indeed, Mr Howe expressly clarified that Lotos was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“one of the companies you thought she was working for when she was working for the Kagazy Group”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to which Mr Gerasimov’s simple response was </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In this regard Mr Howe highlighted, in particular, how in his witness statement he had described GS winning a tender to carry out construction work for Astana-Contract in relation to a transport and logistics centre, with Regul as GS’s sub-contractor in relation to the supply of equipment, with the contracts being entered into in December 2008 and January 2009, and with Regul receiving in the first part of 2009 a large sum of money from GS which it had itself received from Astana-Contract as a prepayment for construction work. Mr Gerasimov went on to state that, as Astana-Contract was waiting for the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (‘DBK’) to approve the construction specifications before the project could commence, this sum was sitting idly in Regul’s bank account and that, since there was an atmosphere of panic in the markets at this time due to the financial crisis, he was concerned that, if anything happened to this money, Regul would be accountable to Astana-Contract. Accordingly, he went on to explain, having discussed these concerns with Astana-Contract, Astana-Contract proposed that Regul should transfer the money to Astana-Contract’s parent company, KK JSC, as temporary financial assistance, to be repaid in two or three months, and that they should execute a contract for temporary returnable financial assistance. When Mr Howe asked him about this matter in cross-examination, he was shown a table which set out the relevant money flows between Astana-Contract, GS, Regul and KK JSC in the period from December 2008 to 20 October 2009. It was put to him that, whereas in his witness statement he had referred to one pre-payment having been made by GS to Regul, the table demonstrated that there were at least five payments spread out over a period of time starting in January 2009 and continuing through to March 2009. He clarified that he had meant to refer to what he described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a combination of payments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In his witness statement, however, he had referred to</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “a pre-payment”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, so suggesting that there was, indeed, a single payment. He refused to accept that there was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“any contradiction”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> between what he stated in his witness statement and the reality which is that there was more than one pre-payment. As far as he was concerned, it was simply a matter of how his witness statement had been drafted. This, however, was a somewhat glib response. It was, in any event, not a response which he was able to deploy in relation to the second point which Mr Howe put to him arising out of the table. This was that on two occasions, far from any monies sitting idly in Regul’s bank account, the funds passed from Astana-Contract to GS to Regul to KK JSC immediately. The first occasion which was put to Mr Gerasimov by Mr Howe involved KZT 480 million or so being paid by Astana-Contract to GS on 20 January 2009 before being passed on by GS to Regul on 6 February 2009 and then paid to KK JSC that same day. Mr Twigger made the point in closing that actually this was not the first payment which GS had made to Regul, however, since the first was made on 5 January 2009 and was in the sum of KZT 411 million, and the first payment by Regul to KK JSC was not made until 6 February 2009. Although Mr Twigger is right about this, it is nonetheless not an answer to the second instance which was put to Mr Gerasimov. That entailed a larger sum, KZT 840 million, being paid by Astana-Contract to GS on 4 March 2009 and then being transferred to Regul by GS six days later, on 10 March 2009, when (again the same day) the money was sent to KK JSC. Mr Gerasimov’s explanation was to insist that this happened to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“mitigate risks, possible risks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Howe pointed out, however, his position made no sense since it is impossible to see how there could be any concern relating to monies which had spent virtually no time sitting in Regul’s bank account given that they had only just been received from GS. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Gerasimov’s difficulties in cross-examination did not stop there, however, because the table also indicated that Regul retained more than KZT 400 million of what it had received from GS for a number of months starting on 10 March 2009 and ending in September 2009 without making a transfer to KK JSC. Mr Gerasimov suggested that this was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to ensure works to be performed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, adding that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“this is the money that was not exposed to high risks, according to our opinion, and we had to pay for the works performed so we kept the money”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe, not unsurprisingly, made the point that this had not been mentioned in his witness statement, to which Mr Gerasimov’s response was that in his witness statement he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“didn’t focus on such tiny details”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I agree with Mr Howe that retention of such a large sum of money hardly amounts to merely a tiny detail. That Mr Gerasimov’s evidence on this matter is not evidence which I can accept was further confirmed by his inability to explain why, although he had stated in his witness statement that the monies were repaid by KK JSC to Regul which then paid them to GS which then, in turn, repaid them to Astana-Contract following cancellation of the contracts in September or possibly October 2009 (and anyway, as Mr Gerasimov put it when asked by Mr Howe, in the autumn), the table demonstrated that repayments started to be made as early as March 2009 with other repayments coming in May 2009 and in August 2009. Mr Gerasimov stated that he did not know why these repayments were made, suggesting that he would need to look at the underlying documents. This was unimpressive evidence. It is quite clear to me that the evidence contained in Mr Gerasimov’s witness statement concerning these arrangements cannot have been true.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The unreliability of Mr Gerasimov’s evidence was further underlined by certain evidence which he went on to give concerning Ada-Trade, a company which made two interest-free loans to the Exillon Group, totalling in excess of US$ 5.7 million in 2009. These were loans which were recorded in the Exillon IPO prospectus as involving amounts</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “owed to Ada Trade”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“expected to be re-assigned to Maksat Arip and repaid before the end of 2009”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, making it difficult to see how Ada Trade really could have been anything other than Mr Arip’s own company. Nonetheless and although it was Mr Arip’s evidence coming into trial (albeit that this was not apparently something which he was initially able to recall) that Ada-Trade was, as he put it, “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Mr Gerasimov’s company</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, Mr Gerasimov insisted (at least initially when first asked by Mr Howe in cross-examination) that the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“director and owner”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of Ada-Trade was a Mr Kuat Kozhamberdiev, at the time somebody in only his late teens who worked as a junior lawyer within the KK Group. Asked directly by Mr Howe whether Ada-Trade was his company, Mr Gerasimov’s response was: </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“I was a partner of Kuat Kozhamberdiev, but unfortunately we didn’t formalise my involvement, my participation. So in fact I was his partner, but legally, de jure, I wasn’t a owner of the company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He then agreed with Mr Howe that he was, in fact, an owner of Ada-Trade. There then followed a series of exchanges in which Mr Howe sought to explore with Mr Gerasimov how it was that Ada-Trade, a company owned by somebody as young as Mr Kozhamberdiev, was able to afford to make so substantial a loan to Mr Arip. Mr Gerasimov’s evidence was that, according to Mr Kozhamberdiev, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the company did have that money”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe then asked how he came to meet Mr Kozhamberdiev. Mr Gerasimov explained that it was in late 2008 that he met him at the KK Group’s offices and that, although he did not know that he was employed as a lawyer, he did know that he was employed by the KK Group. He apparently regarded him as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“quite an interesting, promising partner”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> because he</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “already had an operational business that was dealing in supply of materials to various customers including Kazakhstan Kagazy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Again, this was unimpressive evidence given, in my view, by somebody who was being very far from straightforward with the Court. </span>

I am quite clear, on the contrary, that Mr Gerasimov was a witness whose loyalty to Mr Arip (and Ms Dikhanbaeva) meant that he was prepared to give evidence which was, quite simply, dishonest. The fact that, as Mr Twigger pointed out, when Mr Arip left the KK Group, he introduced Mr Gerasimov to Mr Werner as someone who was experienced in running the operational side of the business and Mr Werner then worked with Mr Gerasimov until Mr Gerasimov shortly afterwards chose to leave does not, in my view, justify the conclusion urged upon me by Mr Twigger, namely that Mr Gerasimov is to be viewed as having loyalties both to Mr Arip and to Mr Werner. Mr Gerasimov’s longstanding relationship with Mr Arip considerably outweighs his relatively short-lived working relationship with Mr Werner.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Sannikov’s evidence was that the first time that he had heard of Arka-Stroy was when he met Mr Zholshybek Sartbayev in around Spring 2006 and Mr Sartbayev introduced himself as the owner of that company. Mr Saoul put to Mr Sannikov in cross-examination that, given that he was the Finance Director of PEAK at this time (he had started in this role in February 2006) and given that PEAK and Arka-Stroy had entered into a construction contract relating to the Akzhal site for a price as high as KZT 3,364,266,404 (approximately US$ 26.05 million) on 2 November 2005, this is evidence which simply could not be true. Mr Sannikov’s somewhat blithe response was to claim that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“wasn’t related to construction”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The difficulty with this, as was pointed out to him, is that he quite obviously was involved in construction-related matters. In her witness statement, Ms Dikhanbayeva described him as having responsibility for dealing with the financial aspects of construction projects and in his witness statement he had referred to monthly meetings of the budget committee of the KK Group having involved Arka-Stroy representatives attending to report on construction progress. Mr Saoul put to him that he was trying to give the impression that he had not previously heard of Arka-Stroy in order to support Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case that it was an unrelated company. His answer was that he did </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not support any of the parties”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and had merely provided </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“an unbiased witness statement”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">.  It was then put to him that he must have known about Arka-Stroy given his role as Finance Director of PEAK from February 2006 onwards in view of what Mr Saoul described as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“absolutely enormous financial flows passing from PEAK to Arka-Stroy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Sannikov’s thoroughly unsatisfactory response was to say that he </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Sannikov’s evasiveness continued during the course of his cross-examination. For example, he was asked about his evidence in his witness statement that he began to do some work for Arka-Stroy in his free time and became Arka-Stroy’s Finance Director in Spring/Summer 2006 in order that Arka-Stroy could pay him for what he was doing. Mr Saoul pointed out that his employment contract with Arka-Stroy (which was, it should be noted in passing, located on the KK Group’s systems) stated that he would work normal working hours (eight-hour days with a break of one hour based on a five-day working week). Mr Sannikov nonetheless still insisted that he only carried out work for Arka-Stroy in his evenings and weekends given his commitments at PEAK, somewhat unconvincingly suggesting that the contract was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a standard template of an employment contract necessary for the accounting office to accrue salary”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and adding that he</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “was free to choose my own working schedule because I was delivering to all my commitments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He was then pressed as to why it is the case that there is no documentation involving Mr Sartbayev, the person at Arka-Stroy with whom Mr Sannikov insisted he had all his dealings. Mr Saoul put to Mr Sannikov that the reason he was unable to produce, for example, a single email with Mr Sartbayev, and why no other witness had in their witness statement referred to Mr Sartbayev, was because Mr Sartbayev was not the owner of Arka-Stroy as Mr Sannikov claimed. Mr Saoul drew attention, in particular, to the fact that the employment contract described Arka-Stroy as being represented by Mr Makovac rather than by Mr Sartbayev. Mr Sannikov’s response was to say that Mr Makovac </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was a director and he was working on a project, whereas Mr Sartbayev was most likely the owner and overall manager of the firm”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was evidence which, in my view, was most contrived. It is clear that Mr Sannikov was trying to give the impression that Arka-Stroy was separate and apart from the KK Group by referring to Mr Sartbayev as Arka-Stroy’s owner when he knew full well that this was simply not the case. </span>

This is why he went out of his way to explain that he never communicated with Mr Sartbayev by email. He thought that if he made this point, then, it would explain the absence of any email correspondence. As Mr Saoul pointed out, however, during the course of cross-examination, it is unrealistic to suppose that there would not be at least some email correspondence. It is equally unrealistic to suppose that, if Mr Sartbayev really did play the role which Mr Sannikov maintained, there would not be some reference to him in at least some type of document, yet there is no reference anywhere to Mr Sartbayev. Mr Sannikov sought to suggest that the reason why there is no reference to Mr Sartbayev in the employment contract or in any other document was that Mr Sartbayev was a government official and that there is (or at least was at the time) a practice within Kazakhstan of companies owned by government officials being recorded as the property of other persons. Whether or not there is (or was) such a practice, it is still highly surprising that there should be no reference at all to Mr Sartbayev in any documentation. Mr Sannikov, in my view, simply made up his evidence concerning Mr Sartbayev’s alleged role. He did so, I am quite clear, in order to assist the Defendants’ case. This does him no credit whatsoever.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">When shown this email, Mr Sannikov was keen to explain that the reference to</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “solving the issue on debts”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was a VAT-related matter and had nothing to do with what Mr Saoul suggested to Mr Sannikov was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“manipulating debts between these three companies, all of which you were responsible for”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Sannikov disputed this, explaining that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“I couldn’t channel funds around because I didn’t have the right of signature”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was not authorised to make bank money transfers”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In my view, however, that was not really an answer to the point which was being made to Mr Sannikov by Mr Saoul. In his email Mr Sannikov was quite clearly describing work which he was doing not only on behalf of PEAK and Trading House (both members of the KK Group) but on behalf also of Arka-Stroy. This was work which he was describing to another employee of the KK Group. He quite clearly was treating all of the work described as being for companies within the KK Group. If there were any doubt about this and the role which Mr Sannikov was at this time playing, it is removed altogether by how Mr Sannikov chose to sign off the email. He did so describing himself as “…</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">A Sannikov, financial director of PEAK LLP and Arka-Stroy LLP</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Saoul put to him that this represents conclusive evidence that he was performing a joint role, yet Mr Sannikov would not accept that this was the case. His explanation was this:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Again, at PEAK I was a logistics officer. I was responsible for logistics only. At Arka-Stroy I was mostly an adviser to structure accounting processes and report on information flows. My signature here, financial director of PEAK and Arka-Stroy, means that probably this email was addressed to that lady, whoever she is, I don’t remember now. So hence I showed - I meant to show that I was very busy and overloaded with her repeated requests for information. I was never hiding that I was employed by Arka-Stroy.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">This was not an answer to the point which was being put to him. It is perfectly obvious that Mr Sannikov was, as Mr Saoul suggested, carrying out work for PEAK and Arka-Stroy simultaneously in what was a joint role performed for companies which were each within the KK Group. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">That this was the position, despite Mr Sannikov’s insistence before me that the opposite was the case, is furthermore borne out, in my view, by the evidence in his witness statement that he did not consider that there was a conflict of interest in his working for both Arka-Stroy and PEAK at the same time. Mr Saoul put to Mr Sannikov in cross-examination that the reason why he did not think that there was any conflict was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“because they were part of the same company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He denied this, repeating that he</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “worked at PEAK involved in the division and project related to logistics, exclusively”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“wasn’t involved in construction matters at PEAK”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to say that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“At Arka-Stroy I was an adviser on budgeting and structuring accounting processes for construction projects, so I didn’t know there was any conflict of interest possible”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Saoul pointed out to him, however, that in his witness statement he had referred to budget committee meetings of the KK Group at which there had been presentations on financial aspects of the construction project with Arka-Stroy.  Mr Saoul queried whether Mr Sannikov’s position was that he attended such meetings as a representative of Arka-Stroy. Mr Sannikov’s answer was that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“attended those meetings mainly as a PEAK employee”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, adding that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Because mainly those meetings involved our whole team, where we reported on budgets and Arka-Stroy was engaged on an ad hoc basis from time to time. Not always. Only if any matters were discussed, I was able to address them provided I was asked to”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This answer appeared, therefore, to confirm that Mr Sannikov </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">did</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> work on financial matters for PEAK which were construction-related. However, when Mr Saoul sought confirmation to that effect, Mr Sannikov’s wholly unpersuasive response was to deny this. Mr Sannikov’s denial became all the more implausible when he was taken by Mr Saoul to the minutes of one of the budget committee meetings held on 11 September 2006, specifically the reference in those minutes (which were approved by Mr Sannikov amongst others) to Arka-Stroy being a “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">subsidiary</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” of Kagazy Invest (the holding company of the KK Group at that time). </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Sharipov’s evidence should be accepted. This is, however, a submission with which I struggle, not least given the attitude which Mr Sharipov was wont to adopt when confronted with documents by Mr Saoul which, at least on their face, were at odds with the evidence he was giving. This is exemplified by his response to being asked about an email which he sent to a number of people in May 2006 relating to the conduct of an audit of subsidiaries of Kagazy Invest. The attachment to that email was a formal order on Kagazy Invest notepaper dated 28 April 2006 which listed a number of companies to which the audit was planned to relate. Those companies included Arka-Stroy. When asked why this should have been the case, Mr Sharipov’s response was to say that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“didn’t originate that letter, I simply forwarded that, as you can see”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Regardless of whether that is right or wrong, what is important is that Mr Sharipov did not take issue with Arka-Stroy’s characterisation as a subsidiary (or subordinate) of Kagazy Invest. More than this, as Mr Saoul pointed out, one of the people to whom Mr Sharipov sent his email forwarding the order was Mr Makovac at Arka-Stroy. Mr Sharipov could not explain why otherwise he would have sent his email to Mr Makovac. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“initiated this procedure of inviting representatives”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to such meetings. He explained, in particular, as follows:</span>

So if Arka-Stroy delayed with construction we would incur other extra costs and I would fail to deliver on my commitments to my management. That is why, when I could not explain the causes behind some delays or the reasons for increases in construction costs, I would invite representatives of Arka-Stroy so that they could deliver a first-hand explanation. As far as I remember a representative of Arka-Stroy would always come at the very end of these meetings, that was weekly, and he would explain what was going on on the construction site, explaining the causes behind delays and other related causes to effect the timeline of construction as well as the quality of it.”   </span>

The first was that the email address was not his. He then went on to make various other points, including to suggest that at the time that the email was sent he had ceased to work at PEAK, only to accept when challenged on this by Mr Saoul that he did not, in fact, leave until later. Pressed on the reference in the email to </span>

Mr Saoul then directed Mr Sharipov to another email from the same email address which was sent to Mr Sannikov and Mr Nikolay Guber, a KK employee, in December 2007, in response to an email from Mr Guber to Mr Sharipov and a number of other KK employees regarding a budget committee meeting.

First, however, it is worth mentioning that it emerged during Mr Zhangurov’s evidence that, although it is pretty clear that it was Mr Zhangurov who worked for Arka-Stroy, the person who was Arka-Stroy’s official employee was not him but his wife, Tatyana Zhangurova, who actually worked in the IT team at PEAK. He went on to explain that, whilst his wife </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was receiving her salary, because she was officially formally recorded as an employee”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was the person who performed the actual work”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Apparently, she never attended at Arka-Stroy to do any work at all. Instead, she attended </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Only when she was actually employed and then dismissed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, the latter requiring attendance in order </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to undergo a number of formal procedures”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. His evidence was that he requested this arrangement with Arka-Stroy because he already had two other jobs and needed to avoid “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">possible questions</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, explaining that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">companies that could be considered partners or competitors dealing in one and the same trade, such companies typically don’t want to share a person</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Turning to Mr Zhangurov’s approach to documents, an example was when Mr Zhangurov was shown an on-screen copy of an email from Mr Sharipov (from his PEAK email address) early on in his cross-examination. Mr Miller asked Mr Zhangurov to note how Mr Sharipov had described himself, only for Mr Zhangurov immediately to say that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">to figure out that this is a real, genuine email from Nurlan Sharipov, I have got to look into the technical metadata of the email, what server was used, when it was sent out, when it was received. Now I can just see a paper. I can type a dozen of papers like this without any sophisticated technical means, just in Microsoft Word … So I doubt that this document is genuine</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Zhangurov’s immediate suggestion that this email may have been fabricated was surprising to say the least. It suggested a disinclination to be open in the evidence which he was giving. Mr Miller responded by suggesting that Mr Zhangurov had only queried the authenticity of the email because Mr Sharipov’s email signature gave his address at PEAK as 30 Prigorodnaya Street (the offices where Arka-Stroy was also based). Mr Zhangurov denied this, but I had the impression that Mr Miller was right to make the suggestion that he did. That impression was strengthened when Mr Miller put to Mr Zhangurov another email which was sent the same day as the</span>

He suggested that, in the circumstances, the Claimants’ suggestion that his evidence represented pure invention should be rejected.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">destroyed in the course of time</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. The difficulty with this is that there is not a single document to support the evidence which was given by Mr Jumadilov. This is not, therefore, a case where the documentary picture is fragmented but there are at least some documents supportive of what is said to have happened. On the contrary, there are no documents at all. This is surprising, to say the least, since it might be expected that there would be some reference somewhere (however fleeting) to the transactions having taken place. I can also hardly lose sight of the explanations which Mr Jumadilov gave as to why, for example, there is no tax documentation demonstrating that he was operating in the land broking business at the relevant time. His first explanation was that he was “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">” because he had previously worked in the Ministry of Finance Tax Directorate, only then to explain that he had not submitted any tax returns for his own earnings relating to his land broking business because “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I am quite clear that Mr Jumadilov was not a reliable witness. An illustration of a somewhat curious approach to business ethics, as Mr Howe pointed out, was that, contrary to what was contained in his witness statements, Mr Jumadilov explained when he came to give oral evidence that his commission was not set as a percentage in advance but instead that he agreed with KK JSC a price which it would pay for the land and that he would then seek to negotiate a lower acquisition price with the farmers, with the difference being his commission. He confirmed to Mr Howe that this was not the subject of any written agreement with KK JSC, albeit that he appeared to suggest that there were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“verbal agreements”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Earlier, however, he had acknowledged that there was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“nothing definitive”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> agreed as to the rate of commission which he would receive and that it was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“an approximate agreement” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Approximately 5%”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Howe submitted, this seems to be a very uncommercial way for KK JSC to have done business. The fact that what Mr Jumadilov had to say contradicted his written evidence suggests, I also agree with Mr Howe, that his evidence on the point was manufactured. He also somewhat breezily agreed with Mr Howe that not only did the land plot transactions involve the making of fake agreements (as he acknowledged in his witness statements) but also fake VAT claims in respect of services which were not provided. He agreed that this was dishonest but explained that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “there was no other option”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since the</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is a common practice all over the world”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Asked specifically about his conduct, he agreed that</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, before adding </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">A similar attitude was displayed by Mr Jumadilov when confronted with evidence of his own dishonesty in relation to the alleged purchase of an office building from Holding Invest using the KK Group’s funds. He stated in his first witness statement that he and some business associates purchased an office block from Holding Invest (a company owned by Mr Arip and Mr Zhunus), in an attempt to explain a payment of approximately KZT 605 million/US$ 5 million from Bolzhal to Holding Invest. Mr Jumadilov stated in cross-examination that he had decided to use money which the KK Group had provided to Bolzhal for the purposes of the land plots purchases to finance this transaction for his own benefit, saying that this money was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“idle”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that his friends were wealthy businessmen who agreed to pay him back. Mr Jumadilov stated that the decision to purchase the office building entailed a completely different venture to transactions with the KK Group and that he did not know that Holding Invest was owned by Mr Arip and Mr Zhunus. This was wholly implausible. What matters for present purposes, nonetheless, is that he accepted in cross-examination that to use KK JSC’s money in this way was an improper use of funds.

Mr Mamedov’s evidence in his witness statement was that he and his family owned a plot of agricultural land located in Almaty, with a total area of 33.12 hectares. In 2007, he explained, he was approached by a woman called Saule (the land broker dealing with him) who suggested that he should sell the plot. Saule helped him register the land into his own name, he signed the sale and purchase agreement and Saule paid him the price of US$ 1,800 per sotka (one hundred square metres of land). This is equivalent to a total price of US$ 5.9 million for the 33.12 hectare plot. To put this sum into context, the Claimants made the point in their opening submissions that the average monthly wage in Kazakhstan at the time (2007-2009) was approximately KZT 60,000, equivalent to approximately US$ 460. His written evidence was that the purchase documents stated a lower price than that had been agreed in order that he would incur less tax. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">During cross-examination, Mr Mamedov’s evidence underwent a certain amount of revision. He explained, in particular, that the land had belonged to him jointly with nine other relatives. He also said that the price he had given of US$ 1,800 per sotka was an estimated amount because he had been paid in installments, in dollars, and could not remember the precise amount paid, or how many installments there had been. His evidence was surprisingly vague in this regard. He stated that he wanted to be paid in cash so he could have “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">real money</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” to share with his relatives. Mr Mamedov stated that his share of the land plot was 5.6 hectares, which means that, if he was paid US$ 1,800 per sotka, his share would have been over US$ 1 million. He stated that he spent his share of the money on a car, some refurbishment in his home, a house for his daughter and that he shared it with relatives. He stated that the money was spent within a couple of months. He still lives in the house in the village where he has lived all his life. Somewhat implausibly, given the amount of money involved, Mr Mamedov also said that, if he had been the only owner of the land plot, he would not have sold it but continued to farm it (apparently, his relatives convinced him to sell). </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It was in relation to the tax position, however, that Mr Mamedov’s oral evidence was most markedly different from his written evidence. Although in his witness statement he had explained that the purchase documents stated a lower price than what had actually been agreed in order that he would incur less taxes, his evidence during cross-examination was that he did not pay any taxes in relation to the land sale. He explained that Saule had told him that she would pay all the taxes, adding that he thought that maybe he had been paid the purchase price after the deduction of the 10% tax. It was not clear from his evidence whether he and his relatives or Saule and those she represented would get the benefit of the reduction in tax payable. Mr Miller put to Mr Mamedov that the reason why his oral evidence was different to his written evidence was because the statement was prepared on Mr Mamedov’s behalf with very limited input from him. That plainly was the case, as demonstrated by the fact that Mr Mamedov could only estimate the amounts which he was paid and could not explain with any clarity the position as to tax. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Rasul Khasanov worked in the IT department of the KK Group between October 2009 and October 2013. He worked as the head of programming and his role included administering 1C accounting databases. His evidence related primarily to the discovery of the (alleged) PEAK Fraud and the presence of the Arka-Stroy 1C database on the KK Group’s servers. He was involved in administering the 1C database of Caspian Minerals (the predecessor entity to Exillon, the oil business venture owned and run by the Defendants) when he worked for that company before joining the KK Group. It was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Khasanov was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“an impressive witness who knew a great deal about the IT matters about which he was questioned”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I do not doubt, for one moment, his IT expertise. Indeed, as I have previously indicated when dealing with Mr Kuzmenko’s account of the difficulty encountered in locating the Arka-Stroy 1C database, it is clear that Mr Khasanov’s expertise as a computer programmer meant that he was able to locate the Arka-Stroy 1C database much more quickly than Mr Kuzmenko would have been able to do it. It does not follow, however, that he is a witness whose reliability is beyond question since, as Mr Howe pointed out, despite his denials, it is clear that he has close links to the Defendants.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Khasanov disputed Mr Werner’s account of a meeting which they had on 18 March 2013. Mr Khasanov’s evidence is that he located the Arka-Stroy databases before this meeting, when asked to do so by his colleague, Mr Kuzmenko. He claimed that it was straightforward to find the Arka-Stroy 1C database because it was not concealed, and could be accessed by anyone in the IT and finance departments. He stated that, on 18 March 2013, Mr Kuzmenko told him that the executives of the KK Group were looking to replace him because of his association with the former shareholders (he provided IT support to a company of Nazim Dikhanbayeva, Ms Dikhanbayeva’s sister) and that Mr Werner wanted to meet with him. A meeting with Mr Werner took place that same evening, with Mr Kuzmenko and Ms Gorobtsova (acting as translator) also present. Mr Khasanov’s evidence is that Mr Werner told him that he had 24 hours to decide if he wanted to remain with the company and be part of his ‘team’, and Mr Khasanov confirmed immediately that he did. Mr Khasanov’s evidence was that, the following day, he received a 1.5-fold increase in his pay, although he denied that he had asked for this. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">A supplemental witness statement from Mr Khasanov appeared halfway through the trial, and after the Claimants’ witnesses had given evidence. This exhibited three screenshots taken from his KK computer in September 2013, purportedly showing the location of the Arka-Stroy 1C database which he provided to Ms Dikhanbayeva in September 2013 shortly after these proceedings were commenced. The Claimants’ position was that the fact that Mr Khasanov produced this further witness statement demonstrates his close ties to the Defendants. In this supplemental witness statement, Mr Khasanov stated that, after he provided his first witness statement for the Defendants in these proceedings, he was concerned about what Mr Werner’s response to this would be when he found out and so sent a letter resigning from his role at the KK Group on 10 October 2013. His evidence was that, on that day, he was sick from nervous stress and exhaustion, and that he was therefore off work. He went on to explain that, on the evening of 11 October 2013, two KK employees, Mr Kuzmenko and Alexander Solokov, the head of security at Kagazy Recycling, came to the apartment where he lives with his parents, and demanded that his father open the door. He stated that he had taken a sedative and so was unable to come out, but that he woke up and overheard the end of this conversation. His parents subsequently told him that the KK employees had demanded that he return a hard drive (which he disputes taking), and that they hurled threats and abuse at his father. Mr Kuzmenko disputed this account in his second witness statement, saying that he did visit Mr Khasanov’s apartment with Mr Solokov that evening, and that he spoke to Mr Khasanov’s father and mentioned the hard drive to him, but that he behaved respectfully at all times, and made no threats or abuse. Mr Khasanov filed a police report relating to this incident the following day on 12 October 2013. However, this report contradicted the evidence given in his witness statement in these proceedings in a number of ways. For example, the police report stated that the KK Group employees had forced their way into his parents’ home and threatened him with physical violence. When asked in cross-examination why his witness statement did not refer to this forced entry, he admitted that they had not actually “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">penetrated or trespassed</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” in his apartment and that what he had meant by this was that they were very rude and insistent. In addition, Mr Khasanov’s witness statement stated that he did not actually see or speak to the KK Group employees, and yet the police report stated that they threatened him with violence. When asked about this discrepancy, Mr Khasanov stated that the KK Group employees had said to his father that there would be “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">consequences</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” if he did not return the database, which he interpreted as a threat of violence. Mr Howe put to Mr Khasanov that the police report showed that he was willing to tell lies and do so in official documents. Mr Khasanov denied this, however, explaining that he was in a panicked mental state at this time and had had to take steps to protect himself and his family. I have some sympathy with this as an explanation, but the fact remains that Mr Khasanov did exaggerate his account of events when making the report to the police and his willingness to do that is bound to call into question his reliability generally. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. I am not so sure about this since I bear in mind Mr Howe’s point that Mr Belochkin has clearly worked closely with the Defendants for number of years, both at the KK Group and subsequently at Caspian Minerals/Exillon. I bear in mind also the curiosity that Mr Belochkin, as Mr Howe put it, re-appeared in Kazakhstan from Dubai in August 2013, just a few days after these proceedings had been commenced. This was ostensibly, so Mr Belochkin explained, in order to make arrangements for his forthcoming wedding. However, it is common ground that during this time he contacted Mr Khasanov, on a Saturday, to ask for the passwords to the IT system of Nazim Dikhanbayeva’s company. His evidence was that he asked for the passwords for Nazim Dikhanbayeva’s company systems because there had been an IT failure and she had asked for his help in relation to that. I am doubtful about this explanation, however.</span>

Mr Thompson, in particular, provided a detailed analysis of the relevant money flows in certain appendices which, as Mr Twigger reminded me, were relied upon extensively by both sides at trial.

Mr Grummitt explained that he qualified as a chartered accountant in 1985 and that in 1995 he joined a predecessor firm to Mazars, initially as an audit manager, before becoming involved in forensic investigations work as well as audit work, indeed for some years splitting his practice between the two.

	      <span style="color:#000000">I did not find the evidence which was given on the audit issues by either Mr Crooks or by Mr Grummitt to have been entirely satisfactory. Whereas the forensic accountancy issues required analysis of accounting databases and documentation, and so largely factual matters, the audit issues required the experts to provide their opinions on the information in the PwC Russia report and how auditors might have responded to that report. The audit issues were, therefore, by their nature, more likely to be influenced by each expert’s own personal views. It may be for this reason that Mr Crooks came across as less independent and impartial when giving evidence on the audit issues than he did in relation to the forensic accountancy issues. Although Mr Howe suggested that Mr Crooks sought at all times to assist the Court and was ready to make appropriate concessions, he sometimes failed to answer questions which were put to him by Mr Twigger. Nor did I find it helpful that, as Mr Twigger highlighted, Mr Crooks sought to distinguish between information which might be described as (merely) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“useful”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and information which was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“needed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, his view being that the PwC Russia report fell into the former category. I agree with Mr Twigger that Mr Crooks appeared on occasion to have some difficulty in getting out of his mind the possibility (perhaps, in his view, rather more than that) that BDO (although they had not actually been shown the PwC Russia report) had been made aware of the contents of the PwC Russia report, despite Mr Twigger repeatedly asking him to assume for the purposes of the questions which he was being asked that BDO had neither seen the PwC Russia report nor been made aware of its contents. The following exchange demonstrates this point:</span>

Your conclusion, as I understand it, is that although the PwC report would no doubt have been useful, BDO did not actually need it, essentially because it covered risks about which BDO was already aware and all the PwC report would have done was corroborate BDO’s earlier assessment of those risks; is that a fair summary of your conclusion?</span>

They could have been made aware of the contents of the report through management informing them.

He did so in the following exchanges which are worth setting out because they show Mr Crooks’ difficulty in proceeding on the basis of the assumption which Mr Twigger had from the outset invited him to consider:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “hard to see how”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> certain representations made by Mr Werner had been made in good faith. When I put to him that it was no part of his expert role to state such an opinion, he accepted this and apologised for having</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “overstated my position”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I tend to agree with Mr Howe, however, that Mr Grummitt’s willingness to express the opinion which he did suggested a certain lack of objectivity. Importantly, Mr Howe highlighted also how, in a report prepared in October 2013 in support of the Defendants’ application to have the freezing injunction obtained by the Claimants overturned, Mr Grummitt had stated that, in his opinion, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the areas of KK Plc’s activities covered by the PwC report should have been addressed as part of BDO’s routine audit procedures… not only because they are material to KK Plc’s FY2009 financial statements, they are financial transactions which in my experience fall to be audited in the ordinary course”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and so that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the issues identified by PwC should, if genuine, also have become apparent to BDO”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, yet this was not something which he included in his reports prepared for trial. I agree with Mr Howe that this omission is odd, and the more so since, when asked about it in cross-examination, Mr Grummitt confirmed that what he had previously stated was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“still my view”</span>

The Claimants’ expert, Mr Sergei Vataev, has practised law in Kazakhstan since 1992, and is currently a partner with Dechert LLP in Kazakhstan, where he heads the dispute resolution practice.  He speaks both Russian and English and gave his evidence in English. Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s expert, Professor Maidan Suleimenov, is an academic and Director of the Private Law Research Institute, which he founded in 1995 and which is now incorporated in the Caspian Social University. The Institute conducts scientific research in the area of civil and international private law and is also involved in the drafting of legislation governing economic relations. Since Kazakhstan became independent in 1990, he has been involved in the development of Kazakh laws and the drafting of legislation and he was involved in drafting the Civil Code of Kazakhstan, including specific provisions of that Code which were in issue in these proceedings.

	      <span style="color:#000000">It was Mr Howe’s submission that both experts gave their honest professional opinions. Mr Twigger submitted, however, that Mr Vataev was not a satisfactory witness, suggesting that he was prone to arguing the Claimants’ case and taking untenable positions which he apparently thought would advance their cause. I agree with Mr Twigger about this. I did not find Mr Vataev to be an entirely satisfactory expert witness. I agree, in particular, that Mr Vataev gave the impression of wishing to find and make arguments which supported the Claimants’ case rather than simply giving his own impartial view on the issues. He came across to me as a lawyer who was intent on projecting a case (the Claimants’ case) rather than as an independent expert with an overriding duty to assist the Court. Putting the point slightly differently, he gave the appearance of being the practising lawyer that (in contrast to Professor Suleimenov) he is. He appeared, at times, reluctant to give answers which he recognised were unhelpful to the Claimants, and some of the points made by him in support of his overall opinion had every appearance of being simply arguments rather than any considered opinion held by him. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">An example of this concerns the evidence which he gave regarding Article 185 and whether it applies not only to individuals but also to companies. Professor Suleimenov’s evidence was that Article 185 is limited to individuals and does not extend to companies, whereas Mr Vataev’s position was that it is a provision which applies to both. Mr Vataev explained specifically that, since Article 185 does not expressly state that it has no application to companies, it should be treated as though it does apply to companies. When I explored with him what he was saying his answer was instructive because it revealed that what he was really doing was no more than identifying a possible argument. He had this to say:</span>

If there is a legislative gap and I would say that there probably is a gap, then the court would be allowed to - I don’t know what were the motives and grounds on which some of the courts arrived to the possibility to extend the stated formulation to legal entities. But there are decisions, standing, valid, enforced, and that is - I agree that it is exceptional, it is very rare. I don’t know what is the rejection rate. Maybe it is just one of 10,000 of plaintiffs enjoys that exception, or more, maybe one of the million.

In particular, his experience with drafting the Kazakh Civil Code gave him a useful insight into the purpose behind this legislation. I have not, however, accepted all his evidence without question. For example, as I shall come on to explain, I was not convinced by his argument that the identity of a wrongdoer need not be identified for limitation to start running in tortious claims, whereas it is (generally) necessary for the wrongdoer to be identified in claims involving violations of the Joint Stock Companies law by company officers, as I found his reasoning to be somewhat illogical.   </span>

Indeed, as I have indicated, Mr Twigger ultimately decided that he was in no position to rely upon the evidence which she gave. The truth is that Ms Kusainova was a deeply unsatisfactory witness who had no apparent idea as to what is expected of an expert witness in this Court. Mr Howe submitted, indeed, that she was demonstrably dishonest. This is an assessment with which I agree. Not only did she freely admit during the course of her evidence, in effect anyway, that she assisted in bribery and tax evasion activities in the context of land acquisitions in Kazakhstan, but most notably she lied more than once when giving her evidence concerning her attendance at the Ritz-Carlton in Almaty as Mr Jumadilov was giving evidence by video-link earlier in the proceedings. That she was in attendance on that occasion is not disputed; indeed, not only were representatives of the Claimants there but so were the Defendants’ own lawyers. It is difficult to see, in such circumstances, how Ms Kusainova could have thought that she would be able to get away with denying being in attendance at the Ritz-Carlton. She came over, however, as an ebullient and very confident individual as she was giving her evidence, and I can only assume that she thought that her firm denials would be accepted without more. She was, of course, wrong about this. Ms Kusainova’s willingness to lie made her entirely unsuitable as an expert witness. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe criticised Mr Jackson and Mr Twigger criticised Mr Tapper, although neither suggested that the experts did anything other than their best to assist the Court. Indeed, Mr Twigger expressly acknowledged that Mr Tapper was, as he put it,</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger’s position was that nonetheless Mr Tapper lacked relevant Kazakhstan-related experience and also that there were flaws in the methodology which he employed. Those flaws, Mr Twigger submitted, led Mr Tapper to arrive at valuations which were too low. Mr Howe, for his part, suggested that Mr Jackson used a methodology which resulted in him arriving at valuation figures which were too high, even though Mr Howe observed that Mr Jackson’s valuation in respect of Akzhal and Aksenger was still appreciably lower (some KZT 4 billion or approximately US$ 30 million) than the amounts which Arka-Stroy received pursuant to the (alleged) PEAK fraud. </span>

Indeed, with the exception of the law concerning limitation which I shall I address separately later, as far as I could detect the only area of disagreement between the Kazakh law experts is whether it is possible to bring concurrent claims in contract (including a claim under what is known as the JSC Law) and in tort. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Professor Suleimenov’s position on this issue is that it is not possible to bring concurrent claims since there is a rule which </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is usually called a prohibition on the conflict of claims”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and Kazakh law </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“does not provide for the filing of alternative claims”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Vataev disagreed with this, explaining that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“there is no prohibition against the competition of claims under Kazakhstan law in general and in relation to company officers’ breaches of duty in particular”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, so that Kazakh law </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“does not prohibit alternative claims within the same lawsuit, even if the satisfaction of one of the claims excuse satisfaction of the other claim”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Vataev agreed in cross-examination that a Kazakh court would not hold a defendant liable in both contract (including a company director under the JSC law) and in tort or, for that matter, both in tort and in unjust enrichment. However, Mr Vataev was not in the relevant exchanges asked whether a Kazakh court would permit the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">bringing</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of alternative claims, something which in his reports Mr Vataev had made clear he considered is permissible. It seems to me that this distinction is important. In short, I consider that Mr Vataev’s view is to be preferred since I struggle to see why it should not be open to a claimant under Kazakh law to pursue claims in the alternative, although I recognise that I approach the matter from an English law perspective which has no difficulty with the bringing of alternative claims. Ultimately, however, since the question is really a matter of procedure rather than substantive law and since the Claimants have chosen to bring their claims before the Commercial Court rather than before a Kazakh court, it is a matter for this Court (as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">lex fori</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) applying its own procedural law whether alternative claims should be permitted to be brought. Plainly, viewed as an English procedural matter, the answer must be in the affirmative. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Coming on to deal with the undisputed aspects of Kazakh law which arise, I can take as my guide the helpful (and, for the reason just stated, largely uncontroversial) summary contained in Mr Twigger’s written closing submissions. As there pointed out, the Claimants’ case raises three main categories of wrongdoing: (i) alleged breaches of the duties which Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva owed to KK JSC as directors pursuant to the Law on Joint Stock Companies (the ‘JSC Law’), specifically Articles 62 and 63; (ii) what under English law would be regarded as tort claims brought under Articles 917 and 932 of the Kazakh Civil Code (the ‘KCC’) for harm caused by allegedly unlawful acts committed by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva; and (iii) unjust enrichment-type claims against Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva under Articles 953 to 960 of the KCC.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">As Mr Twigger pointed out, again uncontroversially as far as I could detect, in respect of Mr Arip and insofar as KK JSC’s claims are concerned, it is only the claims under the JSC Law which are of any real relevance. This is because, if KK JSC were to find itself unable to establish breach by Mr Arip of his duties owed to KK JSC as a director, it is difficult (Mr Twigger would say impossible) to see how KK JSC would be in a position make out its tortious liability or unjust enrichment cases. Those other cases (the tort and unjust enrichment cases) are, therefore, more directly relevant not in relation to KK JSC’s claims against Mr Arip but in relation to the claims which the other Claimants (not including Peak Aksenger which is no longer a claimant in these proceedings) have brought against Mr Arip. In addition, although KK Plc formally also claims against Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva under the JSC Law in relation to their activities as officers of KK JSC (no claim is now pursued by KK Plc in relation to Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s activities as officers of KK Plc) and there was (at least coming into trial) a dispute over whether Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva could be liable to KK Plc as well as KK JSC on the basis that Article 63 of the JSC Law refers to company officers being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“liable to the company and the shareholders”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and KK Plc is an indirect shareholder of KK JSC. When the matter was explored in cross-examination, Mr Vataev ultimately agreed with Mr Twigger that Article 62 permitted claims to be brought by what he described as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“immediate shareholder”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“indirect, ultimate owners … if they are not shareholders, they would be able to claim only … under the general provisions of the civil law on torts”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In short, Mr Vataev accepted that only direct shareholders could bring a claim, and so the claim brought by KK Plc against Mr Arip (and, for that matter, Ms Dikhanbayeva) under the JSC Law, is not a claim which is viable.</span>

There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one’s reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.</span>

Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.</span>

It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what has happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it. The inherent improbability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied</span>

Mr Howe submitted that the relevant context in the present case consists of the lies which, he suggested (and I have decided) were told by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva in their evidence to the Court on central matters, combined with what he characterised as often elaborate false explanations put forward when confronted with documents which contradicted their version of events. Mr Howe submitted that, in the circumstances, far from it being improbable that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva committed the frauds alleged by the Claimants, it was highly probable that this was the case.

That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.’”</span>

This is because if the Defendants brought about a situation where payments were made by the KK Group to entities which were controlled by them in circumstances where it was not known by the KK Group that the entities were controlled by the Defendants, this must, it seems to me, amount to wrongdoing on the part of the Defendants (whether under the JSC Law, if applicable, or under Articles 917 and 932 of the KCC). </span>

The claimant’s argument was that, since the trades were bogus, the former directors were liable on the basis that they had orchestrated a fraudulent scheme in breach of their fiduciary duties. The former directors maintained that, as far as they were concerned, all the transactions between the company and the counterparties were arms length transactions with trading entities which were independent of the company and independent of each other. They were adamant that they knew nothing of these matters and were certainly not themselves responsible for controlling the affairs of the counterparties in question. Faced with these conflicting arguments on the claimant’s application for summary judgment against the former partners, Hart J described his approach to the case in the following way at [13]:</span>

Its proof, however, seems to me to depend on RBG being able to establish the truth of one central proposition, namely that the counterparties were not independent of RBG or of each other but were in fact controlled by VR and AJ. Unless VR and AJ can show a realistic prospect of demonstrating at trial that that was not the case, it seems to me that RBG is entitled to judgment against them, at least so far as liability is concerned. RBG seeks in its evidence to go further and to assert that not only were the counterparties so controlled but that all the transactions into which they entered with RBG were, as it is put in the evidence, ‘bogus’. This does not appear to me to be a necessary element of RBG’s claim to hold the defendants liable for breach of fiduciary duty. Whether or not the transactions were ‘bogus’ in the sense of being merely the product of the generation of a transactional paper trail, the mere fact that they were presented by the defendants to RBG’s auditors and its financiers as being transactions with apparently independent counterparties will be sufficient to establish breach by the defendants of their fiduciary duties as directors of RBG.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I come on, then, to deal with the PEAK Claim. To a degree by way of recap but also by way of amplification, the PEAK Claim arises in connection with proposed construction works at three sites in Almaty, Kazakhstan which were owned by the KK Group. Two of these, Akzhal-1 and Akzhal-2, form part of what was supposed to be a logistics park. Specifically, Akzhal-1 is an area amounting to ten hectares in which it is not in dispute that work was carried out since there are now 14 warehouses served by a small railway terminal linked to the nearby mainline, none of which was there before. Next to this area is a much bigger area of land, amounting to some 50 hectares, which is known as Akzhal-2 and where the intention was that there would also be warehousing but where to this day there is none. Not far from these two sites is the third of the sites to which the PEAK Claim relates, namely the Aksenger site which is even bigger again, consisting of some 476 hectares and comparable in size to almost double the City of London or two thirds the size of Gibraltar. This was intended to be developed into an industrial park but that did not happen. Indeed, it is the Claimants’ position (disputed by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva) that there is virtually no evidence that any meaningful construction work was done on the Aksenger site, beyond the building of a small guardhouse, a temporary road and a stretch of railway track which is not connected to the mainline which passes nearby. The PEAK Claim involves the Claimants (specifically KK JSC, PEAK and Peak Akzhal) claiming back everything which was paid in connection with this construction work. This amounts, in net terms, to US$ 109.1 million, although the Claimants’ position is that they are entitled to be paid certain very substantial interest and penalties paid on top of this amounting to a further approximately US$ 78.2 million, so making the total value of the PEAK Claim something approaching US$ 200 million. I shall come on to deal with interest and penalties later since my present focus is on the primary claim. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I should explain at the outset that there was no issue between the forensic accountancy experts (Mr Crooks and Mr Thompson) that the Claimants did, in fact, part with the US$ 109.1 million which forms the basis of the PEAK Claim. Details of how this figure is arrived at were contained in a diagram prepared by Mr Crooks (the Claimants’ expert) and described as Appendix 13B. This shows that of the US$ 109.1 million which was paid to Arka-Stroy by the Claimants: KZT 4.781 billion (US$ 36.9 million) was paid by Arka-Stroy to entities alleged by the Claimants to be owned or controlled by the Defendants; KZT 2.974 billion (US$ 23 million) was paid to entities described as the ‘Kazakh LLPs’ (also described elsewhere as ‘the Construction LLPs’) which the Claimants allege were also owned or controlled by the Defendants; and KZT 636.1 million (US$ 5 million) was paid to additional parties alleged by the Claimants to be owned or controlled by the Defendants. The balance, which was not paid out by Arka-Stroy, amounts to US$ 49.1 million. As I have previously mentioned, it is the Claimants’ case that they are entitled to be paid that amount of money in full since, Mr Howe submitted, the Claimants only paid the money to Arka-Stroy </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“on false pretences”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (not knowing that Arka-Stroy was not independent of the Defendants but, so the Claimants allege, a company which was owned or controlled by the Defendants) </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“…if the defendants have, as the claimants say they have, set up potentially a Potemkin Village exercise which consists of a few warehouses, but under the cover of which very large sums of money were paid away on fake construction projects, then once it is paid away it doesn’t much matter whether it was wasted digging a ditch at the bottom part of Aksenger or putting together a few rusting railway lines that end up in the bushes”</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it is lost to the claimants either way”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the alternative, if (contrary to his primary position) the Claimants are required to give credit for any construction work which was carried out, Mr Howe’s submission was that any such credit ought to be very modest indeed since, whatever the possible cost of the works done at Akzhal-2 and Aksenger, they are of no value whatsoever to the Claimants. Mr Howe illustrated this submission with the observation that incomplete and redundant sections of railway at Aksenger, for example, serve no useful purpose and, accordingly, can hardly be described as having any value. In those circumstances, he submitted that it would be quite wrong to require the Claimants to give any credit in relation to work carried out at Akzhal-2 and Aksenger. Mr Howe’s position was any credit ought, accordingly, only to relate to the works done at Akzhal-1 where there is now an operational logistics facility. In the further alternative, the Claimants’ position is that, if any greater credit is to be given which seeks to reflect the costs of the work carried out across all three sites (Akzhal-1, Akzhal-2 and Aksenger), then, on the basis of the evidence given by the quantity surveying experts (Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson), that credit ought to be very modest (something between US$ 6.5 million and US$ 16.4 million), and so reducing the size of the principal claim, before taking account of interest and penalties, only a little to between US$ 92.7 million and US$ 102.6 million. Mr Howe explained that these figures were based on the valuations arrived at by Mr Tapper, whose valuations of the work done at between US$ 22 million and US$ 29 million need to be reduced by between US$ 13 million and US$ 16 million to reflect the fact that work in this valuation range appears to have been carried out by other contractors which the Claimants paid directly since Mr Tapper’s view was that something like half of the work done, viewed by value, is properly attributable to contractors other than Arka-Stroy. Mr Howe highlighted in this context that even Mr Jackson’s valuation of the works done at just over US$ 80 million is significantly less than the US$ 109.1 million which was paid to Arka-Stroy, suggesting that this would need to be reduced to about US$ 40 million to take account of Mr Tapper’s point concerning other contractors carrying out work. </span>

If Arka-Stroy was owned or controlled by the Defendants, that is sufficient for the Claimants’ purposes, and the same applies to the ‘Connected Entities’ which received monies from Arka-Stroy.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Mr Werner’s assertion that the ‘KK Group got very little in return for the very large sums paid to Arka-Stroy’ is not true. As I have explained, Arka-Stroy performed significant work on both the Akzhal Logistics Centre and the Aksenger Industrial Park before the KK Group suspended these projects. The money that the KK Group paid to Arka-Stroy went towards labour, materials and other construction-related expenditures, as reflected in the numerous invoices that the Claimants have submitted in connection with these proceedings. Though Mr Werner alleges that Arka-Stroy was in reality under the full direction and control of the Defendants, he does not state what this allegation is based on. It is quite untrue. I had no direct or indirect interest in Arka-Stroy and exercised no control over it.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> and </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger went on to make the point that Arka-Stroy carried out substantial work for the KK Group prior to Mr Arip becoming a shareholder in the KK Group and prior to the Akzhal 1 project. I have touched on this aspect previously when referring to how, in the witness statement where he made the point that the KK Group had entered into various contracts with Arka-Stroy at a time before he became a shareholder, Mr Arip had neglected to mention that by this stage he had been made </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“board chairman”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. That happened in February 2003, the month before the first of the contracts relied upon by Mr Twigger was entered into. Mr Twigger submitted that, given the short timescale, it is unlikely that Mr Arip would have been involved in the decision to enter into that contract with Arka-Stroy. I am not sure, however, that I can agree with this since it does not seem to me to follow. The contract was entered into a month after Mr Arip’s appointment. In those circumstances, especially since there is nothing to indicate that the contract was one of any particular complexity requiring lengthy negotiations (in fact, the only reference to the contract is in a list of contracts without any detail being supplied), it would not, in my view, be safe to conclude that Mr Arip must necessarily have had nothing to do with the contract being entered into. In any event, what matters, as it seems to me, is that Mr Arip was at this juncture quite obviously involved with the KK Group, even if it was his evidence that between February and October 2003 the KK Group was really run by Mr Alexandr Shilov as this was something of a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“transition period”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> for Mr Arip as he was still working with his previous company. Mr Twigger referred, in similar vein, to two service agreements which were entered into between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy on 1 and 20 August 2003, each concerning cleaning and beautification services for the KK Group’s paper plant in Abay Village. Specifically, Mr Twigger highlighted that these contracts were signed by Mr Arip at a time when he was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“only”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> a director of KK JSC and not also a shareholder in that company (something he was not to become until early the following year via Kagazy Invest). However, the fact that Mr Arip was signing contracts demonstrates that he was involved in this period. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is quite clear that it was Mr Arip’s arrival at the KK Group that led to the KK Group’s increasing involvement with Arka-Stroy. As to this, it is significant that the contracts to which I have referred were signed for Arka-Stroy by a Mr S.M. Zhanpeisov. Mr Howe put it to Mr Arip that this person was an employee of the KK Group at that time and that Mr Arip would have known this because he had signed his employment contract. In fact, Mr Arip explained that he did no such thing since the signature on the employment contract appearing next to his typed name was not his. He insisted that he had no knowledge of Mr Zhanpeisov and pointed out, by reference to certain employment records which he was shown by Mr Howe, that these showed that Mr Zhanpeisov had been dismissed from the KK Group on 1 August 2003 and that he was not re-engaged until 5 January 2004. The fact that Mr Zhanpeisov had written to Mr Arip on 25 March 2003 seeking employment as (at least as per the agreed translation) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Head of administration and supply department”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was, according to Mr Arip, explained by the fact that every potential employee will write to the chairman of the board of the company where he or she is desirous of working. A person in that position will, therefore, receive many such letters. This explains, Mr Arip insisted, why he had no recollection of Mr Zhanpeisov. He went on to explain that, at the time, people working in the KK Group had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“their own businesses in parallel and many of the businesses worked with Kagazy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He speculated that this is the reason why these two service agreements had been entered into. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I had the impression, however, that Mr Arip was ready for Mr Howe’s questions on this matter and that he was not being straightforward in what he had to say in his answers. That impression was reinforced when, after being shown a lease agreement entered into between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy on 1 September 2003 relating to a temporary lease of premises at KK JSC’s factory, Mr Arip explained that he did not remember who Mr Zhanpeisov was because </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“all these contracts, I was basically signing more or less mechanically”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He then quickly pointed out that, although the lease agreement described itself as having been signed by the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Chairman of the Board”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, in fact it was signed by somebody else, Mr Ikmet Muhanov. That excuse was not something he was, however, able to give in relation to the document which he was then shown, namely a contract entered into on 2 September 2003 between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy whereby Arka-Stroy agreed to provide interior design services for an office development. That contract was described as having been signed by Mr Zhanpeisov on behalf of Arka-Stroy and by Mr Arip on behalf of KK JSC, and Mr Arip accepted that the signature was, indeed, his. He immediately added, however, that he did not remember signing the document which was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not a big contract”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He was then asked by Mr Howe why Arka-Stroy would have been providing interior design services. His answer was that he did not know because he was not involved in the relevant discussions. Interestingly, though, he then added this:</span>

I am clear that Mr Arip was simply not telling the truth about this. As demonstrated by the initial unguarded answer which he gave, Mr Arip clearly knew not only about Mr Khan (a director of Arka-Stroy at the time and, as Mr Arip agreed, an employee of the KK Group) but also about Mr Zhanpeisov. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The same applies, quite obviously in the circumstances, to Mr Zhekebatryov, Mr Khan’s fellow Arka-Stroy shareholder at the relevant time. As Mr Howe pointed out, Mr Zhekebatyrov, a relative of Mr Zhunus, was in 2006 the owner of PEAK and is somebody who, as a KK Group employee, has held a variety of roles including Head of KK JSC’s Head of Procurement, Head of Capital Construction, an employee of Holding Invest, the owner of Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara, CEO of Kagazy Invest, the founder and CEO of Kontakt Service Plus, the director of Trading Company and the owner/director of HW and TEW. Despite this, as Mr Howe observed, Mr Arip made no mention of Mr Zhekebatyrov being Mr Khan’s partner in Arka-Stroy. Mr Twigger rightly pointed out that Mr Arip clarified later in his cross-examination that he was only able to say that Arka-Stroy was owned by Mr Khan and Mr Zhekebatyrov after reading the documents in the trial bundle, and that he did not know that this was the position when he was dealing with Arka-Stroy since, as far as he was concerned, when he was in contact with Arka-Stroy in relation specifically to a contract entered into between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy on 23 April 2005 relating to the construction of foundations for an office at KK JSC’s paper factory, the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“main person”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> he dealt with was Mr Sartbayev. This does not, however, explain why Mr Arip did not refer to Mr Zhekebatyrov and his involvement in Arka-Stroy in any of his witness statements. This omission was obviously deliberate and intended to suggest that Mr Arip’s knowledge of, and involvement with, Arka-Stroy was somewhat less than actually was the case. When asked by Mr Howe, Mr Arip confirmed that Mr Zhekebatyrov was, in fact, at the time (from 1 August 2003) employed by KK JSC as Head of Capital Construction, albeit that Mr Arip suggested that this was a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“pretty minor”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> role, not least because </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“we didn’t have much of a construction going on”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is difficult to see why, if he was intending to be straightforward in the evidence which he gave, certainly in the lead-up to trial, Mr Arip would not have made mention of this. The fact that he did not do so causes me to doubt, once again, his credibility. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger drew attention in closing to the fact that Mr Arip described Mr Zhekebatyrov as somebody who always had his own businesses. He added that Mr Arip freely acknowledged that Mr Zhekebatyrov had, on occasion (he agreed with Mr Howe that it happened </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“regularly”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">), acted as Mr Zhunus’ and Mr Arip’s nominee for Kagazy Invest and Holding Invest (indeed, temporarily holding their shares when the KK Group restructuring took place). Mr Twigger’s suggestion was that, since Mr Arip was willing to accept this, there was no reason to doubt his denial that Mr Zhekebatyrov acted as his nominee in respect of Arka-Stroy. I do not consider that this follows, however, since a blanket denial that Mr Zhekebatyrov </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">ever</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> acted as Mr Arip’s nominee would have been wholly unrealistic. The fact, therefore, that Mr Arip was prepared to acknowledge Mr Zhekebatyrov’s nominee role in relation to other entities which he accepts owning or controlling seems to me to be of only very limited significance. Moreover, as Mr Howe pointed out, it can hardly be overlooked that, if Mr Zhekebatyrov was prepared to act as a nominee and Mr Arip was prepared to use him as a nominee, in relation to some companies, then, this rather suggests that they would be prepared to do so in relation to Arka-Stroy as well. It is clear to me that Mr Zhekebatyrov was, as Mr Howe put to Mr Arip, somebody who acted as a nominee in relation to Arka-Stroy in the same way as he did in relation to other companies for Mr Arip. Mr Howe memorably observed that Mr Zhekebatyrov occupied so many roles </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it is a wonder he could remember what he was supposed to be doing everyday”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, later even more memorably describing him as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“one of the sort of Swiss army knives of people who is variously deployed, as I said, originally, a form of human rubber stamp to stamp off on various documents in relation to these entities”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There is also the position of Mr Bek Esimbekov to consider. He became Arka-Stroy’s 100% shareholder in January 2007, acquiring each of Mr Zhekebatyrov’s and Mr Khan’s 50% shareholdings. As Mr Howe put it, Mr Esimbekov is another person </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“who appears all over the place”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Specifically, he occupied various roles within the KK Group at various times, such as PEAK’s General Manager from 2008, Chief Executive Officer of Peak Akzhal and President of Astana-Contract. He was also the owner/manager of Trading Company before Mr Arip’s mother-in-law acquired that company, and the owner/manager also of Lotos. The latter is demonstrated, for example, by a document described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Decision No. 4 of the sole shareholder in Lotos LTD LLP”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> dated 29 December 2006 which describes Mr Esimbekov as the sole shareholder of Lotos and goes on to record his decision to sell to KK JSC various plots of land. Mr Arip insisted in evidence that Lotos was not one of his companies but belonged to Mr Esimbekov, explaining that he was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a very sophisticated person”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that he (Mr Arip) </span>

This is a matter to which I shall return but, for reasons which I shall develop later, I am satisfied, however, that Lotos was, indeed, Mr Arip’s company and that Mr Esimbekov acted as his nominee in relation to it. It is telling in this regard that in his fourteenth witness statement Mr Arip’s denial that he owned or had any interest in Lotos was accompanied by the claim that he did not know if that company was owned by Mr Esimbekov. This is impossible to square with Mr Arip’s evidence in cross-examination that Lotos was Mr Esimbekov’s company. Mr Arip resorted to saying that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“had just forgotten and made a mistake”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to justify this on the basis that events took place some time ago and </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it was difficult for me to recognise and remember many companies”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was a poor excuse made, in my view, to try and distance Mr Arip from Mr Esimbekov and so from Lotos. That Mr Esimbekov acted on behalf of Mr Arip in relation to Arka-Stroy as well is apparent from the fact that as early as June 2005 Mr Esimbekov was representing Arka-Stroy when, on 6 June 2005, he signed a termination agreement with Kagazy Gofrotara on Arka-Stroy’s behalf. This was just a matter of weeks after, on 22 April 2005, he had given his approval along with others on behalf of KK JSC to the agreement entered into the following day between Arka-Stroy and KK JSC. When asked about this by Mr Howe, Mr Arip stated that he did not know that Mr Esimbekov was a director of Arka-Stroy. This is despite the fact that it was Mr Arip who counter-signed the 6 June 2005 contract on behalf of Kagazy Gofrotara purporting to act as a director. It should be borne in mind in this context that Mr Arip and Mr Esimbekov (and Ms Dikhanbayeva) worked together at KazTransCom before joining the KK Group. Mr Esimbekov and Mr Arip were, therefore, hardly strangers. In these circumstances, it is difficult to accept that Mr Arip did not know in what capacity Mr Esimbekov was acting or purporting to act when entering into this contract. Mr Twigger referred to a different contract which was also entered into on 6 June 2005. This was a contract entered into between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy and was in respect of the design and commissioning of an office building. As Mr Twigger pointed out, this contract was signed by Mr Zhekebatyrov on behalf of Arka-Stroy rather than by Mr Esimbekov. Mr Twigger complained that, in the circumstances, it was wrong to have suggested to Mr Arip, based on the termination agreement entered into on the same day, that Mr Esimbekov was acting as a director of Arka-Stroy at that time. I do not agree with this. It does not matter that other contracts signed by other people (whether Mr Zhekebatyrov or, as in the cases of a third contract also entered into on 6 June 2005 and another contract concluded on 24 June 2005, a Mr Uteuliev) can also be seen to have been entered into with Arka-Stroy at this time since all that matters is that Mr Arip cannot have been as ignorant as to what Mr Esimbekov was doing as regards Arka-Stroy as he suggested.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Matters do not stop there, however, since there is also Mr Sartbayev to consider. It is striking that the first time that there was any mention of Arka-Stroy’s owner being Mr Sartbayev was when Mr Sannikov produced his witness statement in September 2016 in which he stated that the first time that he had heard of Arka-Stroy was when he met Mr Sartbayev in around Spring 2006 and Mr Sartbayev introduced himself as the owner of that company. As I have made clear, I regard that evidence as having been made up. There is not a single document supporting what Mr Sannikov had to say in this respect. Nor, tellingly, did Mr Arip say anything in any of his witness statements about Mr Sartbayev being Arka-Stroy’s owner. It is inconceivable that Mr Arip would not have referred to this at a much earlier stage in the proceedings had what Mr Sannikov had to say been truthful. The fact that he did not do so is, therefore, significant. It was highly surprising, in the circumstances, that relatively early on in his cross-examination Mr Arip should choose to mention, almost in passing, that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“later on”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> Mr Sartbayev </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe initially let that pass but returned to the topic after the short adjournment. He put to Mr Arip that he must have had some idea of who owned Arka-Stroy. This resulted in this lengthy response from Mr Arip:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Yes, but I come to this - and it was quite clear, not just some idea, it was very clear to me. Because what happened when Arka-Stroy, when we had the tender – when Arka-Stroy had been doing all kind of small jobs on Kagazy, I simply did not bother who owns it and what it is doing. But during the big tender for construction of the cardboard factory, it was a big factory, it was like 30,000 or 40,000 square metres, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of investment, it was probably the first significant construction of Kagazy Group.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">So during that period, we have the tender. And Arka-Stroy was one of the bidders. We have some other bidders, but Arka-Stroy did not want to tender, because tender was won by the Dutch company called Bemaco. And I’m sure it is not new information for claimants, because there is this factory standing there and the name Bemaco is on the wall of the factory. So they won this tender.</span>

But for me the main person was Mr Sartbayev. Basically I explained to him that we are very happy with the price and job you did before is a good one. Also I understood from him that he owned some other construction businesses, Kastrovanov is basically his companies [sic], but I said we are going ahead with Bemaco and that is - so from that moment on what I actually knew, owners of Arka-Stroy.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that he </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Arip denied this and went on to explain that the reason why he had not previously mentioned about Mr Sartbayev was that he thought that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it is really the first time you ask me about that”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He clarified later that he </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Just as I am clear that Mr Sannikov made up what he had to say concerning Mr Sartbayev, so I am equally clear that Mr Arip made up this evidence also. It is fanciful to suppose that Mr Arip would have chosen to say nothing about Mr Sartbayev at an earlier stage if what he ultimately came to say during his cross-examination was even remotely true. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows also that I cannot accept Mr Arip’s evidence that, as far as he was concerned, it was Mr Sartbayev who acted on behalf of Arka-Stroy in deciding to employ Mr Makovac. That plainly cannot be the case. This is a matter which I have previously touched upon when dealing with the employment contract dated 1 July 2005 entered into between Arka-Stroy and Mr Makovac. It will be recalled that that employment contract was signed on Arka-Stroy’s behalf not by Mr Sartbayev but by Mr Arip himself. I have also previously considered the email which Mr Makovac sent to Mr Arip in October 2006 and rejected Mr Arip’s suggestion that this related not to Mr Makovac’s employment with Arka-Stroy but to a role assisting Holding Invest. In short, Mr Arip told lies about these matters. The position is clear beyond peradventure. It was Mr Arip who decided to hire Mr Makovac for Arka-Stroy. I do not accept that Mr Arip was merely acting in an advisory role which entailed him assisting Arka-Stroy to recruit Mr Makovac.  It was also Mr Arip to whom Mr Makovac typically reported, as demonstrated, for example, by an email which he sent to Mr Arip on 26 July 2005 enclosing </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a draft proposal of the organisational principles for the Arka Stroi company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and offering to discuss it with Mr Arip. That Mr Makovac regarded himself, and was treated by others, as being, in effect, part of the KK Group was abundantly clear from the evidence in this case. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Another example concerning Mr Makovac specifically is the email to which I have previously referred in which Mr Makovac looked to Mr Arip to be provided with more employees to work on the logistics centre. Yet another example is an email which Mr Makovac sent on 6 October 2005 to Svetlana Zykova at the KK Group in which he essentially asked for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the payment of salaries for Arka Stroi [sic]”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Arip suggested that the explanation why Mr Makovac sometimes asked him or the KK Group to approve the expenditure of Arka-Stroy, was that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">because I have to pay for that at the end of the day, it has to be approved by me”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This explanation, however, makes little sense if, as Mr Arip would have it, Mr Sartbayev was Arka-Stroy’s owner and so Mr Makovac’s superior (rather than Mr Arip). Mr Twigger also sought to explain away other documents such as Ms Dikhanbayeva’s subsequent agreement to meet a request by Mr Makovac for urgent funding of KZT 20 million for excavation work and prepayments for haulage (transporting warehouses from Slovenia) on the basis that this represented what Mr Twigger described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“flexibility”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The reality, it seems to me, is that this was simply another example of Mr Makovac (and Arka-Stroy) looking to the KK Group to do what a parent will often do for its subsidiary. In the same way, it is to be noted that in a document on which Mr Twigger placed some reliance (albeit only in a footnote and on a different point) namely something entitled </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Weekly Coordinating Meeting of ARKA-STROY LLP”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> dated 3 October 2005 and on the KK Group’s notepaper, there is reference to a meeting chaired by Mr Makovac, in which there is reference to the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“legal department”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> preparing </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“all contracts for Arka-Stroy within 2 days after receiving the relevant internal memorandum”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This must be a reference to the KK Group’s legal department since there is no indication that Arka-Stroy itself had a legal department. It follows, therefore, that what was contemplated here was that the KK Group would prepare legal contracts for its sub-contractor. That seems a most unlikely scenario to me. Even more intriguingly, the document goes on to state that it “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">has been decided that each contract shall be approved by the signature of the following three persons: Messrs Tulegenov, Dikhanbayeva, and Maccovac [sic]”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is impossible to see why the first of these two people should be approving contracts on Arka-Stroy’s behalf unless the company was part of the KK Group. The document then ends with a reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Notifying new employees of Arka-Stroy LLP on their movement to the company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> with the relevant</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Responsible Person”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> identified as somebody called Svetlana, namely Svetlana Zykova who was an administrator within the KK Group. Again, it is not easy to see why new Arka-Stroy employees would receive notification from an employee of the KK Group unless Arka-Stroy was itself a member of the KK Group.</span>

Other examples include documents where Arka-Stroy personnel are described as though they are employed by the KK Group. I have in mind, for instance, a note which was put together for Alliance Bank by Ms Tatiana Mikhailovna Kazinets where she is described as PEAK’s Chief Accountant yet in other documents (including, perhaps most notably, various Acceptance Acts) she is described as Arka-Stroy’s Chief Accountant. Another example concerns Mr Tulegenov who, despite being a senior employee within the KK Group, was also described as Arka-Stroy’s Deputy Director. Mr Sharipov was asked, in particular, in cross-examination about a letter which he wrote to Mr Tulegenov on 28 October 2007 concerning </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the formation of a commission for the acceptance inspection of the completed construction of water pipeline and sewerage utility networks at the construction site of the PEAK Logistics Centre”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This letter was addressed to Mr Tulegenov in his capacity as Arka-Stroy’s Deputy Director. Mr Saoul suggested that it was a letter which had been </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“created for appearances really”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Sharipov denied this, insisting that it was a </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> which Mr Twigger suggested was all that there was between the KK Group (specifically KK JSC and PEAK) and Arka-Stroy. An illustration of this is a letter which Ms Yelgeldiyeva, KK JSC’s Chief Accountant, sent to Alliance Bank on 15 February 2006. That letter requested the preparation and installation of </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> and then listed a whole series of companies within the KK Group. Amongst that list, at the end, was Arka-Stroy. This type of document points, conclusively as I see it, to the inevitable conclusion that Arka-Stroy was treated at the time as part of the KK Group.

	      <span style="color:#000000">These are only examples. I mention them merely to illustrate the type of documents which exist. I do not, in the circumstances, propose to list every document which establishes the correctness of Mr Howe’s submissions on this topic. Suffice to say that I have considered all the evidence and am quite clear that those submissions are, indeed, correct. In addition to the matters which I have already addressed, the other evidence which I have taken into account includes the many corporate documents which are only really consistent with Arka-Stroy being part of the KK Group. By way of illustration, as I have previously explained by reference to the evidence which was given by Mr Sharipov, in the minutes of the regular budget review meetings which took place, Arka-Stroy was identified as a subsidiary of Kagazy Invest. Futhermore, Arka-Stroy was referred to as a subordinate company of Kagazy Invest in an Order dated 28 April 2006 regarding tighter internal controls, and Arka-Stroy was identified as a subsidiary of Kagazy Invest in Regulations of the Legal Department of Kagazy Invest. In addition, resolutions regarding Arka-Stroy’s budget were passed in KK JSC’s board meetings; and Arka-Stroy was described as a KK Group subsidiary in regulations relating to the KK Group bonus system. Moreover, there is the fact also that Arka-Stroy can be seen in the evidence to have featured in numerous multi-party agreements involving entities within the KK Group and other companies alleged by the Claimants in these proceedings to be ‘Connected Entities’. Again, I do not propose to set out every example of such contracts but they include: a debt assignment agreement between Trade House (PEAK Akzhal), Arka-Stroy and Lotos; an assignment agreement between Trading Company, Trade House (PEAK Akzhal) and Arka-Stroy; an assignment agreement between Trade House (PEAK), Arka-Stroy and Kontakt Service Plus; an assignment agreement between KK JSC, Arka-Stroy and HW: an assignment agreement between KK JSC, Arka-Stroy and TEW; and an agreement between Trading Company and Arka-Stroy for (unlimited) financial assistance; a draft debt transfer agreement between Lotos, Trading Company, Arka-Stroy and HW which included what Mr Howe suggested was a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“revealing comment bubble” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">referring to there having been</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “no basis for the origin of the debt…”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe submitted, and I agree, that what these agreements appear to demonstrate is that the various entities entering into them were being treated in a manner which is inconsistent with any of them having any independence of the type which Mr Twigger suggests Arka-Stroy enjoyed. On the contrary, it seems to me that Mr Howe was right when he submitted that the agreements effectively amounted to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“accounting entries”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which involved the shuffling around of monies between members of a single group of companies. It will be recalled that this is a topic which I addressed when describing what I characterised as Ms Dikhanbayeva’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“unrealistic and implausible evidence”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> when she was shown various documents relating to an instruction which she had given concerning the drawing up of financial assistance or debt transfer documentation. I am quite clear that agreements of this sort could only be concluded (despite her denials) by Ms Dikhanbayeva at Mr Arip’s behest if every company was a member of the KK Group. Mr Howe was right when he submitted that not only does the absence of any evidence that there were ever negotiations with the various entities point strongly towards a conclusion that these were not genuine agreements, but there is also no logical commercial reason why these various entities, if genuinely independent, would be willing to enter into arrangements involving, for instance, the swapping of a debt owed to them by a substantial (and known) KK Group entity for a debt owed by a company which is unknown to them.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In addition, but importantly, there is also the evidence concerning the merger between PEAK and Arka-Stroy in 2008 which I have already addressed in some detail. Mr Twigger’s submission was that too much store had been placed in this regard on what he described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“two isolated emails, both in similar terms”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He suggested that the wording of these emails is obscure and says nothing about a merger between the two companies (as opposed to changes in email addresses). He relied, in addition, on what Mr Sharipov had to say in cross-examination, which was to deny that there had been a merger between PEAK and Arka-Stroy in 2008 and, indeed, that at that time </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“there was a conflict between PEAK and Arka-Stroy which resulted from the fact that Arka-Stroy had left quite a lot of elements undelivered on their construction and they had to fix those”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger observed that that evidence is not consistent with Arka-Stroy being a member of the KK Group or some sort of ‘captive’ entity. The difficulty with this evidence from Mr Sharipov is, however, that I did not find it to be evidence which was even remotely credible. I reject it, in fact, as being evidence which was made up. As for the emails themselves, in my view, they are both quite clear and only consistent with a merger of the two companies (not merely their two computer systems) having taken place. I am clear, in short, that the evidence concerning the merger provides significant support for the Claimants’ case that Arka-Stroy was owned or controlled by the Defendants.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger made a number of other submissions in support of his overall proposition that Arka-Stroy was (and only ever was) an independent entity and not a part of the KK Group. I have dealt with a number of these already and so in what follows I shall endeavour not to repeat myself. First, I have already mentioned that he referred to a number of contracts which Arka-Stroy entered into at a time when, albeit that Mr Arip had become President of KK JSC’s Management Board (in February 2003), he had yet to become a shareholder. As Mr Howe observed, however, the contracts concerned were (as, indeed, Mr Arip, on occasion, himself stated) relatively minor. This is confirmed by a document which Mr Makovac drew up entitled </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“List of facilities completed by ArkaStroy LLP during 2005”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, which included work done with a value of KZT 800 million as follows: waste paper recycling shop for Kagazy Processing (earthworks, levelling, reinforced concrete foundations, installation of metal framework, water supply etc.); construction of production warehouses (foundations and metal framework); paper stock preparation room (earthworks, foundations, installation of walls and roof framing); paper manufacturing shop (internal water supply, waste removal, ventilation networks and floor installation); and construction of the administration building (foundations, framework, roof, landscaping, site improvements, paving and reinforced concrete barrier). Although the fact that this work was carried out demonstrates that Arka-Stroy was obviously already ‘in business’ in the autumn of 2005 when Mr Makovac joined and, furthermore, that Arka-Stroy was engaged in construction-related work, the fact remains that the contract which it entered into on 15 August 2005 with KK JSC which had a value of KZT 2,191,375,600 (approximately US$ 16.97 million), the first of the so-called PEAK contracts, and the contracts which followed were of a completely different order. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Indeed, it is worth pausing here to consider what were the contracts which were entered into between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy and under which KK JSC came to pay the substantial monies to Arka-Stroy and which led to the bringing of the PEAK Claim. I have just mentioned the first of these contracts which was concluded on 15 August 2005. This was concerned with Akzhal 1. It should be appreciated that, as a result of an addendum dated 1 February 2006 (and signed by Mr Arip on behalf of KK JSC), the contract price was subsequently substantially increased to KZT 3,117,885,039 (US$ 24.15 million). The August 2005 contract did not stand alone, however, since that contract was followed by a further contract, also concerned with Akzhal 1 (at least originally), concluded on 2 November 2005 between Peak Akzhal and Arka-Stroy with a price of KZT 3,364,266,404 (approximately US$ 26.05 million). This was, in turn, followed by a contract dated 1 March 2006, again between Peak Akzhal and Arka-Stroy, where the agreed price was KZT 1,531,936,250 (approximately US$ 11.07 million). Some four months after that, another contract was entered into, on 6 July 2006, this time between PEAK (then called Megalogistics Terminal Services LLP) and Arka-Stroy and concerned not with Akzhal 1 but (at least originally) with Akzhal 2, with a contractual value of KZT 1,023,000,000 (approximately US$ 7.92 million) which was increased shortly afterwards, through an addendum dated 1 August 2006, to KZT 6,185,948,905 (approximately US$ 47.91 million). A final contract was concluded between KK JSC and Arka-Stroy on 28 March 2008 for a price of KZT 2,472,812,005 (approximately US$ 19.15 million). Although it is right to acknowledge that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva quibble over whether this was signed by Mr Arip and suggest that it was not even drafted until November 2009 by which time they had left Kazakhstan for Dubai, it is tolerably clear that Arka-Stroy was paid under this further contract, albeit apparently by referencing a different contract altogether (one described as being dated 11 January 2008) which was not actually entered into. Specifically, Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s forensic accountancy expert, Mr Thompson, has identified 12 payments from KK JSC to Arka-Stroy amounting to KZT 2,229,648,589 made between November 2008 and January 2009. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is worth also taking a moment to consider what Ms Dikhanbayeva had to say about these contracts. According to her, the August 2005 contract was initially for work on Akzhal-1 but was, in fact, used for Akzhal-2 and the addendum entered into in February 2006 was to increase the price to allow for the additional work required at Akzhal-2. The November 2005 contract, Ms Dikhanbayeva explained, was for work at Akzhal-1 and, as such, replaced the August 2005 contract. It included, she added, the price of the Akzhal-1 metal warehouses, although these were subsequently bought directly from Loging for approximately US$ 6.8 million. As for the March 2006 contract, this was also in relation to Akzhal-1, the intention being that this contract would replace the November 2005 contract and that the Akzhal-1 metal warehouses would not be included in the new contract since these were now the subject of a separate contract with Loging, but Ms Dikhanbayeva stated that it was ultimately decided to leave the November 2005 contract alone. The July 2006 contract, she went on to explain, was supposed to be for work at Akzhal-2 and the increase in the August 2006 addendum was to cover the cost of Akzhal-2 metal warehouses, but in the end the Akzhal-2 warehouses became the subject of a separate contract with Seybold and this contract was not used at all in relation to Akzhal-2. Instead, according to Ms Dikhanbayeva, the contract was used for the purposes of Aksenger and described in that context as having been a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Supplemental Agreement No.3”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to the July 2006 contract. This further agreement has not, however, been located. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">This was curious evidence which it was not at all easy to follow, still less accept. What matters, however, is that, taken together, these were major contracts worth as much as US$ 160 million to Arka-Stroy, a company with only a very modest track record which entailed nothing like the level of experience which might be expected in a company securing such large contracts. It is, furthermore, instructive in this context that, in an effort to explain that Arka-Stroy was already significantly involved in the construction business when it entered into the 2005 contracts, the Defendants should rely on the document to which I have previously referred dated 3 October 2005 on the KK Group’s notepaper which is entitled </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Weekly Coordinating Meeting of ARKA-STROY LLP”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since, on analysis, there is very little in that document to indicate what work Arka-Stroy was doing at the time. It is certainly impossible to see how this is a document which evidences any significant construction work having been carried out by Arka-Stroy. Indeed, it is worth mentioning in passing that the fact that the document is on the KK Group’s notepaper itself rather supports the proposition that Arka-Stroy was not an independent company. It should be borne in mind also that the contract entered into by Arka-Stroy with Kagazy Gofrotara on 6 June 2005, the contract which Mr Twigger pointed out was signed by Mr Uteuliev rather than by Mr Esimbekov, although substantial (KZT1.16 billion), never, in fact, happened. I agree with Mr Howe, in the circumstances, that there is very little evidence to demonstrate any substantial construction activity on the part of Arka-Stroy or to justify the conclusion that the company had a substantial independent management, such as to justify the scale of the contracts that it subsequently entered into with KK JSC from August 2005 onwards.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">It should be noted also that, in setting out details of what Mr Makovac did at Arka-Stroy after his arrival in late 2005, Mr Twigger highlighted the fact that by November of that year Arka-Stroy had 15 employees and was described by Mr Makovac to the Karasay District Head of Department for Employment as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“standalone enterprise whose core line of business was the design and construction of production buildings”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It seems to me that, if anything, this assists Mr Howe’s submission since, if Arka-Stroy had only reached the position where it had as few as 15 employees in this timescale, it is difficult to see how it can really be the case that beforehand it was a company which could have been engaged in any particularly substantial work. I might add that I tend also to think that the description which Mr Makovac used in describing the business to local officialdom somewhat hints at a business which was only at that stage really getting going. The same applies to the further point made by Mr Twigger concerning Mr Makovac’s attempts to recruit a production engineer from abroad, also described in the letter to the Karasay District Head of Department for Employment. Mr Makovac was plainly making efforts to boost the company’s workforce precisely because it had hitherto been somewhat lacking. It is also interesting in this context that the opening paragraph of the letter reads as follows:</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">It was also suggested by Mr Twigger that in early 2006 Arka-Stroy issued a tender in relation to the development of the Akzhal and Aksenger projects in view of, among other things, the proposed positioning of the Almaty ring-road in the Almaty transportation development strategy. A perusal of the relevant document relied upon demonstrates, however, that it was not really a tender at all but, as indeed the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Document Scope”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> itself put it, a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Rough description of the project frame, to be used for initial feasibility calculations and price proposals”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is not a document which demonstrates any real work carried out by Arka-Stroy and is rather more consistent with Arka-Stroy at that stage being little more than a start-up. Mr Twigger went on to point to various other matters. He referred, for example, to Mr Makovac assisting the KK Group management, including Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva, from early 2006 onwards by providing information pursuant to their requests to enable the KK Group to obtain financing and relevant permits for the project. He highlighted also how, starting in March 2006, Arka-Stroy developed procedures for the selection and management of sub-contractors and produced minutes of its tender committee, and how shortly after that Arka-Stroy began holding regular meetings with its sub-contractors, in particular the designers PTIpishcheprom and Intereng Almaty. This, together with work done creating business plans and marketing material, Mr Twigger suggested, establishes that the Akzhal projects were genuine and that they were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not some fictional device to commit fraud”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Howe pointed out, however, it has never been the Claimants’ case that no construction work was carried out; on the contrary, it is self-evident that work was done on the Akzal-1 site since there are, quite clearly, warehouses which have been built there. The Claimants’ position is that, although work was carried out, it was not carried out in sufficient quantities to justify the amount of money which the KK Group parted with. Clearly also it would not have been possible to justify the very large sums of money being paid out by the KK Group without having some sort of construction activity to show for it. I agree with Mr Howe that, in the circumstances, the fact that Mr Twigger was able to point to the types of activities which he identified only takes matters so far. In my view, it is not far enough. I am quite clear, indeed, considering the totality of the evidence and bearing in mind lies which Mr Arip and others such as Mr Sannikov and Mr Sharipov (as well as Ms Dikhanbayeva, of course) told when giving evidence, that the suggestion that Arka-Stroy was a genuinely independent construction company, as opposed to a company controlled by the Defendants, is fanciful.</span>

The first of these points concerns Mr Twigger’s submission that, in relation to US$ 49.1 million of the US$ 109.1 million net total paid to Arka-Stroy between August 2005 and July 2009, there is no evidence that any onward payment came to be made by Arka-Stroy to any entity connected with the Defendants or that the money was used for the Defendants’ personal benefit. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to that US$ 49.1 million, Mr Twigger suggested that the Claimants’ own forensic accountancy expert, Mr Crooks, effectively conceded that he had no basis for saying that the US$ 49.1 million had been misappropriated by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva since he confirmed that he had not engaged in a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“specific transaction-by-transaction”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> exercise and that the analysis which he had performed involved a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“bucket approach, in the sense we analysed the amounts going into the bucket, if I can use that non-technical term, and we looked at the payments going out of the bucket, to see where the majority of the income or cash flows came from and where the cash flows went to”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Accordingly, Mr Twigger contended, the most (if anything) that the Claimants could hope to recover in respect of the PEAK Claim is approximately US$ 60 million (US$ 109.1 million less US$ 49.1 million). However, I reject this contention. As I have previously explained, what matters is that the Claimants parted with the monies which they did in ignorance of the fact that the recipient of those monies, Arka-Stroy, was a company which was controlled by the Defendants. I agree with Mr Howe that it is not for the Claimants to have to explain what Arka-Stroy did with each and every tenge it received from them. This is not to say that credit should not be given for genuine construction work which was carried out, and nor do I mean to suggest that, where money has been repaid to the KK Group, this should simply be ignored, the issue which I come on now to address. </span>

His point was that there cannot be said to be misappropriation where there has been repayment by such entities, and that this must all the more be the case if those entities are properly to be regarded as having been owned or controlled by the Defendants since, if that is right, the repayment ought likewise to be treated as having been made by or on behalf of the Defendants themselves. The difficulty with this submission, however, is that Mr Crooks made it clear in the report which he prepared in March this year that he was not blind to this point and had carried out an analysis of what might be described as the ‘state of accounts’ between the Claimants and the ‘Connected Entities’ which involved looking at transactions other than those which form the subject matter of the PEAK Claim.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe submitted that the analysis performed by Mr Crooks was entirely appropriate. I agree. It was clearly unrealistic to expect him (or any other expert) to do what Mr Twigger suggested, which was to review the payment narratives in relation to all 3,394 transactions. Mr Crooks was clear, both in his report and when he was cross-examined, that the exercise he engaged in was intended to provide him with some </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“comfort”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“needed to be comfortable that … the KK Group was still in the net payment position”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Far from closing his eyes, therefore, to the point which was given such emphasis by Mr Twigger, namely that payments made by Arka-Stroy to ‘Connected Entities’ may have found their way back to the KK Group, Mr Crooks had this point very much in mind. As he put it, he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“wanted some comfort that in fact all of the payments that we had been looking at on, let’s say, appendix 13B didn’t find their way back to the KK Group”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The fact that Mr Twigger was able to pick Mr Crooks up on aspects of the analysis which he carried out (including, for example, the fact that he included transactions involving Arka-Stroy when his intention </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was to identify cash flows outside of payments going to Arka-Stroy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) does not, in my view, alter the core fact that what Mr Crooks did demonstrates that there clearly was a substantial balance in favour of the KK Group. Mr Howe speculated, indeed, in his reply submissions that the claim advanced against the Defendants </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“could, on another analysis, have been very much bigger than it is”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. As he explained earlier in his cross-examination when he was asked about the payments to and from Arka-Stroy, his primary focus was not on payment narratives but on cashflows, and he only looked at narratives when considering whether an adjustment to the claim was required.

	      <span style="color:#000000">I was unconvinced by Mr Twigger’s reliance, in particular, on the exercise carried out by Mr Thompson in a report produced in April this year which entailed an analysis of what payments were made to certain of the (alleged) ‘Connected Entities’ and what funds were returned to the KK Group by those entities both before and after 30 May 2007, reaching the conclusion that of the KZT 22,313,564,410 paid by Arka-Stroy to the entities concerned, KZT  3,306,690,748 was repaid to the KK Group. Mr Howe objected to Mr Twigger’s reliance on Mr Thompson’s approach, making the point that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva have not pleaded any positive case that the size of the PEAK Claim should be reduced to account for particular repayments and highlighting in this context that such a case would need to have been set out in the defence in order to enable both sides’ experts to have engaged with it fully. I have some sympathy with this objection. There is, however, a more substantive point which can be made. This is that the difficulty with the approach adopted by Mr Thompson is that it represents little more than a snapshot and says nothing about the overall accounting position between the Claimants and the ‘Connected Entities’. As Mr Howe put it, Mr Thompson has focused on a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“little slice of payments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and has not looked at the broader picture. Mr Crooks’ exercise has, in contrast, involved looking at that broader picture, albeit in order to provide him with </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“comfort”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> rather than precision. The more precise analysis performed by Mr Thompson, if it is to have any meaningful value, would need to have been performed much more widely. As Mr Howe put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“we know that quite apart from the very large number of transactions that we have considered in these proceedings and form part of the pleaded case, there were numerous other transactions taking place off stage, as it were, between the connected entities and the claimants”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Those transactions were, again as Mr Howe put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“scattered here and there, what appear to be agreements for purchases of corrugated board and other things of that nature”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In such circumstances, it is quite clear to me that the approach adopted by Mr Thompson, and relied upon so heavily by Mr Twigger when seeking to criticise Mr Crooks, is as flawed as it is unhelpful.</span>

Mr Howe labelled these each as the ‘Connected Entities’ and, as I have mentioned, the last five in particular as the ‘Kazakh LLPs’ although Mr Twigger preferred to call them the ‘Construction LLPs’. I repeat that the relevant payments which were made by Arka-Stroy comprised US$ 23 million to the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’ and US$ 36.9 million to the other (alleged) ‘Connected Entities’. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It should be noted right away that, except for Kagazy Invest, Kontakt Service Plus, Kagazy Processing, Kagazy Gofrotara, HW and TESS, all of these entities also feature in the Land Plots Claim. As for the Astana 2 Claim, the entities involved there are Holding Invest, TESS and another company, Ada Trade. The extent of the overlap is apparent from looking at Appendix 13B (in relation to the PEAK Claim) alongside the diagrammatical portrayals which Mr Crooks prepared as regards the Astana 2 Claim and the Land Plots Claim, namely Appendices 15.2A/15.3A and Appendix 14B respectively. Specifically, taking some of the examples cited by Mr Howe, it could be seen from Appendix 13B that, in relation to the PEAK Claim, Bolzhal and CBC received funds from Arka-Stroy whereas Appendix 14B shows that in relation to the Land Plots Claim these companies were two of the three entities (along with Holding Invest) which were recipients of the funds which came from KK JSC. Similarly, again in relation to the Land Plots Claim, as Appendix 14B illustrates, Biznes-Privat, TESS, Mouli-Group, Ritek and TEW received most of the sums transferred which Bolzhal and CBC had received from KK JSC, adding up to approximately US$ 37.1 million, whilst also, as Appendix 13B shows, receiving (again between them) something in the region of US$ 23 million from Arka-Stroy in relation to the PEAK Claim. Then there is Lotos which features in Appendix 13B as receiving US$ 6.6 million from Arka-Stroy in relation to the PEAK Claim and also in Appendix 14B (the Land Plots Claim) where a payment of some US$ 1.3 million from TEW (a recipient of the monies from CBC which had itself obtained them from KK JSC) can be seen albeit that the self-same day Lotos transferred the money to Biznes-Privat. Lastly, although it is worth stressing again that these are only examples, Appendix 13B (the PEAK Claim again) reveals that Trading Company received approximately US$ 4.5 million from Arka-Stroy in relation to the PEAK Fraud, together with an additional US$ 1.8 million from Holding Invest which that company had received from KK JSC. Although these are merely illustrations, they demonstrate very clearly the extent to which Appendices 13B, 14B, 15.2A and 15.3A are largely dealing with the same entities, and so that there are significant overlaps between all three of the claims which are brought in these proceedings. It is particularly striking that the entities to which Arka-Stroy paid some of the most substantial amounts of money as shown in Appendix 13B (in the context of the PEAK Claim) appear also in Appendix 14B and so in the context of the Land Plots Claim. Why this should be the case is not easy to fathom if Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva are right and Arka-Stroy was a legitimate and independent construction company. I agree with Mr Howe that this cannot have simply been a coincidence and, furthermore, that this matters because, if it was indeed not a coincidence, this provides significant support for the proposition that Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s insistence that they did not commit the frauds which are alleged by the Claimants should not be accepted. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe emphasised that Holding Invest, Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara continued throughout to be owned by Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip. This is significant, he submitted, insofar as it can be demonstrated that monies were paid to those companies after they had left the KK Group but also, he suggested, insofar as monies were paid to such companies before they left the KK Group since it does not necessarily follow that payments made before departure should be treated as what Mr Howe described as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“credit to the group”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This is because, he explained, this will depend on whether the monies left the KK Group with the company which received those monies from Arka-Stroy. If the monies did leave when they should have stayed within the KK Group, then that, Mr Howe submitted, ought not to have happened. As he put it, it is not legitimate to move monies out of subsidiaries into parent companies before then hiving off the parent companies.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It seems to me that Mr Howe was right about this. This matters because of the submissions which were made by Mr Twigger in relation to Holding Invest (and, indeed, Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Gofotara). Thus, having drawn attention to the fact that it is the Claimants’ case that Holding Invest received net payments of KZT 519 million/US$ 4 million from Arka-Stroy and that, because Holding Invest was jointly owned by Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip, they received the benefit of those payments, Mr Twigger went on to justify the payments by making a series of points. He began by acknowledging that between January 2006 and December 2008, KZT 16.65 billion was paid from Arka-Stroy to Holding Invest and KZT 16.13 billion was paid from Holding Invest to Arka-Stroy, resulting in a net amount of KZT 519,214,035 being paid from Arka-Stroy to Holding Invest. He pointed out, uncontroversially as I understand it and based on certain tables which Mr Thompson produced showing the various money transfers, that the KZT 16 billion did not derive from the KK Group but from two loans drawn down from Alliance Bank, and that that amount was repaid to Alliance Bank with interest by Holding Invest via Arka-Stroy. As to the net amount of KZT 519,214,035 which forms the basis of Claimants’ claim, Mr Twigger went on to explain that, prior to 30 May 2007, KZT 122.85 million was received by Holding Invest, and that Holding Invest paid approximately KZT 22.65 million out of that sum to KK JSC as the return of financial aid with approximately KZT 55.73 million being paid as financial aid to Kagazy Invest as the main group operating company. Accordingly, Mr Twigger submitted, approximately KZT 78.38 million was paid back to the KK Group. As to the balance, KZT 44.33 million, this was paid for utilities, construction, bank commission and interest payments. Looking at the position after 30 May 2007, Mr Twigger pointed out that, ignoring the KZT 16 billion repayment to Alliance Bank (via Arka-Stroy), around KZT 475 million was received by Holding Invest after 30 May 2007 and that out of that KZT 241 million was paid to Caspian Minerals LLP as financial aid, KZT 515,032 was paid as financial aid to KK JSC, KZT 100,000 was paid to Kagazy Invest as financial aid, and the remainder (KZT 233.21 million) was paid for utilities (and other services), rent, a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“recreational resort account”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, commissions, currency purchases and taxes. It was Mr Twigger’s submission, in these circumstances, that the only onwards payment which the Claimants could even conceivably allege had been used for the Defendants’ benefit (as opposed to the KK Group’s benefit) is the payment which was made to Caspian Minerals which Mr Arip has never disputed was owned by him jointly with Mr Zhunus. Mr Twigger observed, however, that Mr Arip had not been cross-examined about this and, furthermore, that it could not be known whether the payment involved a misappropriation without first knowing what the state of account was, at that stage, as between the Claimants and Holding Invest as at 31 May 2007. In addition, Mr Twigger suggested, it is highly unlikely that after 31 May 2007 there was complete separation between the activities of Holding Invest and the KK Group so as to mean that payments made by Holding Invest ought to be regarded as being for the benefit of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip rather than the KK Group.</span>

We purchased approximately 300 hectares of land and intended to develop it into a business and logistics park among the lines of what the KK Group was planning for Almaty. Given its high quality work on the KK Group projects, we planned to use Arka-Stroy as the general contractor for our Astana project as well.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">In order to fund this project, we sought financing from Alliance Bank, which required Arka-Stroy to produce in advance detailed technical documentation to support the proposed budget. Based in large part upon the information produced by Arka-Stroy, Alliance Bank agreed to loan KZT  6 billion (approximately US$ 46.5 million) to fund this project, which Holding Invest LLP drew down and transferred to an account of Arka-Stroy about 29 June 2007. I note that it was necessary for Holding Invest LLP to immediately draw down the entire amount of the loan in order to ensure that these proceeds would be available for the project. Due to the immaturity of the Kazakh banking sector and the relative instability of the banks, a guarantee that the funds will be made available in future would not have been sufficient.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">After drawing down the Alliance Bank loan, it became clear that the estimated budget of KZT  6 billion would not be sufficient to complete the project. Alliance Bank indicated that in order to obtain further financing we would have to return the current loan and reapply for a new loan, with revised technical documentation supporting any newly proposed budget. Accordingly, Arka-Stroy transferred the original loan amount of KZT  6 billion back to Holding Invest LLP (plus interest), and Holding Invest LLP then returned those funds to Alliance Bank. Alliance Bank also required that we pay a variety of fees, fines and costs related to the issuance of the loan and its early repayment. Because we believed that Arka-Stroy was responsible for failing to correctly estimate the cost of the project, we insisted that it ultimately bear all costs of the loan repayment and other losses we incurred as a result of the project being put on hold, and it did so by transferring funds to Holding Invest LLP and Kagazy Invest LLP during the following months.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">In September 2007, we submitted a revised loan proposal for the project based upon the technical documentation produced by Arka-Stroy, and we were able to secure from Alliance Bank a KZT  10 billion loan (approximately $77.4 million), which Holding Invest LLP drew down and transferred to an account of Arka-Stroy that it could only access as and when approved by Alliance Bank. However, the project was delayed as a result of Arka-Stroy’s failure to obtain certain government approvals for the initial phases of the project. In addition, due to the brewing financial crisis, Alliance Bank advised us that it intended to unilaterally increase the interest rate under the loan (as it was contractually entitled to do), which would cause a substantial increase in the overall or cost of the project. In light of these problems, as well as other factors, including growing concern over the increasingly difficult economic environment generally, we ultimately decided to cancel the project. We therefore retrieved the KZT  10 billion from Arka-Stroy (with interest), and transferred it back to the bank on about 10 October 2007. As before, Alliance Bank demanded that we pay substantial fees, fines and costs in connection with this transaction. We again took the position that it was Arka-Stroy’s responsibility to pay these amounts and other related losses that we sustained. Arka-Stroy initially objected to this but eventually agreed to make a series of payments to compensate us.</span>

However, it is striking that an explanation has been given by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva which found no mention in Mr Twigger’s closing submissions. I am quite clear why that was the case. It was because Mr Twigger appreciated that the explanation was unsustainable since, when asked about the matter in cross-examination, Mr Arip struggled to give an adequate explanation. It is quite clear that what Mr Arip described in relation to the construction project was made up. Not only is there not a single document to support his evidence that there was such a project, but I agree also with Mr Howe that it is inconceivable that such very large sums would have been drawn down only for Arka-Stroy and Holding Invest to supposedly realise within days that the project had to be abandoned because it was not ready to proceed. I agree also that, as Mr Howe put it, it is stretching credulity well beyond breaking point to suggest that this happened not just once, but twice, within a short space of time. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that in his closing submissions Mr Twigger felt obliged to ignore Mr Arip’s explanation concerning the net balance paid to Holding Invest by Arka-Stroy in the sum of KZT 519,214,035 and instead sought to focus on an analysis of the various payments which passed between Arka-Stroy and Holding Invest which took no account of Mr Arip’s explanation.  </span>

Mr Twigger’s submission was that, whilst it is correct that Kagazy Invest received a net payment of KZT 710,407,631 from Arka-Stroy between May 2006 and November 2008, there was no misappropriation since, as far as the Defendants were concerned, Kagazy Invest had received this amount from Arka-Stroy because Arka-Stroy had itself received a similar amount of money from Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara in 2005 and the KZT  710.4 million represented repayment of the amounts due from Arka-Stroy to Kagazy Processing/Gofrotara together with repayment of sums due from Kagazy Processing/Gofrotara to Kagazy Invest.

Anyway, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara used the advance payments that it received back from Arka-Stroy to pay to Kagazy Recycling LLP (‘Kagazy Recycling’) and to repay their loans to Alliance Bank and Kazkommertsbank.

These net amounts roughly correspond to the KZT 710,407,632 paid to Kagazy Invest as return of financial assistance that Kagazy Invest provided to Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara at an earlier time.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I agree with Mr Howe that Ms Dikhanbayeva’s explanation makes little sense not least because, as was put to Ms Dikhanbayeva in cross-examination, if what was happening in relation to the KZT 710.4 million paid to Kagazy Invest really did entail repayment of a debt due to it from Kagazy Processing/Gofrotara as she maintained, then, it is odd that the amount paid did not match the sum which was owed to Kagazy Invest by Kagazy Processing/Gofrotara. Ms Dikhanbayeva’s explanation was that there were other transactions between the three KK Group companies which had to be taken into account but which would not be apparent only from a review of the 1C databases. Mr Twigger submitted that that explanation was credible and should, in the absence of contradictory evidence, be accepted. I do not agree, however. Ms Dikhanbayeva was a witness who was prepared to give evidence which was untrue. I see no reason, in such circumstances, to give her the benefit of the doubt on this issue. The more so, since Mr Howe was right to observe that the explanation given both by her and by Mr Arip bears little resemblance to the pattern of transactions described in Mr Thompson’s tables. Indeed, and despite also Mr Twigger’s attempt to justify what Ms Dikhanbayeva had to say in answer to Mr Howe’s questions on this issue, this is a point which Mr Thompson himself acknowledged after he had been asked by Mr Howe in cross-examination to read what Ms Dikhanbayeva had had to say by way of explanation in her sixth and eighth witness statements.

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in rejecting the evidence which was given by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva on this point. This was untruthful evidence which necessarily made it very difficult for Mr Twigger to meet the case advanced by Mr Howe. Mr Twigger nonetheless made a number of other points. He submitted, for example, that Mr Thompson’s analysis showed that KZT 99.047 million of the KZT 710.4 million was used for operating expenses and that this was mainly before 31 May 2007, although the fact that payments for operating expenses continued beyond 30 May 2007 is, Mr Twigger suggested, inconsistent with the payments being misappropriations since payment of operating expenses by Kagazy Invest in the aftermath of the restructuring and IPO must have been of benefit to the KK Group. He highlighted also how KZT 119.111 million was used to purchase land from an unconnected company (Kaisar LLC) in February 2007, with nothing to suggest that this payment was not for the benefit of the KK Group, and how Kagazy Invest paid KZT 31,315,789 to KK JSC between February and October 2007 and KZT 13,368,000 to Kagazy Recycling in November 2008.  He also drew attention to the fact that, while Kagazy Invest paid a total of KZT 469.956 million as financial aid to among others KK JSC, Holding Invest and Kagazy Processing, the payments made to Holding Invest and Kagazy Processing after 30 May 2007 only amounted to approximately KZT 35.835 million. He, lastly, observed that, whilst of the sums paid from Arka-Stroy to the (alleged) ‘Connected Entities’ KZT 451,009,772 was paid to Kagazy Invest via Kagazy Processing, Holding Invest and Kontakt Service Plus, that sum was paid over prior to 31 May 2007, with only KZT 100,000 being paid to Kagazy Invest by those entities after 31 May 2007. For reasons previously given, however, specifically given the exercise carried out by Mr Crooks, this is not an answer to the claim. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">In any event, the answer to all of these points is that, looking at Mr Thompson’s tables, it is clear that a net amount of some KZT 990 million was paid by Arka-Stroy to Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara after 31 May 2007. Specifically, table 8 of Appendix 7, which sets out overall details of payments, gives a cumulative total as at 7 May 2007 (the last entry before 31 May 2007) which identifies a net cumulative total paid by Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara of KZT 315,706,074.43. After taking account of ‘financial assistance’ provided by Arka-Stroy as at 22 May 2007 (the last entry before 31 May 2007) amounting to KZT 568,301,583.48, Mr Thompson confirmed to Mr Howe that Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara are to be regarded as having received a net payment of the difference between these two sums, namely KZT 252,595 million. As at 28 November 2008 (the last date in the table) the equivalent figure for the KZT 315,706,074.43 becomes KZT 533,769,403.29, meaning that between the end of May 2007 and the end of November 2008 Arka-Stroy paid Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara KZT 849,475 million. As for ‘financial assistance’, the KZT 568,301,583.48 becomes KZT 710,407,631.86 as at 23 July 2009 (the last date given), meaning there had between the end of May 2007 and the end of July 2009 been an additional KZT 142 million or so provided by Arka-Stroy to Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara. This means, in turn, as Mr Thompson agreed, that between those two dates Arka-Stroy had paid Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara a total of approximately KZT 990 million. In short, there seems little doubt that Mr Twigger’s submission that the bulk of the payments came before 31 May 2007 simply cannot be right. This makes Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s position in relation to Kagazy Invest, Kagazy Processing and Kagazy Gofrotara untenable.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“both owned by nominees”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although she did not say for whom they were nominees, as I have previously mentioned when addressing Ms Dikhanbayeva’s qualities as a witness, she did nonetheless state that CBC’s nominee was her then husband, Mr Esperov, and that Mr Shabadanov, a relative of Mr Esperov, acted as Bolzhal’s nominee. She went on to explain that, as she put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“for the purposes of the land plots transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, these two companies were</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “managed by the real estate brokers who took care of those transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, whereas </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“…for the purposes of the acquisition of the assets of Exillon in October to December 2008”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, they were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“managed by [her] on the instructions of Mr Arip”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. She added that in July 2009 she became the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“legal owner”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of the companies and that she remained this until December 2009, when she sold them.  During this period, she added, Bolzhal had a bank account at Eurasian Bank which was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“managed by accountants who took care of running the companies”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe observed during the course of closing that this was a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“classic example of the defendants together concocting a story to explain the emerging evidence in relation to the ownership”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of Bolzhal and CBC. I agree. I agree also with his assessment that, in so doing, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbateva have ended up </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in the completely implausible position”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that Ms Dikhanbayeva was managing Bolzhal and CBC for Mr Arip, who ultimately was obliged to admit that they were indirectly owned and controlled by him, but not for the purposes of the land plot transactions in relation to which Bolzhal and CBC are, according to Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva, to be regarded as having been beneficially owned or managed on behalf of KK JSC. This is an impossible scenario. It cannot really have been the case that Bolzhal and CBC could have ended up in a situation where they were simultaneously owned and controlled both by KK JSC (through the land brokers) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">and</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> by Mr Arip (through Ms Dikhanbayeva). In circumstances where, even on Ms Dikhanbayeva’s account, Mr Esperov and Mr Shabadanov were at all material times (including during the period of the land plot purchases) the nominal shareholders and directors of CBC and Bolzhal respectively, it is an irresistible inference that, throughout, these people looked to Ms Dikhanbayeva and Mr Arip, and nobody else, to be told what to do. As I have previously observed, the notion that Ms Dikhanbayeva could control those companies for some purposes but not for the purposes of the land plots transactions is fanciful. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The more so, given that Ms Dikhanbayeva also accepted that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">she</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> controlled Bolzhal and CBC for the purposes of acquiring the Exillon assets from around October 2008. Ms Dikhanbayeva’s suggestion that by the time that Bolzhal and CBC started to become involved in the Exillon transaction, in October 2008, those companies had served their purpose in relation to the land plots, was quite obviously a lie designed, as Mr Howe put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to produce a discontinuity in the time”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> despite the fact that there are a number of documents demonstrating that the land plots transactions between KK JSC and Bolzhal and CBC were still ongoing during the time when Ms Dikhanbayeva had taken over control of CBC and Bolzhal. These include master agreements for the sale and purchase of the land which were concluded on 23 January 2009 and which I have previously mentioned. There are also, again as I have previously mentioned, minutes of a KK JSC board meeting on 23 January 2009 approving the entry into these contracts. There is, additionally, a similar agreement entered into between Bolzhal and KK JSC on 23 February 2009 in respect of a sixth land plot. Ms Dikhanbayeva’s suggestion that these documents were concerned simply with “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">registration</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” was clearly something which she made up since the documents very plainly were dealing with land plot acquisition and not merely matters of registration which were being dealt with post-acquisition. Nor does the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“registration”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> explanation sit at all happily with the fact that Ms Dikhanbayeva herself accepted in the course of cross-examination that by January 2009 the price to be paid for the land plots had not been finalised. Given that the prices had still not been finalised in the early part of 2009, it is impossible to see how it can really have been the case that the land plots had already been acquired before that time. In fact, the position is even more stark as the prices were not finalised until rather later on in 2009 since, although Ms Dikhanbayeva’s evidence was that the prices were finalised in various supplemental agreements entered into on 7 April 2009, those agreements were actually drawn up in September 2009 and backdated in order to explain why so much more money had been paid to Bolzhal than had been specified in the purchase agreements which were then in place. Ms Dikhanbayeva accepted that this was the case, in her eighth witness statement which she made shortly before trial, explaining that she had looked at the agreements and noted that they bore a land registration stamp dated 11 September 2009. What she did not go on to explain was that the backdating was carried out on her instructions, specifically as a result of the email which she sent on 27 August 2009 which began with the words </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If the auditors are raising questions, the following will need to be done”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and then referred at point 2 to it being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“necessary to increase the value of the land plots”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I have previously explained that this email entailed Ms Dikhanbayeva giving instructions to create false documentation. That plainly was the case. The fact that Ms Dikhanbayeva should nonetheless deny that this was the case serves merely to underline that her evidence concerning the extent to which she and Mr Arip controlled Bolzhal and CBC consisted very largely of invention. The reality is that the 27 August 2009 email completely undoes the version of events described by Ms Dikhanbayeva. I am quite sure, taking account of all the evidence, that at all material times Bolzhal and CBC were owned and controlled by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva.     </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Coming on to deal with Lotos, the Claimants’ case is that this company was paid a total net sum of KZT 852.9 million/US$ 6.6 million. As to this, although Mr Twigger pointed out that Mr Thompson had only been able to reconcile receipts amounting to KZT 384,816,151 in Lotos’ bank statements, he did find Arka-Stroy’s bank statements show a net payment of KZT 852,911,541 to Lotos with the payments being made between May 2006 and August 2007. Mr Thompson’s tables show that approximately KZT 350 million was paid by Lotos to Holding Invest, Kagazy Processing (before May 2007 and when they were part of the KK Group) and KK JSC with further payments amounting to KZT 226,221,775 also being made to KK JSC between May 2007 and September 2008 apparently in respect of the supply of paper. It was Mr Twigger’s submission that, in the circumstances, since there was nothing to indicate that Lotos was involved in any misappropriation from the KK Group, the case advanced by the Claimants that Lotos was controlled by Mr Arip is </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“of little significance”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I do not agree for reasons previously given, specifically in view of the exercise performed by Mr Crooks. Furthermore, the significance is quite clear: as I have previously mentioned, in his fourteenth witness statement in September 2016, Mr Arip denied that he owned or had any interest in Lotos and stated that he did not know if it was a company which was owned by Mr Esimbekov, yet when Mr Howe put to him in cross-examination that documentation exists where Mr Esimbekov is described as acting on behalf of Lotos, specifically a contract dated 29 December 2006 under which Lotos sold certain land at the Aksenger site to KK JSC, Mr Arip’s response was that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Lotos was his business”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, so making it abundantly clear that Mr Arip knew full well that Mr Esimbekov was involved with Lotos. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Leaving aside the fact that it is the Claimants’ position that Lotos was not, in truth, Mr Esimbekov’s company (as opposed to Mr Arip’s company), it is striking that Mr Arip should have stated what he did in his witness statement only then to give the evidence which he did when first asked about Lotos by Mr Howe in cross-examination. This was another area where he claimed simply to have made a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“mistake” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">but I do not accept that this was the case at all. On the contrary, it is quite obvious that Mr Arip decided in his witness statement to give the impression that he knew nothing when that was not the position. He then clearly recognised when being asked about Mr Esimbekov in cross-examination that he could no longer maintain that he knew nothing and had to admit to knowing something. There was no mistake here. Indeed, it is significant that the following day, when Mr Arip was shown the relevant sale contract dated 29 December 2006, he accepted that, in buying the land, Lotos was acting as KK JSC’s nominee, explaining that Lotos (Mr Arip actually used the word </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“he”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> referring to Mr Esimbekov) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“bought and sold at the same time, basically”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Again, it is most odd that Mr Arip should have such a level of recall having declared in his witness statement that, in effect, he knew nothing. The exchange which followed is also illuminating:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger suggested that the mere fact that Lotos (and Mr Esimbekov) acted in a nominee capacity on one occasion does not justify a conclusion that this was the position more generally. This submission would have more resonance, however, were it not for the fact that this evidence did not stand alone but needs to be considered alongside other evidence which, in truth, points compellingly to the conclusion that Lotos was a company which was owned and controlled by Mr Arip. Taken together with Mr Arip’s pre-trial insistence that he knew nothing about Mr Esimbekov owning or controlling Lotos, evidence which Mr Arip must have known was simply not true, the proposition that Lotos was, as Mr Arip insisted, Mr Esimbekov’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“own business” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">is simply not sustainable. It should not be forgotten in this context that Mr Arip and Mr Esimbekov (and Ms Dikhanbayeva) worked together at KazTransCom before joining the KK Group. They knew each other well. Mr Esimbekov was also somebody who at various times served as the General Director of PEAK, the President of Astana-Contract and the owner of Trading Company. He was also, as I have explained when dealing with the position of Arka-Stroy, the owner and director of that company. There is, in addition, the note which Mr Esimbekov sent to Mr Tulegenov on 24 November 2010 and to which I have previously referred. In that note, it will be recalled, Mr Esimbekov described how </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“several companies were registered in my name, as a legal owner, and I was registered as a director in a few other companies”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and how the</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “nature of these transactions may be deemed ‘dubious’ and not entirely legal”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This is all evidence which wholly undermines Mr Arip’s insistence that Lotos was simply Mr Esimbekov’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“own business”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. So, too, does an email which Mr Esimbekov sent to a lawyer at KK JSC on 28 November 2008, in response to a request for information concerning Lotos’ involvement in the sale of the land to KK JSC to which the contract dated 29 December 2006 related. Mr Esimbekov responded by saying that he remembered </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“nothing on this subject; my role in this matter was only to have the papers signed by the notary”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In the circumstances, it seems somewhat unlikely that Mr Esimbekov </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“just came up with the idea that he could use Lotos”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> as Mr Arip described it when asked by Mr Howe. In both this email and his note to Mr Tulegenov, Mr Esimbekov was describing a role which is simply impossible to square with Mr Arip’s description of him as the independent owner of an independent company. Clearly he was nothing of the sort, and nor was Lotos. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This was unconvincing evidence. So, too, was the evidence which Ms Dikhanbayeva gave when Mr Howe showed her an email which her sister, Nazym Dikhanbayeva, described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Internal Auditor of JSC Kazakhstan Kagazy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, sent to Mr Nikolay Dolmatov, KK JSC’s Administrative Director, on 18 January 2011. In that email, Ms Dikhanbayeva’s sister asked,</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Could you please assign a specialist to prepare draft documents for the replacement of the Director of Lotos LLP effective from 05.01.2011?”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe asked why, if Lotos was independent of the KK Group, such a request would have been made. Although by this stage Ms Dikhanbayeva was herself no longer in Kazakhstan and so would not have been involved with this specific request, it is instructive to note her answer:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Well, firstly, I would like to say that I didn’t say that my sister was involved with Lotos. I don’t own Lotos, so it is owned by Mr Yesimbekov. How did this email come to life? I can just assume. I don’t know why it says what it says, but I can tell you that in 2010 - at the end of 2010, she was asked to leave the company. And that’s around January 2011, about the date of this email, she was no longer visiting the office of Kazakhstan Kagazy. Maybe Bek Yesimbekov asked her, maybe someone else. During this litigation I never asked my sister - sorry, I asked my sister why she wrote this email and what she asked about. She said she didn’t remember. Maybe someone had asked her, was her assumption. So I don’t have an explanation here. My assumption is Bek had asked her, but again, she had left by January she was no longer involved with Kagazy, because she had been asked to leave.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It can be seen from this answer that Ms Dikhanbayeva began with a denial that she or Mr Arip owned Lotos and then questioned the authenticity of the email, before only then answering Mr Howe’s question by not altogether unreasonably explaining that she could only assume what lay behind the request. Interestingly, however, she asserted that she had not asked her sister about the email, before immediately contradicting herself and saying that she had done so and had been told by her sister that she could not remember. The truth is, however, that Ms Dikhanbayeva had no answer other than a bare denial to Mr Howe’s point, which was that an email of this sort could not conceivably have been sent unless Lotos was a member of the KK Group. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Nor could Ms Dikhanbayeva have sent the emails which she did on 26 and 27 August 2009 in which she essentially shuffled around various financial obligations between members of the KK Group, including Lotos, if Lotos and the other companies mentioned were not companies which were under Mr Arip’s (and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s) control. It will be recalled, in particular, that in her message on 27 August 2009 she referred to Lotos and stated this: </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“226,877,094 to be written off as bad debts as of August”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is perfectly apparent that Ms Dikhanbayeva had complete control over Lotos in the same way as she did in relation to all of the other companies in the KK Group. As I have previously mentioned, her explanation when asked about this by Mr Howe in cross-examination, was that she was simply assisting accounting employees of the KK Group who were going through the six-month audit for the first time without her. I reject that evidence which does not even begin to explain why Ms Dikhanbayeva felt able to make decisions concerning supposedly independent companies such as Lotos. In much the same way, Ms Dikhanbayeva had no answer to a document which Mr Howe showed her in native format on the computer screen which showed daily balances in the period between 5 January 2009 and 9 October 2009 for a number of companies including Kontakt Service Plus, Arka-Stroy, HW, TEW, Trading Company and Bolzhal as well as Lotos. Mr Howe put it to Ms Dikhanbayeva that somebody within the KK Group was monitoring the daily balances of the companies concerned and that this can only have been because those companies were all members of the KK Group. Ms Dikhanbayeva’s response was obtuse to say the least. She maintained that she did </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not know who kept this document”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that she</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “did not request for this document to be kept”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. She added that by 9 October 2009 she was no longer with the KK Group but had no answer to Mr Howe’s point that she had been there for the bulk of the relevant period covered by the monitoring document starting in January that year. Again, this was distinctly unimpressive evidence in which, quite clearly, Ms Dikhanbayeva was determined to avoid having to give an honest answer to Mr Howe’s perfectly reasonable questions.    </span>

Mr Twigger submitted that no account has been taken by the Claimants of the fact (accepted by Mr Crooks) that they received directly from Kontakt Service Plus a greater net sum, US$ 703,104. For reasons previously given, however, this is not an answer to the claim. As Mr Twigger rightly reminded me, Kontakt Service Plus was disclosed in the IPO prospectus as a related party. This was on the basis that 90% of its shares were owned by Mr Yuri Bogday, who was one of the senior managers of the KK Group and Mr Zhunus’ brother-in-law. Furthermore, the prospectus suggests that Kontakt Service Plus was a company with a real business involved with the purchase of corrugated products in 2005 (as well as the provision of production equipment to the KK Group). Mr Twigger submitted that, in the circumstances, there was no reason to suppose that this company was owned or controlled by Mr Arip. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In cross-examination, Mr Arip, indeed, maintained his denial that he ever owned or had any interest in Kontakt Service Plus, making it clear that what he had to say concerning the company being owned (strictly speaking, majority-owned) by Yuri Bogday and trading with the KK Group was based not on what he knew at the time but on what he had learned from looking at the documents disclosed in these proceedings. Ultimately, however, it seems to me that similar considerations apply to Kontakt Service Plus as apply to Lotos. In particular, I struggle to see why it would be that the daily balance records for the period from January to October 2009 to which I have just referred in the context of Lotos should include entries for Kontakt Service Plus also unless that company (like Lotos and the others) were treated as part of the KK Group. It is right to acknowledge that, when he was shown this document by Mr Howe, Mr Arip denied all knowledge of what the Finance Department might have been doing, suggesting that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“maybe Shynar could have some better recollections”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. However, in the absence of an explanation as to why Kontakt Service Plus appears alongside other KK Group companies in the daily balance records, it would be wrong, in my view, to take Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s denials at face value, especially given that in other respects their evidence has been demonstrated to be quite obviously dishonest. When, indeed, Ms Dikhanbayeva was taken by Mr Howe to an email from Ms Lyazzat Zhambuzova to Mr Nazgul Sayasatova sent on 26 March 2009 and headed </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“KK Group legal entities monitoring”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, she again had no answer to the fact that amongst the companies listed was Kontakt Service Plus. The best that she could come up with was the rather desperate explanation that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I bear in mind in this context that, as I have previously explained, Ms Dikhanbayeva was asked by Mr Howe about letters which Ms Kogutyuk sent to Alliance Bank on 15 February 2006, in which requests were made to install “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">” for a number of companies in the KK Group. Those letters included also a reference to Kontakt Service Plus, making it perfectly obvious that (despite Ms Dikhanbayeva’s insistence to the contrary and suggestion that the letters were “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">simply impossible</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”) Kontakt Service Plus was, indeed, regarded internally as a member of the KK Group. It should also not be overlooked that there is other documentation which strongly supports the conclusion that Kontakt Service Plus was part of the KK Group. An example is an email which was sent on 12 December 2008 from Ms Zhambuzova to Mr Dolmatov in response to an email from Mr Dolmatov attaching draft employment agreements for various entities including Lotos, Trading Company and Kontakt Service Plus. Ms Dikhanbayeva explained that she had nothing to do with this, but the fact remains that this is evidence which is at odds with the evidence which she and Mr Arip gave on the topic of Kontakt Service Plus and, as such, is not easily disregarded.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The Claimants’ case is that Arka-Stroy paid TEW the total net sum of KZT 389 million/US$ 3 million. Mr Thompson has confirmed that TEW did, indeed, receive a total net payment from Arka-Stroy of KZT  388,978,960, consisting of four payments between February and May 2006. Each of the payments related to a contract dated 10 October 2005: the first payment was a refund of a prepayment whilst the others were payments for construction materials. Mr Twigger’s submission was that the use to which TEW put the funds shows no misappropriation whatsoever. Specifically, although for reasons which I have previously explained, in my view, nothing turns on this, Mr Twigger drew attention to the fact that insofar as recipients of the funds have been identified: in February 2006, it paid Peak Akzhal KZT 201 million in respect of corrugated cardboard and thus the monies were received by the KK Group; on 20 April 2006, it paid KZT 54 million and on 16 May 2006 it paid KZT 36 million to TalkRock for construction materials; in early May 2006, it paid a modest KZT 156,000 to Kontakt Service Plus for materials; and also in early May 2006, it paid KZT 10,125,273 to Ideal Ltd for materials. The only material difference with Mr Thompson identified in Mr Crooks’ report, Mr Twigger explained, is that, whereas Mr Thompson identified a payment to Ideal on 4 May 2006 of KZT 10,125,273 and a separate payment on the same date to an unknown recipient of KZT 88,694686 (amounting together to KZT 98,891,959), Mr Crooks identified two exact match payments from TEW to Bravo Trading amounting to KZT 98 million. This does not matter, however, since Mr Crooks has found that the KZT 98 million was paid from Bravo Trading to Peak Akzhal, meaning that it is common ground that, out of the US$ 3 million which was paid to TEW, US$ 2.4 million was paid back to Peak Akzhal. In addition, it is common ground also that the KK Group received US$ 4,311,938 more from TEW than it paid out, with the principal beneficiary being Peak Akzhal in the amount of US$ 4,067,725.</span>

Indeed, it is interesting that, despite in her sixth witness statement, stating that she did not know who owned or managed TEW, by the time that she came to give her evidence Ms Dikhanbayeva was in a position to make a correction to what she had stated, explaining that she had </span>

Although Ms Dikhanbayeva did not herself make the point, at least not expressly, Mr Twigger submitted that this would explain why it was that TEW was treated as an affiliated entity in the 29 December 2006 board minutes. Indeed, it may be that Mr Howe understood Ms Dikhanbayeva to be making the same point because he suggested to her that she was </span>

Having seen Mr Arip struggle somewhat to explain away the board minutes, particularly the reference to him not voting, I am quite clear that Ms Dikhanbayeva decided to take it upon herself to think up another explanation. This required her to modify the evidence which she had set out in her witness statement, hence the correction which she made during examination-in-chief. This was both devious and cynical.</span>

Mr Thompson has confirmed that HW was, indeed, paid a total net sum of KZT 95,115,000 by Arka-Stroy, with a KZT 95 million payment in January 2006 being followed by three small payments in March 2006, June and July 2007. Mr Twigger highlighted that HW used the KZT 95 million to pay Cariar LLP in respect of construction materials pursuant to an agreement dated 19 January 2006, suggesting that since there is nothing to indicate that Cariar LLP is connected to the Defendants, there can be no question of misappropriation. Again, this is a matter which is addressed by my earlier conclusion as to the appropriate approach to adopt in this case.

In particular, the board minutes dated 29 December 2006 went on after referring to the Deed of Assignment of Receivables in relation to TEW to refer to a further such deed </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“for the amount of 183,646,033.54 … tenge 54 tiyns concluded between Kazakhstan Kagazy JSC, Kagazy Trading LLP and HW&amp; LTD LLP”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The decision part of the minutes then included a further paragraph reflecting approval of what was proposed in relation to HW. Furthermore, like TEW, HW had as its CEO the seemingly omnipresent Mr Zhekebatryov and was another of the companies in relation to which Ms Yelgeldieva sought second signature rights on 15 February 2006. HW also featured in the daily cash balances records to which Mr Howe took both Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva in cross-examination. As to Mr Zhekebatyrov in particular and picking up on a point which I have previously made concerning the email which Ms Dikhanbayeva sent to Ms Kogutyuk on 5 January 2007 in which she asked that certain</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “claim assignment agreements dated December 29, 2006”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> be prepared, besides the fact that Ms Dikhanbayeva apparently was able to give such instructions without there having been any discussions with the (allegedly) non-KK Group companies which were to be named in the various assignment agreements, it is striking that it was Ms Dikhanbayeva’s evidence, both before trial and at trial, that she had no knowledge that Mr Zhekebatryov was involved with HW at all. She explained, in particular, when shown by Mr Howe a draft assignment agreement dated 29 December 2006 between HW and Holding Invest that she was unable to say why Mr Zhekebatyrov’s name should appear (as it did) on the draft described as HW’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Director”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> because she was </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Given her longstanding working relationship with Mr Zhekebatyrov, this was somewhat surprising evidence to put things mildly. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As for Trading Company, the Claimants’ case is that Arka-Stroy paid Trading Company the total net sum of KZT 579.8 million/US$ 4.5 million and there is no issue that this did, indeed, happen since Mr Thompson has confirmed that Trading Company received a total net sum from Arka-Stroy of KZT 579,823,721, with the large majority of payments being made between May 2006 and August 2007 and one payment of KZT 50.397 million made in November 2008. Mr Twigger explained, based on Mr Thompson’s analysis, that of the KZT 579,823,721 paid to it, Trading Company paid KZT 323,976,276 to KK JSC, a further KZT 31.2 million to Kagazy Recycling in May 2007 and KZT 205.850 million to Holding Invest in May 2006. The small residual balance was spent on bank charges, tax and miscellaneous expenses. Mr Twigger added that, using his ‘exact match’ methodology, Mr Crooks has identified the payments to Holding Invest, KK JSC and Kagazy Recycling but as to KK JSC has only identified a smaller amount (KZT 50.4 million) due to the fact that he only took into account onward transactions which precisely match the amounts paid by Arka-Stroy. According to Mr Thompson, the KZT 323,976,276 was paid to KK JSC from the sums paid to Trading Company by Arka-Stroy because 12 of the payments from Trading Company to KK JSC were made on the same day as sums were received from Arka-Stroy (10 receipts) and in similar amounts. Mr Twigger submitted that the timing and amount of these payments is highly relevant in any consideration of the question whether Trading Company was used by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva to misappropriate monies from the KK Group. So, Mr Twigger went on to submit, Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s alleged links to, and control of, Trading Company are of only </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“marginal importance in circumstances where it can be shown that the monies paid to Trading Company by Arka-Stroy were not used for D2/3’s benefit, as alleged, but rather for the corporate purposes of Cs/the KK Group”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Again, however, for reasons which I have explained, I am not persuaded by this submission since it ignores what might be described as the overall ‘balance of account’.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Debtor”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> in relation to a debt in the sum of KZT 340,461,627.50 seemingly owed to Trade House (Peak Akzhal) which under the agreement was assigning that debt to Arka-Stroy. His answer was that Trading Company “</span>

Mr Howe queried with Mr Arip how, in the circumstances, he could have stated what he did in his witness statement concerning his lack of knowledge of Trading Company’s previous activities given that he was apparently able to explain the debt assignment agreement which he had been shown and which was entered into in late 2006. Mr Arip was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation, insisting that it was only as a result of these proceedings that he learned what Trading Company had previously done.

As Mr Arip himself pointed out when Mr Howe asked him why Mr Nazarov, a KK Group employee, was entering into such a contract with Trading Company, this was prior to the transfer of the company to his mother-in-law and so at a time when Trading Company’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Sole Member”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was Mr Esimbekov, whose name appeared at the end of the agreement. Although Mr Arip denied the suggestion, it is clear to me that the reason why Mr Nazarov was being appointed to this position is because Trading Company was one of his companies. Indeed, it is interesting that only about a month later, on 14 May 2008, Mr Nazarov entered into a similar contract under which he was appointed CEO of Lotos also, again with Mr Esimbekov identified as the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Sole Member” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">of that company in the signature section. Mr Howe described Mr Nazarov as being </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Arip denied that that was the case, but I am clear that it was. It is, furthermore, worth mentioning in this context that, very shortly before trial, Ms Dikhanbayeva had referred in her eighth witness statement to her having recalled, apparently prompted by something which Mr Crooks had to say in one of his expert reports, that she had had a conversation with Ms Kogutyuk </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“sometime in 2008”</span>

Thus, Trading Company was not always involved in the medical services business.

	      <span style="color:#000000">I am fortified in the conclusion which I have reached in this regard by other documents which Mr Howe showed to Mr Arip, including a financial assistance agreement dated 25 November 2008 entered into between Arka-Stroy and Trading Company, under which Arka-Stroy agreed to give unlimited financial assistance to Trading Company. Mr Howe asked Mr Arip why a supposedly independent contractor such as Arka-Stroy would have been providing such assistance to Trading Company, a company which was concerned with the setting up of a medical centre on a not-for-profit basis. Again, Mr Arip was simply unable to answer Mr Howe’s question in any coherent fashion. The best that he could do was to query whether any financial assistance was, in the event, given. That, however, was no answer since Mr Howe’s question understandably had as its focus why such an agreement would have been entered into at all. Similar considerations apply to various other agreements (in draft form) to which Mr Arip was taken by Mr Howe, such as an </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Agreement on mutual settlement of accounts”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> dated 30 March 2009 between Kagazy Invest and Trading Company. Mr Arip pointed out that the relevant transaction did not happen </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“because everything that has happened with Kagazy Invest or Trading Company is completely known to you because of the expert evidence”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, suggesting also that</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. However, it is the fact that such agreements were drafted at all, whether they were executed or acted upon or not, which is important in the present context.

The companies concerned and the amounts which it is common ground were received are: Ritek - KZT 131,172,593/US$ 1.02 million; Mouli - KZT 1,043,057,706/US$ 8.08 million; Biznes-Privat - KZT 564,577,617/US$ 4.37 million;  TESS -  KZT 468,000,000/US$ 3.62 million; and Bedel Stroy - KZT 766,706,126/US$ 5.94 million. Again, Mr Twigger sought to highlight that the KK Group was a net beneficiary of direct payments made to it by each of the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’ (with the exception of TESS), referring to Mr Crooks having found that the KK Group was a net beneficiary of US$ 598,575 from Biznes-Privat, US$ 217,228 from Mouli, US$ 1,067,357 from Ritek and US$ 2,614,951 from Bedel-Stroy, adding up to US$ 4,498,111 in total.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger furthermore relied upon Mr Thompson’s findings that the relevant payment narratives relating to the total of KZT 2,206,807,916 which was paid by Arka-Stroy to Ritek, Mouli, Biznes-Privat and TESS are consistent with the payments being made for construction work pursuant to agreements concluded in 2007 and early 2008. In addition, Mr Twigger pointed out, Mr Jumadilov’s evidence in his witness statement was that these four companies were all involved in the construction/distribution business and had significant cash turnover. As I have explained, however, I did not regard Mr Jumadilov as a satisfactory witness and so place little weight on what he had to say. Nor do I feel able to place a great deal of weight on the fact that Ms Dikhanbayeva referred in cross-examination to having located the director of Biznes-Privat, a Mr Dorbabaev, who had confirmed that the company was involved in the construction business but that he had declined to be a witness. Although it does, indeed, appear that Ms Dikhanbayeva met Mr Dorbabaev and so apparently did Cleary Gottlieb, the fact is that he did not come and give evidence and, in such circumstances, I am sceptical about what Ms Dikhanbayeva had to say she was told by him. The fact that Cleary Gottlieb have disclosed certain tax returns concerning Biznes-Privat which Mr Dorbabaev provided to them in February 2017 and that they show a turnover of over KZT 3.407 billion in 2007 does not greatly assist me either. It may be that this is inconsistent with the Claimants’ case that the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’ were simply </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“shell companies”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> under the control of Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva but it is hardly conclusive of the position. It is a matter to weigh in the balance along with other evidence, but no more than that. Moreover, as Mr Howe pointed out, subsequent tax returns obtained in relation to a number of the (alleged) ‘Connected Entities’ (including Biznes-Privat but also Mouli, another of the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’) reveal incomes of either nothing at all or virtually nothing, so making it improbable that, whatever the tax position as regards Biznes-Privat may have been in 2007, the company was, indeed, a substantial construction business since a substantial construction business would hardly be likely so quickly to end up apparently doing nothing at all.</span>

I do not agree with him about this. Specifically, as Mr Howe pointed out, there are a number of draft agreements concerning the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’ which, if Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva are to be believed, had nothing to do with the KK Group and so had no business being on the KK Group’s computer systems which is where nonetheless they have been found. Examples include template agreements between Lotos (represented by Mr Esimbekov) and Biznes-Privat (represented by Mr Dorbabaev) dated 12 and 20 March 2006 respectively. When Mr Howe asked her about these documents, Ms Dikhanbayeva claimed ignorance. In relation to the latter, Mr Howe asked her why such a document would be found within the KK Group if she was right and neither Lotos nor Biznes-Privat had any connection with the KK Group. As I have noted above in relation to Lotos, her answer was unconvincing:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There are other such contracts, including for example a draft agreement between TESS and Trading Company (represented by Mr Esimbekov) dated 1 March 2007, which identifies a Mr Baysymakov as TESS’s CEO, with a comment balloon next to his name querying whether he was a director as at the agreement date. This strongly suggests that a check needed to be made as to who, in effect, had been installed in the CEO position at the relevant time. Mr Twigger did not agree. He made the point that the origins of the draft agreement are unknown. He was, no doubt, right about that. This is not, however, a point which really assists Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva given that there is no question but that it was found on the KK Group’s systems. Nor, in the circumstances, do I accept that Mr Twigger was right to suggest, as he did, that putting such drafts to Ms Dikhanbayeva involved what he described as an impermissible leap of logic. Ms Dikhanbayeva could offer no sensible explanation as to why such drafts would be on the KK Group’s systems and that inability on her part seems to me to be very telling. It is clear to me that Mr Baysymakov must have been yet another individual who was used by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva in an effectively nominal role. A further example is a draft contract relating to </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> between Bolzhal and Biznes-Privat dated 20 March 2008 in the sum of KZT 196.5 million and so matching the payment from Bolzhal to Biznes-Privat made on 1 April 2008 as recorded in Mr Crooks’ Appendix 14B relating to the Land Plots Claim. This is a payment which Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva say was connected to the financing of the land purchases and, therefore, not to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“earthworks” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">at all. Similarly, there is another a draft contract between Bolzhal and Ritek in the sum of KZT 1.117 billion which closely matches the payment from Bolzhal to Ritek in the sum of KZT 1.037 billion which again features in Appendix 14B, the description given in the contract being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Intermediary services for search and acquisition of land plots”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. There is also a draft contract between Bolzhal and Mouli in the sum of KZT 205.375 million which is again described as being for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“earthworks”</span>

So, too, does the overlap with the Land Plots Claim since it can hardly be a coincidence that the ‘Kazakh/Construction LLPs’ should have been introduced into the transactions giving rise to the Land Plots Claim and the recipients of such large sums of money from Arka-Stroy, a company which I have concluded was controlled and run by the Defendants. In addition, of course, TESS also features in the Astana 2 Claim. Nor can it easily be overlooked that on 11 January 2009 Ms Dikhanbayeva was sent an email by an employee of the KK Group, Mr Marlen Elgeldiev, attaching several agreements between Kagazy Gofratara and Bedel-Stroy, Biznes-Privat and Mouli. Mr Howe asked Ms Dikhanbayeva why it was that she was being sent draft contracts in relation to companies which she claimed she did not know anything about. She suggested that these drafts were sent to her because </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“We were in the middle of a tax audit and we couldn’t find the documents related to Kagazy Gofrotara so we were trying to find the documents and re-establish that database”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. She went on to say that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“we had an outstanding agreement, an outstanding amount, hence these documents were drafted”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> and made a correction to a date in one of the agreements relating to Mouli. I am clear that this was Ms Dikhanbayeva once again dealing with essentially internal KK Group matters involving two KK Group members.     </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. A Potemkin village, after all, involves at least some actual construction, the term apparently deriving from stories of a fake portable village built only to impress Empress Catherine II during her journey to Crimea in 1787. In the circumstances, it is plainly relevant to consider what construction work was carried out at both the Akzhal-1/Akzhal-2 and the Aksenger sites in order to arrive at a conclusion on liability as regards the PEAK Claim. It is also relevant to consider this issue in evaluating the quantum of the Claimants’ loss, assuming that liability is established, because it seems to me that it must be appropriate, at a minimum, that credit is given in respect of the works done at Akzhal-1 and Akzhal-2 in circumstances where construction of Akzhal-1 and construction of aspects of Akzhal-2 took place concurrently during 2006 and 2007 and both Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson agree that Akzhal-1 and Azkhal-2 should be treated as one site and in circumstances where there is now at Akzhal-1 an operational logistics facility with 14 class B+ warehouses (along with supporting buildings and infrastructure) and there is, in addition, a functioning railway which covers both Akzhal 1 and 2. I do not accept, in other words, that Mr Howe can be right when he submitted that no credit is required to be given at all since that would put the Claimants in a better position than they would ever have been which can hardly be right as a matter of principle. I shall come back later to consider whether any additional credit should be given in respect of Aksenger.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is necessary, therefore, to address the quantity surveying evidence which was given by Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson. Before coming on to deal with this, however, it is convenient to outline the evidence on which Mr Twigger sought to rely in support of his submissions that substantial work was carried out at Akzhal-1 in particular. Mr Twigger highlighted, in particular, how planning in respect of Akzhal-1 commenced in late 2005 soon after the first of the agreements was entered into between Arka-Stroy and KK JSC on 15 August 2005, with design work subsequently starting in about March 2006, when Arka-Stroy instructed PTIpishcheprom, Intereng Almaty and AlmatyNPTszem and also KazNIIPI Dortrans in relation to the provision of engineering support and quality control. At about the same time, planning permission was sought and this was then granted on 25 May 2006. Shortly after that, work began on the Akzhal site, only for waterlogging to be encountered, necessitating a trench to be dug to the Aksai river in order to drain a lake which had appeared on the south side of the site and, as Mr Kosarev explained, earthworks which were not limited to Akzhal-1 but covered also the Akzhal-2 site. In the meantime, the metal structures for the warehouses were purchased from Loging pursuant to a contract dated 8 May 2006 and for a purchase price of approximately US$ 6.8 million. These were then transported from Slovenia to Almaty where they were assembled on the Akzhal 1 site such that by mid-2007 the 14 warehouses had been erected and the park was substantially complete. In the meantime, work had been carried out in relation to the railway at Akzhal, a working committee certificate dated 30 April 2007 recording that the work had been carried out by Regul and RSU and that, although there had been deviations from the project design, 70% of tracks 1-3 had been completed and 90% of track 4 up to the ‘bending radius’ had been completed. By 5 June 2007, the railway siding was largely complete, although certain defects remained to be remedied. Thereafter, at the KK Group budget committee meeting of 28 July 2007, it was decided to raise the standard of the warehouses to B+ (in order to make them more desirable to potential lessees) by pouring dust free floors and constructing internal and external offices. There was then a delay in construction in or around September 2007, contemporaneously recorded by Mr Sharipov in a memorandum which he prepared on 17 September 2007. A working commission report dated 1 November 2007 confirms that by that date, the works were complete save for some remedial works. The PEAK Logistics Centre was subsequently, in December 2007, formally opened. The same month, on 7 December 2007, Act 255 was issued by the State Acceptance Committee (albeit that somewhat oddly approval did not actually come until 28 December 2007). In that document completion of the works was stated to be July 2007. </span>

There was, however, rather more dispute in relation to Aksenger precisely because Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson were unable to agree not only in relation to costings but also, in several respects, in relation to whether particular work was carried out at all.

These criticisms essentially entailed it being suggested that Mr Tapper set out to arrive at valuations which were too low and that Mr Jackson set out to arrive at valuation figures which were too high. In my view, however, neither did anything of the sort. I am quite clear, as I have stated previously, that both Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson in their evidence did their best to assist the Court. The fact that they disagreed about certain matters is not a reason to conclude the contrary.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe made two central criticisms concerning Mr Jackson: first, that Mr Jackson placed too much reliance on certain Acts of Acceptance relating to Akzal-2 and Aksenger which were prepared internally and signed off by personnel who were operating on both the KK Group side and the Arka-Stroy side; and secondly, that Mr Jackson asked himself the wrong question when undertaking the exercise which he performed in this case. It is convenient to address the first of these criticisms in context rather than at this stage. As to the second, Mr Howe drew attention to the fact that Mr Jackson had explained in his supplemental report that he had focused on </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“what the work </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;color:#000000">should</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe submitted that this was quite wrong since what the Court needed to know was, indeed, the value of the work which was actually carried out. Accordingly, Mr Howe suggested, Mr Jackson’s evidence was of little (if any) assistance. I cannot agree with this submission, however, since it seems to me that, in truth, all that Mr Jackson was here meaning to do was to explain why, in his view, an appropriate valuation methodology is to adopt what might be described as a ‘prospective’ approach to valuation which entails looking not at buildings which have actually been built (such as the warehouses in the case of Akzhal-1) but at pre-construction drawings for those buildings. Whilst it is, of course, open to Mr Howe to criticise that as a methodology, in my view, the point does not go further than that. It does not, in particular, I am clear, mean that Mr Jackson’s evidence ought to be disregarded because of any failure to engage with the issue which the Court must resolve. It is instructive in this regard to consider the exchanges between Mr Howe and Mr Jackson on this topic immediately after Mr Howe had read to Mr Jackson the passage in his supplemental report which I have quoted:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, but explained that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“you would have to be certain”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“For that approach to be reliable, you would have to be certain that you have got all of the cost records”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Indeed, when I explored the matter with Mr Howe during the course of his closing submissions, he acknowledged that it may be that all that Mr Jackson was seeking to do in the passage in his supplemental report highlighted by Mr Howe was to explain that, in his view, given the information which was available, a ‘prospective’ approach to valuation was appropriate. In my view, as I have explained, that is precisely what Mr Jackson was seeking to do. In those circumstances, I reject the suggestion that Mr Jackson’s evidence ought to be regarded as lacking in reliability on this particular basis. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Secondly, as to Mr Tapper, Mr Twigger drew attention to the fact in relation to Akzhal-1 that, rather than carrying out his own ‘high’ valuation, Mr Tapper had treated Act 255 as the maximum value attributable to the work and the maximum amount of cost involved. He criticised this approach for three reasons. First, Mr Twigger made the point that the valuation methodology underlying Act 255 is completely unknown, highlighting how Mr Tapper had accepted in cross-examination that he had no experience of being involved with a committee of the kind which produced Act 255 and how Mr Tapper had gone on later to say that he did not know how </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it works in terms of their committee …”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> when it was put to him by Mr Twigger that, if Act 255 had been concerned with the railway, there would in all probability have been somebody on the committee from </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the railway department or something similar”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Secondly, Mr Twigger submitted that it is very likely that Act 255 did not include any value for the construction of the railway, which both experts agree is a valuable item (in fact, as I shall explain shortly, Mr Tapper’s valuation is higher than that of Mr Jackson) and, if that is the position, then, Act 255 cannot represent a maximum in the way suggested by Mr Tapper. Mr Twigger pointed out in this context that, if Act 255 had anything to do with the railway, then, it makes no sense that no detailed description of the railway was given in it in the same way as details were given concerning the warehouse specifications and other buildings. The most that there is in relation to the railway, Mr Twigger explained, were merely generalised references such as those contained in Supplement 2 to Act 255. Thirdly, Mr Twigger highlighted how, in seeking to explain why Act 255 represented an appropriate maximum, Mr Tapper explained that the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“work scope for Akzhal is not entirely clear, we don’t know exactly”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and continued by stating that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “we have done the best we can to establish the work, but we don’t know exactly how deep the foundations are, we don’t know exactly how much filling they put in”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In these circumstances, Mr Twigger suggested that Act 255 cannot sensibly be treated as a maximum. That is probably right. However, nothing really turns on this since the real battleground as between Mr Jackson and Mr Tapper was not as to Mr Tapper’s ‘high’ valuation figures but as to his ‘low’ valuation figures. Indeed, once the railway is added to the Act 255 estimated figure (Mr Tapper confirmed that Act 255 did, indeed, only give an estimate), which appears to have been based on an acceptance on 5 July 2007 when not only the railway but other work also would not have been completed, Mr Jackson has calculated that the Act 255 figures would increase to KZT 4.601 billion which is not much less than Mr Jackson’s preferred KZT 4.749 billion overall valuation.</span>

As that table demonstrated, Mr Jackson’s overall valuation in respect of Akzhal-1 and Akzhal-2 was KZT  4,749,048,869.55 whereas Mr Tapper’s equivalent figure (taking what he described as his ‘low’ valuation and not the ‘high’ valuation which he based on Act 255) was KZT 2,590,279,786.00. The difference between Mr Jackson and Mr Tapper was, accordingly, approximately KZT 2.16 billion. </span>

In the circumstances, no point arises about these matters.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> at Akzhal-2, Mr Jackson grouped these into three categories: KZT 773.15 million for land clearance and earthworks (including those for the railway); KZT 184.5 million for site dewatering; and KZT 68.12 million for works to the Aksai river. Mr Tapper, on the other hand, attributed ‘low’ valuations: KZT 2.27 million for what he described as ‘site preparation/clearance’ and which Mr Jackson included within his ‘bulk excavation’ figure; and KZT 94.88 million for earthworks. This is as part of an overall ‘low’ valuation for Akzhal-2 which Mr Tapper puts at KZT 150.293 million. The difference overall on</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, two points arise. The first concerns foundations in relation to which Mr Tapper gave a valuation in respect of the work which added up to KZT 366.4 million (specifically KZT 324,301,089, KZT 27,800,729 and KZT 14,242,834) as compared with Mr Jackson’s KZT 502.7 million. The difference, therefore, amounts to some KZT 135 million. Mr Tapper fairly accepted that he was not an expert </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in taking any sort of detailed measurements of underground work”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Nor, of course, was Mr Jackson. In the circumstances, it seems to me that the appropriate course is to treat the appropriate figure in relation to foundations as being in the middle of these two amounts.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">The second aspect is more significant in monetary terms. It concerns the warehouse superstructures. Mr Tapper in this respect based his valuation on the amount paid to Loging (US$ 6.8 million) less US$ 1.79 million which he explained that he was instructed to deduct on the basis that this was the amount which Loging had paid the Defendants by way of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“commission”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Accordingly, Mr Tapper’s superstructure valuation figure was US$ 5,008,477 or approximately KZT 646.72 million. Mr Jackson’s valuation, in contrast, using his ‘prospective’ approach and so on the basis of a pre-construction estimate rather than the sums paid to Loging, amounted to KZT 771.75 million, although Mr Jackson considered that to this needs to be added sums in respect of internal finishes, services, ventilation, testing and commission and so forth, giving an overall valuation of KZT 1.461 billion. On the face of it, therefore, the difference between Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson on this issue is considerable. However, as Mr Twigger pointed out, if the US$ 1.79 million which Mr Tapper was instructed to deduct from the US$ 6.8 million which was paid to Loging is added back in, the equivalent amount in tenge (KZT 231.14 million) increases Mr Tapper’s superstructure valuation to KZT 877.86 million which means that the difference between Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson reduces to approximately KZT 583.14 million. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> which is said to have been paid came not in any statement of case but in Mr Tapper’s report which was served in early March this year, just a month before the trial started. The reference to </span>

A striking example relates to the January 2008 valuations from Mr Benmakhlouf referred to above. It was suggested for the first time in Ms Baturina's written opening that these were only ‘purported’ valuations and that they ‘wildly overstate[d]’ the true value of the Paradise Golf plots of land. Ms Baturina then gave evidence for the first time in cross-examination that at a meeting on 30th January 2008 Mr Chistyakov told her that a valuation had been received in Morocco commissioned by Mr Krupnov showing a market price of about €120 per square metre. This appeared nowhere in her pleaded case or her witness statements. It was then put to Mr Chistyakov in cross-examination that he had seen these valuations at the time and that they were false valuations commissioned by the consortium to justify the price allegedly being advanced to Ms Baturina. He denied seeing the valuations at the time, denied telling Ms Baturina of any such valuation and said that he did not believe the valuations to be false.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The question which, then, arises is whether that level is still too low given that, although it is more than Mr Jackson’s KZT 771.75 million equivalent (before taking account of what might be described as ‘add-ons’), it is nonetheless approximately KZT 583.14 million lower than Mr Jackson’s all-inclusive KZT 1.461 billion valuation. This depends on whether Mr Tapper was justified in using the sums paid to Loging as the basis for his assessment of the value of the warehouses and that, in turn, depends on whether the US$ 6.8 million which was paid to Loging covered everything which Loging supplied. If it did not include everything, then, it must be right, as Mr Twigger submitted, that the US$ 6.8 million is a valuation which is too low. If, on the other hand, the US$ 6.8 million included the ‘add-ons’, then, it makes little sense to do what Mr Jackson has done and base the valuation on drawings relating to the warehouses in order to arrive at a theoretical value.

No attempt was made, however, to trawl through the contractual documentation and demonstrate why Mr Tapper was wrong to have assumed (as he did) that the Loging contract covered the ‘add-ons’. I consider that that was a fair assumption and that, in the circumstances, it is really incumbent upon Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva to explain with some precision why it was wrong to have made it. That, however, has not been done. It follows that I do not consider it appropriate to include additional sums for valuation purposes to cover the items identified by Mr Jackson in his report. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">That is not, however, the end of the matter because Mr Tapper accepted that he included the cost of installation within his KZT 646.72 million, apparently under the impression that those costs were included in the Loging contract. Whether that is right or wrong is, in a sense, not important because, as a matter of fact, the installation was not done by Loging but, it seems, by a company called Parity Ltd LLP and Mr Tapper accepted that, if the installation work had not been carried out by Loging, a sum would have to be added in that regard. Although no particular amount was put to Mr Tapper, it appears from Mr Jackson’s report that he allowed an amount for this somewhere in his ‘add-ons’ (perhaps in</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “builders’ work in connect”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“testing and commission”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) because the ‘add-ons’ (taken together with the amounts he identified for foundations and superstructure) add up to the KZT 1,969,062,591.44 which he attributes to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Warehouses”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Without knowing more precisely what amount he allowed, however, it is not possible to reach a settled conclusion on the appropriate additional sum which should be included on top of Mr Tapper’s US$ 6.8 million valuation. Similarly, since Mr Tapper explained that he had included in his US$ 6.8 million figure the cost of transport because he had assumed that it was included in the Loging contract, an additional amount should be added for this. That must, again, be included somewhere in Mr Jackson’s ‘add-ons’ for the reason which I have given. However, it seems to me that, since the actual costs incurred with TKA Intertrans GmbH in respect of that transportation are known because they are set out in Mr Thompson’s Appendix 3 at Table 1, the actual costs (€410,689.75) should be what is added to deal with this additional item. It follows that, in respect of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Warehouses”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, I consider that the appropriate valuation is one which attributes to foundations an amount which is midway between Mr Tapper’s and Mr Jackson’s respective valuations, and which as to superstructure starts with a baseline valuation of US$ 6.8 million which has added to it an amount in relation to the costs of installation (which can hopefully be agreed) and an additional €410,689.75 to cover transportation costs.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> (the security building, administration building, electricity substation/reservoir, security guard hut and shelter), Mr Tapper arrived at his figure of KZT 30.5 million by establishing the total cost per square metre of the warehouses (KZT 28,945) and applying that rate to the area of the other buildings. He nonetheless accepted, when asked by Mr Twigger, that these buildings were of a different type to the warehouses. He explained that, ideally, he would not have adopted a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">pro rata</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> approach but that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“didn’t have any details other than these photographs, so that’s why I have taken a pretty broadbrush approach”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In relation to one of the administration buildings, however, as far as I can tell the building to which Mr Jackson attributes a KZT 63,678,720.00 valuation, it would appear that this is a building which was covered by the Loging contract since another of the specifications to that contract includes a drawing showing a building made up essentially of 22 containers (described by Mr Tapper as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a series of Portakabins stacked up”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) which Mr Jackson stated that he seemed to recognise. On that basis, the relevant valuation ought to be deducted from Mr Jackson’s total. This still leaves, however, approximately KZT 175 million between Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson. As to that, I bear in mind Mr Tapper’s evidence that the relevant buildings were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“pretty simple buildings, as the warehouse”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, and so that Mr Twigger was probably not right to suggest that Mr Tapper’s approach of using a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">pro rata</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> figure based on (as Mr Twigger put it) </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the price of second-hand pre-fabricated warehouses”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was wholly inappropriate. Nonetheless, it does seem to me likely that Mr Tapper’s valuation is simply too low. In those circumstances, adopting a necessarily broadbrush approach, and reflecting Mr Howe’s point that Mr Jackson’s methodology entailed his looking at drawings rather than the buildings as actually constructed, in my view, an appropriate valuation would be KZT 160 million rather than the approximately KZT 211 million left after the KZT 63,678,720.00 is deducted from Mr Jackson’s KZT 274.5 million total.</span>

The second concerns the distance which soil removed from the site needed to be transported. As to that second matter, it is a short point. Mr Jackson has priced all of the earthworks (not just those at Akzhal) on the basis that surplus material would be transported 20 km away from the site rather than the 1-5 km estimated by Mr Tapper. Mr Jackson explained that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in the absence of a specific destination, I revert back to my standard methodology which is 20 kilometres”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The fact, however, is that in none of the relevant invoices is there any suggestion that removal entailed soil travelling anything like that kind of distance. Indeed, as Mr Howe was able to demonstrate, such reference as there is (in the form of an invoice relating to work on the bed of the Aksai River) suggests that the distance which soil had to be transported was just one kilometre. Accordingly, an adjustment would need to be made to Mr Jackson’s figures, in any event. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The first issue is rather more significant. This is because, although the quantities assessed by Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson are similar (for bulk excavation, Mr Tapper allowed 304,000 cubic metres whereas Mr Jackson allowed 295,000 cubic metres; in relation to topsoil removal, Mr Tapper allowed between approximately 65,000 and 120,000 cubic metres whereas Mr Jackson allowed 178,000; and as for filling and backfilling, Mr Tapper assessed approximately 182,000 cubic metres and Mr Jackson assessed 181,000), the difference between the amounts assessed by Mr Tapper in his ‘low valuation’ and Mr Jackson for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Earthworks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> is very considerable  (KZT 172.07 million and KZT 473.22 million respectively) almost entirely (subject, no doubt, also to the distance point which I have just addressed) because of the different rates which Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson have applied for labour (skilled/unskilled) and plant in relation to the carrying out of the relevant works. The difficulty which arises in this respect is that, as I shall now explain, both Mr Howe and Mr Twigger were able to make legitimate criticisms of each other’s expert. As a consequence, I am left in the position which Mr Twigger contemplated I might find myself in, which is that, in my view, the right rates lie</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “somewhere in between the Jackson and Tapper rates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As he went on to observe, it </span>

Accordingly, all that I can usefully do at this stage is to indicate my conclusions on the rates as rates, leaving it to the parties to run whatever calculations then need to be run in order to arrive at an appropriate overall valuation. I shall come on, therefore, to set out my conclusions in this regard, after first outlining the criticisms which were, as I say legitimately, made in relation to the approaches to rates adopted by Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson respectively.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I start with Mr Tapper. Mr Howe submitted that Mr Tapper had done his best to obtain objective independent data on what rates might be applied, and then fully explained in his reports how he had adjusted that data in order to arrive at the rates which he considered most appropriate. I do not doubt that Mr Tapper did his best and that Mr Jackson did also. However, unlike Mr Jackson who has experience of working on a construction project in Kazakhstan, Mr Tapper had no such direct personal experience and so no direct personal experience of labour rates in that country.  Nor, Mr Twigger submitted, in my view with some justification, did Mr Tapper appear to have a complete grasp of the nature, make-up and accuracy of the sources which he used to compile his rates. So, for example and as Mr Twigger highlighted in his closing submissions, whilst Mr Tapper was apparently under the impression that he had used three sets of rates, actually he had only used two since the rates which he quoted from the Ministry of Economy and Ranking.kz both came from the State Statistics Committee. This calls into question his decision to exclude from consideration certain benchmark rates prepared by his own company, T&amp;T International, on the basis that those rates were in an outlier category when compared with what he mistakenly thought were three sources when there were, in fact, only two sources. I agree with Mr Twigger that, in the circumstances, it would have been better if, rather than taking no account of the T&amp;T rates altogether, Mr Tapper had sought to adjust the T&amp;T rates to take account of the fact that they were in respect of oil and gas projects which may not have been equivalent to the Akzhal project. Furthermore, again as Mr Twigger pointed out, it was unclear whether the Ministry of Economy rates covered all types of labour and all types of construction. Mr Tapper could not say whether this was the position. It was also unclear what areas of Kazakhstan the rates covered, despite the fact that Ranking.kz showed that the rates paid to workers in Almaty were higher than those in Kazakhstan as a whole. Indeed and in fairness to Mr Tapper, he agreed that, in relation to the Ranking.kz rates, it would have been more appropriate for him to have applied the Almaty rates rather than the general Kazakh rates.  </span>

Furthermore, Compass International noted that these rates were lower end rates, with rates in major cities being as much as 20%-40% higher. Somewhat oddly, given that the relevant passages were set out in his report, Mr Tapper stated during cross-examination that he had not noticed that fact or, indeed, the fact that rates for unskilled workers in major cities could be up to 50% higher. Mr Tapper went on to agree with Mr Twigger that, had he used an uplift of between 20%-50% in respect of his rates, the T&amp;T figures would not have looked so out of kilter.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> lower than in the US, Mr Tapper took a different (and lower) figure having, in fact, referred in paragraph 983 of his report to Compass stating </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. It appears that the reason for the difference is that the Compass International pricing document appended to his report was a different edition to the one to which he was here referring because, in brackets after saying what he did there is a reference to page 270, whilst the relevant page in the document in the appendix is page 262.

This applies, therefore, both to labour and plant rates since Mr Tapper ultimately accepted that, if it took a digger operator in Kazakhstan two hours to do the same thing as an operator in the UK would do in 1 hour, the digger would be required for twice as long. I consider, in the circumstances, that a 20% uplift was quite obviously too low, as indeed would have been a 100% uplift as originally canvassed by Mr Tapper in paragraph 983, and that a more appropriate uplift would have been 150%.</span>

As I have explained, I am in no position, however, to work out what the correct rates would be once the various aspects which I have described above are taken into account.

	      <span style="color:#000000">it would have been a good idea to have done a comparison.

In those circumstances, I do not consider that this further criticism was altogether warranted. No further adjustment is, therefore, needed to take account of this point. </span>

Mr Tapper, accordingly, revised the 2015 rates which he was using for plant to take account of the devaluations in the tenge which had occurred during 2007. I agree with Mr Twigger, however, that the basis of Mr Tapper’s assumption about plant needing to be imported from the US was somewhat unclear, if only because it seemed geographically and culturally rather more likely that any plant would come from Russia rather than from the US. Furthermore, Mr Tapper’s adjustments for devaluation took no account of the subsequent devaluations of the tenge which took place in 2009 and instead applied what Mr Twigger characterised as a ‘straight-line’ adjustment of 278% to December 2016 plant rates across the entire period. I agree with Mr Twigger that, in the circumstances, primarily because there was only really a very slender justification for assuming that plant would be sourced from the US, Mr Tapper’s adjustment in this regard was not appropriate. It follows that the rates set out in paragraph 987 of Mr Tapper’s first report, which I understood Mr Tapper to be saying in the next paragraph (paragraph 988) were 2015/6 rates which had been adjusted </span>

Specifically, Mr Twigger highlighted how Mr Jackson had obtained actual quotations from suppliers and also submitted that the rates were based on actual comparable projects including a hotel and business centre in Astana, Oriflame near Moscow and a further project called Gas Device which was a warehouse and factory unit. Mr Twigger emphasised, in particular, that Mr Jackson had explained to Mr Howe during the course of cross-examination that it makes no difference whether these other buildings were or were not warehouses.

	      <span style="color:#000000">The difficulty nonetheless remains that the information which Mr Jackson provided in relation to the comparables was, leading into trial, very sketchy indeed. In his first report, he referred to his having used </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“cost data from a variety of different sources”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and then identified just two such sources, namely the hotel in Astana and Oriflame. He did not mention Gas Device at that stage. The first time that he referred to this was when Mr Howe asked him what other sources he had had regard to. This is despite the fact that in his discussions with Mr Tapper in the lead-up to trial, Mr Jackson </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“undertook to provide rates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or, as he immediately clarified, </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Jackson explained in cross-examination, however, that he then </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. I agree with Mr Howe that this was wholly unsatisfactory. I do not, in the circumstances, consider that I can place any great reliance on Mr Jackson’s comparables since they are largely incapable of being tested, certainly in any particularly meaningful way.

Before dealing with these in a little detail, it is worth having in mind what difference the three areas of dispute have on the experts’ overall valuations. It is not insignificant. Specifically, Mr Tapper’s overall valuation for Akzhal-2 ranges from KZT 150.293 million (his ‘low’ valuation) to KZT 196.97 million (his ‘high’ valuation), whereas Mr Jackson’s overall valuation for Akzhal-2 comes to KZT 1.63 billion (net of VAT at 14% and a 5.7% allowance which I shall come on to describe) or KZT 1.96 billion (inclusive of VAT and the 5.7% allowance) less KZT 45.82 million (which he accepts has been double-counted) and so KZT 191.14 billion.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Starting with the KZT 773.15 million which Mr Jackson had attributed to land clearance and earthworks (including those for the railway), there are two issues here. The first is the issue regarding appropriate rates which I have already addressed in the context of Akzhal-1. Mr Tapper will need, in his revised calculations, therefore, to make adjustments reflecting the matters which I have identified. The second issue involves a disagreement between Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson as to the height of the embankments at Akzhal-2. Unlike Mr Tapper who was reliant on what Warner Surveys had to say in this regard, Mr Jackson had personally observed and found physical evidence that, although the height of the embankment varied, it was in some places 2 metres (as shown in certain photographs although in his report Mr Jackson refers to 1.5 metres) and in other places as high as 7 metres. Mr Twigger submitted that this evidence should be preferred to what was, at best, second-hand evidence from Mr Tapper based on Warner Surveys having ascertained that the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">maximum</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> height of the embankments was 2.5 metres. I agree with Mr Twigger about this since Warner Surveys had to make a number of significant revisions to their earthworks quantities, including, for instance, a correction to an assumption which they had made that the average depth of excavations across the sites was 1 metre which involved this changing to 4.5 metres. Mr Tapper agreed with Mr Twigger that this constituted a substantial revision. Mr Tapper’s calculations will need, in the circumstances, to take account of Mr Jackson’s evidence concerning the height of the embankments.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As for Mr Jackson’s KZT 184.5 million for site dewatering, again the rates issue arises and a revised calculation will need, accordingly, to be undertaken by Mr Tapper (and hopefully agreed by Mr Jackson). In addition, however, there was an issue between Mr Tapper and Mr Jackson over whether dewatering took place at the southern end of the Akzhal-2 site. Mr Jackson’s evidence was that he had identified such dewatering and that, in his view, the lagoon would have required extensive removal of sludge and vegetable soil before being filled. Mr Tapper’s view, however, was that, although there is evidence of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“some drainage on site”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, it </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“appears to have been installed some years prior to the works commencing (i.e. when it was still agricultural land)”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Twigger pointed out, this is an opinion which is not altogether easy to square with Warner Survey’s identification of the area concerned as being one </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“where dewatering has obviously occurred by design and as a specific action”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It was, furthermore, both Mr Kosarev’s and Mr Sannikov’s evidence that dewatering and remedial work in respect of waterlogging took place. Mr Sannikov, in particular, stated as follows when giving evidence:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“So there were some works done for dewatering purposes and that is territory of 60 hectares, as a total, 50 plus 10. That territory had massive construction works performed, but the lake was dewatering through two pipes. It was dewatered and then, as I said, there was an error in project design and I remember that I saw huge amounts of soil, they clawed a huge pile, a huge heap of soil  and the tractor was moving back, and that was hard soil to replace the local softer soil with that harder  soil  containing rocks and stones.”</span>

Although I see no particular reason to doubt what Mr Jackson was here saying, this is not, however, the end of the matter since in his first report, specifically in Appendix B1, where he set out his costings summary, Mr Jackson’s justification for his figure of KZT 184,493,829.82, was stated to be as follows:</span>

He did so by taking Mr Jackson to an Arka-Stroy invoice relating to drainage work done at Aksenger. That invoice was in strikingly similar terms to the Act of Acceptance, save in respect of one of the items in the invoice which did not appear in the Act of Acceptance. It is quite clear, looking at this material, that the Act of Acceptance is not a document on which reliance could legitimately be placed.

I recognised at the time when I put these values into my report that they may not be totally safe. That was certainly a consideration of mine. So here is how I have treated them: I have put them in, but within my overall valuation at Akzhal I have moderated the total value associated with all of the earthworks to the value of a roundabout 600 million tenge, i.e. a deduction.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Jackson later, when discussing with Mr Howe the works relating to the Aksai River, explained in more detail what he meant by moderation. It was clear that he had in mind the type of thing which is done at a pre-construction stage in order to avoid either overvaluation or undervaluation. As Mr Howe pointed out, however, nowhere in his reports did Mr Jackson mention having engaged in a moderation process resulting in an overall reduction in the case of Akzhal amounting to KZT 600 million and, as he earlier explained, in the case of Aksenger amounting to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“nearly KZT 400 million”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Jackson insisted that he had explained what he had done by way of moderation to Mr Tapper in the experts’ meeting. However, I was left with the impression that Mr Jackson was engaged in what might be described as damage limitation in the face of the difficulties which Mr Howe had explored with him concerning his reliance on the Act of Acceptance.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The Court is, therefore, left in a difficult position. It seems to me that, in all probability, based on what Mr Jackson says that he himself saw when he visited the site and based on what Warner Surveys reported, taken in conjunction with the evidence given by Mr Kosarev and Mr Sannikov, it would be wrong to conclude that no dewatering work took place. Attributing a value to that work is, however, not something which, in the circumstances, is easily done. I am troubled, in particular, about any reliance being placed on the Act of Acceptance on which Mr Jackson has, at least in the first instance, based his valuation. Similarly, Mr Jackson’s somewhat broadbrush approach of discounting earthworks in respect of Akzhal-1/Akzhal-2 by KZT 600 million seems to me to be somewhat unsatisfactory since it remains the case that Mr Jackson’s starting point is the Act of Acceptance which, as he himself accepted, is not reliable. In such circumstances, since there is no other evidence to indicate a likely cost involved in dewatering, the Court has two options: either to attribute no value to dewatering work which nonetheless the Court considers has taken place, or to do its best to arrive at an appropriate figure. In my view, it is appropriate to try to do the latter and, doing the best that I can, I attribute to the dewatering work a value of KZT 60 million.  This represents my broadbrush attempt at arriving at an appropriate figure. It is roughly a third of the amount which Mr Jackson attributed to dewatering and so represents a substantial reduction. I might add that since I have arrived at the figure in such a broadbrush way, it is not affected by any recalculation as to rates.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The third and final issue which arises as regards Akzhal-2 concerns Mr Jackson’s KZT 68.12 million for works to the Aksai river.  Mr Tapper’s position, as described in his second report, was that, although there appears to have been some works in the relevant area, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it cannot be confirmed that this was for cleaning and widening of Aksai river”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Accordingly, Mr Tapper explained that he was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not able to rely on Mr Jackson’s estimate for these works”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This is another aspect where Mr Jackson placed reliance on an Act of Acceptance, making the same comment in his cost summary at Appendix B1 to his first report as he had done in relation to the dewatering item. It was put to Mr Jackson that he had not independently verified whether the work described in the relevant Act of Acceptance had been carried out, to which Mr Jackson replied as follows:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Since Mr Jackson was clear that some work had been done, he explained that he relied upon the Act of Acceptance and then moderated the value downwards to mitigate the risk of the document being unreliable. The difficulty, however, is that, as Mr Howe pointed out to Mr Jackson, the reduction had not been specifically identified in his report. Indeed, there was no specific reduction in respect of this item of work since his evidence was that the moderation led to his overall KZT 600 million reduction. Again, therefore, the Court is left in the position where it either attributes no value to this work or does its best to arrive at an appropriate value without any real evidence before it to enable such a value to be achieved. Doing the best that I can, and so again adopting a very broadbrush approach, it seems to me that an appropriate value would be KZT 30 million, an amount which will again not be affected by any recalculation.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Lastly, before coming on to deal with Aksenger, it should be noted that, in addition to 6% being added to cover design costs, the experts are agreed that between 15%-17% should be added for preliminaries, overheads and profit. Mr Jackson put this at 15% but it seems to me that it is appropriate, in the circumstances, to apply Mr Tapper’s slightly higher 17%. In addition, Mr Jackson took the view that it is appropriate to add a 5.7% contingency for the risk that the work will not have been executed in the most efficient manner as envisaged by the applicable rates. Mr Jackson was under the impression when he was being cross-examined by Mr Howe that Mr Tapper had allowed a 10% contingency equivalent. In fact, he has not done so but has, instead, as he put it in the joint memorandum, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“included an allowance for the inaccuracy in the pricing and established scope of works of plus or minus 10%”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I am satisfied that Mr Jackson’s 5.7% approach is appropriate given, in particular, that he had based it on an apparently well regarded article by Chester and Hendrickson and given also that, in his experience, as he explained when he was re-examined, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Almost every project has some form of additional cost arising out of delays and major projects in particular, the additional cost usually way exceeds that sort of value”</span>

Mr Twigger submitted that this is not to say, however, that the work was not carried out, observing that the burden of proof rests on the Claimants to prove that, on the balance of probabilities and in the context of allegations of serious fraud, the work was not done. Accordingly, Mr Twigger submitted, it does not assist the Claimants if, as was suggested to him at various points in his evidence, Mr Jackson had not been able to prove that particular work had been done. That, Mr Twigger suggested, is to reverse the burden of proof since Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva are under no obligation to prove that the works had been performed. The more so, Mr Twigger submitted, in circumstances where Mr Tapper had taken a deliberate decision not to undertake investigations in relation to certain aspects which would have enabled it to be determined whether the work had been done.</span>

This will entail me considering the evidence which both sides have put before me and seeing where that evidence takes me. In these circumstances, the burden of proof is unlikely to be determinative.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> area. In his second report, he gave details of the size of the land areas concerned, adding up to 79,860.80m</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> (not including railway-related earthworks) which appears in Mr Jackson’s cost breakdown would need to be reduced proportionately even assuming that Mr Jackson’s rates were treated as being appropriate. In very broad terms, therefore, the KZT 706 million figure falls to be reduced by 48% to KZT 338 million. The more fundamental issue, however, is whether the Court can be satisfied on the material before it whether there were, indeed, the earthworks which Mr Jackson considers there were based on the satellite imagery since obviously, if the Court is not satisfied that there were, there is nothing to value. </span>

The satellite imagery is, in truth, wholly inconclusive since such changes to the ground which can be detected are at least as consistent with ordinary agricultural activity as with earthworks having been carried out. Mr Jackson was shown, for example, a close-up photograph which Mr Howe put to him showed plough marks. Mr Jackson agreed that that appeared to be the case.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“bunny ear”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and, in particular, Mr Jackson’s reference to one of the images looking </span>

On any view, therefore, Mr Jackson’s figure in relation to earthworks attributable to the railway, KZT 547,581,134.78, cannot be accepted. Nor, given the need for Mr Tapper to recalculate using revised rates, can his valuation which he put in his second report at just over KZT 16 million.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the first issue, concerning the nature of the works which were performed, two sub-issues arise: as regards the width of the sub-base used by Mr Tapper in his second report, and as regards the height of the embankment. I can deal with both these points in short order. Mr Twigger’s submission is that Mr Tapper was unjustified in reducing the width in his second report from the width used for the purposes of his first report. Specifically, whereas in his first report Mr Tapper based his calculations on a railway with a length of 1,119.60 m and an overall area of 8,750 m</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">2</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, in his second report Mr Tapper changed the length to 1,288 m yet performed a valuation based on an overall area of 4,403 m</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">2</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Tapper’s explanation was that the reason for the change concerning width was that the data obtained from the GPR work carried out by Warner Surveys had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“been analysed in more detail”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“given us more accurate areas of disturbed ground”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although Mr Tapper went on to express himself more confident in his recalculation, I tend to share Mr Twigger’s scepticism about this change and am not persuaded that it was justified. Indeed, it is not a matter which was even addressed in Mr Howe’s closing submissions.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the height of the embankment, Mr Jackson’s valuation is based on the embankment having a 2 m height. Mr Howe made two points concerning this. First, he highlighted how Mr Jackson in his first report referred in paragraph 112 to the railway line being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“constructed either at grade, or upon shallow embankments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, suggesting that this is inconsistent with an embankment as high as two metres. Secondly, Mr Howe suggested that the photographs relied upon by Mr Jackson do not show any embankment. Mr Tapper, who visited the site, furthermore, stated that as far as he could see there was no substantial embankment. Mr Tapper explained that a particular photograph which he was shown was of no relevance because it showed the main line rather than the railway line built as part of the project. Mr Jackson disagreed. He was adamant that the photograph showed </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the new spur line”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although it is not altogether easy to reach a particularly considered view on this issue, it does seem to me that there is considerable force in Mr Howe’s point concerning Mr Jackson’s reference in his first report to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“shallow embankments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I struggle to see how a 2 m high embankment can properly be described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“shallow”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In those circumstances, I am not persuaded that Mr Jackson’s valuation based on an embankment of that height would be appropriate. I can see, however, that there should be some allowance for a raised embankment and, in my view, therefore, it would be appropriate to value based on an embankment measuring 1 m in height.</span>

I am quite clear, in the circumstances, that it does not justify a conclusion that drainage work took place in that area. I am strengthened in that view by the fact that Mr Jackson relied for these purposes the Arka-Stroy invoice relating to drainage work to which I have previously referred when discussing the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Dewatering”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> issue in the context of Akzhal-2. That invoice is not a document which, in the circumstances, can be regarded as reliable. The more so, since the invoice describes no less than 25.547 km of 200mm diameter perforated drainage pipe and Mr Jackson said that it would not be possible to fit as much as that in an area the size of the pink </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“bunny ear”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> measuring, he accepted, about 200 m by 200 m. Although Mr Jackson pointed out that in his second report he had identified </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, a reference to the eastern boundary infilling work addressed above and so not work which ultimately Mr Jackson accepted could have taken place, Mr Jackson made it clear that he </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> accepted Mr Howe’s </span>

He agreed with Mr Howe that the sidings would have to have rail control systems and so photographs which he had relied upon showing control boxes in the sidings did not evidence any control work on the Aksenger spur line. Similarly, he accepted that, for example, a photograph showing a station building with control systems in it did not in and of itself indicate that any centralised locking system had been constructed in respect of the Aksenger spur line since the system shown in the photograph could have been one which related to the mainline railway alone.

During the seven years that the branch was in an abandoned state some of the communication devices were stolen, but some of them are still in place.</span>

Mr Tapper confirmed in cross-examination that neither he nor Warner Surveys had visited the station, observing that it is </span>

Mr Twigger was able, however, to refer to a police report prepared in August 2014 in which it is stated that a Mr Yagmurov, the chief specialist at KazZhelDorProekt (which designed the Aksenger railway), had been interrogated and had confirmed that work had been undertaken as part of the reconstruction of Aksenger station in accordance with the technical specifications for the project. In those circumstances, it seems to me that there is evidence which would justify Mr Jackson’s valuation. Mr Twigger suggested also that the same report supported the case that the centralised locking system was also put in place. However, the report is not explicit on that point and, therefore, I see no reason to change my conclusion on that aspect.</span>

As Mr Howe submitted, whatever the cost of the works done at Aksenger, it might legitimately be thought difficult to see that the works can, in truth, be regarded as having any value at all as far as the Claimants are concerned. As he put it, it is not immediately apparent how incomplete and redundant sections of railway at Aksenger serve any useful purpose. The position is not the same as regards Akzhal-1 where there is an operational logistics park in place. Furthermore, I have explained as regards Akzhal-2 that I consider it appropriate for these purposes not to differentiate between Akzhal-1 and Akzhal-2 given their geographical proximity. The question is whether, given that Aksenger is somewhere else altogether, it is appropriate to require that credit be given. In my view, it would be appropriate to do so since the fact remains that works were carried out, albeit not to the extent suggested by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. That said, in view of the conclusions which I have reached in relation to the works carried out at Aksenger and in relation to appropriate rates, any credit will inevitably be somewhat modest.</span>

It will be recalled that Mr Howe’s position was that something like half of the work done, viewed by value, is properly attributable to contractors other than Arka-Stroy, and that Mr Jackson’s valuation would need to reduce to about US$ 40 million accordingly, even if it otherwise were to remain unaltered.

Specifically and for the avoidance of doubt, for the reasons which I have given in considerable detail in this section of the judgment, I have concluded: (i) that Mr Arip is liable to KK JSC under Articles 62 and 63 of the JSC Law, given that he was a director of KK JSC at all material times; (ii) that Ms Dikhanbayeva is also liable to KK JSC under those provisions in respect of the time when she was a director of KK JSC, namely between April 2008 and July 2009, and otherwise under Articles 917 and 932 of the KCC; and (iii) that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva are both liable to PEAK and Peak Akzhal under Articles 917 and 932 of the KCC. In the circumstances, there is no need for me to make any determination concerning KK JSC’s, PEAK’s and Peak Akzhal’s (alternative) unjust enrichment claims brought under Articles 953, 955 and 956 of the KCC.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The claim relates to monies which were disbursed in relation to the Astana project between August 2008 and June 2009.  More specifically, in April 2008, the KK Group (via Peak Aksenger) purchased for approximately US$ 42 million the ‘Astana Contract Group’ which comprised Astana-Contract and its three subsidiaries, Astana-Contract LLP, Paragon and PD Logistics LLP. The Astana Contract Group was the largest logistics and warehouse operator in Central Asia and, as at April 2008, was the KK Group’s main competitor. At the time of its acquisition, Astana-Contract was owned by Mr Sergey Kushenov, Mr Vladimir Loskot, Mr Timur Bashev and Mr Erik Khasanov. In acquiring the Astana Contract Group, the KK Group acquired the logistics park in Almaty to which I have referred (comprising a full service container terminal near Almaty-1 train station and 48,000 m</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">During the early part of 2008 and prior to the acquisition, the KK Group provided funding of US$ 22 million to Astana-Contract because it urgently needed to refinance certain bank loans. The cash was used to repay Halyk Bank (US$ 14 million), ATF Bank (US$ 4 million), DBK (US$ 2 million) and other accounts payable (US$ 2 million). Furthermore, by the time of the acquisition, Astana-Contract and Paragon had taken out (in January 2008 and as co-borrowers) a loan from DBK in the amount of US$ 57.77 million for the purpose of constructing the Astana Project. It is this loan which is at the heart of the Astana 2 Claim since the Claimants’ case is that the Defendants caused Peak Aksenger to acquire Astana-Contract and Paragon in order to misappropriate the DBK loan monies by repeating their alleged </span>

Put shortly, the Claimants say that the general contractor appointed to the Astana Project, GS, was </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. The Claimants’ case is that at all material times the Defendants controlled Astana-Contract and Paragon by </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> relatives and associates as directors of those entities, including Yuri Bogday (a relative of Mr Zhunus) and Mr Tulegenov, and that the Defendants caused Astana-Contract and Paragon to enter into various contracts which I shall now describe. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The first aspect of the Astana 2 Claim concerns certain contracts for the manufacture of steel structures and construction work which were concluded between Astana-Contract and GS. The first of these contracts was entered into on 1 December 2008 in the amount of KZT 3,600,001,269/US$ 27.8 million and as to which there were seven addenda, the final one being dated 1 October 2009 (the ‘First GS Contract’). Having concluded this contract, GS entered into a sub-contract for the supply and installation of equipment with Regul on 26 December 2008 with a contract value of KZT 2,382,397,415/US$ 18.4 million (the ‘Regul Supply Sub-Contract’) and under that KZT 1.8 billion was paid to GS as a pre-payment (albeit that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva allege that by a letter to GS dated 11 September 2009 Astana-Contract cancelled part of the construction work which GS was to carry out under the First GS Contract because the work was to be carried out by a different contractor and requested a pro rata reduction in the contract price). The second contract was entered into on 15 April 2009, with supplementary contracts dated 25 May and 22 September 2009 with a value of KZT 3,493,725,916/US$ 27 million (the ‘Second GS Contract’), the Claimants’ case being that KZT 609,975,663 was paid to GS pursuant to this second contract, meaning that between the two contracts a total of KZT 2,409,975,663 was paid. The Claimants’ case is that GS was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“nothing more than a front and a vehicle for extracting money from [Astana-Contract] for the benefit of [the Defendants] and their associates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The Claimants rely upon various matters. First, they point to the fact that the logistics centre has never been constructed with only, the Claimants say, minimal (and preparatory) work carried out on a section of the 25-hectare plot. Secondly, they point to what they say is the absence of any tender process prior to the awarding of the contracts to GS. Thirdly, they highlight how, pursuant to the First GS Contract, GS was paid KZT 1.8 billion/US$ 13.9 million drawn down from the DBK loan between 1 December 2008 and March 2009 against what the Claimants maintain are false Acts of Acceptance and invoices raised by GS for work that had not been done. Similarly and fourthly, they say that, pursuant to the Second GS Contract, on 3 June 2009 KZT 589,975,664/US$ 4.56 million was drawn down from DBK and paid to GS against Acts of Acceptance which were also false with invoices again being raised for work which had not been done. Fifthly, the Claimants say that GS concluded the Regul Supply Sub-Contract in circumstances where Regul’s CEO was Mr Gerasimov, a close associate of Mr Arip, and Regul and GS shared a common director, Mr Meribek Kuanyshev. Lastly, the Claimants point to GS having made advance payments to Regul amounting to KZT 1,725,650,395 pursuant to the Regul Supply Sub-Contract notwithstanding that the completion certificates submitted by Regul only came to a total value of KZT 216,171,699. On the basis that KZT 1,542,000,000 was repaid to Astana-Contract, the Claimants’ position is that they are entitled to be compensated by reference to the difference between these two sums, namely KZT 867,975,664/US$6,721,928.</span>

The Claimants’ case as to this is that, the design work having been sub-contracted by TESS to Regul on 11 December 2008 for a price of KZT 68,049,605 (the ‘Regul Design Sub-Contract’) and Regul having sub-sub-contracted the work to Montazhprojekt for KZT 62,000,000, Astana-Contract is entitled to receive as compensation the difference between the sum which Astana-Contract paid to TESS (KZT 574,266,000/US$ 4.45 million) and the price which Regul paid to Montazhprojekt (KZT 62,000,000), namely KZT 512,266,000/US$ 3,967,179, on the basis that this was </span>

The Claimants’ case is that, although Astana-Contract paid NSA KZT 1,422,305,092/US$ 11.01 million between October 2009 and April 2010, NSA supplied no goods or services of any substantial value in return. In those circumstances, the Claimants’ case is that compensation is payable to reflect what had been paid essentially for nothing in return. They recognise, however, that that compensation needs to take account of various sums which were returned to the KK Group. Specifically, NSA paid KZT 1,255,625,600/US$ 9.72 million to Ada Trade LLP (‘Ada Trade’) which then paid KZT 927,900,000/US$ 7.18 million to Kazvtorsyrye LLP which in turn paid it to KK JSC and Kagazy Recycling, KZT 32,100,000/US$ 248,594 to KK JSC, and KZT 280,000,000/US$ 2.17 million to Holding Invest.  The amount sought in respect of this contract is, accordingly, not the full KZT 1,422,305,092 which Astana-Contract paid to NSA but that amount less what was repaid by Ada Trade, namely KZT 365,295,092/US$ 2.83 million. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“purely as an afterthought”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although that may be putting things a little too highly, it is nonetheless right to say that the Astana 2 Claim did not receive the same degree of attention as the PEAK and Land Plots Claims. Specifically, Mr Twigger submitted that the Claimants had failed to establish that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva controlled Astana-Contract and Paragon to such an extent that they caused those entities to enter into each of the contracts which I have described, nor that they had done so with the intent to misappropriate sums for their own benefit. Similarly, Mr Twigger suggested, it had not been shown that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva controlled each of GS, TESS, Regul and NSA such that they could procure the participation of those entities in the alleged fraud. Nor, Mr Twigger went on to submit, had it been demonstrated that those entities had not carried out the work or provided the services or goods they had purported to carry out or provide, in particular that the Acts of Acceptance against which payment was made were false. On the contrary, Mr Twigger submitted, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva were not directors of Astana-Contract or Paragon and so there is no reason to suppose that those companies entered into the contracts which they did because Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva caused them to do so. Likewise, so it was suggested, neither Mr Arip nor Ms Dikhanbayeva controlled GS, TESS, Regul or NSA, and there is no evidence to indicate that they had any involvement in the sub-contracting arrangements which those companies entered into with Regul and Montazhprojekt. Furthermore, Mr Twigger highlighted the fact that a number of the contracts, work completion certificates and payments were concluded or made after Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva had left the KK Group in July 2009 and after Mr Arip had sold his shares in September 2009. Furthermore, Mr Twigger submitted that there was clear evidence that substantial work was, in fact, done at Astana. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The backdrop to the Astana 2 Claim is highly suspicious. Specifically, Mr Howe submitted, correctly in my view, that the various money transfers which lie behind the three contracts which I have described and which were portrayed in an elaborate ‘spider’ chart (together with certain tables detailing the money transfers on a daily basis) prepared by Mr Crooks, reveal a carefully orchestrated scheme involving very large sums of money and co-ordinated actions amongst at least nine companies. Specifically, as the tables in particular show, between 21 December 2008 and 10 March 2009 KZT 1,320,000,000 of the funds drawn down by Astana Contract from DBK, purportedly for the Astana 2 project, was funnelled through GS and Regul to KK JSC. This is most odd since it is difficult to see why GS and Regul would, as Mr Werner put it in his first affidavit, be paying KK JSC what </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“must effectively have been its own money”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. GS and Regul were, after all, supposed to be acting as Astana-Contract’s contractor and sub-contractor respectively. The oddities do not stop there, however, since thereafter, KK JSC having made some small payments back to Regul between 10 March 2009 and 8 September 2009, what then happened is that the balance held by KK JSC as at 8 September 2009, KZT 1,240,000,000, weaved its way between 30 September 2009 and 19 October 2009 from KK JSC to Regul (through payments of KZT 300 million on 30 September 2009, KZT 100 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 180 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 317 million on 8 October 2009 and KZT 343 million on 12 October 2009), from Regul to GS (through payments of KZT 300 million on 1 October 2009, KZT 280 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 317 million on 8 October 2009 and KZT 343 million on 12 October 2009), from GS to Astana-Contract (through payments of KZT 300 million on 1 October 2009, KZT 280 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 317 million on 8 October 2009 and KZT 343 million on 13 October 2009), from Astana-Contract to NSA (through payments of KZT 300 million – or, more accurately, KZT 300,010,000 with the extra KZT 10,000 being repaid by NSA on 20 October 2009 - on 5 October 2009, KZT 280 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 317 million on 8 October 2009 and KZT 343 million on 13 October 2009), from NSA to Ada-Trade (through payments of KZT 280 million on 7 October 2009, KZT 280 million on 8 October 2009, KZT 220 million on 9 October 2009, KZT 97 million on 12 October 2009, KZT 343 million on 14 October 2009 and KZT 20 million on 16 October 2009), from Ada Trade to Kazvtorsyrye (through payments of KZT 247.9 million on 8 October 2009, KZT 220 million on 9 October 2009, KZT 97 million on 12 October 2009, KZT 343 million on 14 October 2009 and KZT 20 million on 19 October 2009), from Ada Trade to </span>

It will be recalled that Mr Gerasimov gave evidence concerning the large sum of money which Regul had received from GS sitting idly in Regul’s bank account and his decision, as a result, to transfer the money to KK JSC as temporary financial assistance, to be repaid in two or three months. Ms Dikhanbayeva essentially stated the same thing. The explanation was plainly, however, false since there was no time when a large sum of money was sitting idle in Regul’s bank account; on the contrary, apart from an initial payment of KZT 411,950,395, the monies passed straight through Regul to KK JSC, as Mr Howe put it, </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to Ada Trade, I have previously explained, when dealing with the evidence which was given by Ms Dikhanbayeva, how Ada Trade was one of the companies which she listed in her emails sent on 26 and 27 August 2009 (the latter being the email which starts with the words </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If the auditors are raising questions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">), so demonstrating that Ada Trade was another of the entities in relation to which she was in a position to give instructions concerning the drawing up of contracts and the like. It will be recalled that Ada Trade was also a company which made two interest-free loans loans to the Exillon Group, totalling in excess of US$ 5.7 million in 2009, which were described as being </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“expected to be re-assigned to Maksat Arip and repaid before the end of 2009”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Howe pointed out, Ada-Trade (together with Trading Company, Lotos and Kontakt Service Plus amongst others) was additionally a conduit for the payment of further funds into Exillon, as demonstrated by the table prepared by Mr Crooks compiled from Trading Company’s bank statements, which showed payments to Lotos, Ada Trade, and Kontakt Service Plus, as well as a number of KK Group companies. Mr Arip’s evidence was that these payments came from Barnard, his separate oil business and had nothing to do with the KK Group. Mr Arip, however, accepted that, Barnard having paid KZT 1.4 billion to Trading Company on or around 25 December 2008 supposedly as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“financial aid”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, the money </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“ended up in Russia, into the operations of this oil business”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It did so, Mr Arip explained, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not directly”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since there were some </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“steps in the middle”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Those steps included money being paid in tranches to a number of entities including Ada-Trade, Lotos and Kontakt Service Plus, so making it quite clear that these must have been entities controlled by Mr Arip. They were entities which, in the circumstances, Mr Howe appropriately described as </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There is, then, also as regards Ada Trade, Mr Gerasimov’s evidence to consider. Again, I have addressed this already but Mr Gerasimov’s initial insistence when being cross-examined (despite Mr Arip having belatedly</span>

It then, of course, emerged not only that Mr Gerasimov was, by his own admission at least, one of Ada Trade’s owners but also that Mr Kozhamberdiev, the other owner, was somebody whom Mr Gerasimov had met at the KK Group’s offices where Mr Kozhamberdiev was employed as a lawyer. This evidence provides strong support for the proposition that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva were the guiding minds behind the elaborate money dealings illustrated by Mr Crooks’ ‘spider’ chart. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the circumstances, I am not at all persuaded by Mr Arip’s protestations that he had no first-hand knowledge of the TESS Contract, the First and Second GS Contracts and the NSA Contract. The fact that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva (and other witneses called on their behalf) should have given dishonest evidence on these matters makes it very difficult to accept anything which they had to say in relation to the transactions which are the subject of the Astana 2 Claim. Furthermore, the fact that they also gave dishonest evidence concerning the PEAK Claim and, as I shall come on to explain later, the Land Plots Claim makes it all the more impossible to accept what they had to say in relation to the Astana 2 Claim. Similarly, the fact that the Astana 2 allegations have been considered by the criminal authorities and the courts in Kazakhstan, and no criminal prosecutions or findings of liability have ensued, a matter relied on by Mr Twigger, is hardly conclusive since it is for me to make my own determination based on the evidence before me. Accordingly, although Mr Twigger drew my attention to the fact that in 2011, following a complaint submitted by Ms Kogutyuk, the Almaty Financial Police investigated the Claimants’ allegations regarding embezzlement of funds by the management of Astana-Contract and concluded that the DBK funds received by Astana-Contract were used for the purpose of the Astana Project and there were insufficient grounds to initiate a criminal case, this can have no impact on the task which I must perform. Neither is it material that there were further investigations by the Astana and Almaty Financial Police in 2012 and 2013 which did not result in any criminal prosecutions, nor that civil proceedings brought by the Claimants against Mr Tulegenov, Ms Musagaliyeva and Mr Esimbekov resulted in no finding of liability.</span>

I referred to this in the context of the evidence in relation to that document which was given by Ms Dikhanbayeva. I reiterate that the fact that such a draft was on the KK Group’s systems seems to me to be significant, certainly given Ms Dikhanbayeva’s inability to offer any sensible explanation as to why it should be there if, as she insisted TESS was not a company which she and Mr Arip controlled. The linkage with TESS is, in short, made out. I shall come back shortly to address the question of what (if any) work was carried out by TESS.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As for GS, Mr Twigger highlighted that no allegations have been made by the Claimants against Mr Yuri Lavrov, described by Mr Gerasimov as the common shareholder of GS and Regul, or against Mr Dauren Khairullin, the General Director of GS. Mr Twigger submitted that, since it is the Claimants’ case that GS </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is the ‘Arka Stroy’ of the Astana Fraud”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, Mr Khairullin would have to have been connected to Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva yet this has not even been alleged, still less established on the evidence. I have taken this into account. The difficulty, however, as far as Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva are concerned, is that this is just one matter to take into account alongside others which seem to me to point quite conclusively to the arrangements with GS not being as independent as Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva would have it. Similarly, Mr Twigger also made the point that Mr Werner was wholly mistaken when he asserted that no tender process took place ahead of the appointment of GS since, although there are other board minutes suggesting that only GS was under consideration, the documents do appear to show there was a tender for the General Contractor role on the Astana Project. Indeed, Mr Twigger was able to point to the minutes of Astana-Contract’s tender committee meeting held on 28 November 2008, signed by Ms Dikhanbayeva along with six other members of the committee, which demonstrate that the other bidders included Angar-Stroy, SKG Kazakhstan, Demeukurylys and Parity-Ltd. Still, however, whether or not there was a tender is just one matter to consider. Against this, as Mr Howe submitted, it is wholly unclear how it came to be that GS was paid more even than it sought in the various invoices which it submitted to Astana-Contract. So, for example, as regards the First GS Contract, despite the acceptance certificates adding up to KZT 1,349,098,721 and seven invoices being submitted by GS reflecting those acceptance certificates (and that amount), GS was, in fact, paid the US$ 1.8 billion to which I have previously referred in three instalments in December 2008 (KZT 480 million), January 2009 (KZT 480 million) and in March 2009 (KZT 840 million). This represented an overpayment of just under KZT 451 million. There was then a further overpayment in relation to the Second GS Contract. Accordingly, GS ultimately returned KZT 1.542 billion to Astana-Contract between June 2009 and October 2009. Even leaving aside whether any meaningful construction work was carried out by GS, a matter to which I shall return, why things should have happened in this way is suspicious to say the least. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This leaves NSA. Mr Twigger submitted that there is no evidence of any linkage between NSA and Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. He dismissed the suggestion, in particular, that it is sufficient for Mr Howe to point to the fact that NSA paid KZT 1,255,625,600/US$ 9.72 million to Ada Trade, having between 5 October and 30 April 2010 received from Astana-Contract KZT 1,422,305,092/US$ 11.01 million under the NSA Contract. I have already dealt with Ada Trade. I agree with Mr Twigger, however, that a linkage between that company and Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva is not sufficient in isolation, even taken with the fact of the payments made to Ada Trade by NSA, to establish a linkage between NSA and Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. The starting point, however, given the other linkages which I have described, the more so given Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s insistence that they had nothing to do with the various complicated transactions which I have also described, must be one of suspicion concerning what was happening in relation to those transactions. Ultimately, however, central to the Astana 2 Claim is the Claimants’ assertion that the construction works for which they paid were not actually carried out or, if they were, only to a minimal degree. Only if the Claimants are right about this, will it be necessary to consider other aspects of the Astana 2 Claim. Equally, if works were carried out and those works have a value, the consequence will be, as Mr Howe acknowledged and consistent with my approach in relation to Akzhal-1/Akzhal-2, that the size of the claim will fall to be reduced accordingly. It is, therefore, important to consider the evidence concerning the construction work which was performed.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The only expert evidence on this question came from Mr Jackson since I was informed by Mr Howe that funding issues meant that the Claimants were not in a position to maintain instructions to Mr Tapper to carry out an equivalent valuation to that performed by Mr Jackson. In such circumstances and since also Mr Howe did not cross-examine Mr Jackson in relation to his Astana valuation, it is not really open to the Court to reach a conclusion which is at odds with Mr Jackson’s valuation in the sum of KZT 933,739,306/US$ 7.23 million (inclusive of VAT). Three points nonetheless arise. First, Mr Jackson’s valuation does not include any costs associated with design work. Secondly, there is an issue as to whether credit ought to be given in respect of steel and machinery which was at one stage on site. Thirdly, for reasons which I have previously explained, I consider that Mr Tapper’s approach to rates is to be preferred. Although Mr Tapper has not produced an alternative valuation based on his preferred rates (and unit rates), it would make little sense if Mr Jackson’s valuation as regards Astana were not revised to take account of the matters which I have previously identified. Fourthly, although Mr Twigger is right to observe that the point was not put to Mr Jackson in cross-examination, there is an issue concerning when the works identified by Mr Jackson, and which he has valued, were carried out. I need say no more about the third matter. I do, however, need to address the first, second and fourth matters. I start with the fourth but, as a general point, I agree with Mr Twigger that, in view of Mr Jackson’s valuation, the Claimants cannot make out their case that no meaningful work was carried out or that no materials were supplied. Specifically, the suggestions in opening which Mr Howe made that the construction works performed by GS were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“worth (at most) just over US$1 million”</span>

This, Mr Howe submitted, is consistent with an email which was sent on 7 May 2010 by Astana-Contract’s former President, Ms Musagalieva, to Ms Dikhanbayeva and Mr Tulegenov and in which she explained that, following a technical audit, it had not been possible to prove how US$ 4 million of the US$ 22 million DBK loan had been used.

But what I also heard, roughly the same time, from Mr Gerasimov, because that was quite an issue in that period of time, he said that actually also position of the DBK was inadequate, because what had been happening is that bank experienced some liquidity problems, they didn’t want to continue projects, they didn’t want to disclose, they were simply reluctant to admit that money was spent. So it was kind of back and forward with the bank, everyone understood nothing was stolen, but I had been under pressure just to find money and give cash to the company, and these people were under pressure, they were threatened, they was panicking with all kinds of investigations which might come from the company or from the bank, and which later on actually has happened, there was a lot of litigation about this money and criminal investigation about this money.

I do not consider that they do. Ms Musagalieva’s reference to US$ 4.5 million has the appearance of an estimation. It would be wrong, in my view, therefore, to treat it as being too exact. Mr Jackson’s valuation is, in my view, obviously more reliable. </span>

Mr Howe relied for these purposes on passages in Mr Jackson’s report which he suggested should be taken as Mr Jackson saying that most of the works now visible at Astana 2 were carried out after 1 June 2010 and before 11 November 2010.

I agree also with Mr Twigger that this timeline is consistent with all of the payments made under the contracts, in that those made to TESS on 14 August 2008 included payments for design work, those made to GS ran throughout the period of the preparatory and main work, and those made to NSA also ran throughout the period of the bulk of the work.

T&amp;M subsequently, in a further report, described there as being 2 travelling cranes of 50 tonne lifting capacity stored on the site with some components also being stored at Akzhal. Subsequently, in 2013 Bereke-Kab photographed materials on site such as metal sections, trusses and beams, gantry crane elements, corrugated sheets, temporary fencing and mineral wool sandwich panels.

I agree with Mr Howe, however, that it is unclear how the emails which Mr Werner was asked about can really be thought to be reliable evidence of anything, in particular whether as to the quantity of steel on the Astana 2 site or its value or who supplied it. I am, accordingly, not disposed to place any reliance on those emails. The more so, in circumstances where, as Mr Howe went on to point out, on any view, their contents are not readily reconciled with the fact that GS received in net terms US$ 6.7 million, and not US$ 30 million or more. </span>

It was Mr Twigger’s submission that, since the design documents were not before the Court and neither expert had undertaken an analysis of that documentation, the Claimants should be regarded as having failed to prove that TESS did not undertake design work or that it was not worth what was paid to Regul for it. Mr Twigger relied, for these purposes, on certain evidence which was given by Mr Gerasimov, who explained how Regul won a sub-contract from TESS in relation to the design documents. In particular, when being cross-examined about this, Mr Gerasimov explained that, although Regul did not have skills in this area, it did have a design licence and it wanted to expand its business and begin to undertake design work. So it was, Mr Gerasimov went on, that Regul sub-contracted its part of the work to Montazhprojekt which meant its </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“margin was relatively low”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but that Regul </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There are, however, a number of significant difficulties with this explanation, not least the fact that it can hardly be a coincidence that Regul should have won a sub-contract with TESS as well as a sub-contract with GS. That, however, on Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case is the explanation. The fact that Regul managed to enter into both sub-contracts, one in relation to design work in which it had no experience, within just a couple of weeks of each other (with TESS on 11 December 2008 and with GS on 26 December 2008) makes the coincidence all the more implausible. Secondly, it is striking that, although Mr Gerasimov explained that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Regul won a sub-contract from TESS for a part of the designs after it submitted the most competitive bid”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, there is no documentary evidence to support any such bid having been made. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, there is the fact that the sub-contract which Regul entered into with TESS (the Regul Design Sub-Contract) entailed TESS agreeing to pay Regul just KZT 68,049,605 despite having entered into a contract (the TESS Contract) where the price was as much as KZT 574,266,000 and so almost nine times as much. The fact, in these circumstances, that Regul then sub-sub-contracted the design work to Montazhproject for KZT 62,000,000 is really neither here nor there. What matters, as Mr Howe submitted, is that TESS was paid approximately US$ 4.45 million by Astana-Contract for work which was sub-sub-contracted to Montazhproject at a cost of just US$ 480,000 or so, meaning that TESS was able to retain approximately US$ 3.9 million out of the funds which Astana-Contract had received from the DBK loan facility.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger sought to meet this last point by suggesting that the payment of KZT 574,266,000 made by Astana-Contract to TESS was not only for design services, but was also for construction work. He pointed out in this context that the TESS Contract was amended by an Addendum dated 12 November 2008 which specified that KZT 452,380,000 (inclusive of VAT) was payable to TESS for development of the detailed project design and that KZT 368,000,000 (inclusive of VAT) was payable for construction. He then explained, again basing himself on what was stated in the Business Audit Report, that those sums were then reduced in a Second Addendum dated 7 August 2009 which specified that KZT 206,266,000 (inclusive of VAT) was payable to TESS for development of the detailed project design and KZT 368,000,000 (inclusive of VAT) was payable for construction work. He also relied upon relevant completion acts supporting the performance of that construction. It was because of this non-design work, Mr Twigger submitted, that certain payments came to be made by TESS to two sub-contractors, namely Aspen Kurylys Company LLP (‘Aspen’) and Sarbaz (or Sabeez) LLP (‘Sarbaz’), for construction services on 15 August 2008. Specifically, Sarbaz received one payment of KZT 130,976,400 on 15 August 2008 pursuant to an agreement dated 12 August 2008 described as being for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“construction services”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, and Aspen received three payments on the same day, namely KZT 141,223,000 pursuant to an agreement dated 12 August 2008 for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“construction services”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, KZT 150,450,000 pursuant to an agreement dated 15 August 2008 for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“construction services”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and KZT 150,450,000 pursuant to an agreement dated 14 August 2008 for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“construction services”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger submitted that, since it had not been suggested by Mr Howe that these companies were somehow connected with the Defendants, there is no reason to treat the payments to them as being anything other than legitimate. The difficulty with this, however, is that the payments to Sarbaz and Aspen were each made only a matter of days after the TESS Contract had been entered into (on 11 August 2008) and so several months before any addendum was entered into which expanded the scope of the TESS Contract beyond design work. In these circumstances, I am clear that it would not be right to proceed on the basis that the payments were in respect of construction services.   </span>

The question which then remains is whether, given Mr Jackson’s evidence that works were carried out, this means that there cannot have been the fraudulent conduct which has been alleged by the Claimants against the Defendants. In my view, the answer to this is that there can be, predominantly because (despite their denials) it is quite clear that Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva were behind the numerous transfers. The fact that construction work was carried out is not what is important. What matters is whether such work was anything more than ‘window dressing’. As to this, although Mr Twigger placed significant reliance on the Acts of Acceptance which are in existence, in circumstances where neither Mr Thompson nor Mr Tapper is in a position to vouch for the accuracy of these documents or, indeed, their genuineness, the safest course is for the Court to proceed on the basis that Mr Jackson’s valuation (as modified to reflect rates revisions) is the most reliable guide to the level of works carried out at Astana. </span>

By this, I mean, of course, the difference between the amount which Astana-Contract expended in relation to the TESS Contract, the First and Second GS Contracts and the NSA Contract, less amounts returned to the Claimants, and the value of the works which were carried out as valued by Mr Jackson. </span>

Mr Twigger nonetheless submitted that the fraud which the Claimants have alleged makes little sense and is inherently unlikely when considered in context since it entailed, if the Claimants are right, the Defendants having caused Peak Aksenger to spend US$ 42 million buying Astana-Contract and Paragon in April 2008 in order to gain access to the DBK loan facility in order to misappropriate a much smaller amount, some US$ 13.45 million, when it would have been so much easier, if the Defendants were fraudulently inclined as suggested, for them not to have spent US$ 42 million buying Astana-Contract and Paragon but instead simply to have misappropriated that much larger amount of money. The answer to this, however, is that the alternative fraud suggested by Mr Twigger would, no doubt, have been rather more easily detectable.

In the circumstances, as with the PEAK Claim (and, indeed, the Land Plots Claim), there is no need for me to make any determination concerning Astana-Contract’s and Paragon’s (alternative) unjust enrichment claims brought under Articles 953, 955 and 956 of the KCC.</span>

Proving such causal link under Kazakh law requires demonstrating with evidence (e.g., technical and economic calculations) that, if not for the unlawful conduct, the business would have generated income that could have been used to repay the loan and pay interest, and the default interest and penalties would not have been imposed by the bank. </span>

Mr Twigger’s submission was that there is no evidence to show that particular sums drawn down were paid to Arka-Stroy at all nor that any sums returned by Arka-Stroy have not been included within the amount on which interest is claimed. I cannot accept that Mr Twigger is right about this, however, since I detect no such requirement in Professor Suleimenov’s description of the appropriate approach to be adopted in the passages from his third report at paragraphs 145 to 150 which I have set out above. In such circumstances, I agree with Mr Howe when he submitted that there is no need for some sort of tracing exercise, and that the question is simply whether the losses in question were incurred as a result of the Defendants’ wrongdoing.

The following figures, which are figures verified by Mr Crooks and which differ to some degree to what is in the Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, will, accordingly and on any view, need to be adapted to reflect what I have decided in relation to the Astana 2 Claim: interest in the sum of KZT 853,966,842 paid by Astana-Contract and Paragon to DBK up until October 2009; penalties in the sum of US$ 14,203,000 payable by Astana-Contract and Paragon to DBK up until October 2009; and default interest in the sum of US$ 15.824 million payable by Astana-Contract and Paragon to DBK and Investment Fund of Kazakhstan (‘IFK’) which acquired the liabilities from DBK in 2013. Even these figures do not, however, reflect what is claimed because, as Mr Tapper explained, they need to be apportioned to reflect a comparison between what is recoverable in respect of the Astana 2 Claim and the amount of the loan from DBK.

Mr Thompson then reviewed the available material and so his evidence needs also to be considered. The upshot of Mr Thompson’s work was that, although he was able to verify the majority of the interest payments to Alliance Bank, he could only verify about half of the interest payments to DBK. Moreover, he was unable to find evidence that penalty and default interest would be payable. Specifically, in relation to the PEAK Claim, as Mr Twigger pointed out in closing, Mr Thompson identified that PEAK paid interest in the sum of KZT 1,932,243,207 to Alliance Bank in respect of loans drawn down under credit line 1928 S/06 during the period of the Defendants’ management but excluded from consideration a further sum of KZT 19,801,590 which was paid between 15 May 2012 and 27 June 2012 in respect of a loan entered into on 5 November 2010 when the Defendants were no longer at the KK Group. As for interest payments in the sum of KZT 16.319 million from KK JSC to Alliance Bank, Mr Thompson was unable to identify actual proof of payment but that he had seen accounting entries in KK JSC’s and PEAK’s 1C databases where such payments appear. As for default interest and penalties, Mr Thompson’s position was that he understood Alliance Bank not to be enforcing those liabilities following entry into a Co-operation Agreement on 4 September 2014 (the ‘2014 Co-Operation Agreement’) to which I shall return. Lastly, as to payments from KK JSC to the Third Issue Bondholders, Mr Thompson identified payments totalling KZT 1,163,763,435 but not otherwise and queried the relevance of entries in certain 1C database extracts relied upon by Mr Crooks in circumstances where those indicate that payments were made by other companies in the KK Group which are not amongst the Claimants.</span>

In relation to penalties and default interest due to DBK, however, Mr Thompson’s position, as described in the experts’ joint statement, was that, although he agreed that penalties and default interest in the sums of US$ 14,203,000 and US$ 15,824,000 respective </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me, however, to the question of causation which I propose to address by dealing, first, with the single objection which Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva take concerning the Astana 2 Claim. This is the point to which Mr Thompson referred concerning KK JSC’s Rehabilitation Plan, specifically the fact that on page 8 of this document there is a footnote explaining that the list of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“short-term part of interest bearing loans”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> set out in Table 1</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “does not include the debt to IFK due to the bankruptcy of Astana-Contract Group of Companies”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger suggested to Mr McGregor that this reflects the reality that there was no continuing liability on Astana-Contract or Paragon’s part to IFK. He also put it to Mr McGregor that, furthermore, Astana-Contract and Paragon (described by Mr McGregor as</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “empty shells with no assets and no business”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) having assigned the Astana 2 Claims to KK Plc, any monies recovered will not go to Astana-Contract or Paragon (and so onwards to IFK). I agree with Mr Howe, however, that this does not matter since all that is important is that the liabilities came into existence. Astana-Contract and Paragon were entitled to enter into the assignment arrangements which they did. The fact that they did so does not in and of itself mean that the liabilities to IFK came to an end. It would be very odd were it to be the case that an assignment has the effect that the claim which is assigned (or part of that claim) comes to an end. Indeed, Mr Twigger cited no authority, whether under Kazakh or English law, to suggest otherwise. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As for the PEAK Claim, Mr Twigger made a number of criticisms concerning Mr McGregor’s evidence, including in relation to Mr McGregor’s reliance, in putting together the details of the amounts claimed, on the Co-Operation Agreement entered into on 4 September 2014 to which I have previously referred when setting out what Mr Thompson had to say concerning the verification exercise which he performed. That agreement was concluded between KK Plc, KK JSC, Peak LLP and Peak Akzhal and Alliance Bank. Importantly, it refers by way of background in recital B to the underlying credit line No. 1928 C/06 dated 1 November 2006, a contract which Mr Twigger was right to observe in closing Mr McGregor appeared not to know very much about, his position, rather, being that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“what had happened before is of course rolled up”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> into the 2014 Co-Operation Agreement (and, at least as I understood it, a settlement agreement described in the 2014 Co-Operation Agreement as a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Termsheet Agreement”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> entered into on 11 July 2014). He described this as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the very start of that particular journey”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, by which he explained that he meant that the 2014 Co-Operation Agreement was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“based on the loan agreements that were originally entered into and everything else which has happened since those were entered into, and this is the place that you’ve come to”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger’s response was to suggest that, as a lawyer, Mr McGregor should not have accepted </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“what the other side say”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but should have checked that it was right. Mr Twigger was referring here to the fact that the Co-Operation Agreement described there as being a penalty liability of KZT 7.232 billion and a default interest liability of KZT 2.72 billion. Mr McGregor admitted, however, that he just assumed that this judgment related to sums drawn down for the purpose of developing the PEAK construction projects. I consider, however, that Mr Twigger’s criticism in this respect was not warranted. Mr McGregor was, in my view, quite entitled to approach the matter in the way which he described.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In any event, in view of the verification exercise carried out by Mr Crooks, it is clear that nothing turns on Mr Twigger’s criticism of Mr McGregor in this respect. In particular, although Mr Howe was concerned at one stage that Mr Twigger might seek to argue (as Mr Thompson had implied in his first report) that the 2014 Co-Operation Agreement entailed the KZT 7.232 billion by way of penalties and the KZT 2.72 billion by way of default interest being written off by Alliance Bank, that was not ultimately an argument which Mr Twigger put forward other than, perhaps, in a footnote and in something of a throwaway reference to penalties and default interest having been </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“relinquished”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> pursuant to the 2014 Co-Operation Agreement. That is, however, an argument which does not work since, as Mr Howe pointed out, the clause providing for a mutual release between the KK Group and Alliance Bank, Clause 6.1, was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Subject to the complete performance by all relevant KK Group entities of their obligations under clauses 2.1 to 2.10 … together with complete performance by Alliance of its obligations under clauses 2.12 to 2.16 …”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, and those provisions required the Claimants, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“In the event that any one or more of the KK Claimants is awarded judgment or reaches a settlement…in respect of the PEAK Claim” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">to pay over the fruits of any such judgment or settlement. Since there has to date been no judgment or settlement of the PEAK Claim, and so there has been no payment of any proceeds to Alliance Bank, it necessarily follows that there cannot have been any release pursuant to Clause 6.1.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the event, Mr Twigger advanced really only two causation arguments over and above his contention, which I have rejected, that the Claimants need to show that particular sums drawn down are referable to particular amounts which have been misappropriated. The first point was very generalised. It was that the Defendants’ wrongdoing did not amount to the sole cause of any inability to repay the Alliance Bank (and, for that matter, the DBK) loans since there is also the global financial crisis to consider as that was also likely to have had a severe negative impact upon the Claimants’ ability to repay. I regard this as an argument which is simply too vague. In any event, as Professor Suleimenov has explained, the inability to repay need not have been exclusively caused by a defendant’s wrongdoing in order for a claim to succeed. In any event, on the evidence, it is quite clear that the substantial cause (if not the sole cause) of the inability to repay was the fact that there had been extraction of funds on a large scale as alleged by the Claimants. </span>

Indeed, Mr McGregor confirmed that he had not seen this agreement until it was referred to in Defendants’ written opening submissions. Nor, he also confirmed, had he been aware of a document apparently prepared by Ms Yelgeldieva for the KK Group’s auditors in April 2013, in which she stated as follows:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> had not been fulfilled. Mr McGregor’s perfectly reasonable response was to say that he did not know but that, in effect, what mattered to him was that in 2014 Alliance Bank was operating on the basis that there was still a liability. Again, it seems to me that Mr McGregor was entitled to take this view since, as Mr Howe pointed out in closing, there is no evidence to indicate whether the pre-conditions were fulfilled or not other than Ms Yelgeldieva’s statement in her note that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“all penalties that were charged for the Group during the default period were cancelled” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">and her reference to the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> in 2011. In short, I am not persuaded that the 2010 Co-Operation Agreement has been demonstrated to have brought to an end the relevant liabilities. Nor do I agree with Mr Twigger’s related submission that it is not open to the Claimants to claim in respect of penalties and interest in circumstances where in May 2012 it became apparent that the restructuring had failed and the KK Group defaulted on the restructured loan on the basis, so Mr Twigger argued, that any wrongdoing committed by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva in relation to the PEAK Claim can only have caused the penalties and default interest that accrued following the KK Group’s default in the third quarter of 2009 and any failure to perform to the level intended when restructuring in late 2010 was nothing to do with Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. The more so, Mr Twigger suggested, given that the principal sum had been increased by the refinanced sums under the Eurasian loans. The answer to this submission is that the Eurasian loan was entered into, and drawn down, under the Defendants’ management, as Mr Thompson himself confirmed. It was, accordingly, a loan which, as Mr Howe put it, the Claimants </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“were saddled with”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that is why it came to be refinanced pursuant to the 2010 Cooperation Agreement and a related Loan Agreement entered into on 5 November 2010. It did not entail any fresh lending. In such circumstances, bearing in mind that the Claimants’ ability to recover interest and penalties as damages is not contingent on them being able to establish that the amounts misappropriated were the very amounts borrowed, it must follow that Mr Twigger’s ‘break in the chain of causation’ argument cannot succeed. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Turning to the Land Plots Claim, it will be recalled that this entails the allegation that the Defendants used nominee companies to acquire land plots cheaply from farmers in Kazakhstan which were then re-sold to KK JSC, ostensibly for development, at highly inflated prices. Specifically, the Claimants say that, at the instigation of the Defendants, KK JSC paid out a net total of KZT 6,344,103,952/US$ 52.097 million to three entities associated with the Defendants, namely CBC, Bolzhal and Holding Invest, purportedly in payment for the purchase of fourteen land plots, and that those three entities then paid on US$ 44.29 million to seven further entities associated with the Defendants (Lotos, TEW, Trading Company, Ritek, Mouli, Biznes-Privat and TESS), each of which also features (along with CBC, Bolzhal and Holding Invest) in the PEAK Claim.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. He was right about this, as demonstrated by the fact that Mr Twigger’s focus in his submissions was on explaining that the land plot transactions which are the subject of the Land Plots Claim were unexceptional and legitimate from a commercial perspective. Specifically, Mr Twigger suggested that they were entered into at a time when Kazakhstan was experiencing an unprecedented economic boom and when KK JSC had good liquidity relative to its competitors which meant that acquiring more land was commercially sensible. If, Mr Twigger suggested, the land plots were acquired at the peak of a turning market, that was not clear at the time and anyway does not warrant a conclusion that there was fraud on the Defendants’ part. Moreover, Mr Twigger submitted, the structure used for the purchases was not uncommon in Kazakhstan at the time and had, indeed, been used by the KK Group itself when acquiring other land plots.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This, then, is what needs to be considered in deciding the liability question. Depending on the answer to that question, there is a further issue requiring determination as regards quantum. The Claimants’ case is that the entire amount (KZT 6,344,103,952/US$ 52.097 million) which was paid by KK JSC to CBC, Bolzhal and Holding Invest has been misappropriated since there was no sound commercial reason for the purchase of the land plots. Alternatively, the Claimants say that only limited credit should be given to reflect the limited value of the land plots which were acquired. Applying Mr Mayhew’s valuation and focusing on the land plots purchased via CBC and Bolzhal (ignoring, therefore, for reasons which will become apparent, Holding Invest), the Claimants’ position is that the damages recoverable will reduce by approximately US$ 9.755 million so bringing the claim down to something in the region of US$ 40.42 million, whereas adopting Mr Kuznetsov’s approach, and depending on what date is taken in relation to valuation, the amount recoverable would either be approximately KZT 4,180,535,020/US$ 34.2 million or KZT 3,716,899,719/US$ 30.33 million. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">It can be seen, therefore, that, at least in relation to the Claimants’ alternative case, the dispute is relatively limited, subject only to the Claimants being right on the relevant dates to use for valuation purposes. I shall return to that aspect of the quantum issue later, after first dealing with the question of liability, but it is convenient to deal with the question of whether any credit at all should be given right away since I am clear that the Claimants are not right about this. Mr Howe submitted that it would be inappropriate to require that credit be given for two reasons. First, Mr Howe suggested that the Defendants having (so it is alleged) organised a scheme which involved the land plots being acquired for very little and then sold to KK JSC for far more, in circumstances where there is no proper record to show how the monies paid by KK JSC were actually spent, the Court should infer that all of the monies were misappropriated. Secondly, Mr Howe submitted that, since the land plots which were purchased were useless, they should be regarded as being of no value to KK JSC. I cannot, however, accept that either of these reasons justifies the approach which was urged upon me by Mr Howe. As to the first, whatever criticism might be made as to how the land plot transactions came about, the fact is that KK JSC has acquired ownership of the land plots through the arrangements which were put in place. There must, therefore, have been some payments made to the owners of the land plots. It is, accordingly, unrealistic to adopt an approach which entails a conclusion that the Defendants misappropriated everything which KK JSC paid to CBC, Bolzhal and Holding Invest. As to the second of Mr Howe’s points, KK JSC having become the owner of some 142 hectares of land adjacent, or proximate, to land which had previously been acquired, it simply makes no sense to attribute no value at all to that land. I am clear, in the circumstances, that credit should be given, and so that the Claimants’ primary case as to quantum should not succeed. As I say, I shall come back to what this means in financial terms. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the liability question and focusing in the first instance on the transactions involving CBC and Bolzhal, rather than Holding Invest in relation to which the position is not on all fours, the context is important, at least on the Claimants’ case, since they say that the relevant transactions were part and parcel of a dishonest scheme designed to misappropriate the very substantial sums of money which were achieved through the IPO which took place in July 2007 and which raised proceeds of approximately US$ 273 million. Specifically and, as will appear, this is relevant also to the limitation issue, Mr Howe drew attention to the fact that the investigation into the Land Plots Claim arose out of a Grant Thornton report dated 11 November 2014 which had been commissioned in order to investigate the movement and destination of funds raised in KK Plc’s IPO, including funds which were distributed to KK JSC which received, in all, some US$ 154.6 million in various tranches distributed between 28 July 2007 and 27 June 2008. Accordingly, part of Grant Thornton’s work was to look into what happened to those monies, in particular to identify so-called </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Secondary Recipients”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Grant Thornton discovered that outward payments of incoming IPO monies were made by KK JSC very shortly after they had been received, and that these included substantial payments to Bolzhal, CBC and Holding Invest, as follows: in the case of Bolzhal, monies totalling (when converted to US Dollars) US$ 35.8 million; in the case of CBC, monies totalling US$ 6.9 million; and in the case of Holding Invest, KZT 230,880,000/US$ 1.9 million. Subsequently, Mr Crooks and Mr Thompson have found (and agreed) that the sums paid to Bolzhal and CBC were, in fact, greater: KZT 4,388,247,952/US$ 36,366,760 in the case of Bolzhal; and KZT 1,724,976,000/US$ 13,815,274 in the case of CBC. These revised amounts are the amounts which the Claimants identify as having been paid out by KK JSC in relation to land plot transactions which were not all that they seemed to be.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the detail of those land plot transactions, in order to understand them, it is necessary to explain something about the structure which was employed. I shall do this by largely basing what follows on the useful summary in Mr Howe’s written closing submissions which was itself based on what Mr Jumadilov described in his first witness statement, although I shall have to come back later to consider the use of that structure in the context of various criticisms which Mr Howe made of it. Step 1 entailed land plots which were not already in private ownership being acquired by farmers which was their statutory right, with the land brokers assisting in this process, at first funding the acquisition process but later using the funds advanced by KK JSC to CBC and Bolzhal. Step 2 consisted of the farmer owners selling the land plots to CBC’s and Bolzhal’s respective nominees, namely Mr Esperov and Mr Shabadanov, such transactions taking place between 11 October 2007 and 2 June 2008. I shall come back to this, but Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s position is that the amounts specified in the land sale and purchase agreements with the farmers did not reflect the actual price of the Land Plots owing to what was described as a widespread practice in Kazakhstan which allowed sellers to pay less tax on sale proceeds and addressed security concerns about receiving large sums of money. Step 3 involved the nominees contributing the land plots into the charter capital of CBC or Bolzhal in transactions which occurred between 7 December 2007 and 12 December 2008, something which Mr Mayhew acknowledged was a</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “market practice”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Again, I shall come back to this because, notably, Mr Twigger made no mention of the amounts recorded by way of contribution in his summary or, indeed, anywhere in his written closing submissions. Step 4 then entailed CBC and Bolzhal entering into sale and purchase contracts with KK JSC pursuant to which they sold the land plots to KK JSC. Those transactions occurred between 19 February 2008 and 23 February 2009 and, so Mr Twigger suggested, amounted to necessary formalities (and no more) in order to complete the process of registering the land plots under KK JSC’s ownership.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Specifically, again as helpfully explained by Mr Twigger in his written closing submissions, the land plots transactions comprising Step 2 were funded by KK JSC pursuant to preliminary agreements for the sale and purchase relating to the land plots which were entered into between CBC/Bolzhal and KK JSC. Accordingly, on 7 September 2007, KK JSC entered into such an agreement with CBC in relation to five land plots for a sum of KZT 1,724,976,000, which Mr Twigger described as ‘Group 1’. Although the timings do not make a great deal of sense, this is consistent with what was proposed at a meeting of KK JSC’s board on 25 September 2007, those minutes identifying the plots not by number but by hectare size. This was followed by </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Agreement No.3 for Contribution of Real Estate Charter Capital”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> dated 7 December 2007, under which Mr Esperov (Ms Dikhanbayeva’s then husband) delivered four land plots (nos. 058-173, 058-634, 058-475 and 058-476) to CBC by way of an equity contribution (Step 3). In the same way, land plot no. 058-424 was the subject of a separate equity contribution agreement dated 15 February 2008. Step 4 then saw KK JSC and CBC, on 19 February 2008, enter into separate contracts for the sale of four of the land plots by CBC to KK JSC, with a Ms Abekova (a KK Group employee) signing on behalf of CBC, and the following month, on 10 March 2008, entering into a similar</span>

After the increases agreed on 7 April 2009, KK JSC ended up paying ten times as much – although, after taking account of certain adjustments, the total net payment which KK JSC made (as agreed by Mr Crooks and Mr Thompson) in relation to these and the other Bolzhal-related land plots amounted to KZT 4,388,247,952. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">These are very substantial differences which, in truth, it is difficult to see can be justified. Mr Twigger sought to justify the differences by reference to what he suggested was (and possibly still is) a widespread practice in Kazakhstan which allows sellers of land to pay less tax on sale proceeds and address security concerns connected with receiving large sums of money. As a result, the actual price of the sale was recorded on handwritten receipts, in case it was necessary to prove the transfer of these funds at a later date, rather than in any sale and purchase agreement. Mr Twigger submitted, therefore, that the fact that the prices paid to the farmers (in the instances where they are known) appear to be so much lower than the prices paid by KK JSC is misleading. Mr Twigger relied in this context on the evidence which was given by Mr Mamedov, the farmer who was one of the holders of the largest land plots with a total area of 33.12 hectares and cadastral no. 03-047-058-634 which he sold to CBC. As I have explained, however, I find it hard to accept that Mr Mamedov really can have been paid over US$ 1 million in respect of his share of the land plot sale. This is a substantial amount of money which it is difficult to see can really have been spent, as Mr Mamedov suggested, within a couple of months. As I have also noted, Mr Mamedov still lives in the same house where he has always lived. Moreover, if he did receive as much money as he suggested, then, it makes no sense at all that Mr Mamedov should have gone on to say that, if he had been the only owner of the land plot, he would not have sold it but continued to farm it. As Mr Howe submitted, this rather suggests that the price he and his relatives received cannot have been that attractive. Furthermore, again as Mr Howe submitted, if prices were truly as high as Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva would have it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“there would be a lot of extremely rich farmers in the region around the Aksenger site”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> yet there is no evidence that this is the case, with photographs taken of the houses lived in by the farmers who sold some of the land plots indicating that they continue to live in a frugal manner. In this regard, I should say that I afford only modest weight to the evidence which was given by Mr Khashimov and Mr Nagashibaev, the security guards who visited certain of the farmers who sold land plots. This is because, as I have explained, I agree with Mr Twigger that their evidence is open to some doubt and is, in any event, hearsay. I am satisfied, however, that, even without the evidence given by Mr Khashimov and Mr Nagashibaev, the position is clear: the farmers cannot have been paid as much money as Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva would have it. I might add that I am not swayed from this conclusion by Mr Twigger’s reliance on the evidence given by Mr Jumadilov to the effect that the actual purchase price paid to the farmers was between US$ 1,500 and US$ 3,000 per sotka (i.e. 100 square metres of land) and, in some instances, was as high as US$ 5,000 per sotka once the farmers began to realise that the KK Group was buying up land since, as I have previously explained, Mr Jumadilov was a witness whose reliability is open to very considerable doubt.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The vast disparity between the prices paid to the original sellers and the prices paid by KK JSC to Bolzhal and CBC is not readily explained. It cannot be the result of agents’ fees since Mr Jumadilov’s evidence (which in this respect there is no particular reason to doubt) was that such fees were typically </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“around 5% of the land plots sales price”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to KK JSC. Clearly, fees at that type of level cannot be the reason for such disparity. Nor can the reason be explained by bribes or </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“facilitation payments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since there is no suggestion that these would be at such a scale. Nor, also, can the commission payments allegedly paid to the ‘Kazakh LLPs’ for converting the monies paid by KK JSC into cash account for the divergence, not least because it appears from the evidence which Mr Atashev, like Mr Jumadilov one of the land brokers involved, would have given had he attended the trial, that a fee of only some 3% would typically be payable. As Mr Howe pointed out, the simple fact is that in the only cases where original sale and purchase contracts have been located, namely in relation to the six land plots which are listed in the second of the tables above, 57.72 hectares, in total, were purchased for, again in total, KZT 231,967,400. This works out at an average price per hectare of KZT 4,018,839 or approximately KZT 40,000/US$ 350 per sotka. Even though this may not be the most reliable source, it nonetheless provides some sort of indication as to what was paid, which is very substantially less than what KK JSC paid to CBC or Bolzhal. This, combined with the disparity which is apparent from the first of the tables above as between what was paid by KK JSC to CBC and the level of equity contribution to CBC’s capital, calls very much into question the propriety of what was happening in relation to the land plot transactions. In any event, even if Mr Twigger was right to submit that the farmers must have been paid more since it should be assumed that they must have had some idea as to what their land was worth, as I shall explain in a moment, the evidence concerning that issue (what the land was worth), in the form of Mr Mayhew’s and Mr Kuznetsov’s opinions, was not helpful to Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva.  </span>

These are matters which I shall come on to consider, but it seems to me that the price disparity which I have highlighted is particularly significant. Indeed, it is instructive that, although in his written closing submissions, Mr Twigger addressed in considerable detail the evidence given by Mr Mayhew and Mr Kuznetsov concerning land plot valuation, submitting that Mr Kuznetsov’s (higher) valuations should be preferred, he took no account of the fact that, even on the basis of Mr Kuznetsov’s valuations, it can be seen that KK JSC must have very considerably overpaid.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Specifically, using a valuation methodology which entailed the identification of appropriate comparables from the contemporaneous land sale advertisements in the Kazakhstan newspaper, Krysha, and then the application of a statistical analysis to those comparables which involved the stripping out of some of the higher and lower asking prices to arrive at an average value per sotka, Mr Kuznetsov’s valuation was KZT 2,396,324,233/US$ 19,847,276. This is based on the dates when the land plots were purchased from the farmers, as opposed to the dates when KK JSC acquired the land plots from CBC and Bolzhal, since Mr Kuznetsov’s view is that the correct dates to use are the former rather than the latter. I shall come back to this issue shortly, merely noting for the present that Mr Kuznetsov’s valuation, using the later dates, was KZT 1,932,688,932/US$ 15,975,288 whereas Mr Mayhew’s equivalent valuation was KZT 1,181,591,410/US$ 9,747,000. What matters, for present purposes, is simply that both of Mr Kuznetsov’s valuations are substantially lower than the KZT 6,113,223,952 which KK JSC paid to CBC and Bolzhal for the land plots which were purchased from the farmers. Therefore, although, clearly, the Claimants’ (at least one-time) contention that the land plots are worthless cannot stand, it is equally clear that the notion that what KK JSC paid was what the farmers themselves received (subject only to matters such as agents’ fees, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“facilitation payments”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and commission payments allegedly paid to the ‘Kazakh LLPs’) is unsustainable. Specifically, the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> figures used by Mr Kuznetsov to arrive at his valuations were all somewhat lower than what, according to Mr Jumadilov, the farmers were paid (between US$ 1,500 and US$ 3,000 per sotka and, in some instances, as high as US$ 5,000 per sotka) and, crucially, lower than what KK JSC paid to CBC and Bolzhal. Indeed, interestingly, as Mr Howe observed in closing, Mr Kuznetsov identified land plots advertised for sale at prices comparable (namely in the US$ 300 to US$ 500 per sotka range) to the actual prices recorded as having been paid to the farmers in respect of the six plots for which information is available (namely approximately US$ 350 per sotka). Mr Kuznetsov chose to exclude those comparables when calculating his averages. However, even if he was right to do so, what is significant is that his valuations do not justify the amounts which KK JSC paid to CBC and Bolzhal.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is the case, as I have observed, irrespective of which of Mr Kuznetsov’s two valuations is considered. Plainly, however, the applicable dates issue matters given that there is a difference between Mr Kuznetsov’s valuations amounting to some US$ 4 million or so. It is significant also because there is a difference also as between Mr Mayhew’s valuation (taking the later dates) and Mr Kuznetsov’s valuation (again taking the later dates) of some US$ 6 million or so. Indeed, the only valuation exercise performed by Mr Mayhew is one which takes the dates when KK JSC entered into the final sale and purchase agreements with CBC and Bolzhal. Mr Mayhew has not, therefore, carried out a valuation equivalent to Mr Kuznetsov’s KZT 2,396,324,233/US$ 19,847,276 valuation based on the dates when the farmers sold their land plots to Mr Esperov and Mr Shabadanov.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Howe submitted that Mr Mayhew had plainly selected the correct valuation dates, given that KK JSC is the relevant claimant and what matters, in those circumstances, he suggested, was what value the various land plots had at the time when KK JSC acquired them, not what Mr Howe described as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“on other random dates in the course of the acquisition process”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I cannot agree with Mr Howe about this. It seems to me that Mr Kuznetsov’s approach of using the dates when KK JSC became committed to the purchases, in other words when its nominees purchased the land plots from the farmers with KK JSC’s money and for KK JSC’s benefit, is the right one in the circumstances of the present case. As Mr Twigger observed, those nominees did not purchase the land plots as independent third parties but acting indirectly for KK JSC. Their sole intention, as Mr Twigger also pointed out, was to contribute them to Bolzhal or CBC’s charter capital in circumstances where those companies had signed preliminary agreements to sell the land plots to KK JSC. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows, in my view, that the relevant dates are those which were used by Mr Kuznetsov, namely between October 2007 and June 2008, and not the dates when KK JSC completed the purchases of the land plots from CBC and Bolzhal, namely between February 2008 and February 2009. Indeed, although perhaps not strictly a matter for him anyway, it is to be noted that Mr Mayhew, who had in his report stated that he was instructed to use the later dates only, at trial said that he himself had made the decision to do so, but was unable when pressed by Mr Twigger in cross-examination to explain in very convincing terms why he regarded his approach as preferable to that of Mr Kuznetsov. Apart from asserting that the appropriate date </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is the date of the transaction”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, which somewhat begged the question as to what was the relevant transaction for present purposes, it seemed that Mr Mayhew’s only real point was that additional costs may have been incurred between the dates of the purchases from the farmers and the dates of the sales to KK JSC. That, however, is not a legitimate reason for taking the later dates for the simple reason that additional costs are not the same as land plot prices and as such, as Mr Kuznetsov explained in his second report, would not be reflected in any price comparables. Mr Twigger illustrated the fallacy in Mr Mayhew’s (and Mr Howe’s) position by citing a hypothetical example of a plot being purchased from a farmer by a nominee in 2007 for US$ 1 million but not being transferred to KK JSC until 2008. He suggested, and I agree, that, in those circumstances, it would make no sense to say that the value in 2008 was only US$ 500,000, so that is all that KK JSC can have spent on the land, since nobody has suggested that the nominee bought the land plot from the farmer at his own risk so as to mean that he would suffer a US$ 500,000 loss.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I, therefore, proceed on the basis that the appropriate dates for valuation purposes are the earlier dates. Accordingly, the relevant valuation produced by Mr Kuznetsov is his KZT 2,396,324,233/US$ 19,847,276 valuation, rather than his KZT 1,932,688,932/US$ 15,975,288 valuation. Although this still means that the land plots are to be regarded as having been worth substantially less than KK JSC paid CBC and Bolzhal for them, the position is not as pronounced as it would be if either Mr Kuznetsov’s alternative valuation or Mr Mayhew’s (only) valuation based on the later dates were to be used. The differential is nonetheless significant, and more than enough to call into serious question how it could be that KK JSC came to pay so much more for the land plots than they were worth. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is nothing to the point that Mr Twigger was able in his written closing submissions to point to various sources of information which were known to the KK Group at the time that KK JSC committed to purchase the land plots from CBC and Bolzhal and which, Mr Twigger suggested, demonstrated that the real estate market in Kazakhstan was buoyant. Mr Kuznetsov has arrived at his valuations, and these make it clear that KK JSC paid more than the land plots were actually worth. Mr Twigger relied, for example, on the fact that on 28 April 2007 Mr Mayhew provided a valuation report for the purpose of the KK Group’s financial statements in which he valued the Akzhal 1 and 2 sites (partially developed) at US$ 48,450,000 (US$ 7,860 per sotka) and the Aksenger site (partially industrial and partially agricultural designated use) at US$ 147,700,000 (US$ 3,090 per sotka). Mr Mayhew also provided a draft report for the purpose of the IPO prospectus, in which he valued the Akzhal 1 and 2 sites at a slightly lower figure of US$ 36,063,000 and the Aksenger site at the same amount as in his 28 April 2007 report. CBRE Scot Holland similarly prepared valuation reports for the IPO prospectus on 24 and 25 May 2007, in which they valued the Akzhal 1 and 2 sites at US$ 75,150,600 (US$ 12,180 per sotka) and the Aksenger site at US$ 214,547,000 (US$ 4,500 per sotka). Mr Twigger additionally prayed in aid the fact that in the report which PwC Russia produced in December 2009 (and which I shall consider in more detail when dealing with the limitation issue), reference was made to the land plots purchased in 2008 having been purchased at prices ranging from US$ 2,620 to US$ 2,650 per sotka </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“which seems to be in line with average rates”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. However, the report went on to say that there was no open land market in Kazakhstan, meaning that prices can vary significantly, and furthermore that the price range could serve as an indicator but not a confirmation of the reasonableness of the prices paid by the KK Group. This last comment seems to me to underline the limited assistance which can be derived from such further material and why the more appropriate focus, for present purposes, is on the valuation work carried out by Mr Kuznetsov and Mr Mayhew (even allowing for the fact that his only valuation relates to the later dates). </span>

However, focusing for the present on the valuation exercises performed by Mr Kuznetsov and Mr Mayhew, the Court is in an odd position because, as I have observed, the only valuation which considers the dates when the land plots were purchased from the farmers has been carried out by Mr Kuznetsov. Mr Mayhew has not done an equivalent exercise. Mr Twigger suggested, indeed, that it should be inferred, in the circumstances, that, had he done so, Mr Mayhew would have arrived at a valuation substantially higher than Mr Kuznetsov’s valuation. Mr Twigger highlighted in this context that Mr Mayhew’s view was that the Kazakhstan real estate market had in the meantime declined. Although it would certainly have been helpful if Mr Mayhew had (like Mr Kuznetsov) produced an alternative valuation, I consider nonetheless that I should not draw the inference which Mr Twigger invited me to draw, if only because Mr Mayhew’s valuation using the later dates (KZT 1,181,591,410/US$ 9,747,000) was not inconsiderably lower than Mr Kuznetsov’s equivalent valuation (KZT 1,932,688,932/US$ 15,975,288). </span>

It seems to me, in the circumstances, that I must consider the various submissions which have been made concerning the respective methodologies adopted by Mr Kuznetsov and Mr Mayhew and, if necessary, depending in particular on the view which I reach in relation to Mr Kuznetsov’s approach, do my best to arrive at an appropriate valuation. This, in circumstances where, as I have previously explained, the land valuation evidence was not altogether satisfactory given that Mr Mayhew lacked particular experience of Kazakhstan and given that Mr Kuznetsov, at least judging from his curriculum vitae, had only limited experience of land valuation. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">More specifically, however, as to Mr Mayhew and the methodology which he used, as Mr Twigger highlighted, although Mr Mayhew identified certain comparables which he used to arrive at the valuations which he did, he did not give details of other comparables which he rejected when arriving at those valuations.  Mr Twigger asked Mr Mayhew about these other comparables, exploring with him what they entailed. Mr Mayhew was, however, not very forthcoming, insisting that he had identified the comparables which, in his view, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“are required to arrive at an opinion of value”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that he did not</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “see the benefit of putting comparables in to then take them out, because they are not comparable”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was not very helpful. Nor was Mr Mayhew’s assertion, for that is what it was, that his selection of comparables which were appropriate was based on his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“expert judgment”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Twigger submitted, this is unsatisfactory not only because, without proper identification of the comparables which were not selected by Mr Mayhew, it is impossible to test the appropriateness of Mr Mayhew’s selection, but also because Mr Mayhew’s experience of Kazakhstan specifically, and so his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“expert judgment”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, was, on any view, not exactly vast. Indeed, it emerged that Mr Mayhew had never visited the comparable sites which he did use, and that he did not know where they are beyond the name of the village or district. Furthermore, I agree with Mr Twigger when he submitted in closing that Mr Mayhew’s reasons for making the location adjustments were based on factors about which he lacked sufficient information and upon which he was unqualified to express an opinion, and specifically that he could not know that nearly all of the comparables he used were better located than the land plots he was valuing; indeed, he admitted when trying to defend his liquidity adjustment that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“we don’t know a huge amount about them”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Furthermore, again as Mr Twigger observed, Mr Mayhew had no real basis for reaching the conclusion that irregularly shaped farming land is less valuable; and, since he did not himself know what proportion of land plots in the region were irregular or regular shaped, his decision to make a 15-20% adjustment as regards a narrow comparable that was already being marketed at a lower price, to reflect the supposed concern about irregular shaped plots, must be questionable. All in all, therefore, particularly when taken together with his lack of Kazakhstan-specific experience and a somewhat argumentative approach when giving evidence, I would be reluctant to place too much weight on Mr Mayhew’s valuation approach, even if he had produced a valuation which was based on the earlier dates which are, in my view, the right dates to take for valuation purposes. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The difficulty, however, is that just as Mr Twigger was able to make legitimate criticisms concerning Mr Mayhew’s approach, so Mr Howe was in a position to level legitimate criticisms at Mr Kuznetsov’s seemingly mechanical (or at least mathematical) valuation method which, Mr Howe suggested, meant that on one view, he failed to carry out any valuation exercise at all. This involved, as I have indicated, Mr Kuznetsov looking at advertisements for land sales and producing an average without, as Mr Howe pointed out, making any allowances whatsoever for the characteristics of the comparables he was using or of the plots of land he was supposed to be valuing. Mr Kuznetsov also, as Mr Miller demonstrated in cross-examination, adopted an approach which consistently saw him omit lower values. This meant, inevitably, that the valuations which he arrived at were higher than would otherwise have been the case. The danger inherent in such an approach is obvious, even though, in his closing submissions, Mr Twigger sought to explain that Mr Kuznetsov’s approach did not entail any predisposition towards the selection of higher priced advertisements but merely involved Mr Kuznetsov endeavouring to achieve an appropriate level of homogeneity. Specifically, in order to try to create sets of comparables with acceptable homogeneity, Mr Kuznetsov calculated the variation coefficient for the data and, if it was not under 35%, he stripped out comparables in order to reach an acceptable degree of homogeneity. This did not, Mr Twigger suggested, involve Mr Kuznetsov simply stripping out lower priced data but data (whether lower or higher) which is furthest from the average. Nonetheless, as Mr Howe pointed out, when Mr Twigger explored the matter in re-examination asking how Mr Kuznetsov decided which figures to exclude, the response was disarmingly straightforward. Mr Kuznetsov stated that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“would resort to the conditions of the task, that is the conditions under which the task should be solved, what result I want to achieve and what are the purposes for me to achieve this result”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> explaining that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Only after that I would make a decision on which values to exclude”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger, perhaps understandably in the circumstances, left matters there. However rigorous Mr Kuznetsov’s approach may have been from a mathematical or statistical point of view, I was left with some unease as to its appropriateness in terms of arriving at a land valuation. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows that I do not consider that it would be right simply to accept Mr Kuznetsov’s valuation, I repeat the only valuation dealing with the earlier dates, and that the right course, adopting a somewhat broadbrush approach once again, is to approach matters on the basis that Mr Kuznetsov’s KZT 2,396,324,233/US$ 19,847,276 valuation is too high and that a more appropriate valuation would be KZT 1,929,041,007 (or approximately US$ 15.9 million). I have arrived at this figure by taking a mid-point figure between Mr Mayhew’s later dates valuation (KZT 1,181,591,410) and Mr Kuznetsov’s equivalent valuation (KZT 1,932,688,932), namely KZT 1,557,140,171, which equates to 80.5% of Mr Kuznetsov’s KZT 1,932,688,932 valuation. Applying that percentage to Mr Kuznetsov’s earlier dates valuation of KZT 2,396,324,233 produces KZT 1,929,041,007. I regard this as appropriate in circumstances where criticisms can legitimately be directed at both Mr Mayhew’s and Mr Kuznetsov’s approaches, and yet where the difference in their later dates valuations is not so very vast, it suggests to me that the appropriate valuation is likely to be somewhere in the middle.      </span>

Specifically, on the basis that I have decided that the true value of the land plots was KZT 1,929,041,007, the total overpayment will have been KZT 4,184,182,945 (KZT 6,113,223,952 less KZT 1,929,041,007) or something in the region of US$ 36 million. In these circumstances and since I am quite clear that the farmers would not have received anything more than what the land plots were worth (indeed, based on the six land plot details which are known about, they may have received somewhat less), it must follow that, at a minimum, the monies paid by KK JSC in excess of what the land plots were worth (subject only to matters such as agents’ fees, </span>

As I have explained in considerable detail already, the evidence that these were not genuine independent companies is clear and compelling, certainly when viewed cumulatively which I consider is appropriate in this case. The likelihood that the companies were independent in relation to the PEAK Claim, acting as genuine sub-contractors and as such receiving monies from Arka-Stroy for legitimate (essentially construction) purposes, and independent also in the context of the Land Plots Claim, acting not as construction companies but as companies willing to provide cash, is fanciful. As Mr Howe submitted, it can hardly have been a coincidence that the same companies should appear in relation to both the PEAK Claim and the Land Plots Claim. This is the position even without taking into account all the other matters connecting the companies to the Defendants. It should also, of course, be borne in mind in this context that I have decided in relation to the PEAK Claim that these entities were used by the Defendants to perpetrate fraud.

	      <span style="color:#000000">. He did nothing of the sort, however. He made no mention, in particular, of these companies providing cash to enable the farmers to be paid. In cross-examination, when asked about what he had omitted from his witness statement, his answer was that he was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“not controlling these transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that he did not know about their involvement with the land plot transactions. As far as he was concerned, he explained, the land brokers decided to use them without his involvement, adding that he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“just generally was not involved into this kind of level of details ever”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This is not evidence which I can accept, in view of the conclusions which I have arrived at in relation to the ‘Connected Entities’. Mr Arip may not have been involved in all the details of every transfer, but I find it impossible to believe that he did not know about the role of the companies involved in the Land Plots Claim. These were, in effect, his companies; they were not independent. The suggestion, therefore, that Mr Atashev </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“found”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (as Mr Jumadilov put it) the companies is not one which I can accept. Mr Twigger dismissed Mr Howe’s observation during the course of Ms Dikhanbayeva’s cross-examination that it would be </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a pretty extraordinary coincidence”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> for these companies to have been selected as sub-contractors by Arka-Stroy and then separately as sources of cash by the real estate brokers. Mr Twigger pointed out that Ms Dikhanbayeva’s position was that she did not know the companies and was unable to explain how they were chosen. He went on to suggest that there is no evidence to support what Mr Howe was putting to Ms Dikhanbayeva, suggesting in effect that there is nothing surprising in the fact that the companies should find themselves dealing with the KK Group </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in two separate spheres”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger drew attention, in this respect, to the fact that Arka-Stroy used as many as 184 sub-contractors (based on certain lists prepared by Mr Thompson), observing that, in the circumstances, there is </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“nothing remarkable or suspicious in a small number of those companies also being known to or introduced via the real estate brokers’ connections”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I simply cannot agree with Mr Twigger about this. The fact that the companies involved in the Land Plots Claim were among as many as 184 sub-contractors dealing with Arka-Stroy seems to me to mean nothing. What matters is the fact that the same companies are players in both the PEAK Claim and the Land Plots Claim. What matters even more than this is that I have concluded, based not only on this fact but also on the basis of other evidence, that the companies were owned or controlled by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This conclusion is, in truth, fatal to Mr Twigger’s submission. So, too, however, is the fact that a number of the transfers from CBC and Bolzhal to the companies which are the subject of the Land Plots Claim were covered by contracts which, instead of identifying the services which the companies were providing in a straightforward and honest way, pretended that other services were being provided. I have mentioned certain of these already when discussing the connections between the companies and Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. However, an example is a draft contract relating to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“earthworks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> between Bolzhal and Biznes-Privat dated 20 March 2008 in the sum of KZT 196.5 million and so matching the payment from Bolzhal to Biznes-Privat made on 1 April 2008 as recorded in Mr Crooks’ Appendix 14B relating to the Land Plots Claim. There is also a draft contract between Bolzhal and Mouli in the sum of KZT 205.375 million which is again described as being for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“earthworks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but which likewise closely matches the payment from Bolzhal to Mouli recorded in Appendix 14B. In his written closing submissions, Mr Twigger himself referred to these two contracts by saying that they were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“agreements with the Kazakh LLPs for land intermediary services which were for the sole purpose of documenting the Kazakh LLPs provision of cash”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. If so, then, it is difficult to see why this could not simply have been stated, as it was in another of the agreements to which Mr Twigger referred which was a draft contract between Bolzhal and Ritek in the sum of KZT 1.117 billion (and so closely matching the payment from Bolzhal to Ritek in the sum of KZT 1.037 billion which again features in Appendix 14B) where the description given was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Intermediary services for search and acquisition of land plots”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The fact that draft agreements were drawn up which deliberately misstated what services were being provided, all the more so in circumstances where those draft contracts have been found on the KK Group’s own systems, provides further confirmation that the role played by the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Secondary Recipients”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was not an innocent one. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Nor was this confined to Bolzhal, since, as Mr Howe pointed out in his oral closing submissions, although agreements (or draft agreements) relating to CBC have not been found, it is telling that in certain internal email exchanges on 26 August 2009 (and so the day before Ms Dikhanbayeva’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If the auditors are raising questions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> email in which she gave instructions in respect of Bolzhal “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">to increase the value of the land plots”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) between Marlen Yelgeldiyev, a lawyer in the KK Group, and Ms Aiman Useinova there was discussion concerning the drawing up of such contracts with TESS, Biznes-Privat, Ritek and Mouli. Specifically, in the case of TESS, there was, again, a reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“earthworks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and a direct reference to the KZT 95 million which CBC paid to TESS over a year before, on 14 March 2008. Ms Useinova clearly regarded the drawing up of these contracts as being important since she ended one of her emails by saying </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Marlen, please pay attention – this is serious!”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The clear inference, given the timing of this email, is that Ms Dikhanbayeva was behind these email exchanges and so, as Mr Howe put it, involved in the process of creating these further </span>

It seems to me that, in truth, it is not the structure </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">per se</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which gives rise to legitimate suspicion but the parties which, in this case, played their roles in that structure. Put differently, if CBC, Bolzhal and the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Secondary Recipients” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">had not all been ‘Connected Entities’, I doubt that the structure would itself have been open to serious criticism. I need not, therefore, take up too much further time dealing with Mr Twigger’s various submissions in defence of the structure which was used. Indeed, as he pointed out, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development produced an Information Memorandum in January 2007 in which it described a similar six stage structure used by the KK Group to purchase real estate on previous occasions. Furthermore, even Mr Mayhew (whose experience in relation to Kazakhstan was not substantial) acknowledged both in his report and in cross-examination that investors and developers employed</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “creative approaches to buying land”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Furthermore, I see considerable force in the reasons which Mr Twigger gave as to why the structure would have been used, even if some of those reasons (specifically the ability to minimise tax liabilities, whether on the part of KK JSC or the farmers) would not be regarded as especially laudable.  I can see particular force in the point which Mr Twigger made concerning Kazakh law imposing restrictions on the direct sale of agricultural (peasant farming) land from individuals to legal entities. Although, both Mr Mayhew and Mr Vataev suggested that this could be avoided by having the farmers apply for a change of designated land use, I agree with Mr Twigger that there is no evidence to suggest that the farmers would have agreed to this, nor that they would have been successful in this process if they could not show the plans for an industrial use, and nor that this was necessarily a simpler method than that adopted by the KK Group. To repeat, therefore, I do not regard the simple fact that the structure used was what it was as indicative that there was fraud in this case. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me to Mr Twigger’s submission concerning the commercial reasons behind the purchasing of the land plots, which he suggested were consistent with the growth of the KK Group’s real estate division, together with his related submission that the real estate market in Kazakhstan at the time was in a state which made a decision to invest in land eminently understandable. I should say at the outset that, even if these submissions were to be accepted, still the conclusion which I have reached would not change because the position would remain that KK JSC had found itself making payments for land plot purchases in amounts which, unbeknown to KK JSC, vastly exceeded the prices, in fact, paid to the farmers who sold the land plots, and so with the consequence that monies which KK JSC intended should be used for such purchases went instead into the coffers of companies owned or controlled by Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. In such circumstances, it makes no difference whether there were sound commercial reasons to purchase the land plots since the issue is not whether it made sense to make the purchases when they were made but whether the provider of the funds (KK JSC) was, in effect, duped into paying more than was necessary to effect the purchases. I propose, for this reason, to address these further submissions only relatively briefly. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the first submission which Mr Twigger made, essentially two points arise. First, it was suggested by the Claimants in the Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim that the land plots comprised </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“undeveloped agricultural land plots on the far outskirts of the city”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Twigger pointed out, however, and as Mr Howe acknowledged, the land plots were, in fact, at least to an extent, contiguous with the Aksenger site (with the exception of one of the land plots which was adjacent to the Akzhal 2 site). Secondly, Mr Werner had suggested in one of his witness statements that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the land was, from a commercial perspective, of no use at all”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This, however, somewhat overstated things since, as Mr Twigger went on to point out, the Aksenger development was on approximately 477 hectares of land which KK JSC had purchased in the preceding years. As a result, the land plots were close to good transport links, including highways, railways (which were expected to extend onto the Aksenger site) and other transport routes. Moreover, the area was one to which the Almaty city government had announced it would relocate industrial facilities, so driving up demand for industrial facilities and land in those areas. Indeed, Mr Mayhew and Mr Kuznetsov agreed in their joint memorandum as follows:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> dated March 2007. In that document, it was, indeed, noted that one of the important factors determining the Aksenger project’s success was the fact that there were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“opportunities for further expansion of the plot”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, albeit that later on under </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Weaknesses” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">a note of caution appeared as follows: </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Complex shape of the land plot that might drive higher costs of infrastructure and requires well thought out planning of the territory to avoid problems in the future”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Howe highlighted this last point when making the observations that the land plots were irregular in shape and that some of them only partially adjoined the Aksenger site with some separated by plots not owned by the KK Group. However, as Mr Twigger submitted, the land plots either adjoined or were in very close proximity to KK JSC’s land, with only one of the thirteen plots near the Aksenger site separated from the adjacent plots by a plot not owned by the KK Group. It is anyway obvious that the KK Group could have sought to buy up other land plots, so hopefully overcoming any difficulty in this respect. I agree with Mr Twigger that, in the circumstances, it can hardly be said that the plots had been purchased in random, isolated or remote locations. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows that I am unpersuaded by any objection to the land plots being purchased based on these sorts of essentially physical considerations. This brings me, however, to the second point which arises. This is that there was no need to buy more land plots given that, Mr Howe suggested, there was simply no need for KK JSC to buy up more land in view of the fact that, as confirmed by KK JSC’s IPO prospectus, 528 hectares of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“prime land”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> had already been purchased, including 477 hectares at the Aksenger site. I agree with Mr Howe that it is not immediately obvious why, in such circumstances, more land would be needed. As Mr Howe reminded me in this context, the Aksenger site was already vast, comparable in size to almost double the City of London. I agree, in particular, that, the valuations presented to IPO investors having apparently been provided on the assumption that the necessary industrial infrastructure for the existing Aksenger land plots would be developed, to acquire additional land plots would additionally have used up liquidity which otherwise would have been available to develop existing land plots. Even if, therefore, Mr Twigger was right when he suggested in closing that by late 2007, purchasing real estate was, in its own right, a separate stream of the KK Group’s business, regarded as having the potential to make substantially higher profits than the paper business, it still is difficult to see why at that stage more land would have been purchased.</span>

Nonetheless, had this matter stood alone, I would not have concluded that the decision to do so could provide any real support for a case in fraud. After all, poor commercial decisions are frequently made by businessmen who lack any fraudulent intent.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> (as Mr Twigger put it) to purchasing the land plots, Kazakhstan had experienced an unprecedented economic boom and there were a number of indicators that made it reasonable for the KK Group to continue to acquire land. Mr Twigger was prepared for these purposes to treat the relevant time period as being between October 2007 and June 2008. As a result, I need not deal with certain submissions which Mr Howe made to demonstrate that there cannot have been any commitment (he would say any decision, indeed) to purchase the land plots prior to the IPO in July 2007. </span>

There is also an issue as to whether by the time that it was decided to purchase the land plots a decision had already been made to put the development of the Aksenger site on hold. However, in truth, there is no real evidence to support the proposition that this was the case. On the contrary, it would appear that KK JSC was still in negotiations with Immo Industry Group, a potential joint venture partner for the Aksenger development, in mid to late 2008 as demonstrated by the drafting of a confidentiality agreement dated 15 October 2008 and draft heads of terms dated 22 October 2008. </span>

I agree with Mr Twigger about this. Indeed, given that the investors on the conference call were themselves, no doubt, to a greater or lesser degree, knowledgeable about such matters, it is notable that nobody appears to have disputed what Mr Manghi and Mr Arip had to say.

The problem is that it may happen not on the level that we expected and in this case maybe it’s better for us to wait for a year or more, maybe one and a half years until the whole situation on the real estate market could be clarified. Anyway, most of the payoff of the land we planned to do has to be in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 and we believe that generally the economy is very strong. It’s mostly commodity driven with all the historical peaks and as a result, I think those years liquidity crisis will be history. So we don’t think that we have to strongly review our real estate strategy,  maybe just to take advantage of the situation and acquire some more real estate assets during this liquidity situation because it certainly won’t be long and it will continue for a couple of months more. Currently the market is stagnating, you don’t see the strong fall of the prices but if this situation continues it will certainly continue for a couple of months, I think we have to expect some connection on the market, and also I believe we will have special opportunities for some companies who have leverage and are under pressure to sell their assets.”</span>

This is because it is not known on what basis the auditors, BDO, apparently arrived at such a view.

	      <span style="color:#000000">There remains the role played by Holding Invest also to consider. This relates to two payments received by that company, namely a payment by Bolzhal to Holding Invest on 1 April 2008 in the amount of KZT 605.9 million and a payment made directly by KK JSC to Holding Invest on 8 May 2008 in the amount of KZT 230,880,000/US$ 1,915,937. As to the first of these, it was Mr Jumadilov’s evidence that this payment represented 50% of the purchase price for an office block owned by Holding Invest and that the payment was made on behalf of a group of investors (including Mr Jumadilov himself) who were buying that block. I have previously mentioned this when describing my impressions of Mr Jumadilov’s qualities as a witness. It will be recalled, in particular, that Mr Jumadilov accepted in cross-examination that to use KK JSC’s money in this way was an improper use of funds. He also agreed, using the phrase “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">C’est la vie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, that he was prepared to act dishonestly if there was money in it for him. It was nonetheless Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Jumadilov’s evidence concerning the payment from Bolzhal to Holding Invest, and moreover what he suggested was a subsequent cash payment in the other direction, should be accepted. Specifically, according to Mr Jumadilov, he decided to use money which KK JSC had paid Bolzhal and which was sitting in Bolzhal’s bank account to make the payment, with around US$ 1 million of this constituting Mr Jumadilov’s anticipated fees in relation to the land plots transactions and the remaining US$ 3.7 million being returned to Mr Jumadilov (and so to Bolzhal) in cash by his fellow investors for use by Bolzhal in the acquisition of the land plots – to be followed by the other investors subsequently returning his US$ 1 million as well after, so he explained in his second witness statement served shortly before trial, Mr Jumadilov realised that the pledge over the property held by Alliance Bank could not be removed. On this basis, therefore, at least according to Mr Jumadilov, there was no detriment to Bolzhal: Bolzhal was repaid and Holding Invest kept the money which it had received by way of the purchase price of the office block which it owned. The difficulty with this, however, is that it is an explanation which entirely depends on Mr Jumadilov having told the truth in the evidence which he gave since there is no documentation supporting what he had to say. This, he explained, was because the transaction came to nothing and because also the events in question took place almost a decade ago. Mr Arip also speculated that, as Holding Invest had in the meantime been subject to a number of investigations, it is possible that relevant documents may have been taken by the Financial Police or prosecutors. This was, however, really no more than speculation. I am not prepared, in the circumstances, bearing in mind the view which I have formed both as to Mr Jumadilov and Mr Arip, simply to accept what they (or, for that matter, Ms Dikhanbayeva) had to say on the matter. It is striking that there is absolutely nothing in any document to support their version of events and very convenient (in truth, too convenient) that the return payments made by Mr Jumadilov’s fellow investors should apparently have been made in cash. Indeed, it is instructive to note how Mr Jumadilov described things in his first witness statement where he said this:</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“We used funds received from KK JSC to make the purchase because I was owed fees for the land plots transactions and whilst the amount due to me was less than the amount paid to Holding Invest for the property, the difference was made up by me and my co-purchasers through the cash payments we made to sellers of land plots.”</span>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Accordingly, it would seem that, on Mr Jumadilov’s account, he and his co-investors did not, as such, repay Bolzhal but that they provided funds which were used, apparently as direct payments from them (as opposed to from Bolzhal), to pay the sellers of land plots. This explanation seems to me likely to have been designed to make it all the more readily explicable that there are no documents showing that he and his co-investors ever repaid (whether directly or indirectly) the monies which Bolzhal transferred to Holding Invest effectively on their behalf. There is also the point made by Mr Howe in closing that neither Mr Jumadilov in his first witness statement nor Mr Arip in his fourteenth witness statement (both of which were served in September 2016) suggested that the purchase of the office block did not ultimately go ahead. This was something which was only mentioned in Mr Jumadilov’s second witness statement and Mr Arip’s sixteenth witness statement (both served shortly before trial). I agree with Mr Howe, however, that if this really was what happened, it would obviously have needed to be mentioned but, instead, the opposite impression was given.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Even assuming that what Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva had to say about this was true, and the bank statements and the assignment agreement do, of course, somewhat speak for themselves, the difficulty remains, aside from the fact that it is evidence which ought to have been forthcoming somewhat earlier than proved to be the case, that monies which were paid by Bolzhal to Holding Invest on 1 April 2008 were (at least almost entirely) paid the very same day to Central Asia. As a matter of timing, it is difficult see that this can have been a coincidence. I agree with Mr Howe that it is most unlikely that back-to-back payments such as this can have been completely unrelated. The more so, given the conclusion which I have reached concerning the role played by the Defendants in relation to Bolzhal and the fact that Holding Invest was a company which was owned by Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip. In short, unless Mr Jumadilov’s evidence concerning the office block (as corroborated by Mr Arip but supported by nothing by way of documentation) is to be believed, the only realistic inference is that the monies received from Bolzhal were used to pay Central Asia. The fact that Central Asia repaid PEAK Aksenger on 17 April 2019 changes nothing in circumstances where the monies transferred from Bolzhal to Holding Invest did not, as I conclude, find their way back to Bolzhal or, more accurately, land plot owners as Mr Jumadilov suggested.

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me to the second payment (KZT 230,880,000) which was made by KK JSC to Holding Invest on 8 May 2008 and which then was paid on to Trading Company and then on to Sunclub LLP the self-same day. Like the payment with which I have just been dealing, although treated by the Claimants as a Land Plot Claim, this aspect is in a different category since it does not involve any purchase of a land plot. Whereas, however, it can be said in relation to the payment which Bolzhal made to Holding Invest that this involved monies which, at least as far as KK JSC was concerned, had been transferred to Bolzhal for the purposes of land plots purchases, the KZT 230,880,000 payment which KK JSC made to Holding Invest was not, both Mr Crooks and Mr Thompson agreed, described as being related to land but instead as a payment relating to the rent of office space in accordance with a contract with the reference A-04-1/08 and dated 30 April 2008. Mr Howe suggested that, whether or not this strictly qualifies as a Land Plots Claim, what is clear is that there is a misappropriation claim. He highlighted, in this regard, Mr Arip’s connections with Trading Company, Mr Arip’s mother-in-law’s company, as well as the fact that Sunclub LLP is a company which, according to Ms Dkhanbayeva, built a clinic for Trading Company. The fact that the payment which KK JSC made did not purport to be in respect of a land plot purchase means, however, that the focus is different. It is not good enough for Mr Howe, therefore, to say (as he did in his written closing submissions) that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “it is difficult to see what proper or honest explanation there could be for such a transaction, which resulted in Trading Company receiving a substantial sum of money which [KK JSC] was supposedly paying for the purchase of the Land Plots” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">since that is simply not what the payment was ever meant to cover. The focus must, instead, be on whether the payment, although described as being for rent, was not actually a rental payment at all. As to that, although Mr Howe submitted that there is no documentation to support the existence of an agreement that rent would be paid in advance in order to cover refurbishment costs in circumstances where the rental space was fully fitted out, Ms Dikhanbayeva was able in her eighth witness statement, served shortly before trial, to explain by reference to 1C database entries as follows:</span>

From the 1C database, I can see that KK JSC had made advance payments to Holding Invest which related to the office building rented by KK JSC from Holding Invest, including the KZT 230,880,000 payment made on 8 May 2008. I can see that by 31 July 2009, after I had left the KK Group, the overall amount due from Holding Invest to KK JSC was KZT 596 million. </span>

The significance of these dates is that the Claim Form commencing the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims was issued on 2 August 2013, and the Land Plots Claim was introduced by amendment pursuant to a Consent Order dated 28 August 2015 which made it clear in a recital that the Land Plots Claim was made or deemed to have been made on the date of the order and not on the date the original action was commenced unless the Claimants could establish that the Land Plots Claim arose out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as the claims in respect of which the Claimants had already claimed a remedy in these proceedings. In the event, Mr Howe did not attempt to argue that the proviso operated to allow the operation of the ‘relation back’ principle, accepting that the relevant date for limitation purposes in respect of the Land Plots Claim is three years before the amendment was made. </span>

I shall come back to this matter shortly, after first dealing with what is meant by ‘awareness’ more generally. There were two aspects to this: first, whether ‘awareness’ for the purposes of Article 180.1 requires, as Mr Twigger put it when cross-examining Mr Vataev, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“discovering something”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">; and secondly, what level of awareness qualifies as ‘awareness’ for the purposes of Article 180.1. In truth, however, as demonstrated by the question which Mr Twigger himself posed in cross-examination, the first of these issues is a non-issue. It seems to me that ‘awareness’ must always be acquired in the sense that there is inevitably a time when a party lacks awareness and a time when that party obtains it. It is of the essence of a limitation provision that time must start running at some point, so making it obvious that there will be a before and after. Indeed, this is recognised within Article 180.1 itself with its reference to a person becoming (the words used are </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a very good question”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to which he did not know the answer. This prompted Mr Vataev, shortly before he came to give his evidence, to suggest that the more accurate translation of the relevant Russian word used in Article 180.1 (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“uznal”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“obtaining knowledge”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was even though in the joint memorandum (as demonstrated by the quotation set out above) of Mr Vataev and Professor Sulemeinov had said Article 180.1 entails the limitation period </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“running from the date on which the person whose rights have been violated became, or should have become, aware of the violation of his rights”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. During cross-examination, Mr Vataev rejected the suggestion put to him by Mr Twigger that he had changed his mind </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“in order to come up with a translation … more favourable to the claimants’ case”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He insisted that it was his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“responsibility to deliver the true and exact meaning of the law”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that that is why he had raised the translation issue. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I was not particularly impressed by Mr Vataev’s somewhat belated clarification as to how Article 180.1 should be translated. I tend to agree with Mr Twigger that Mr Vataev adopted a somewhat opportunistic approach in this respect. Ultimately, however, not only did it emerge when Professor Suleimenov came to be cross-examined that he, too, spoke in terms of knowledge (as well as awareness), but I am, in any event, not convinced that anything really turns on the translation point. This is because, as pointed out by Mr Howe, the view of Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s own Kazakh law expert, Professor Suleimenov, was that for time to start to run a claimant must have </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“reasonable grounds to believe”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that his rights have been violated. He explained that by </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“reasonable grounds to believe”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> he meant </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“knowledge, although to a lesser degree than specific knowledge”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He added that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Whereas specific knowledge simply cannot exist when the claim is filed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, before adding further that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“again, it is ‘uznal’, knowledge”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (and so, in fact, rather making the point that awareness and knowledge in the context of Article 180.1 amount to much the same thing). The position seems to be, as Mr Twigger submitted  (and I did not understand Mr Howe ultimately to dispute), that Article 180.1 requires the court to consider whether a claimant was actually, or acting reasonably should have become, aware of the violation of his rights, with ‘awareness’ in this context meaning having </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> evidence of or reasonable grounds to believe there was a violation. This is, indeed, what Mr Vataev appeared to consider, as demonstrated by the following exchanges during his cross-examination:</span>

We are talking about relative knowledge only and hence that mean specific knowledge referred to by Mr Vataev cannot be the subject of our discussion here.

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me to the issue of whether it is necessary for Article 180.1 purposes that the identity of the wrongdoer should be known before the limitation period commences. In truth, although in the joint memorandum a disagreement was identified, there was no real difference between Mr Vataev and Professor Sulemeinov in relation to claims arising out of Article 62 of the JSC Law. Mr Vataev acknowledged that there is no express requirement under Kazakh law that the identity be known but makes the practical point that, in order for a claim to be filed, the identity would need to be known because </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a claim may not be made against an unidentified person”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Professor Sulemeinov said in cross-examination that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the most important thing is to identify not the person but rather the category of official”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “then as a rule it is not difficult to identify the specific person”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He nonetheless also agreed with Mr Howe that for the purposes of Articles 62 and 63 it is necessary to identify the particular company officer concerned, and so I was not entirely sure whether there was any real difference between the two Kazakh law experts. In any event, if it proves impossible to identify the relevant officer, then, as I understood both experts’ evidence, limitation would not start running because the potential claimant would not fall foul of the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">That said, in the present case, since there was no uncertainty as to who the relevant company officers were, the identity issue does not really arise. The position is the same concerning the claims under Article 917 (tort) and Articles 953-960 (unjust enrichment) of the KCC because there can be no doubt that, whatever the Claimants may have known or should be taken as having known concerning the violation of their rights, this is not a case where they should be taken to have had the requisite awareness of everything they need to be aware about except for the identity of the (alleged) wrongdoers. As Mr Twigger observed, the Claimants have only ever thought that, if there had been wrongdoing, it was caused by Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip with the assistance of Ms Dikhanbayeva. For completeness, however, I was not altogether persuaded by Professor Suleimenov’s view that in tort cases, where the wrongdoing and the causal link between that and the damage are evident, the wrongdoer need not be identified to trigger the limitation period since the potential claimant will then have three years in which to identify the wrongdoer. In particular, I struggled to see why Professor Suleimenov appeared to take the view that, whereas identification of the relevant (wrongdoer) company officer is necessary for the purposes of Articles 62 and 63 of the JSC Law, there is no similar need to identify the wrongdoer for the purposes of Articles 917 and 953-960 of the KCC. Indeed, as I put to Professor Suleimenov, since (as he himself put it)</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “the circle of people who may have committed the wrongdoing is much, much broader”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> than it is where the claim is under Articles 62 and 63, this would suggest that it is all the more necessary that the potential claimant should know the identity of the wrongdoer before time starts to run since it is all the more difficult, potentially anyway, to identify the wrongdoer where the circle is so much wider. Professor Suleimenov did not really have an answer to this point. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Another matter which arises in this context is not a matter which was explored in cross-examination with either of the Kazakh law experts. Professor Suleimenov’s position is that, for the limitation period to commence, a potential claimant does not need to know that a fraud has been committed if fraud is not an essential element of the violation about which the potential claimant needs to be aware under Article 180.1. In this regard, Professor Suleimenov pointed out that a company officer can be liable under Articles 62 and 63 of the JSC Law even if </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“he/she acted out of good intentions and in good faith”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He made the same point in relation to an unjust enrichment claim. He did not, however, extend this observation to claims in tort. As for Mr Vataev, as Mr Twigger highlighted, he referred in one of his reports to it being</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “only when the legal entity or its shareholder obtained sufficient grounds and ability to realise that the transaction was a fraud, and not a good faith, reasonable and fair deal”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that a claimant should be treated as having known of the violation. Mr Vataev was not taken to this particular passage in cross-examination.

Again, at this point, no violation is truly known by the new owner-there is a mere suspicion, which needs further investigation. Only after the new owner discovers sufficient details about suspicious transactions, which would allow him to conclude that the transactions were indeed against the company’s interests and/or fraudulent, can the new owner be attributed with knowledge of the violation, in the full legal sense of this word, having occurred which would mean the period of limitation would then start to run.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger summarised what he understood Mr Vataev to be saying as being that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the claimant needs details which would be sufficient to cause a reasonable person to consider there has been a fraud”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Vataev agreed with this. It should be noted, therefore, that Mr Twigger put to Mr Vataev that a claimant would need to know that there had been a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">fraud</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, not merely an innocent violation of rights. I consider that Mr Twigger was right to put things in this way since, in my view, it is necessary to consider the nature of the claims which the claimant comes to assert since it is those claims (and not others) which are being considered for time-bar purposes. If the claimant alleges fraud, in those circumstances, the focus should be on what the claimant knew, or should have known, relating to the allegations of fraud under consideration for time-bar purposes. It seems to me that it is artificial to adopt an approach which is divorced from a consideration of the actual allegations which the claimant has made. It may be, for example, that a claimant is aware of violations of its rights which, because they appear to be innocent, the claimant chooses not to pursue. If the claimant later becomes aware that the violations are not at all innocent but involve fraud, and so wishes to pursue a case, and the reason why the claimant has only come to the realisation that there has been fraud is because the wrongdoer has managed to date to succeed in concealing its fraud from the claimant, then, it is difficult to see why the wrongdoer should be permitted to rely on a time-bar in relation to the fraud case which the claimant seeks to put forward. In summary, it seems to me that a claimant needs to know enough to plead the actual fraud case which has been advanced and which it is said is time-barred in order for the limitation clock to start running. Accordingly, if a claimant does not have enough knowledge to do this, then, there cannot have been the requisite awareness.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Lastly, I should say something about attribution of knowledge. There was no issue between Mr Vataev and Professor Suleimenov in the joint memorandum which they prepared as to the fact that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Awareness of a legal entity’s chief executive officer, executive body, board of directors, general meeting of shareholders (participants) all the sole shareholder (participant) would mean awareness of the legal entity”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although in the joint memorandum there appeared to be disagreement as to the position in terms of attribution of knowledge where a group of companies is involved, during cross-examination Mr Vataev acknowledged that in some cases the facts could justify attribution where a parent and subsidiary companies are involved. He referred to the situation where “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">essentially the parent company runs the business of its subsidiary”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It would appear to follow from this that, as Mr Twigger submitted, knowledge on the part of those engaged in the management of KK Plc and KK JSC ought to be attributed to the other Claimants. This includes, of course, Mr Werner, whose knowledge is obviously attributable to all of the Claimants. There is no issue about this. Nor could there be given that, as Mr Twigger highlighted: in September 2009, Mr Zhunus sold his shares in KK Plc to Mr Werner for nominal deferred consideration; and in November 2009, Mr Werner was appointed Chairman of KK JSC’s Board and assumed control over key management decisions of the KK Group (as Mr Werner put it in cross-examination, by January 2010 he was </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The other aspect in relation to which attribution of knowledge is relevant concerns SP Angel in circumstances where between October 2009 and 1 August 2010 Mr Werner and SP Angel worked together closely in trying to put the KK Group on a proper financial footing. Strictly speaking, the question of whether SP Angel personnel’s knowledge is attributable to KK Plc is subject to the law of the Isle of Man (the place of KK Plc’s incorporation). In relation to the other Claimants, the relevant law is Kazakh law which, Mr Vataev agreed in cross-examination, essentially entails knowledge being attributed where the facts support such attribution. Ultimately, Mr Vataev accepted that knowledge of contractors to whom relevant authority has been delegated in something formal like a contract can be attributed to a company. On the facts of the present case, I am clear that SP Angel’s knowledge is properly attributable to the Claimants. It should be borne in mind in this context that, not only did SP Angel become a shareholder in KK Plc in October 2009, acquiring from Mr Gerasimov the shares which Mr Arip had the previous month sold to him, but Mr Werner acknowledged in cross-examination that SP Angel had a broad remit and performed a not inconsiderable management role. Specifically, having acquired Mr Gerasimov’s shareholding in October 2009, SP Angel the same month was appointed to lead the Steering Committee which KK JSC had set up to assist the process of enabling KK Plc’s shareholders to work with the KK Group’s management. In that capacity SP Angel reported to Mr Werner (as well as to KK Plc’s and KK JSC’s Boards) on the KK Group’s financial position. It is clear that Mr Werner and SP Angel personnel worked closely together, Mr Werner explaining that it was unlikely that many days would go by without conversations taking place between them. Mr Werner agreed also that SP Angel kept him informed about their activities. Moreover, on 19 January 2010, SP Angel informed KK Plc’s insurers that representatives of SP Angel had been acting in roles which </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“clearly amount to their acting as shadow directors”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> wording in Article 180.1: in the case of the PEAK Claim, until about March 2013 when the Arka-Stroy 1C database was discovered; in the case of the Astana 2 Claim, until about March 2013 for the same reason and because of the similarity between the PEAK Claim and the Astana 2 Claim, and anyway not before late 2012 when the Business Audit Report was given to Mr Werner; and in the case of the Land Plots Claim, until about November 2014 when Mr Arip served evidence in these proceedings which led the Claimants to pursue inquires about the monies which had been paid to Bolzhal and CBC. Mr Twigger did not accept this. He argued that, in relation to all three claims, the essential elements constituting the alleged corporate offences and tort claims advanced were simple and discoverable (indeed, Mr Twigger would say, discovered) much earlier than the Claimants were prepared to admit. Mr Twigger’s position was that, whilst the available evidence supporting allegations can almost always be improved (as can the strength of any inferences being relied upon), what matters for Article 180.1 purposes is when the Claimants were, or should have become, aware of the essential elements of the allegations which they now make. As Mr Twigger put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If possessed of the same knowledge or means of knowledge, the claims of a cautious potential claimant will be time barred at the same time as those of an eager one”</span>

That said, I do not accept that in relation to the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims, the position was quite as it was portrayed when the matter first came before the Court. I consider also that Mr Werner was somewhat coy when giving his evidence at trial in relation to what he knew at various stages.

Mr Twigger pursued this point with Mr Werner towards the end of his cross-examination, putting to Mr Werner that it was misleading to give the impression that before the discovery of the database nothing at all was known about the fraud which is now alleged in these proceedings.

Mr Twigger, in fact, went further because his submission was that Mr Werner had not been candid in what he had to say. On the contrary, Mr Twigger suggested, the evidence demonstrates that Mr Werner had clear and firm beliefs about the essential elements of the alleged violations of the Claimants’ rights long before the discovery of the 1C database which was relied upon so heavily when seeking injunctive relief. Mr Twigger in this regard was able to point to the fact that, whereas in a draft of Mr Werner’s first affidavit, it had been written that Mr Werner had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“for many months been trying to get to the bottom of the KK Group’s dealings”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Quite clearly, Mr Werner made the decision (along with his then solicitors) to give the impression that nothing was suspected, still less known, prior to discovery of the 1C database. I so find. This is regrettable as it would plainly have been preferable if the Court had not been given the impression that nothing was known about the alleged frauds until the 1C database was discovered and, in particular, that no investigations had been carried out before the discovery. It does not follow, however, that Mr Werner’s evidence concerning his state of knowledge at various times should be discounted in the manner suggested by Mr Twigger. The fact that Mr Werner undoubtedly over-egged the position when seeking injunctive relief is certainly to be borne in mind when assessing his credibility, but I do not consider that it is as critical in assessing Mr Werner’s evidence generally as Mr Twigger was inclined to suggest.</span>

Subsequents events are, however, also potentially relevant because they shed some light on the Claimants’ level of actual or deemed awareness prior to 1 August 2010 and 27 August 2012 respectively. Specifically, Mr Twigger submitted that it can be seen from the fact that when Mr Khabbaz bought a stake in KK Plc and started looking into bringing proceedings in New York in the first half of 2012 after being provided by Mr Werner with a copy of the PwC Russia Report that had been produced in December 2009, that the Claimants must already have had the requisite awareness, in any event as regards the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims, as at 1 August 2010.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> (for the purposes of Article 180.1 of the KCC), I start, as did Mr Twigger and Mr Howe, with the position in the months after Mr Werner arrived. The first point which arises in this regard concerns certain discussions which Mr Werner had with Mr Gerasimov. Specifically, Mr Twigger referred in closing to Mr Werner’s evidence that one of the first things that happened after he became a shareholder of KK Plc in July 2009 was that Mr Gerasimov told him that money which Astana-Contract had borrowed from DBK had been routed through Regul back to the KK Group and that, as a result, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“some equipment would have to be bought on behalf of the supplier”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">.  That concerns about the use of DBK’s money was one of the immediate problems which Mr Werner had to deal with when he first became a shareholder is not in doubt. It does not follow, however, that Mr Werner should be regarded as being aware at that time about the principal elements of the Astana 2 Claim which is what Mr Twigger sought to suggest. On the contrary, as Mr Werner later explained when being asked about his discussions with DBK in 2010, he was not aware even then that GS </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“had misappropriated money” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">since, as he understood it,</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Quite to</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">the opposite; in the balance, we were the ones receiving</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">the money, not the ones being defrauded”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Nor do I accept that Mr Twigger can derive any assistance from the fact that Mr Werner was already at the KK Group when, as described in detail earlier, monies were being transferred between KK JSC, Regul, GS and Astana-Contract and an onward payment was being made under the NSA Contract during the first two weeks of October 2009. Mr Twigger suggested that Mr Werner must have been aware of this happening at least in general terms, but I cannot agree with this. On the contrary, consistent with what I have decided in relation to the Astana 2 Claim, it is perfectly obvious that Mr Werner would have been the last person to have been made aware of such transfers. The fact that later in his evidence, when being asked about an email which he sent to Mr Mackay on 15 November 2009 and to which I shall return, he described himself as wanting to know in relation to money which </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“had been sent into the company … had been used by the former shareholders from the company in any untoward way”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> does not justify a conclusion that he wanted to know this as early as September 2009 and so almost as soon as he had started at the KK Group.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is not, however, evidence which I can accept, coming as it did from a witness such as Mr Gerasimov whom I have described as having been very far from straightforward with the Court in the evidence which he gave; indeed, as I have explained when addressing the Astana 2 Claim, Mr Gerasimov was at the very time that he claims to have had these conversations with Mr Werner involved in fraudulent conduct. Moreover, since Mr Werner was aware of Mr Gerasimov’s close friendship with Mr Arip, it is all the more unlikely that Mr Werner would have chosen to confide in Mr Gerasimov about Mr Arip (and Mr Zhunus) siphoning off money from the KK Group. As I have previously observed, whatever relationship Mr Werner might have developed with Mr Gerasimov in the time that he had been in Kazakhstan, could hardly compare with the relationship which Mr Gerasimov and Mr Arip had built up over several years. It follows also that Mr Gerasimov’s evidence that he decided to leave the KK Group after Mr Werner had said these things to him because he became upset about Mr Werner’s alleged unjustified threats to try to obtain money from the former shareholders is not evidence which can readily be accepted. Indeed, I am quite clear that it was simply made up. So, too, I am clear was his suggestion, made for the first time in cross-examination, that another reason for leaving was that Mr Werner had threatened him with investigations into Astana-Contract. Mr Gerasimov explained that he had not mentioned this previously because it was an unpleasant memory for him and he did not think it important. In my view, the real reason why he had not previously mentioned it was that it was an invention designed to bolster his evidence concerning Mr Werner’s state of awareness. Mr Werner described Mr Gerasimov as telling him in around October 2009 that he wished to dispose of his shareholding because he was afraid of certain investigations being carried out by the Kazakh Financial Police connected with the Alliance Bank lending, but that is not the same thing. It appears also, however, that Mr Gerasimov had expressed concern about being a shareholder in a company </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“which might go broke” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">as that is the explanation given in an email which was drafted by Mr McKay of SP Angel and sent to Mr Werner on 2 December 2009 in the context of negotiations concerning liability for certain sums which would otherwise be payable on the transfer of Mr Gerasimov’s shareholding to SP Angel. </span>

Mr Werner forwarded this to Ms Phillips of Norton Rose, the solicitors then acting for the Claimants, without a covering message. Mr Werner explained in evidence that he wanted Ms Phillips to translate what Mr Valitov was saying, although Mr Twigger observed with some legitimacy that if that really was all that Mr Werner wanted from Ms Phillips, then, it was an expensive method of obtaining a translation, especially as there would have been people within the KK Group who could, no doubt, have been called upon to translate. Indeed, since Ms Phillips simply responded with an electronic translation, something which Mr Werner could have obtained without Ms Phillips’ assistance, it is clear that Mr Werner must have wanted to involve Ms Phillips as more than merely a translation facilitator. Indeed, this is rather confirmed by the fact that in the covering message which Ms Phillips sent back to Mr Werner she summarised what Mr Valitov was saying as being that Mr Arip should </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It was suggested to Mr Werner by Mr Twigger that this email demonstrates that his concerns at the time went beyond the DBK/Astana 2 funds issue. Mr Werner denied this, although he stated that he remembered visiting the warehouses, noting that they were empty and asking why. He explained also that he did not investigate the allegations in this email further because Mr Arip had characterised Mr Valitov as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“crazy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">that Mr Werner had been given. Accordingly, Mr Werner added, based on what Mr Arip had told him, he thought that Mr Valitov was an “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">extremely erratic person</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and “</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">simply could not believe that Mr Arip, who I thought to be an amazing businessman, was in the business of defrauding, of stealing money … it simply did not come to my mind</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger’s primary focus in relation to this period, and indeed going forwards also in view of the prominence given to it, was not, in any event, on Mr Gerasimov’s evidence concerning discussions with Mr Werner, but on the PwC Russia report to which I have referred. Mr Twigger highlighted, in particular, how by at least November 2009, Mr Werner was taking an active role in the management of the KK Group and had hired SP Angel to assist him. Specifically, as Mr Werner put it in his second affidavit, in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“their capacity as financial adviser to KK ... SP Angel became aware of some peculiar movements of cash relating to the KK Group’s investments in land and property”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to say that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“SP Angel and KK Group management felt it would be appropriate to have a clear understanding of these movements in order to facilitate financing discussions with the KK Group’s bankers”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and for this reason SP Angel </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“advised the KK Group to instruct PwC ...”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Twigger pointed out in closing, during cross-examination Mr Werner denied that SP Angel had any suspicion of peculiar movements of cash, suggesting that what he had stated in his second affidavit about this was inaccurate. I am in no doubt, however, that this was Mr Werner trying to downplay the level of suspicion which he and SP Angel had at the time. I agree with Mr Twigger that Mr Werner was being less than straightforward, therefore, on this matter. This is regrettable and did not reflect well on Mr Werner’s credibility as a witness. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It does not follow, however, that Mr Werner should be taken as having awareness over and above the awareness which he described SP Angel as having in his second affidavit, namely as to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“some peculiar movements of cash relating to the KK Group’s investments in land and property”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, and nor, obviously, was Mr Twigger in a position to suggest otherwise. What SP Angel did or did not suspect does, however, have a potential bearing on the nature of the exercise which PwC Russia were asked to perform since it was Mr Twigger’s submission, in substance, that Mr Werner and SP Angel were looking to PwC Russia to look into suspected fraud on the part of the KK Group’s former shareholders. In my view, that was not the case, however. I say this for a number of reasons. First, it should be borne in mind that, soon after SP Angel were appointed, a Steering Group meeting took place on 23 October 2009, and the minutes of that meeting record Mr Werner as explaining that in order to assist with </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“shareholders objectives to work with the management to ensure the long term future of the company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, an </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“external team of advisors [sic]”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> had been set up </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“to take this process forward assisted by senior management”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. That team, Mr Werner is recorded as saying, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“will be led by SP Angel as financial advisors [sic] supported by Norton Rose and a credible accountancy firm yet to be appointed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Over the page, the minutes go on to record one of the action points as being the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“appointment of accountancy firm for financial model is required by 27th of October”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Nothing is said in these minutes about suspected fraud or instructing accountants to investigate fraudulent activity. Secondly, in certain minutes relating to a meeting of KK JSC’s Management Committee held on 29 October 2009, there is no mention of any suspected wrongdoing and the only mention of any accountancy firm (actually three firms, PwC, KPMG and Deloitte) is in the context of work being carried out on a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“business plan”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Furthermore, attached to these minutes is a draft letter apparently intended to be sent by SP Angel to the KK JSC’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Board/management”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> in which, under </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Recommendations”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, the only proposal as far as accountants are concerned is that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. There is, therefore, no mention in either the minutes or the draft letter of SP Angel asking any accountancy firm to look into suspected wrongdoing. </span>

Again, this is evidence which I accept since, having rejected Mr Gerasimov’s evidence that Mr Werner told him about his suspicions concerning Mr Zhunus’ and Mr Arip’s fraudulent activities, there is, in truth, no evidence which would justify a conclusion that Mr Werner, so recently arrived on the scene in Kazakhstan, would have been in any position to suspect Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip of fraud. As for Astana 2 and what Mr Werner thought at this time about what had happened in relation to the DBK loan monies, I repeat that if Mr Werner had really thought when sending this email that Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip had misappropriated the monies concerned, then, it is inconceivable that he would not have spelt this out, and not as the last of five action points but at the top of the list of things to be attended to. Mr Werner explained in cross-examination that he was referring in the email, through his reference to funds having been withdrawn, not to Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip having themselves taken the monies relating to the DBK loan but, on the contrary, that</span>

As Mr Howe submitted, it needs in this respect to be borne in mind that Mr Werner had only recently arrived in an extremely complex situation, where there was considerable uncertainty and lack of clarity as to what had been going on and was going on in the business. In those circumstances, he was hardly in any position, so early in the day, to understand what had happened to the DBK monies and still less to form the view that Mr Arip, somebody whom he had respected, had committed fraud.</span>

I do not accept, however, that it establishes that this is the only thing which Mr Werner could have had in mind since the description is also consistent with what Mr Werner explained when cross-examined was his then thinking. Furthermore, I repeat that, if it was fraud that Mr Werner was referring to, then, it is odd that he should have chosen to address the matter only as his fifth (and final) action point. Mr Twigger submitted nonetheless that, if what Mr Werner had to say in evidence was right, then, there was no need for a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“forensic report”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> because circulation of the DBK loan monies would have been easily traceable in the KK Group’s accounts. I cannot accept this submission, however, since it somewhat assumes that what has now emerged, as part of preparations for trial, would have been ascertainable in November 2009 to somebody in Mr Werner’s position, a private banker who had arrived in Kazakhstan with no or very little relevant previous business experience to be confronted by an ever-worsening financial position. It is understandable, in such circumstances, that Mr Werner should turn to SP Angel in the way that he did and, having done that, it is also entirely understandable why Mr Werner and SP Angel should want to have the financial position of the KK Group appraised by an accountancy firm such as PwC Russia. Similarly, I am unpersuaded by Mr Twigger’s heavy reliance, both in cross-examination and in closing, on Mr Werner’s use of the word </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, I am satisfied that, in truth, at the time he did not really focus on the technical meaning of the word and that, as he explained to Mr Twigger, all he meant was that PwC Russia would conduct </span>

I note, really only in passing, that the 15 November 2009 email was considered in some detail by HHJ Waksman QC in his judgment dealing with the Defendants’ applications for summary dismissal of the proceedings: [2015] EWHC 3059 (Comm).

They say that the different explanation given by Mr Werner does not hold water which, here, means that he was lying in his evidence. They are not suggesting that he was confused. This is consistent with the submission that he deliberately misled the Court both initially and indeed on the previous applications as to his true state of mind or knowledge as to the existence of any fraud. </span>

On the other hand if Mr Werner meant as the Defendants suggested, then the notion that they should reinstate only ‘part’ of what they dishonestly took in the fraud makes little or no sense. One also needs to bear in mind that Mr Werner’s starting point was that he did not recall this specific email and no others around the time assisted on what it was about. I do not accept that this explanation goes nowhere because he did not expressly state that he could not recall the “issue” over the recirculation of the DBK Loan as distinct from the email itself. But if this was what he meant at the time and in fact the matter went no further, then I can see how it would not loom large at that stage and so be something easily remembered. It is true that action point 6 also refers to a review of cashflow but it is not clear if this happened (PWC were of course reviewing cashflow and certainly SPA has produced no document about it). </span>

Finally there is the wider context. At that time (November 2009) there are no other documents clearly implicating the former shareholders emanating from or sent to Mr Werner. And he says he never raised the frauds then because he did not know of them. There is a suggestion – and it is no more than speculation – that perhaps, while he knew, he did not want to make a big issue of it lest it scared off potential new shareholders but there is no evidence of this and I disregard it. Finally the explanation of the smoking gun reference I can see as plausible – if PWC did identify clear breaches on the DBK loans which could be laid at the former shareholders’ door then that might well be the pressure point needed to encourage them to put some monies back into KK. … .” </span>

There were, additionally, serious questions about the existence of fraud within the Company and as you will recall, threatening articles in the press and a real concern that the Financial Police might close the Company down. You will also recall that while Mr Gerassimov may have been concerned that his presence was jeopardizing the Company’s future, he was as, concerned, if not more, that his presence within the Company might lead to his being criminally prosecuted and jailed. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> or not spent effectively; (3) noted that Arka-Stroy was paid US$ 39 million for construction work on Aksenger but the contracts provided to PwC Russia only covered US$ 9 million and that in some cases the KK Group paid more than the price named in the contract; (4) observed that the management accounts did not reconcile with the financial statements of the KK Group and that, although told that suppliers were chosen to do work through an official tender process, no tender documentation was provided; (5) identified that the major CIP and PPE suppliers were also related parties of KK Group employees, noting that these related parties included Arka-Stroy LLP and noting that Arka-Stroy was the general subcontractor for the construction works on the Aksenger industrial park project; (6) noted that the related party Arka-Stroy was </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, the PwC Russia report was a document which Mr Werner would have been bound to have been interested in and would obviously have read. The more so, Mr Twigger suggested, given that the report identified very clearly in the</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Conclusion”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Executive summary”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that there were over US$ 170 million worth of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, including land plots and CIP purchased from related parties. Mr Twigger observed in this context that this was in a different order to any concerns which Mr Werner might have had about US$ 22 million borrowed by Astana-Contract from DBK, arguing that it </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“simply beggars belief”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that Mr Werner would not have thought when reading the PwC Russia report that there was nothing to be concerned about. Mr Twigger highlighted also that SP Angel would have been bound to have read the report and that this made it all the more improbable that its significance was not appreciated. Mr Twigger submitted that, in the circumstances, the Court should reject Mr Werner’s evidence that, although he read the report, he did not do so in any detail because it was “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">just a report</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">it didn’t raise any further questions</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” or </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“any flags or any concerns at that time that I thought that should be followed”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Indeed, Mr Twigger suggested in closing that Mr Werner had described the report as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“superfluous”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Strictly, however, this was how Mr Werner described the recommendation that a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> be undertaken, rather than the report itself. Whilst, therefore, I agree with Mr Twigger that Mr Werner is most unlikely really to have regarded the report as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“superfluous”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, not least because it was a report which he and SP Angel themselves commissioned and for which PwC Russia were paid a not inconsiderable amount of money, that is not actually what I understood Mr Werner to be saying. On the contrary, much earlier in his cross-examination (indeed, three days before he gave his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“superfluous”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> answer), the following exchange took place between Mr Werner and Mr Twigger:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Werner was here describing the exercise which PwC Russia, in fact, performed. That was not, however, an exercise which involved looking at suspected fraud. Indeed, aside from PwC Russia’s own description of the work which they undertook (both before the report was prepared in Mr Khaproun’s email on 20 October 2009 and in the report which was ultimately produced), it is important to note that nowhere in the PwC Russia report is there any reference to fraud, let alone fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip whose names are not even mentioned in the report’s sixty pages. The context should be borne in mind, my having rejected Mr Twigger’s submissions that the report was commissioned to look into whether there had been fraud on the part of the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“former shareholders”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“backdrop”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, therefore, is not the one which Mr Twigger has described where fraud is suspected and PwC Russia have been asked to investigate the matter. If PwC Russia really had been instructed to investigate allegations or suspicions of fraudulent conduct, then, it is remarkable that the report should make no reference to such conduct anywhere. True it is that the report refers prominently to</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but it needs to be appreciated that it did so in the context of PwC Russia doing what they were asked to do which was to report on cashflows. Nor, as Mr Howe pointed out, is there any mention in the report of missing funds or unaccountable expenditure. In short, as Mr Howe went on to submit, in my view rightly, none of the information contained in the PwC Russia report could, without more, have been deployed to plead a claim in fraud against anybody. It follows that I do not accept Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner should be regarded as having appreciated that what PwC Russia were describing in their report was fraudulent conduct on the part of Mr Zhunus, Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is important because, focusing on the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims exclusively for the present, Mr Twigger’s submission was that the Claimants (again, in practical terms, Mr Werner) should be regarded as having been aware of the following matters (which I describe almost exactly as set out in Mr Twigger’s written closing submissions) by 1 August 2010: (1) that around US$ 22 million had been paid to GS for construction works at Astana but that a significant proportion of that money had been paid on, via Regul, to the KK Group rather than being spent on construction since Mr Gerasimov told Mr Werner that this was the case in October 2009; (2) that a significant proportion of the money paid to GS in this way had been recirculated back to Astana-Contract and out to the KK Group again via NSA Contract since (i) the recirculation had happened after Mr Werner had become a shareholder, (ii) Mr Gerasimov had told him about the problem at the time, (iii) Mr Werner’s evidence was that he had been required to spend time dealing with this issue when he arrived, and (iv) SP Angel can be expected to have discovered what had happened given that they had taken control of the KK Group’s finances; (3) that Mr Werner believed that some form of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“covert financial support”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> had taken place involving the former shareholders in connection with the money circulated through GS since Mr Werner’s email of 15 November 2009 shows this; (4) that DBK was concerned that KZT 563,002,000 of its loan had been paid for construction work for which there were no corresponding acts of acceptance since T&amp;M’s report dated 4 May 2010 had said this and, Mr Twigger suggested, it is overwhelmingly likely that Mr Werner would have been informed about what the report had to say; (5) that, as Mr Werner stated in his second affidavit (albeit that he described it as being inaccurate when being cross-examined), there had been some </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“peculiar movements of cash relating to the KK Group’s investments in land and property”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger’s invitation to the Court was to make findings that the Claimants were aware of these matters. He submitted that, were the Court to do so, it would follow that the Claimants were aware of enough to mean that they should be taken as being aware that their rights had been violated, so as to mean that the limitation clock had already started running by 1 August 2010. His submission was that, even though there are aspects of the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims which are not included in the above list, the essential elements of those claims are included. Specifically, he suggested that, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Both individually and in combination with the other matters referred to, the PwC report established in Mr Werner’s mind a prima facie case against the former shareholders (and [Ms Dikhanbayeva] as their alleged accomplice)”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This was a recognition on Mr Twigger’s part that the PwC Russia report is critical to the case which he was advancing on Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s behalf. Put differently, unless it can be established that the Claimants became aware or should have become aware of the matters identified by Mr Twigger by 1 August 2010 by virtue of what was contained in the PwC Russia report, then, the limitation defence as regards the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims must fail. I acknowledge that, in setting out the findings he was asking the Court to make, Mr Twigger referred not only to the PwC Russia report but also at (4) to T&amp;M’s report dated 4 May 2010, at (12) to SP Angel’s holding certain views and having discussions with Norton Rose and Mr Khaparov and at (13) to the meeting with Mr Manghi at the Rixos Hotel. The second and third of these matters ((12) and (13)), however, do not entail, even on Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case, Mr Werner or SP Angel acquiring knowledge other than through the PwC Russia report. It is only the first concerning T&amp;M ((4)) which involves, or is said to involve, other information coming to Mr Werner’s and SP Angel’s attention. I will come back to the T&amp;M issue shortly but, subject to that, Mr Twigger’s submissions concerning actual awareness hinge on the PwC Russia report. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This gives rise to three difficulties as far as Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s actual awareness case is concerned. First, for reasons which I have sought to explain, I am unable to conclude that Mr Werner appreciated from the PwC Russia report that Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip had committed fraud. I shall come back to this topic when dealing with Mr Twigger’s reliance on what happened when Mr Khabbaz came on the scene but, as I shall explain when I do that, I do not consider that this warrants a change to the conclusion which I have reached. Secondly, even if it were the case that the Claimants (and Mr Werner) were aware of the matters identified by Mr Twigger, it does not seem to me that this would have amounted to the Claimants (and Mr Werner) having anything more than mere suspicion, in any event. To take an example, (3) is quite clearly concerned with Mr Werner’s belief that there had been wrongdoing, whether that wrongdoing was confined to Astana 2 or it went further. Similarly, (11) concerns PwC Russia’s view that things were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">and that a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was required to confirm that the construction work was worth what had been paid for it amounted to suspicion. So did SP Angel’s view, described in (12), that there were </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“serious questions about the existence of fraud within the company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“possibility of misappropriation of the Company’s funds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This does not equate to the Claimants having enough (actual or deemed) awareness of the frauds or (actual or deemed) awareness that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> the frauds had been committed. Thirdly, even if the matters relied upon by Mr Twigger entailed more than mere suspicion, in my view, this was still not enough. As I have previously explained, it is important to appreciate that what the Claimants allege in these proceedings is that fraud has been committed. In those circumstances, as Mr Twigger put it to Mr Vataev, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the claimant needs details which would be sufficient to cause a reasonable person to consider there has been a fraud”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The Claimants must, therefore, be shown to have become aware of the frauds which are now alleged (alternatively it needs to be established that the Claimants should have become aware of those frauds). Nothing less (including mere suspicion) than this will do. Nor would it have been enough if fraud in a general sense had been in Mr Werner’s or SP Angel’s minds. What is required is that there is awareness of the actual frauds which are now alleged. In the present case, as Mr Howe submitted, there is no evidence at all, whether in the PWC Russia report or anywhere else, demonstrating the following matters, all of which are integral to the claims which are brought in these proceedings: that the Defendants controlled Arka-Stroy; that the Defendants pretended that Arka-Stroy was independent, when it was not; that Arka-Stroy had no genuine independent commercial existence; that Arka-Stroy was managed by colleagues and associates of the Defendants; that the Defendants concealed their own links with Arka-Stroy; that Arka-Stroy paid sums it had received from the Claimants to the ‘Connected Entities’; that Mr Arip controlled Bolzhal and CBC; that Bolzhal and CBC paid sums received to entities connected to and controlled by the Defendants, at which point the money disappeared; that GS was not an independent contractor, but controlled by Mr Gerasimov; that TESS was not an independent contractor, but a connected entity mixed up in fraud; that NSA was controlled by Mr Arip’s nominee; and that Ada-Trade was controlled by Mr Arip’s nominee.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">These are all reasons which mean that Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case on actual awareness cannot conceivably succeed, even if Mr Twigger were right (which, as I shall explain, I do not consider he was) in what he went on to submit concerning Mr Werner’s and SP Angel’s contemporaneous reaction to the PwC Russia report and subject again to the T&amp;M issue which relates to things that happened some months later in May 2010. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">As to what Mr Werner and SP Angel did having received the PwC Russia report, in fact both after receiving the draft report on 3 December 2009 and the final report a little later on 14 December 2009, Mr Twigger pointed out that Mr Werner’s evidence was that he remembered discussing the recommendation concerning </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“performing a technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> with PwC Russia. Indeed, on 11 December 2009, Ms Novikova of PwC Russia emailed Mr Werner stating that she had </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“asked around about an engineering company who could provide engeniering [sic] expert services to you and evaluate the actual % of work done from the contract and the costs of actuall [sic] work performed. I guess I have found one – ‘Stroyexpert’”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Clearly, therefore, Mr Werner must have read the PwC Russia report and, at least initially, considered acting on it even if, as was the case, ultimately he did not take the matter forward (an issue to which I will return later when dealing with the second limb of Article 180.1 of the KCC). Mr Twigger pointed also to the fact that it is apparent that Norton Rose were involved at the time. Indeed, Norton Rose’s time records indicate that they had done work several weeks earlier, on 12 November 2009, which involved their</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “researching on liabilities of third parties, constructive trusts and inducing breach of contract”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger suggested that this again illustrates that Mr Werner and SP Angel, who were the main (although perhaps not only) point of contact with Norton Rose, must at the very least have harboured suspicions concerning Mr Zhunus’ and Mr Arip’s conduct. I do not agree, however, since the work recorded as having been carried out is non-specific in the sense that it merely refers to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“third parties”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> rather than former directors and the reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“inducing breach of contract”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> seems to me somewhat less than apt to cover actions take by Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip given that they had been inside the KK Group until recently. Another explanation, consistent with Mr Werner’s evidence, is simply that the work related to the DBK loan monies issue. As I have explained, if fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip really had been suspected at the time that PwC Russia were being instructed and doing their work, this would have been clearly stated which it was not, whether by Mr Werner or by SP Angel or by PwC Russia themselves. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger next relied upon the fact that Norton Rose’s time records also indicate that on 2 and 3 December 2009, time was spent </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“discussing position of former shareholders with J. Mackay”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Since, however, the draft PwC Russia report was not received until 3 December 2009, the discussions concerned cannot all have been about the PwC Russia report, if it was mentioned at all. Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate in the relevant records that the report was sent to Norton Rose. It is nonetheless clear that there were discussions and they cannot simply be dismissed by Mr Werner on the basis that he was not part of them and was unaware that they were taking place since, as I have explained, SP Angel’s knowledge ought to be attributed to the Claimants and since also Mr Werner accepted that he was in frequent dialogue with SP Angel. It nonetheless does not follow that the discussions between Mr Mackay and Norton Rose were about suspected fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip in circumstances where by this stage, my having rejected Mr Gerasimov’s evidence concerning the discussions he claimed to have had with Mr Werner in September/October 2009, there had been no mention of fraud by anybody. Indeed, it should be noted that Norton Rose do not describe the discussion with Mr Mackay as having involved suspected fraud. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me, however, to an internal Norton Rose email dated 31 December 2009 in which it is stated that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“there might be a possibility of misappropriation of the Company’s funds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Clearly, this is rather more explicit than the previous two records of the work which Norton Rose had carried out. Mr Werner insisted in cross-examination that he was not part of any discussions with Norton Rose. Although that may well be the case in the sense that he was not himself directly involved, it is nonetheless again difficult to accept that he and Mr Mackay did not discuss what Norton Rose were doing. In any event, as I have explained, SP Angel’s knowledge is attributable to the Claimants, and so if they had relevant knowledge the Claimants are to be regarded as also having that knowledge. Mr Werner’s explanation as to what Norton Rose were doing was that he thought (now rather than at the time) that they were looking into his and Mr Mackay’s concern about the circulation of the DBK loan. I agree with Mr Twigger, however, that, if that were the case, it is not easy to see why Norton Rose would have described the circulation of funds back into the KK Group as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“misappropriation of the Company’s funds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or an </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“alleged misappropriation”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since the funds could hardly be regarded as having left. This point is somewhat underlined by the fact that on 4 January 2010 Anna Roberts of Norton Rose is recorded as having carried out </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“research re possible duties and liabilities of directors and shareholders in connection with an alleged misappropriation of company funds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and time is also recorded for </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“analysis of duties and liabilities of directors and shareholders in connection with an alleged misappropriation of company funds”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. That said, it needs to be borne in mind that these are only brief records of the work which was done. I do not consider that they should, as such, be subject to too close textual analysis. It may well be, therefore, that the DBK loan issue was, indeed, what they were asked about. What is nonetheless clear is that work was being performed, and that work would be consistent with Norton Rose looking into fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip. Equally, however, the work described could have been at a rather more general level or, as Mr Werner put it, at a</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “fairly high level”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Indeed, that is what Norton Rose stated in a letter dated 5 November 2013 which was written by the partner involved, Mr Andrew Phillips. Specifically, Mr Phillips explained that Angelica Phillips </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“does not recall anything other than generic discussions about the duties of directors and neither she nor I recall any specific questions in connection with named persons”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that Anna Roberts </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“cannot remember any detail either”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. If Mr Mackay had asked Norton Rose about Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip in particular, no doubt Angelica Phillips and Anna Roberts would have remembered it. The fact that they do not leads me, therefore, to conclude that the advice which they were asked to give was, indeed, at a generalised level. This does not mean, of course, that Mr Twigger’s point loses all force since he was still able to question why Norton Rose would have been asked even for general advice if Mr Mackay, and possibly Mr Werner, had no suspicion about misappropriation whether by Mr Zhunus or by Mr Arip or by any other former shareholder or director. The answer is either that there was a suspicion or that Mr Mackay was wanting to ascertain the legal position in general terms for other reasons. The latter seems unlikely, however, to be the explanation since it is not easy to discern what the other reasons might be. Although this conclusion means that Mr Werner’s denial that by this stage he and Mr Mackay had any suspicion at all cannot be right and so calls into question Mr Werner’s credibility more generally, it nonetheless does not follow that Mr Werner and Mr Mackay should be regarded as harbouring more than mere suspicion at this stage, and suspicion is not by itself sufficient for present purposes.   </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger was also able to point to the fact that on 13 December 2009 Mr Mackay emailed one of his contacts at a public relations firm, Ivo Gabbara, referring to an earlier meeting with a potential investor named Nurlan Khaparov. Mr Mackay wrote that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“We would like to correct what we fear is a generally held belief that we are a front for the old (and corrupt) shareholders” </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger suggested that these discussions arose from Mr Werner and SP Angel’s belief that Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip had misappropriated funds which they should be forced to return. He highlighted, in particular, that Mr Werner denied being at the meeting, suggesting that he did not explain what might have been meant by this comment.

	      <span style="color:#000000">This brings me to the meeting which took place on 14 December 2009, the same day as the final version of the PwC report was sent to Mr Werner. This is the meeting which took place at the Rixos Hotel in Almaty. I have addressed the evidence which Mr Manghi gave concerning this meeting already. I need not, in the circumstances, do so again. Suffice to say that I reject Mr Manghi’s version of events which, despite Mr Twigger describing it as </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, I consider represented nothing more than invention. I acknowledge in this regard that Mr Werner was obliged to change his own version of events when during the course of cross-examination, in response to his denial that any meeting took place at all, he was confronted by the email which Mr Manghi sent to Ms Kogutyuk on 21 December 2009 in which Mr Manghi referred to a meeting with Mr Werner in the evening on 14 December 2009. However, given that as far as Mr Werner was concerned the meeting did not happen in the way described by Mr Manghi, I can understand that Mr Werner would not necessarily have remembered the meeting which was mentioned in Mr Manghi’s email a week later yet without a description coming anywhere near the description which Mr Manghi somewhat belatedly gave in his fifth witness statement in September 2016.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger also highlighted the fact that on 29 December 2009 Mr Werner received a draft presentation to DBK and the draft recorded that the new management had concerns over the valuations of the KK Group’s assets at 31 December 2008. Mr Twigger submitted that those concerns arose out of the PwC Russia report. Mr Werner denied this, explaining that the concerns were about </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the economic crisis and the situation we had with the creditors”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although Mr Twigger suggested that this made no sense since there would have been no reason to have </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“concerns”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> about valuations that were previously correct but which had been superseded by a financial crisis, I do not agree with this since it seems to me that it would have been quite understandable if Mr Werner had been concerned about the KK Group having bought assets when the market was booming (and so at high prices) only to see the market (and prices) subsequently collapse. Either explanation seems to me to be plausible. However, in the light of the views which I have expressed in relation to the PwC Russia report, the imperative to view the matter in the way suggested by Mr Twigger is much reduced. In short, I do not consider that the draft presentation really assists Mr Twigger’s argument on limitation.  </span>

I acknowledge that there is force in this submission. I acknowledge also that it is unlikely that Mr Werner would not himself have been aware that SP Angel held the belief described given that he was working so closely with SP Angel at the time. He may not have known that Mr Mackay was wanting to check SP Angel’s own position as regards coverage but that is not really the critical point since it is the description of the belief which was apparently held which matters for present purposes. In any event, as I have explained, it seems to me that knowledge held by SP Angel ought to be regarded as the Claimants’ knowledge irrespective of whether Mr Werner himself had the same knowledge as SP Angel did. The fact remains, however, that SP Angel can (at most) only have had a suspicion at this stage, indeed only a general suspicion at that, and this does not equate to actual awareness as a matter of Kazakh law. There is simply nothing in the documents to support a conclusion that there was any greater level of knowledge. As HHJ Waksman QC put it at an earlier stage in these proceedings at [81], albeit when expressing some doubt that SP Angel must have shared their belief with Mr Werner, </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows that I cannot agree with Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner and SP Angel had by this time discovered the essential elements of the allegations which the Claimants did not formally pursue until August 2013, some three and a half years later. It follows, therefore, that I also cannot agree that Mr Werner and SP Angel should be regarded as having decided not to pursue claims of which they had become aware for the purposes of Article 180.1. The Claimants had not become aware and so the limitation clock had not yet started running, certainly anyway by this point, namely December 2009/January 2010. Accordingly, although I consider that Mr Twigger was probably right when he submitted that Mr Werner and SP Angel took the decision to focus their efforts on trying to restructure the KK Group’s finances, I do not accept that this involved any parking of claims which Mr Werner and SP Angel knew (as opposed to merely suspected) that the Claimants had. Indeed, although it was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner and SP Angel must have reasoned that evidence showing the misuse of loan and bond/IPO monies would likely prevent a successful restructuring since banks and bondholders would be unlikely to agree to take a haircut on what they were owed in circumstances where there was a claim that former shareholders had misappropriated the loan/bond proceeds, it seems to me that the other side of this particular coin is that it might have been positively helpful if the banks and bondholders were to have been told that it was believed that there was an ability to bring claims against Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip since this might very well have given the banks and bondholders more confidence that monies would be coming into the KK Group. It might also have been positively helpful if Mr Werner and SP Angel had been in a position to make it clear that the difficulties which were being encountered at the KK Group were not the result of some underlying business problem meaning that the business was inherently loss-making but were caused by the previous owners who had since left.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In any event, as Mr Twigger’s submission itself recognised, there is a difference between a decision not to pursue a case against Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip when the essential elements of that case are known, on the one hand, and a decision not to pursue such a case when the essential elements are not known and instead there is merely a suspicion, on the other. I am clear that the present case is an example of the latter, rather than the former, at least as far as the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> limb or actual awareness of Article 180.1 is concerned. A similar point was made by Mr Werner himself in his first affidavit, albeit when distinguishing between fraud and non-fraudulent mismanagement. There, he described the PwC Russia report as</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “an early sign that something was not right”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but explained that his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“immediate priority was to save the KK Group from bankruptcy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. He went on to state that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Once I was satisfied that the viability of the KK Group had been assured, I started investigations into the various matters highlighted by PwC, still believing that I was addressing issues of ordinary (ie honest) mis-management …”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although Mr Twigger complained that it was misleading of Mr Werner to state that investigations only began after the Claimants’ viability had been assured in circumstances where in cross-examination he explained that he commenced investigations in early 2012 after Mr Khabbaz had joined and the first round of restructuring was beginning to fail, I see no reason to doubt Mr Werner’s evidence that the decision to focus on the restructuring was one which was made at a time when it was not known that there had been fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip as opposed to non-fraudulent mismanagement. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger went on to suggest that Mr Werner and SP Angel likewise made a deliberate decision not to disclose the PwC Russia report to BDO in the context of their audit of the 2009 year because they were concerned that it would </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“scupper the ongoing negotiations with the banks”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Specifically, having been engaged to carry out the audit in October 2009, BDO had begun to liaise with Mr Facey of SP Angel about the audit process by 19 January 2010, the same day on which Mr Mackay emailed the D&amp;O insurers, with Mr Facey copied in, about previous shareholders having knowingly authorised payments for contracts which were not properly fulfilled. Mr Twigger’s submission was that, having obtained the PwC Russia report during the immediate build-up to the commencement of the audit, it should obviously have been provided to BDO. The more so, Mr Twigger submitted, since Mr Facey was himself an ex-auditor and so ought to have appreciated its potential significance, especially in view of its reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and what it had to say concerned related parties. This is a matter which I shall come on to address in the context of the second limb of Article 180.1 (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">), including dealing with the issue of whether the PwC Russia report was something which from an auditing perspective was required. Its significance in relation to the first limb presently under consideration, however, is Mr Twigger’s suggestion that Mr Werner and SP Angel made a deliberate decision not to disclose because they had already become aware of the essential elements of the claims now advanced against the Defendants and only chose not disclose the PwC Russia report because of the concern identified by Mr Twigger. It is tolerably clear, not least from a letter from BDO dated 7 February 2017 saying that they were not provided with it, that BDO were not provided with the PwC Russia Report. Indeed, I agree with Mr Twigger that, if BDO had been provided with it, BDO would almost certainly have referred to it or at least some of its content in its report to the Financial Reporting Council in August 2014. The fact that this was not done indicates that BDO cannot have been provided with the report. Nonetheless for the reasons which I have already given, primarily that I do not accept that Mr Werner and SP Angel had anything more than a suspicion of fraudulent conduct at this stage, I reject this further submission made by Mr Twigger. </span>

It will be recalled in this respect also that the initial T&amp;M report was produced three days before an email which was sent on 7 May 2010 by Ms Musagalieva to Ms Dikhanbayeva in which she explained that, following the technical audit, it had not been possible to prove how US$ 4 million of the US$ 22 million DBK loan had been used and that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Although in closing Mr Twigger made a number of criticisms of Mr Werner’s evidence concerning the BDO letter, for example calling into question Mr Werner’s failure to investigate the issue raised about Ms Dikhanbayeva appearing to have continuing influence over board decisions at a time when she had left the KK Group (Issue B) and Mr Werner’s apparent lack of concern about there being significant flows of related party transactions (Issue E), in my view, those criticisms somewhat overlook a simple fact: that BDO did not find that there had been any fraud when they conducted their audit. Specifically, the letter contained a section headed </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Consideration of fraud”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This stated that BDO had performed audit procedures to test identified risks of fraud and performed procedures to consider the risk of the management’s override of controls, such as “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">review of accounting estimates for any deviations, which may result from fraud</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">” and “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">evaluation of business rationale for material unusual transactions</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. BDO then stated, in terms, that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">In the course of our audit of 2009 consolidated financial statements we detected no instances of fraud which, in our opinion, should be communicated to you</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. There is, in short, nothing in BDO’s letter which further enhances Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s argument that the Claimants had actual awareness as at 1 August 2010. That is the position in relation to all the other material relied upon by Mr Twigger in the period leading up to 1 August 2010. Although, in the circumstances, it would be tempting to stop there and not take up time considering events after 1 August 2010, it is necessary to go on and do so, not only in relation to the second limb of Article 180.1 but also, at least so Mr Twigger submitted, in relation to the first limb since he suggested that later events, or some of them, cast light on what the Claimants (specifically Mr Werner and SP Angel) should be taken as having known before 1 August 2010.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Three matters, in particular, were relied upon by Mr Twigger. First, it was submitted by Mr Twigger that, in post-1 August 2010 negotiations with DBK, Mr Werner displayed a clear determination to conceal the PwC Russia report from DBK in order not to derail restructuring negotiations because Mr Werner recognised that the PwC Russia report revealed a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> claim against the former shareholders in respect of a misappropriation of money (including the money which DBK had lent Astana-Contract). Secondly, Mr Twigger suggested that the arrival of Mr Khabbaz at the KK Group and his efforts to bring proceedings alleging fraud illustrate that the PwC Russia report was understood by Mr Werner to have revealed a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> case against the former shareholders that they had stolen at least US$ 170 million from the KK Group since it was the PwC Russia report (and nothing else) which led to Mr Werner and Mr Khabbaz making the decision to bring proceedings. Thirdly, as to the events leading up to the commencement of these proceedings, Mr Twigger submitted that these also show that the PwC Russia report was regarded as containing information which revealed a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I start, therefore, with the DBK negotiations which took place after 1 August 2010 and which concerned what is described in these proceedings (but obviously not in the negotiations) as the Astana 2 Claim. Essentially, DBK continued to do what had been done in May and June 2010 in the context of the T&amp;M report, which was to challenge the use of the money DBK had lent to Astana-Contract. Thus, on 15 September 2010, Ms Musagalieva emailed Mr Facey, Mr Mackay, Ms Yelgeldieva and Ms Kogutyuk about DBK’s two technical audits, explaining that DBK were prepared to accept that US$ 12 million of the total US$ 22.8 million loan had been used properly but not the balance of US$ 10.8 million. A meeting followed this on 26 November 2010 between SP Angel and DBK, during which there was a discussion concerning trying to get the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“misused loan monies back from GS Construct”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and DBK insisted on a letter from Astana-Contract or KK JS promising that they would </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“pursue the evil-doers”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It was nonetheless agreed that this would have to await completion of the restructuring in order not to derail that. Be that as it may, shortly after the meeting Mr Facey sent an email to KK JSC’s board on 7 December 2010 which included an agenda item referring to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“letter to DBK re seeking redress from previous shareholders”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There then followed a meeting with DBK on 14 January 2011, attended by Mr Werner and Ms Kogutyuk, at which DBK demanded </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the disclosure of information regarding claims against the former shareholders”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which, despite some quibbling from Mr Werner in cross-examination when he suggested that this was a reference to the former shareholders of Astana-Contract, was clearly a reference to the former shareholders of KK JSC which, in context, meant Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip. Four days after this, on 18 January 2011, Mr Werner wrote to DBK stating as follows:</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It was Mr Twigger’s submission that Mr Werner was here deliberately telling DBK something which he must have known to be untrue since not only was there no ongoing review since there had been no other review commenced since PwC reported in December 2009 but also there was no question of that review by PwC being continuing. I agree. Mr Werner was not being straightforward with DBK. Nonetheless I do not consider that it follows that, as Mr Twigger went on to submit, Mr Werner did what he did because he did not want DBK to know that PwC had recommended that an investigation be carried out but this had not been done. If that was Mr Werner’s thinking, then, it would appear that DBK would have understood since a similar approach had been advocated in the meeting between SP Angel and DBK on 26 November 2010 when DBK and SP Angel had discussed delaying any action until after the restructuring had been achieved. This, however, is not a point which Mr Werner made when pressed on the issue in cross-examination. Instead, he obfuscated and was particularly unforthcoming as to whether he had provided a copy of the PwC Russia report to DBK at all when, as he ultimately acknowledged, he quite clearly did not do so. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In giving the evidence which he did, Mr Werner was being less than frank because he was trying to ensure that nothing he had to say would cause a problem on the limitation front.

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is, therefore, clear from this letter that Mr Werner understood precisely what DBK were referring to when they complained about the absence of data. It is clear also, however, from his reference to the commissioning of a </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> that Mr Werner was giving the impression that there had to date been no such analysis despite the fact that Mr Werner had previously used the word </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“forensic”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to describe the PwC Russia report. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Mr Werner’s letter was based on, but materially differed from, a draft which Mr Mackay had prepared the previous day because in the draft, instead of a reference to the future instruction of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a leading forensic analysis firm, probably one of the Big Four auditing companies”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although it is possible that this alteration between the two versions came about because Mr Werner was keen to avoid any reference to PwC, I doubt that this was the position since it is not immediately obvious to me that Mr Werner would have had any particular difficulty in telling DBK about the PwC report, as Mr Twigger suggested, in circumstances where DBK were themselves plainly alive to the possibility of proceeding against the former shareholders. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It follows that I do not accept that Mr Werner deliberately chose to hold back on letting DBK see the PwC Russia report, and so to conclude from the fact that Mr Werner did not provide it to DBK that this was because it would be revealed to DBK that he and SP Angel (and so the Claimants) appreciated from the report that there had been the fraudulent behaviour which is now complained about in these proceedings. As I have explained, in my view, the PwC Russia report did no more than raise suspicion in Mr Werner’s and SP Angel’s minds. Since DBK also harboured suspicions, providing them with the PwC Russia report would, in my view, hardly have been problematic. Indeed, it was through pressure from DBK to take some positive action in relation to the misuse of funds that, in March 2011, Mr Werner arranged for Ms Kogutyuk on KK JSC’s behalf to complain to the Financial Police for the City of Almaty to commence a pre-investigation examination of the use of the loan from DBK. Why Mr Werner should in his first affidavit have apparently forgotten about this complaint and so failed to mention it is, I agree with Mr Twigger, not wholly clear. I tend to agree that Mr Werner is unlikely simply to have forgotten about a matter such as this. The explanation, in my view, is that he had not done so when he came to make his first affidavit but instead was anxious not to say anything which would detract from the impression which he wanted to give to the Court when seeking injunctive relief that it was only by discovering the 1C database in March 2013 that he became aware of the Defendants’ fraud. This was regrettable since Mr Werner ought to have been more open with the Court. However, it does not seem to me that the fact that the request to the Financial Police was made demonstrates, without more, that Mr Werner (and the Claimants) did anything more than suspect fraud as at March 2011.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">That is not quite the end to the matter, however, because Mr Twigger was able in cross-examination to show that the request related to the three contracts which are the subject of the Astana 2 Claim (those between Astana-Contract and GS, TESS and NSA). This, Mr Twigger suggested, demonstrates that by March 2011 Mr Werner must have known rather more about the Astana 2 Claim than simply the point (oft repeated by him in cross-examination) concerning the circulation of funds via Regul Telecom. I struggle to see, however, how this really assists Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva given that, even though the PwC Russia report did review the DBK loans and the construction work at Astana 2, as far as I can tell, it did not mention TESS or NSA, as the complaint to the Financial Police did. If that is right, then, Mr Twigger’s reliance on what was raised by the complaint inasmuch as it entails reliance on the contents of the PwC Russia report is somewhat weakened. This still leaves the question of how Mr Werner and Ms Kogutyuk obtained information not in the PwC Russia report, which is a matter of speculation. Unless it can be shown, however, that there was some other source of information before 1 August 2010, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Claimants (through Mr Werner or Ms Kogutuyk) had the requisite level of actual knowledge as at 1 August 2010.</span>

Mr Werner and Mr Khabbaz became friendly straightaway; indeed, Mr Werner even attended Mr Khabbaz’s wedding just a few months later.

Mr Werner denied this in cross-examination, explaining that what he believed at the time was that </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Be that as it may, by February 2012, Mr Khabbaz had become involved in considering the appropriate way of dealing with the pressure being applied on the KK Group by DBK and was exploring the possibility of launching proceedings in New York. Specifically, on 29 February 2012 he wrote to Mr Maxim Telemtayev at White &amp; Case asking about the enforceability of a US Federal Court judgment in Kazakhstan, and Mr Telemtayev replied by telling Mr Khabbaz that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If it were just a lawsuit that doesn’t involve protecting assets in Kazakhstan, I would have strongly recommended filing and/or suing in the U.S. (ex: lawsuit against former shareholders)”</span>

What is nonetheless clear is that it was Mr Khabbaz’s exchanges with Mr Telemtayev which prompted Mr Werner to provide the PwC Russia report to Mr Khabbaz since he did that by email the very next day, 2 March 2012. Mr Twigger suggested that it was somewhat curious that Mr Werner should do this in view of the fact that Mr Werner’s evidence at trial was that the PwC Russia report did not as far as he was concerned raise any major issues.

I consider that Mr Twigger was right about this. It does not follow, however, that Mr Werner (and the Claimants) should be regarded as having had anything more than a suspicion, whether in March 2012 or at any stage after receiving the PwC Russia report. Mr Werner was, in my view, simply reacting to Mr Khabbaz’s litigation plans by providing him with the PwC Russia report. It was, in short, Mr Khabbaz who prompted Mr Werner to dig out the PwC Russia report. I am clear that Mr Werner would not have done so had Mr Khabbaz not adopted the approach which he did.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Thereafter, as Mr Twigger put it, the momentum shifted with Mr Werner signing a settlement agreement terminating SP Angel’s engagement by the KK Group on 7 March 2012 and, just over two weeks after receiving the PwC Russia report, with Mr Khabbaz instructing Ballon Stoll as New York attorneys to draft a complaint alleging the misappropriation of funds and/or breach of fiduciary duties by the former shareholders. This was followed two days later by Mr Werner’s signing of a litigation contract indemnifying Phoenicia Capital for its costs of </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">, as Mr Khabbaz summarised it in an email to Mr Werner on 20 March 2012. This entailed Mr Werner agreeing on KK Plc’s behalf to provide a full indemnity for legal costs and to invest at least US$ 100,000 into the lawsuit. As Mr Twigger observed, there was no suggestion at this stage that Mr Werner was concerned about the ability to make good the case which it was envisaged by Mr Khabbaz would be brought. I do not find this surprising, however, since it seems to me that all that Mr Werner was really doing at this stage was allowing Mr Khabbaz to pursue his strategy. This does not mean that Mr Werner should be taken as having had anything more than (at most) suspicion. </span>

Four days before this, however, there was an email exchange between Mr Khabbaz and Mr Werner concerning Mr Werner’s reference in an email to Mr Khabbaz on 10 April 2012 to his having looked into</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “money that disappeared through related parties to the former shareholders”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Khabbaz pointed out in response to Mr Werner’s email, this seemed to concern things which had happened in 2010 and 2011 and so </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“after the former shareholders were gone”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It was not clear whether Mr Werner’s intention in sending it to Mr Khabbaz was for it to be used in the intended proceedings against the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger nonetheless submitted that Mr Werner’s email was significant because he suggested that it shows that Mr Werner certainly believed at this point that money had disappeared through related parties to the former shareholders and this was the case despite the absence of any significant new evidence. Again, however, it seems to me that the most that Mr Werner’s email can really be said to do is to confirm that Mr Werner was suspicious rather than that, as Mr Twigger put it, he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“had plainly believed this all along”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Werner put it when asked about the Excel spreadsheet worked on by Ms Yelgeldieva which he forwarded to Mr Khabbaz on 24 April 2012, specifically in answer to the suggestion that this showed that Mr Werner had been </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“looking at the amounts by which the construction in progress has been impaired and … looking at that in the context of the amounts that Alliance Bank has paid to PEAK and PEAK has then paid on to Arka-Stroy …  So you have got all the elements of your case at that point, haven’t you, the case you have brought in this claim?”</span>

But at this point I didn’t have the full understanding of the fraud. … At this point I didn’t know that these impairments had been caused not by the financial crisis or not by the fact that the industrial park had to be stopped, but basically by the fact that the works were not done.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger submitted that, in view of its contents, the Lawsuit Narrative establishes that, apart from the land plots allegations, Mr Werner was quite able to detail an arguable case in relation to the PEAK and Astana 2 allegations which was very largely, and indeed avowedly, based on the contents of the PwC Russia report. Moreover, Mr Werner was able to obtain any additional information required directly from Ms Kogutyuk and Ms Yelgeldieva since the Lawsuit Narrative was put together before Ms Gorobtsova had started at the KK Group (she started in early May 2012 but only 5 days before Mr Werner sent the Lawsuit Narrative to Mr Khabbaz) and before also Mr Gafurov had carried out any investigation (which he did in January the following year). It was also, Mr Twigger, observed before discovery of the Arka-Stroy 1C database in March 2013. Indeed, Mr Werner accepted in cross-examination that he had got all of the information which he put in the Lawsuit Narrative without the Arka-Stroy 1C database. The difficulty with Mr Twigger’s submissions in relation to the Lawsuit Narrative is, however, that the document was very lacking in detail. It was, indeed, as Mr Howe put it in closing, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“threadbare”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, showing, if anything, the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">limits</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of the Claimants’ knowledge, particularly as regards Arka-Stroy where nothing is said about Arka-Stroy’s role, again as Mr Howe put it, acting as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a Trojan horse within the system, being used effectively as simply a front to siphon money out of the company under cover of construction contracts”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Werner’s acceptance that he was able to prepare the Lawsuit Narrative without having access to the Arka-Stroy 1C database needs to be viewed in the context of a document which did not develop the case as it is ultimately came to be framed as far as Arka-Stroy is concerned. I do not accept, therefore, that the Lawsuit Narrative is as helpful a document to Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva as Mr Twigger sought to portray it.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Returning to the chronology, over a month later, on 25 June 2012, Mr Khabbaz emailed Mr Werner, asking him </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Why has Kagazy never sued the former shareholders in spite of your knowing about the PWC Review since 2009; do you realize what a huge breach of fiduciary duty that is?”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. As Mr Twigger observed in closing, Mr Werner never responded to that question. In particular, he did not suggest that the reason was that the PwC Russia report gave insufficient information to enable a claim to be launched. I do not find that surprising, however, since I can well understand, having read the exchanges between Mr Werner and Mr Khabbaz from around this time, that Mr Werner might not have thought that a response was really sought. The question posed was, in context, somewhat rhetorical. It needs also to be appreciated that Mr Khabbaz’s email ranged over a number of different matters, including the rather disconcerting fact as far as Mr Werner was concerned that he found himself named as a defendant in the draft proceedings which had been sent to him. As to this, it is worth setting out what Mr Khabbaz had to say because it shows something about his approach:</span>

It was to be expected to include you as a defendant especially when your past was so entangled with that of the former shareholders. You simply can’t make an omelette [sic] without breaking eggs. But as I already told you for example, that if I wanted to be tough, I would have also gone after invalidating your shares. My point is, I am not after you, but I am after everyone else named in the lawsuit and that has harmed this company and I will not let go until I clear them out of the Company’s way. To accommodate your request in our conversation and to make you feel comfortable, I will ask my attorneys to amend the lawsuit and take you out completely as a defendant in the lawsuit, in effect protecting shares for the future and not getting your name sullied in public legal filings. It’s important for me that you feel comfortable with my course of action even if as a result, the lawsuit will be something that is not ideal from a legal basis.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger pointed out in closing that Mr Werner suggested in cross-examination that Mr Khabbaz was wrong to sue when he did and his claim failed and was dismissed, despite the fact that Mr Werner had fully supported the claim, had raised no complaint about it being premature and had entered into the litigation contract which he did. These were fair points. So, too, was the criticism which Mr Twigger made concerning Mr Werner’s reliance on an advice which he received from the New York attorneys, GS2 Law, on 2 July 2012 since it is quite clear that that advice was mainly focused on technical procedural aspects related to the bringing of a derivative action, with very little being said concerning the underlying merits of the claims intended to be brought. However, as Mr Howe pointed out in closing, in his fourth affidavit, Mr Werner relied not only on the advice which he had received (albeit that KK JSC had paid for the advice) from GS2 Law, but also on what Mr Arip’s own New York lawyers had to say in support of the Motion to Dismiss which they came to file on his behalf. Specifically, Mr Werner quoted the following passages from the motion: </span>

The complaint falls woefully short of providing the required level of specificity to support any of Phoenicia’s breach of fiduciary based claims… as it consists of little more than wholly unfounded vague and conclusory allegations, as well as numerous inherent inconsistencies. The only other claim asserted against Arip and Zhunus - civil conspiracy (the First Cause of Action)-fails for the same reasons, because under both Isle of Man and New York Law such a claim stands or falls on the allegations of the underlying wrongful conduct. The complaint’s lack of specificity is particularly telling here, where the sole owner of Phoenicia is also a current board member of KK Plc and thus had full access to the Company’s financial records one would expect the complaint to contain a detailed and coherent account of the means by which tens of millions of dollars were allegedly stolen from the company.

The complaint contains virtually no factual allegations to support this alleged scheme- including the name of the construction company that was purportedly a sham, the dates or specific amounts of any payments to the construction company (.. .) Nor is it clear from the complaint which entity is alleged to have made the payments to the construction company -- while the complaint initially asserts those payments were made by KK JSC, 3 paragraphs later it alleges that the same payments were made by MTS.

I agree about that. The fact is that the complaint was pretty vague and was not framed in the same way as the PEAK Claim has been in these proceedings. This is because, as Mr Werner explained, although it was clearly understood that Arka-Stroy was related to the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> document is a far from detailed document. It gives only very limited information and does so by reference (again) to the PwC Russia report. I consider that, indeed, if anything, it illustrates how little in terms of detail was known at this stage, rather than how much was known as Mr Twigger would suggest. The reason is straightforward: as with the Lawsuit Narrative, the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“KK Story”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> document was prepared at a time when, as Mr Werner explained when dealing with the Lawsuit Narrative, it was not known that Arka-Stroy was “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">a complete KK company, like we discovered in the end</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. This was only known on discovery of the 1C database. Until then that important aspect of the PEAK Claim was not known or, as Mr Howe put it in his reply submissions, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the piece of the puzzle which makes the picture comprehensible”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> in the sense that it explains the real nature of the PEAK Claim, and Mr Twigger was in no position to suggest otherwise. Indeed, as I have previously explained, in setting out the factual findings which he invited the Court to make concerning the Claimants’ knowledge as at 1 August 2010, Mr Twigger did not suggest that that knowledge included awareness that Arka-Stroy was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a complete KK company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> since, of course, the findings which Mr Twigger invited the Court to make were derived from the PwC Russia report, a document which I have already concluded did not give the Claimants enough knowledge (as opposed to suspicion) to amount to actual awareness for Article 180.1 purposes. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">” with KK employees whose trust she had gained, she got a picture of how the company had operated before Mr Werner joined the company.

Ms Gorobstova knew Mr Gafurov, who with his father ran a construction company, Kazstroyinvest, and she approached him around November/December 2012 to ask if he would be able to carry out an assessment. Ms Gorobstova explained that, at that time, they were not instructing Mr Gafurov to make a formal report to use in evidence (not least because she knew Mr Gafurov did not have the necessary qualifications which would be required), but that she personally wanted to understand what had happened, and wanted someone she trusted to “</span>

Mr Gafurov and his father visited the Akzhal and Aksenger sites in December 2012, a few days before Christmas, and Mr Gafurov returned around 15/16 January 2013 for two weeks to carry out a more detailed survey of the sites and analyse relevant paperwork. At the end of January 2013, Mr Gafurov produced his report, which made a number of findings which are relevant to the claims in these proceedings. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger submitted that Mr Gafurov’s report is significant not for the reason suggested by Mr Werner, namely that it was one of the pieces of information that allowed him to discover, as he put it in cross-examination, the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“full extent”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of the alleged frauds, but because of the fact that it was commissioned in order to provide evidence in support of an application for a freezing injunction which Mr Werner had already decided should be made, as demonstrated by his instructions which he gave to Zaiwalla in December 2012.  As Mr Twigger put it, it was the need to obtain evidence to support the claim which prompted Mr Gafurov’s report, not his report which prompted the claim. This, Mr Twigger submitted, indicates that Mr Werner already had sufficient awareness to justify his giving those instructions. I disagree. The fact that Mr Werner gave the instructions which he did to Zaiwalla shows what he wanted to achieve. It does not follow, however, that he already knew what Mr Gafurov was to go on and report. Indeed, if that were the position, there would have been no need to have instructed Mr Gafurov at all unless, of course, the exercise carried out by Mr Gafurov had already been performed yet there is no evidence, and nor has it even been suggested by Mr Twigger, that that had happened.  In this respect, although it was put to Mr Werner that he knew that the Acts of Acceptance were false before Mr Gafurov’s report, the evidence that this was the case is somewhat lacking. The most that might be said, in my view, is that Mr Werner harboured suspicions concerning the Acts of Acceptance. In the absence of evidence showing that he had already done the exercise which Mr Gafurov performed or that somebody else had done it for Mr Werner, it makes no difference that, as Mr Twigger pointed out, Ms Gorobtsova commented in cross-examination on how simple the exercise undertaken by Mr Gafurov was, entailing as it did Mr Gafurov looking “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">at the contracts that were available</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”, looking </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“at the amount of work that had been claimed to have been done, amongst the work paid”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and Mr Gafurov then giving </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“his professional thinking of how much it should have cost”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> so as to arrive at </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the difference, which was something over 100 million”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. The simple fact is that what Mr Gafurov did had, on the evidence, not been done before. Nor does it matter that Mr Gafurov’s work predominately relied upon information that was freely available to the Claimants, so as to mean that, as he agreed with Mr Twigger, if he</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “had done the same investigation in 2009”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, he </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“would have got the same documentation” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">and could, therefore, have reached the same conclusions in 2009 or 2010. There is no evidence that, prior to Mr Gafurov doing what he did, anybody else had performed the exercise. On the contrary, if it had already been done, it is inconceivable that Mr Gafurov would have been asked to carry out the exercise at all.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> in the report such as Acts of Acceptance </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“saying that they used 3.2 people or something really obvious”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“we were shocked that it really happened in such a huge amount”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger submitted that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“by contrast”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> Mr Werner’s evidence was that, prior to the January 2013 meeting, he had met with Mr Gafurov on a number of occasions, describing Mr Gafurov’s report as an </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“iterative process”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> as opposed to </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. That is, indeed, what Mr Werner stated.

	      <span style="color:#000000">In this last answer Mr Werner was, in my view, simply confirming that (at most) he had prior suspicions over Arka-Stroy’s role and that those suspicions had increased, hence his reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“circling”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I do not consider it follows, however, that Mr Werner should be taken as saying that what Mr Gafurov’s report had to say concerning Arka-Stroy was not shocking since, in view of what was stated about the Acts of Acceptance, it is somewhat artificial to divorce Mr Werner’s reaction to what was said by Mr Gafurov about Arka-Stroy from what was said by Mr Gafurov concerning the Acts of Acceptance. In short, I am not persuaded by Mr Twigger’s submission that the evidence as to Mr Werner’s shock is so contradictory as to mean that it has been made up. Furthermore, although it is not clear whether Mr Werner was agreeing with Mr Twigger that by </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“always”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> he meant from the outset or from the time when the PwC Russia report was received. It is, however, unlikely that Mr Werner was saying this given his insistence on other occasions that he did not have such suspicions at so early a stage. In any event, suspicion is not enough for Article 180.1 purposes.    </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The third issue which arises concerns the discovery of the 1C database and the evidence which Mr Werner gave on this. I have addressed certain particular criticisms previously and so need not do so again. The more general point which was made by Mr Twigger was that the discovery of the Arka-Stroy 1C database was neither crucial nor necessary for the Claimants to make the allegations which they now make. At most, Mr Twigger submitted, the contents of the database enabled the Claimants, at least on their case, to strengthen the inferences upon which they now rely because they can allege that the recipients of a portion of the sums paid to Arka-Stroy were connected to the Defendants. Mr Twigger’s submission was that, even without the database, the Claimants would have still alleged, as they do now, that Arka-Stroy is Mr Zhunus’ and Mr Arip’s company and so that all sums paid to it were for their benefit. I cannot accept this, however, since it is clear to me, as I have previously explained, that it was not until discovery of the database that Mr Werner (and so the Claimants) could understand what had happened in terms of money flow from Arka-Stroy and in terms also, crucially as I see it, of understanding what Arka-Stroy actually was, which was that it was “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">a complete KK company</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. The fact that Mr Werner was already aware of connections between Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip and Arka-Stroy is not the same thing as learning that Arka-Stroy was actually “</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I should mention one final matter concerning the Business Audit Report which was sent to Mr Werner on 23 November 2012 by Ms Yelgeldieva. This was something which Mr Werner also relied upon in his first affidavit, as having revealed information without which he could not have known that he had a potential claim in relation to the Astana 2 allegations. Mr Twigger submitted that not only was Mr Werner wrong to say that he did not obtain this report until January 2013, but also that it cannot have been a report which was as significant as Mr Werner sought to suggest in that it resulted, as Mr Werner himself stated in his first affidavit and on other occasions, in no </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">). This submission, however, overlooks the real point which Mr Werner was making in his first affidavit, which was that it was the contents of the report (rather than its overall outcome) that he regarded as significant and about which he had not previously known. I can understand this. The more so, given that the Astana 2 Claim involves the level of complexity which it does. It should be borne in mind also that the majority of the matters relied upon by Mr Twigger in the limitation context are matters which concern the Claimants’ alleged awareness of the PEAK Claim, specifically concerning Arka-Stroy’s involvement, rather than Astana 2-related matters.</span>

Accordingly, the conclusion which I reach in relation to the first limb of Article 180.1 is that the Claimants (whether through Mr Werner or SP Angel or anybody else for that matter) did not in relation to the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims have the requisite actual awareness for limitation purposes.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> of the requisite matters by 1 August 2010 so as to mean that the 3-year limitation period had expired by the time that proceedings were commenced.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of such violations for the purposes of the second limb of Article 180.2 of the KCC. Put shortly, Mr Twigger submitted that, if the Court were to find (as I have done) that the matters on which he relied for the purposes of his contention that there was actual awareness for the purposes of the first limb of Article 180.1, then, those matters (characterised by Mr Twigger as </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> through which (either independently or in combination), he contended that the Claimants should have become aware of the violations of their rights. First, he submitted that, even without following the express recommendation in the PwC report to instruct an expert to carry out a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, Mr Werner should himself have pursued at an earlier stage the investigations he subsequently undertook in the period from March to May 2012 when he and Mr Khabbaz had decided that a claim should be instigated and were taking steps to enable this to happen, including preparation of the Lawsuit Narrative, which Mr Twigger submitted demonstrates a sufficient awareness of the violation of the Claimants’ rights to start the limitation period running. Secondly, Mr Twigger submitted that Mr Werner or SP Angel should have pursued the recommendation in the PwC Russia report to engage to carry out a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and that, if they had done so, the result would have been equivalent to (or better than) the result achieved by Mr Gafurov in 2013. Thirdly, Mr Twigger submitted that Mr Werner or SP Angel should have provided the PwC Russia report to BDO when they were performing their audit and that, if this had been done, then, the result would again have been that what Mr Gafurov was to find out almost three years later would have been ascertained before 1 August 2010. As I shall explain in what follows, I am not persuaded by any of these propositions.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Starting with the Lawsuit Narrative, Mr Twigger’s central submission was that, once the decision was taken to commence proceedings in New York, they were able to move very quickly to a position of drafting the complaint which came to be issued. Mr Twigger in this context highlighted the relevant timing whereby, Mr Werner having provided Mr Khabbaz with a copy of the PwC Russia report on 2 March 2012, Ballon Stoll came to be instructed just seventeen days later, on 19 March 2012, under a retainer which described their work as being as regards the filing of </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the Insiders’ wrongful misappropriation of [KK Plcs’s] funds and/or breaches of their fiduciary duties towards [KK Plc]”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">.  This was followed, it will be recalled, very shortly afterwards by the Claimants entering into a litigation contract under which they agreed to cover the legal costs associated with the New York lawsuit. Mr Twigger also highlighted how Mr Khabbaz plainly considered the PwC Russia report in some detail, as demonstrated by the fact he reverted to Mr Werner with various questions, so promoting Mr Werner to carry out research into the use of the Alliance Bank loans with the assistance of Ms Yelgeldieva who prepared an Excel spreadsheet showing how the money had been used to fund Arka-Stroy.  </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Accordingly, Mr Twigger submitted, things were able to move speedily and effectively, so showing that there is no reason why there could not have been similar steps taken after the PwC Russia report was first received. Specifically, having been asked by Ballon Stoll to produce a detailed narrative, Mr Werner was then able by 8 May 2012, just under two months after the decision was taken to sue, in conjunction with Mr Khabbaz, to produce the Lawsuit Narrative. As Mr Twigger correctly pointed out and as has been explained already, that document was largely based on the PwC Russia report. Although there is no issue about that, again as has been previously explained, there is very much an issue as to whether Mr Twigger was right when he went on to submit that the Lawsuit Narrative contained, as he put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“all the essential elements of the PEAK and Astana 2 violations that are alleged in these proceedings”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Indeed, I have already decided that that was not the case, specifically (and significantly) that what it was able to say about Arka-Stroy was very limited indeed with nothing about, again adopting Mr Howe’s description, Arka-Stroy’s role, in effect, as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a Trojan horse”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. This conclusion is as fatal to Mr Twigger’s submissions on the second limb of Article 180.1 of the KCC (</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">) as it is to the actual awareness issue. It is not, in my view, sufficient for Mr Twigger merely to refer to the fact that the PwC Russia report described Arka-Stroy as a related party by virtue of Mr Esimbekov’s involvement and to the fact that the Lawsuit Narrative itself referred to a number of connections between the KK Group, the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“former shareholders”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and Arka-Stroy. It is one thing to know (let alone suspect) fraudulent conduct in a generalised sense, but quite another to know enough actually to put forward a fraud case. Mr Twigger submitted that details of the onwards payments from Arka-Stroy are not essential elements of the PEAK Claim, and so that the destination of the payments from the Claimants to Arka-Stroy was not something which needed to be known before the Claimants could plead the claims for breach of duty. Whether that is strictly right or wrong is not really the point, however, in circumstances where it was through knowing where the monies went (in other words to the ‘Connected Entities’) that there had, indeed, been fraud and what that fraud entailed. In that way, suspicion could make way for something rather more concrete. It is that something more concrete which is required for present purposes. Nor, in my view, does it assist Mr Twigger to point to the facts that the PwC Russia report identified a mismatch between the amounts paid for construction work and the contracts for that work, or to the Excel spreadsheet which he produced with Ms Yelgeldieva in March 2012 based on work carried out by the KK Group’s financial department in relation to Acts of Acceptance, or to the fact that in the Lawsuit Narrative reference is made to Acts of Acceptance signed by Mr Tulegenov and Mr Yesimbekov adding up to EUR 37 million alongside a claim valuation of as much as EUR 200 million. This is because, whilst it may well be that it was suspected that the Acts of Acceptance were not what they appeared to be, again suspicion alone is not enough. Mr Werner explained the position in this exchange with Mr Twigger:</span>

The Lawsuit Narrative does not, for the reasons which I have given, demonstrate a level of knowledge (as opposed to suspicion) which is sufficient. Furthermore, given that the New York proceedings were the subject of a Motion to Dismiss and then came to be withdrawn, it is difficult to see how the fact that those proceedings were commenced (in, after all, a jurisdiction where allegations of fraud are more easily levelled than in some other jurisdictions) really assist Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case in this respect. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger drew attention to Mr Werner’s reference to the audit process undertaken by BDO having </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“taken a lot of initiative starting with the valuation of all the assets”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Twigger suggested that Mr Werner </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“appeared”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to suggest that the audit made it reasonable not to carry out further investigations. The passage in Mr Werner’s cross-examination cited by Mr Twigger involved Mr Werner being asked not about the recommendation which was contained in the PwC Russia report, but about the Representation Letter which was provided to BDO some months later, specifically why in that letter no reference was made to fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip being suspected. It is not, therefore, strictly accurate to suggest that Mr Werner’s evidence at the time that he received the PwC Russia report was that the audit process in and of itself made it reasonable not to arrange for a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> to be performed. Mr Werner’s contemporaneous thinking at the time that he received the PwC Russia report was explained in the following exchanges between him and Mr Twigger:</span>

So again, I had a clear understanding that these assets had been valued a month or a month and a half before this valuation had been done by companies that were accredited according to international standards, with all the -- with all the necessary requirements, and as a result of these valuations, there were $250 million of impairments.</span>

I supposed at that time that everything was in order. Not in order in the sense that everything was in order. Definitely I knew that these projects had interrupted, that these projects had fallen in value tremendously, that the company was in huge financial difficulties.

It had an enormous amount of legal proceedings, it was enormous difficulties in financing with creditors. I think that one has to be reasonable and a director and personnel have to make reasonable enquiries and reasonable -- they have to make reasonable use of their time.  Because otherwise if they misspend the time on things that we didn’t consider relevant at that time, the company would have gone bankrupt and then I would have had to assume the responsibility of not pointing to the things that mattered at that time to the company, which were not necessarily just a comment about one contract.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Mr Twigger described this as merely an excuse, observing that, if lack of resources was genuinely a difficulty, then, this would have given even more reason for Mr Werner personally to carry out the kind of investigations which he eventually undertook in 2012 leading to the Lawsuit Narrative and, furthermore, that, in view of the sheer scale of the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> described in the PwC Russia report, it was incumbent on Mr Werner to ensure that action was taken. In my view, however, Mr Howe was right when he suggested that such criticism really amounts to no more than second-guessing a commercial decision made by Mr Werner that a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“technical expertise”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> was not necessary in order to give an explanation to creditors. This seems to me to be a reasonable decision given the parlous financial state that the KK Group was in at the time. I acknowledge, however, that the position would be different if I had reached a different conclusion concerning how the PwC Russia report would have been received by the Claimants since, if it had described fraudulent behaviour on the scale suggested by Mr Twigger, then, a lack of funds in and of itself would be less likely to justify a decision to follow the recommendation. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to go on and consider what would have happened if Mr Werner had instructed an expert, whether that be Stroyexpert, the firm recommended by Ms Novikova of PwC Russia in her email to Mr Werner on 11 December 2009, or Mr Gafurov or any other expert for that matter.</span>

It will be recalled that I have previously expressed certain reservations concerning the audit-related expert evidence which was given by Mr Crooks and Mr Grummitt. Having considered that evidence and for reasons which I shall set out below, my conclusion on this issue is that, whilst the PwC Russia report ought to have been provided to BDO for the purposes of their audit, nonetheless the issues identified in the report ought to have become apparent to BDO as a result of their audit, in any event. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the trigger issue, I agree with Mr Twigger that it is perfectly obvious that the PwC Russia report ought to have been provided to an auditor in BDO’s position. Indeed, as I have pointed out, ultimately once he focused on the fact Mr Twigger was asking him to assume for the purposes of the questions which he was being asked that BDO had neither seen the PwC Russia report nor been made aware of its contents and that the report contained material information, Mr Crooks conceded that this is the position. In truth, since, again as I have pointed out, it is tolerably clear that BDO were not provided with the report, the only real question is whether it contained information which was material and, as such, should have been provided to BDO. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. This is terminology which finds an echo in section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006 where “relevant audit information” is defined as being </span>

This is whether, had the report been provided to BDO, this would have resulted in the material allegations which are made in these proceedings being identified by BDO when performing their audit.

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the areas of KK Plc’s activities covered by the PwC Report should have been addressed as part of BDO’s routine audit procedures because not only are they material to KK Plc’s FY2009 financial statements, they are financial transactions which in my experience fall to be audited in the ordinary course”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. In other words, Mr Grummitt’s view is (and always has been) that it should not have made any difference whether BDO were given the PwC Report or not because BDO should have discovered the frauds anyway in the course of their audit. In short, BDO should have more than covered the same ground as the PwC Report in the course of their audit, and so it should not have made any difference whether they received that report or not.

This witness statement was served in response to a report from Grant Thornton dated 6 November 2014 which was exhibited to a witness statement from Mr Crestohl dated 11 November 2014.

Specifically, Mr Werner explained that he and Mr McGregor (together with Mr Crestohl) realised that the location of these 14 land plots on a cadastral map was highly suspicious because it showed them to be outside the area of the Aksenger site, that the land was, from a commercial perspective, of no use at all, and that the prices paid for this land seemed to be exceedingly high, particularly considering the financial crisis which was in full effect in Kazakhstan at the time the land was acquired. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is a conclusion which is only reinforced once it is appreciated that in the report which he prepared at the end of January 2013 Mr Gafurov had prepared a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“summary of purchased plots”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, which listed all of the land that had been purchased by the KK Group, and a further</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “compilation of land contracts”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, which set out more information on the number, size and purchase price of the land plots. Mr Gafurov also noted a suspicious disparity in prices between the various purchases of land plots by the KK Group, noting in particular that one of the land plots bought from Bolzhal was purchased for KZT 31,523,684 whereas a similar sized plot in a nearby location was bought for KZT 217,418. He observed that the management did not act in a coherent way when buying land and allowed the company to become subject to land price speculation. Mr Gafurov formed the view, as he explained when being cross-examined and as I am clear that he would have explained to Mr Werner and Ms Gorobtsova at the time, that his investigations had shown that it was clearly not the case that the KK Group was buying the land plots in the best interests of the company and that he concluded that the KK Group was overpaying for the land without any care for the fair price, indeed that it looked </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“more like money was siphoned out, rather than just buying land”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how Mr Werner can have been right to say when giving evidence that before November 2014 nobody, including Mr Gafurov, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“had ever come up with the idea that there was a fraud”</span>

Specifically, reliance on Mr Gafurov’s report in January 2013 (and so approaching six months after 27 August 2012) takes matters nowhere. Recognising this, Mr Twigger concentrated his submissions as far as actual awareness is concerned on matters which pre-dated 27 August 2012. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Specifically, Mr Twigger referred to the Lawsuit Narrative and the board minutes relating to the meeting which took place on 20 August 2012, suggesting that, although there was no express reference to land plots, the US$ 170 million of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> (the phrase, of course, used in the PwC Russia report) referred to in the Lawsuit Narrative should be regarded as including them. He also relied on the PwC Russia report’s references to the fourteen land plots as having been purchased for US$ 45.171 million in cash from two related parties, Bolzhal and CBC, and to Ms Dikhanbayeva, who was KK JSC’s financial director since 2001 and Chairman of the Board in 2008, was listed as the director of Bolzhal and CBC, together with the fact that the same report observed that, although the price paid for the land plots in 2008 seemed to be in line with average rates, in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“2009 the average price per hectare is 399 thousand”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“is higher than the price per hectare paid by the group in 2008 (USD 262 thousand), before the economic downturn had begun”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, for the reasons which I have previously set out at some length when addressing the issue of awareness as regards the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims, I am not persuaded by these submissions. The more so, in the case of the Land Plots Claim given that the PwC Russia report is, if anything, even less explicit in relation to that claim than it is in relation to the other two claims. The reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable transactions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> is very generalised and the suggestion, therefore, that it should be regarded as including the land plots is more than a little ambitious. The references to CBC and Bolzhal do not really point in any very clear way to fraud in the case of land plots, and the last matter is again not exactly unequivocal.</span>

I accept Mr Werner’s evidence that he believed that the impairment of land values in the 2009 accounts was attributable to the financial crisis.

Mr Werner, indeed, accepted that Mr Khabbaz had formed a view at an early stage that land had been purchased at an overvalue and that he had told Mr Khabbaz that land had been purchased at a time of irrational exuberance. This does not necessarily mean, however, that Mr Khabbaz believed that the land plots had been purchased for the purpose of misappropriating monies from the KK Group. Indeed, if that was what Mr Khabbaz really believed, then, it is curious that apparently he did not himself press Mr Werner to take the steps which Mr Twigger suggested at trial ought to have been taken. It seems more likely, in fact, that what Mr Khabbaz had in mind in the document which he prepared was that Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip had improperly misrepresented the value of company property in order to artificially inflate the share price since that is what the complaint filed in New York in September 2012 appears to have had as its focus.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“cross-fertilization” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">points. The first of these involved Mr Twigger pointing out that the present proceedings were commenced on 2 August 2013 when the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims were advanced, whereas the Land Plots Claim’s first mention was not until 26 November 2014, some 15 months or so later. Mr Twigger submitted that, in these circumstances, were the Court to accept that the Claimants were, or should have been, aware of the violations of their rights in relation to the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims by 1 August 2010, then, it is likely that proceedings in respect of those two claims would have been commenced in relatively short order and, had that happened, then, the Claimants would have become aware of the Land Plots Claim sooner than they actually did because, based on what has actually happened in relation to these proceedings, the Claimants would have acquired such awareness within about 15 months after the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims had been commenced. Accordingly, Mr Twigger submitted, the Land Plots Claim ought now to be regarded as time-barred.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is an ingenious argument which I cannot accept. It is an argument which has a certain logic to it but it also seems to me to have an air of artificiality to it. In any event, in view of the conclusion which I have reached concerning awareness in relation to the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims, this aspect of cross-fertilisation cannot avail Mr Arip and Ms Dikhanbayeva. Nor does the second cross-fertilisation point raised by Mr Twigger do so. This entailed an argument that Mr Gafurov’s report was either sufficient, when combined with the information in the PwC Russia Report that Bolzhal and CBC were related parties, to give the Claimants a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> case in relation to the Land Plots Claim, or it was certainly enough to prompt a reasonable person to investigate at that stage and the Claimants should, therefore, have had a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">prima facie</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> case two weeks later.  This argument, however, depends on the Court having concluded that the Claimants should have followed PwC Russia’s recommendation to engage an expert in late 2009 or early 2010, so as to mean that the Claimants should have become aware of the Land Plots Claim well before 2012. In view of the conclusion which I have reached on that issue, this point also, therefore, falls away.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is necessary, therefore, to consider Mr Twigger’s reliance on the matters which he submitted ought to have triggered the kind of investigation carried out by Mr McGregor in November 2014. The first of these was, again, receipt of the PwC Russia report in December 2009. Mr Twigger observed that the matters relied on in relation to actual awareness above are equally clear reasons why a reasonable person would have carried out an investigation. Accordingly, he submitted, that, for example, even if Mr Werner did not himself notice the reference to the prices paid in 2009 being higher than those paid in 2008 before the downturn began, a reasonable director would have noticed it, especially given that the report identified those transactions as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“questionable”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. For reasons which I have explained, however, this point similarly goes nowhere. Similarly, again for reasons which I have previously given, Mr Twigger’s suggestion that a reasonable person would have provided the PwC Russia report to BDO (something which I accept) and that this report would have revealed to BDO that the sellers of the plots were (potentially) related parties and that would have been bound to raise suspicions about the transactions, also does not assist Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s contention. The same applies to the next point, namely Mr Twigger’s related reliance on the reference to an increase in the price of land plots said to have arisen as consideration for services which had not been provided and for which no contract existed as described in the Addendum dated 7 April 2009. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Fourthly, Mr Twigger highlighted Mr Werner’s evidence that in early 2011, in the context of the dispute with DBK, it </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“was starting to be obvious, yes, that it was not only the financial crisis but that”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> the former shareholders </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“probably had mismanaged the company”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. He pointed out also that Mr Werner had also accepted that DBK had alleged fraud, stating that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“this was the first time that somebody was accusing the former shareholder of misuse of funds, and definitely this was something that I registered and that was a little bit of a shock”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. If that is right, then, Mr Twigger submitted that the realisation that he admits to having in 2011 that the company’s problems could not just be put down to the financial crisis but could be related to fraud on the part of Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip, would have prompted a reasonable director to investigate the land plots transactions. This, however, taken alone, is not a substantial point since there would, in my view, need to be something rather more concrete on which to base any investigation commenced in consequence.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Fifthly, Mr Twigger relied on what Mr Khabbaz had to say in January 2012 concerning the land plot transactions. Once again, however, I do not see how this assists for the reasons which I have previously explained. Indeed, although Mr Werner acknowledged that this was part of what prompted the investigations he began to take in March 2012, it would only constitute a trigger for present purposes if there were evidence that Mr Khabbaz raised with Mr Werner his belief that there was fraud of the type described in the Land Plots Claim. There is, however, no such evidence. On the contrary, as I have explained, the conduct which Mr Khabbaz had in mind appears to be that Mr Zhunus and Mr Arip had improperly misrepresented the value of company property in order to artificially inflate the share price.</span>

Although, in a general sense, this submission makes sense, the difficulty is that the Claimants needed to know what they were looking for, and this depends on the Claimants having sufficient awareness of matters from other triggers. Having decided as I have done in relation to the other suggested triggers identified by Mr Twigger, it follows that this is an end to this further point, and so that this is not a case in which the Claimants </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider what would have happened if Mr Werner had done what Mr Twigger suggested he should have done. In truth, as I have explained, there is no issue about this. As a matter of completeness, however, since in his written closing submissions Mr Twigger focused in this respect on what would have happened if Mr Werner had shown the PwC Russia report to BDO as part of the audit which they were performing, I am not persuaded that BDO would have acted any differently had they been provided with the report and noted what it had to say concerning land plots transactions. Although what Mr Grummitt had to say in his October 2013 report was necessarily focusing on the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims since the Land Plots Claim had yet to be introduced into the proceedings, what he had to say was framed in broad terms, namely that </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the issues identified by PwC should, if genuine, also have become apparent to BDO”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and he confirmed in cross-examination that this was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“still my view”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It follows, therefore, that this applies to the Land Plots Claim as well as the PEAK and Astana 2 Claims. Even if this is wrong, however, the conclusion which I have stated in the previous paragraph makes the point, in any event, academic. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">There was a dispute between Mr Vataev and Professor Suleimenov as to whether Article 185.1 applies only to natural persons (as Professor Suleimenov considered) or whether it extended also to cover what were described by the experts as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“legal entities”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> by which was meant companies such as the Claimants (as, in Mr Vataev’s view, is the case). On this issue, I much prefer the opinion expressed by Professor Suleimenov. This is for a really rather straightforward reason: the wording used in Article 185.1 seems to me to be wholly inapposite in the case of a company. It is to be noted in this context that the provision refers to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the personality of the claimant”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Although I acknowledge that a legal entity can sometimes, formally at least, be viewed as having a personality, the more usual circumstances in which a reference to personality is made is where natural persons are involved. Secondly, it needs to be borne in mind that the reference to </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the personality of the claimant”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> is not in glorious isolation. On the contrary, it is immediately followed by a description of </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“circumstances which are associated with the personality of the claimant”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which clearly relate to (and only relate to) natural persons. A natural person can suffer from a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“serious illness”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or be in a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“helpless condition”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> or suffer from </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“illiteracy”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. A company cannot suffer or be any of these things. The fact that the list in brackets is not exhaustive, as Mr Vataev was at pains to point out, hardly assists since clearly the </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“etc.”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> is intended to bring into play </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“circumstances”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of a similar type and so related to natural persons as opposed to companies. Indeed, Mr Vataev agreed with Mr Twigger in cross-examination that the original Russian, which has been translated as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“etc.”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, means something like </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“and similar”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. Mr Vataev’s contention was that this would permit </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“circumstances”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> such as (as he memorably put it) a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“coma” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">involving a company being </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. I simply cannot accept Mr Vataev’s position on this. It was inventive but also unrealistic. If there were any doubt about the matter, that doubt is removed by the words which follow, namely </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“the citizen”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> seems to me to underline the fact that Article 185.1 has nothing whatever to do with companies. A company is, most certainly, not, on any view at all, a </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">I have previously set out an exchange which I had with Mr Vataev in the context of the evidence which he gave concerning Article 185.1. I asked him, whether what he was saying represented a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“possible argument” </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">or his</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “actual … considered opinion”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. His answer was that it was his </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“opinion that a company may rely on this article and request the restoration of the statute of limitation period”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> but that</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “Whether it will be successful or not, I would… Refrain from giving the probability here”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. I am quite clear that what Mr Vataev was doing when giving his opinion in relation to Article 185.1 involved his identifying an argument rather than describing his actual and considered opinion as to whether the provision extends to cover legal entities in addition to natural persons. True it is that Mr Vataev was able to point to certain decisions in Kazakh courts where a limitation period has been ‘restored’ under Article 185.1 in cases where the claimant is a legal entity. In my view, these were of very doubtful assistance. Mr Vataev relied, in particular, on a Supreme Court decision (no. 3a-232-05 dated 5 January 2006), in which two corporate entities, requested restoration of the limitation period under Article 185. The Supreme Court refused this request on the basis that the Claimants “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">did not provide the court with evidence that the deadline for the limitation period had been missed for good reason, and therefore the court had no grounds, as provided by Article 185 of the Civil Code, to restore it</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Mr Vataev’s point was that the Supreme Court did not reject the Claimants’ request on the basis that Article 185.1 does not apply to legal entities but on the grounds that they did not have a legitimate excuse. So, Mr Vataev suggested, had the claimants in that case had a legitimate excuse, there would have been ‘restoration’ notwithstanding the fact that they were not natural persons. I do not accept this. I suspect that the applicability of Article 185.1 to legal entities was simply not raised by anybody in circumstances where the focus was on the legitimacy of the excuse advanced. Since Mr Twigger described this as the best case in support of Mr Vataev’s position, it will be appreciated that I need not take up time considering other decisions which were explored during the course of the evidence. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This is all the more the case in view of the fact that, although Professor Sulemeinov very properly recognised that there have been lower court decisions where Article 185.1 has been applied in relation to legal entities (as he put it, </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“I do not deny that such decisions may be taken sometimes and they do occur”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">), he was able to refer to decisions at various levels within Kazakhstan (including at the Supreme Court) which consistently confirmed that Article 185.1 has no application to legal entities. For example, in decision no. 3a-162-02 dated 16 May 2002, the Supreme Court dismissed a bankruptcy receiver’s request to restore the limitation period under Article 185.1 on the grounds that the claimant bankruptcy receiver (an individual) filed the claim on behalf of a corporate debtor and so Article 185 “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">did not apply to such legal entity</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. Another decision that Article 185.1 does not apply to legal entities is decision no. 3a-101-06 dated 4 April 2006, in which the Supreme Court rejected the claimant companies’ argument that the limitation period should be extended under Article 185 on the basis that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">… the limitation period can only be extended at the request filed by a natural person because the court may only exercise its discretion to extend the limitation period in a situation where the claimant’s personality is affected (ie where the claimant is affected by a serious illness or is in helpless condition or is illiterate…) and where the claimant is a natural person but not a legal entity</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">”. This decision is entirely contrary to the stance adopted by Mr Vataev, who in fairness was ultimately constrained to accept the weight of the Supreme Court authorities is very much in favour of Article 185.1 not applying to legal entities and that this is also the prevailing view amongst scholars and practitioners. </span>

It is common ground that in Kazakh law the court has a discretion to extend the limitation where there is a ‘valid reason’ for doing so. This is not stated in any code but has been stated by the Supreme Court. Mr. Norbury submitted that this did not apply to employers who were companies rather than natural persons. He based this submission on Article 185 of the Civil Code which gives a similar discretion but which Professor Maggs said did not apply to companies. I preferred Mr. Vataev’s opinion that Article 185 also applied to companies. A purposive construction leads to the conclusion that a company can rely upon the discretion just as a natural person can. In any event there was no evidence that the Supreme Court restricted its ruling to employers who were natural persons.”</span>

This is because in the previous paragraph Teare J had reached the conclusion that the claimant bank in that case was neither aware, nor should it have been aware, that its rights were violated more than a year before the relevant action was commenced. It is, in fact, worth setting out what Teare J had to say on that issue at [240] because, although clearly highly fact-specific, a number of the considerations which he regarded as relevant to the ‘awareness’ issue were clearly regarded by him as reasons why time should be extended:</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“Notwithstanding the absence of direct evidence from the Bank I cannot turn a blind eye to the realities of the situation of the Bank between February and June 2009 and to the inherent probabilities. Upon nationalisation the new management of the Bank had a considerable task. The AFN had requested the nationalisation because the old management had not made the substantial provisions of US$3.58 billion demanded by the AFN against its loan portfolio. The Bank's auditors reported in May 2009 that the Bank’s liabilities exceeded its assets by US$6.2 billion. In these circumstances it is, it seems to me, more likely than not the Bank’s new management concentrated on the survival of the Bank in the early months of 2009 rather than upon possible claims against Mr. Ablyazov and Mr. Zharimbetov (who had fled to England) arising out of the operation of the loan portfolio. Although KPMG had investigated the loan portfolio prior to the arrival of PWC it seems likely, as stated by Mr. Kenyon, that such efforts were directed towards the restructuring of the Bank. The number of loan projects was about 300 which had generated some 3,700 loans. Any attempt to discover what claims there were against the former management would have been, and no doubt was, a very considerable and detailed exercise. I consider it more likely than not that by mid-June 2009 the Bank was not aware of the violation its rights in respect of the Later Loans and could not reasonably have been expected to be. The fact that the AFN had found many loans to be potential problem accounts including the Later Loans is evidence that losses may be sustained on them, not that losses had been sustained or that the Bank’s rights had been violated. It was hardly unreasonable for the new management to concentrate on the survival of the Bank rather than on investigating potential claims between February and June 2009. Nor does knowledge that the police were bringing charges against Mr. Zharimbetov in March 2009 establish an awareness on the part of the Bank that its rights had been violated in respect of the Later Loans. That would require a very detailed knowledge of the police investigations. Whilst it is probable that there was some contact between the new management and the police it is also probable that the new management concentrated on the Bank's survival and left the police to carry out their own investigations.”</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">As will become apparent when I come on shortly to address whether it would be appropriate to disapply the limitation periods in the present case pursuant to the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984, Mr Howe’s submissions on that question are not dissimilar to the matters identified by Teare J as justifying an extension of time in the </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">case. What matters, for present purposes, however, is that it is quite clear that what Teare J had to say concerning Article 185’s applicability to companies was </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">obiter</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. First, Teare J was dealing with the operation of a one-year limitation period applicable under Article 172 of the Labour Code (see [219]), and even then only in circumstances where he had actually decided that that one-year limitation period was inapplicable given that breaches of Articles 62 and 63 of the JSC Law were alleged (see [230] and [231]). Secondly, as made clear by Teare J in [241] itself the discretion exercisable under Kazakh law to extend the limitation period where there is a </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“valid reason”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> is</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. Accordingly, Article 185 had no application and was only raised before Teare J by way of analogy. Thirdly, no doubt for this very reason, Teare J did not need to analyse Article 185’s wording or consider any of the Kazakh decisions concerning the applicability of the provision to legal entities (as opposed to natural persons). In the circumstances, I struggle to see how it can be the case that Teare J made any relevant determination for the purposes of section 4 of the 1972 Act. I agree with Mr Twigger also that, even if Teare J should be taken as having made a determination, since the effect of section 4(2)(b) is only that the Kazakh law </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“shall be taken to be in accordance with that finding or decision unless the contrary is proved”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, it is open to me to reach a contrary conclusion based on the evidence which is before me, both in the form of the expert evidence and the various Kazakh law decisions which I have had the benefit of looking at. In short, I am not bound by Teare J’s decision in the</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">City of Gotha v Sotheby’s and Cobert Financa SA</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">, 9 September 1998 (unrep.). This case involved a painting by Joachim Wtewael which, at the end of the Second World War, disappeared from the collection in the gallery of the Ducal Family of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the City of Gotha, only to reappear when offered for sale by Sotheby’s in 1992. The claimants sought the return of the painting. Moses J had to decide, first, who had title to the painting and, secondly, whether the claim was time-barred under German law. As to the latter, he concluded that the relevant German limitation period (30 years) had not expired by the time that the proceedings were commenced. He went on, however, to consider whether, had he concluded that the claim was time-barred under German law, it would have been appropriate to disapply the limitation period pursuant to section 2 of the 1984 Act. He drew attention to the fact that the argument advanced by the claimants in support of the contention that the limitation period should be disapplied included the point that under German law </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“no account is taken of the plaintiffs’ state of knowledge”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">. It was also relied upon in argument that the defendants in that case had (as Moses J concluded) deliberately concealed facts relevant to the right of action (including details of Cobert Finance SA’s identity). Moses J explained that, in his view, it is not</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> “possible to identify with sufficient clarity a public policy which deprives the defendant of the benefit of time which is already running his favour before he is guilty of deliberate concealment”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and so </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“it is not possible to disapply a foreign law of limitation merely because that foreign law does not recognise the same consequences of concealment as those which the House of Lords has recognised to be the consequences of section 32(1)(b)”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> of the Limitation Act 1980. He then referred to section 4 of the 1980 Act and the fact that the effect of this provision would have been, had English law applied, that the plaintiffs would not have been met with a time bar argument in circumstances where the painting had been stolen (as was the case in that case). He then said this:</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“It does seem to me possible to identify, from that legislation, a public policy in England that time is not to run either in favour of the thief nor in favour of any transferee who is not a purchaser in good faith. The law favours the true owner of property which has been stolen, however long the period which has elapsed since the original theft. If German limitation law is not disapplied the result will be to favour a purchaser with no title to the painting who does not even contend that it or its predecessors purchased the painting in good faith. To permit a party which admits it has not acted in good faith to retain the advantage of lapse of time during which the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the painting and no possibility of recovering it is, in my judgement, contrary to the public policy which finds statutory expression in Section 4. To allow Cobert to succeed, when, on its own admission it knew or suspected that the painting might be stolen or that there was something wrong with the transaction or acted in a manner in which an honest man would not, does touch the conscience of the court. Moreover, to recognise such a public policy does not in any way undermine the purposes of a law of limitation; there is no reason why a defendant in the position of Cobert should be protected from this claim nor does the recognition of such a public policy discourage claimants from instituting proceedings without unreasonable delay. … It does not seem to me that the question whether a foreign law should be disapplied on grounds of English public policy can depend upon the nature of the plaintiff seeking to disapply that law. I should, however, make it clear that if the victim of the theft had itself delayed once it had discovered the facts relevant to its cause of action that might well be a ground for not disapplying the foreign law.”</span>

In the instant case the additional circumstance upon which reliance is placed over and above the mere impact of a limitation period of thirty years, is that the plaintiffs were the victims of theft and between that theft and 1991, they had no means of discovering the facts which would have enabled them to identify the possessor of the painting and its whereabouts. But it is difficult to see how that additional fact would justify invoking Section 2(2) in circumstances where Section 2(1) did not apply. Either the public policy which I have already identified exists or it does not. If it does not, then all the plaintiffs are, in essence, complaining about is the length of the German limitation period. That by itself is not enough, and in those circumstances had I not been prepared to display German law under Section 2(1), I would not have done so under Section 2(2).”</span>

The second is his submission that the Claimants would suffer undue hardship (specifically identified in section 2(2) of the 1984 Act as an example of conflict with public policy) if the limitation period were not disapplied, in particular the point that it would be out of all proportion to any fault on the Claimants’ part to deprive them of their claims. </span>

First, it is submitted by Mr Howe that if time starts to run for limitation purposes even though a potential claimant does not know the identity of the (alleged) wrongdoer, this would result in what he described as </span>

This point goes nowhere, however, since, as Mr Twigger pointed out, in the present case there can be no argument that the Claimants have not had a reasonable opportunity to pursue their claim because they were not aware of the identity of the wrongdoer. In any event, as I have previously explained, I am somewhat doubtful that Professor Suleimenov was right in what he had to say concerning the need for the identity of the wrongdoer to be known. Indeed, in relation to claims under Articles 62 and 63 of the JSC law, he ultimately accepted that it is necessary to identify the particular company officer involved. Secondly, Mr Howe suggested that, if time should be taken as running from when a potential claimant has only </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a general knowledge”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> that its rights have been violated, then, again, this is something which ought to be regarded as contrary to public policy. The difficulty with this is that Professor Suleimenov’s evidence was not to that effect but that one needs </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“reasonable grounds to believe”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> and, ultimately, Mr Vataev agreed with Mr Twigger about this. It is impossible to take the view that, this being the level of knowledge or awareness required, the Kazakh law on limitation is in conflict with public policy. Thirdly, Mr Howe sought to suggest that, if it is the case that Article 185.1 of the KCC only permits ‘restoration’ in the case of claimants who are natural persons and does not also apply to legal entities such as companies then, this, too, is contrary to public policy since there can be no justification for depriving corporate entities of rights afforded to individuals. Again, I struggle with this as a proposition. It seems to me that this simply cannot be the conflict with public policy which Mr Howe suggested. Indeed, as Mr Twigger pointed out, English law might be thought to have a similar provision to Article 185.1 in the shape of section 28(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 which provides as follows:</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">Three particular points were made by Mr Howe in support of this overarching submission. First, Mr Howe drew attention to the fact that, if the limitation period is not disapplied, then, there are shareholders, employees and creditors of the Claimants, all of whom would be prejudiced. However, I see no merit in this point since, as Mr Twigger submitted, a company is controlled by its management and, if they fail to commence proceedings within the limitation period, any hardship that this causes to the company’s shareholders and creditors is caused by that failure. It is not a reason to disapply a limitation period on the basis that there has been undue hardship to the Claimants (the companies). I had the impression that Mr Howe recognised that he was not on the strongest of grounds on this point since it is fair to say that he did not place much (if any) weight on the point.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">I do, nonetheless, consider that there is merit in Mr Howe’s two other points. The first of these was that, in circumstances where (as I have, indeed, now decided) the Claimants are victims of fraud on a significant scale, it would result in the clearest possible undue hardship were the Kazakh law time-bar not to be disapplied. I acknowledge that in some cases the fact that a claimant is aware or </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> for the purposes of Article 180.1 of the KCC will mean that there ought not to be disapplication of the 3-year limtation period. It cannot be an absolute bar, however, since, if that were the case, it would mean that the 1984 Act could never apply to the Kazakh law limitation period. Furthermore, it is obvious that the undue hardship test must apply even where there has been fault. Ultimately, the degree of fault is but a factor to be weighed in the balance. In the present case, I consider that any fault which might have resulted in the Claims becoming time-barred (had that been the case) was not at such a level as to warrant a decision not to disapply. The Claims are not only far from trivial but are also very substantial. The result is that the hardship to the Claimants in being prevented from making a recovery would be very great indeed. Furthermore, even had I reached a different conclusion on the ‘awareness’ issues, what is clear is that the frauds were not obvious. Indeed, I consider that there is considerable force in Mr Howe’s submission that the Defendants went to considerable lengths to hide their tracks, as demonstrated by, for example, Ms Dikhanbayeva’s </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“If the auditors are raising questions”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> email on 27 August 2009 and the many instances where contracts were drawn up on Ms Dikhanbayeva’s instructions seemingly with the express intention of covering up fraudulent activity. In my view, there is also considerable force in Mr Howe’s further submission that there should be disapplication in circumstances where </span>
	      <img src="image15.png" style="width:0.07291666666666667in;height:0.5208333333333334in;"/>
	      <span style="color:#000000">the very fraud which has brought about the claims has meant that the Claimants have had to face a critical and ongoing financial crisis entailing what Mr Howe characterised as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“a fight for their very survival”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> which has meant that the Claimants had to concentrate their efforts on things other than the bringing of the claims. Although Mr Twigger suggested that there is no evidence to justify a conclusion that the KK Group has been in any such fight as a result of anything done by the Defendants, it is wholly unrealistic to dispute that this was the position. The evidence of Mr Werner, in particular, on this issue is very clear. I accept that evidence. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">For these reasons, it follows that, had it been necessary, I would have regarded it as being appropriate to disapply the Kazakh law limitation period under the 1984 Act. I should make it clear that, in the circumstances which I have described, I would have been prepared to disapply not only had I decided that the Claims were time-barred because the Claimants </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">“should have become aware”</span>
	      <span style="color:#000000"> for the purposes of Article 180.1 of the KCC, but also had I decided that the Claimants had actual awareness. This is because, even on Mr Arip’s and Ms Dikhanbayeva’s case, the awareness which the Claimants should be treated as having had was not particularly extensive, largely being derived from the PwC Russia report, and because, as I have mentioned, the Defendants were engaged in efforts to cover their tracks. In the light of my conclusions on the limitation issue, however, there is no reason, in fact, to make an order under the 1984 Act. </span>

At trial, however, and in the immediate lead-up to trial, the parties and their lawyers co-operated well to ensure that there was no slippage in what was a tight timetable and despite a number of practical challenges brought about, in particular, by so many witnesses giving evidence in the Russian language (with simultaneous translation) and, in several cases, by video link from Astana, Moscow and Vancouver.</span>
