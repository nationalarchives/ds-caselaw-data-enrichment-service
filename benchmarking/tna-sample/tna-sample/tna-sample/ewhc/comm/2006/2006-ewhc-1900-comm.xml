It was founded in the 1970s by Dr James Milne, its Chairman, Managing Director and controlling shareholder. Its head quarters are in Aberdeen. In the year to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2005 it had a turnover of over £31,000,000. Much of its business involves supply to the oil, gas and marine industries. It has a wide range of products, including sectional tanks, modular buildings and pipes. The Group has a transport business. Balmoral Marine Ltd, originally an associate and now a subsidiary company, provides specialist services for the offshore oil industry through the hire and manufacture of items such as navigational and buoyancy aids and wire rope. The Group has subsidiary companies in Norway, Houston and Holland.  </p>

Balmoral entered the rotomoulding business in 1992, when it began to design tanks for oils and other liquids, such as water or wastewater, which it began to manufacture towards the end of that year<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The division of Balmoral Group Limited involved in rotomoulding was called “Mouldings”, then “Tanks”, then “Rotational Mouldings”. Nothing turns on the distinction. </p>
	      </authorialNote>. If used as oil tanks, they usually contain kerosene; less often, diesel. Balmoral’s designs although similar, in some respects, to those of other tank manufacturers, are unique to it. Balmoral’s staff includes engineers, designers, and technical support staff. Most of</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Balmoral’s tanks are sold to distributors (building supplies companies, heating companies and oil suppliers) rather than direct to the public, and mainly, but not exclusively, within the UK. There are about 10 – 15 distributors who store tanks at their premises. The end users tend to be householders in areas without mains gas, commercial users and farmers. Until 2004 Balmoral’s tanks came with a 10 year replacement warranty subject to proof of purchase and correct installation and use. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Rotational moulding works in this way. A quantity of polyethylene in powdered form (the charge) is placed into one of the two halves of a steel mould, which are then clamped together. The mould, which is mounted on the arm of a machine, is introduced into an oven and continuously rotated on two axes at a low speed (typically 4- 8 revs/min), so that all parts of the interior surface of the mould pass through the pool.  The charge becomes tacky and then melts in the heat (of up to around 300° C), forming a molten pool. As the powder becomes tacky it starts to stick to the mould. More powder sticks to particles that have become tacky before. As a result a layer of viscous, largely immobile<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> There is normally little flow of the melted plastic over the surface of the mould, only a gentle waving motion of the melted plastic as it is pulled in different directions by gravity.  </p>
	      </authorialNote>, liquid forms over the entirety of the mould. The wall thickness distribution of the melt is largely determined at this stage. The product has, however, to remain in the oven in order to eliminate the bubbles (trapped pockets of gas) in the melt. After about 20 minutes the mould is removed from the oven and cooled. At this stage crystallization of the melt will occur. The crystallizing melt will shrink away from the mould, the rate of crystallization being dependent, in part, on the rate of cooling. When the polyethylene is sufficiently cool, the tank, as it has now become, is removed from the mould. A very high proportion of rotomoulding production is of tanks of one form or another. </p>

The addition of a pigment has a deleterious effect on the properties of the natural product. Further, pigment particles affect the way in which the polymer crystallizes as it cools and hence the crystalline structure. Some pigments, of which phthalocyanine green is one, are nucleating agents i.e. they encourage early initiation of the process of crystallisation. </p>

The two can be <span style="font-style:italic">dry-blended</span>. In this process polyethylene in powder form is mixed with the pigment either in a blender before being added to the mould or in the mould itself.  An alternative process is <span style="font-style:italic">grind blending</span> whereby polymer pellets are mixed with pigment and the mixture is ground into a powder. Another option is to use a <span style="font-style:italic">masterbatch</span>. A masterbatch is created by taking a high concentration of pigment and grind blending or compounding it with a base polymer. The resulting masterbatch is then mixed either in a blender or in the mould with virgin polymer.  A further process is <span style="font-style:italic">compounding.</span> In this case polyethylene powder is mixed with a pigment under heat in an extruder. The resulting pellet is then ground to powder. The blending process is sometimes carried out by the product manufacturer and sometimes by a third party.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In broad terms the evenness of the spread and distribution of the pigment and the homogeneity of the resulting structure are increased, according to which option on a scale from dry blending to compounding is selected. So is the expense. Dry blending involves no grinding. Grind blending a masterbatch involves grinding only a fraction of the material which will form the charge. Compounding is the most expensive of all because it involves an additional process. But it provides the best method of mixing and dispersion of the pigment in the product, and the least reduction in the properties of the base resin.</p>

During 1993 Balmoral acquired three further machines – a 430, 280 and 220. Machines 430 and 330, which were used for the production of fuel tanks, work on a carousel basis with a fourfold cycle of (i) loading/demoulding; (ii) heating in the oven; (iii) pre-cooling and (iv) cooling<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

In 2003 or 2004, when it entered the chemical tank market, Balmoral purchased a “rock-and-roll” machine in which, as its name implies, the product being moulded is rocked back and forward about a perpendicular axis, whilst being rotated continuously through 360°. Balmoral built up their production of tanks from 8 original moulds on the 330 to a complete range of tanks with a production of over 10,000 tanks a year, some 10% of the available market, within 2 or 3 years.</p>

Oil tanks manufactured by Balmoral using borecene suffered a high failure rate, much higher than what was to be expected from rotomoulded tanks.  Within a short period of service tanks produced from borecene were splitting, leading to customer dissatisfaction, oil spillage, and claims. Such failure was particularly prevalent in certain designs. Products manufactured from MFR 6 material showed a much higher failure rate than those manufactured from MFR 3 or MFR 4 material. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">OFTEC had no requirements in relation to the environmental stress cracking resistance (“ESCR”) of the materials of which tanks are made. Prior to the events which have given rise to these claims and those of other manufacturers, ESCR does not appear to have been a topic of much concern.  When borecene was being developed, Borealis carried out the then standard Bell telephone tests (to which I refer in paragraph 179 below); but did not until later carry out creep rupture testing (a method of determining long term creep resistance), since it was not the practice for raw materials manufacturers to do so. When Borealis piloted a borecene with an MFR of 1.9 with Tyrell Tanks (part of the business of Kingspan) in late 1995 or early 1996, no inquiry was made by them about creep rupture tests, and it did not occur to Borealis to carry out such tests until later.  Nor did anyone raise that subject when borecene was launched at a conference in Vienna in October 1996. Rotomoulders assumed that borecene would have the same or better long term qualities as ZN material, which had proved satisfactory, and in respect of which creep rupture tests were not conventionally undertaken. Borealis also regarded borecene as having better physical characteristics than its ZN material and saw no obvious need at this stage to carry out creep rupture testing.</p>

On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1994 a product designer at Balmoral sent a fax to Mr Michael Shorter, who had been Neste’s, and was now Borealis’, main technical advisor on rotomoulding products, in which he said that Balmoral were currently looking for a grade of rotationally moulded polyethylene to store polyester resin and asked him to recommend a resistant form of polyethylene. A manuscript notation on the fax shows that Mr Wood told Mr Shorter not to respond.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="12">

In the event they never did so. The sequence of events was as follows. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1997 when Mr Caygill of Borealis was introduced to Mr Forbes, Balmoral’s Group Purchasing Manager, by Mr Tanner of Balmoral, Mr Forbes had expressed interest in coming to some sort of supply agreement for the group covering both the rotomoulding and pipe coating businesses. He suggested that both sides got together in April.  On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April (as I infer from Balmoral’s letter of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1997) Borealis sent Balmoral a set of documents constituting their standard Industrial Supply Agreement.  These included (a) the basic supply agreement to which the other provisions were to be exhibits; and provisions on (b) confidentiality; (c) price and rebates; (d) consignment stock; (e) research and development; (f) licensing.

	      </authorialNote>, and <span style="font-style:italic">blooming,</span> where white patches appear on the outer surface of the tank. Blooming is caused by microscopic surface tearing of the polymer on the outer section of the tank, when the polyethylene crystallises and tears away from the tool surface, leaving a residue of microscopic pieces of still soft polymer on the mould. It is extremely common in the case of dark materials, whether metallocene or ZN, and is usually dealt with by flaming, i.e. applying heat to the surface of the tank, so as to produce an even appearance. Warping is not uncommon. Neither of these phenomena form any part of Balmoral’s present claim against Borealis<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="35">
		<p class="FootnoteText">  I do not, therefore, intend to try to determine which of the several mooted causes is responsible.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Balmoral relies on them because it raised a claim against Borealis for which Borealis paid it compensation without referring to, or seeking to rely on, its terms and conditions. The two problems appear in the end to have been resolved, even if not completely, although it is not entirely clear to me what it was that did so.</p>

Prior to then Mr Shorter had advised Balmoral to change from a solvent to a water based release agent in order to reduce blooming. A release agent is a coating applied to the metal mould to assist release. A water based agent would lead to a slower release and, therefore, allow the plastic moulding to stay in contact with the mould wall for as long as possible. Parting of the moulding from the mould wall reduces the control of cooling. Balmoral had changed their pre-release agent, which had reduced the risk of blooming but increased the amount of pre-release and consequent warpage.  Mr Sandaas, who questioned the need to change pre-release agent, suggested that the blooming effect might be eliminated and warpage reduced if the cooling cycle was slowed down and the rate of crystallization thus reduced. This did not produce an improvement in blooming although it helped somewhat with warpage. Mr Sandaas suggested the use of a non nucleating pigment<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="36">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> He recommended Chromium Oxide Green (C.I.P.G. 17) or Cobalt Green (C.I.P.G. 50) or, if necessary, phthalocyanine blue.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, dispersal of the pigment through the material in a different manner, and working with ICO to find the best combination of pigment percentage, pigment formulation, resin density, resin crystallization temperature and processing conditions. A nucleating pigment is one that tends to initiate crystallisation, so that crystallisation will take place at a higher temperature. This may cause stresses over the structure or lead to embrittlement of an otherwise ductile material. </p>

The same moulding parameters were applied to the three materials.  The rotation ratio was 4:1. Blooming appeared on the surface of all three products, more prominently on ME 8161. Wall thickness measurements were taken from spots on the walls of the stiffening ribs. The ME 8161 material gave the lowest thickness (on average) for all sections measured.  Borealis explained that material with a higher melt flow required higher rotational speeds than normal in order to distribute product more evenly throughout the product because at low speed more material would be left in pockets and flow away from peak areas because of the product’s low viscosity.  </p>

Mr Halvorsen did not, as it turns out, intend to refer to a crowbar in the generally accepted sense of the term, but the instrument that he saw was not one with which he was familiar. The generality of this evidence renders detailed refutation or assessment difficult. But I found Mr Halvorsen, who left Borealis in 2005 and now works for a Borealis distributor, a reliable witness, and I regard his general criticism as probably well founded.

In June 1999, Balmoral requested 2 tonnes of MFR6 for product trials. In July Borealis agreed to supply 10 tonnes of ME 8160 free of charge to cover the cost of  OFTEC testing. In August Balmoral told Borealis that it needed 19 tonnes free supply in order to cover WRC,  OFTEC and BBA testing costs, and Borealis agreed that it would meet the cost of re-approving Borealis MFR 6 grade by supplying material free of charge. By Augus<span style="font-weight:bold">t</span> 1999 Borealis had told Balmoral that it was going to cease production of MFR 3 and would only be supplying MFR 6 in future. In December 1999 Borealis ceased to supply Balmoral with MFR 3 and began supplying MFR 6.</p>

So far as Borealis was concerned, the seller was Borealis Denmark. The arrangement whereby the producing company receivables were factored to Borealis Belgium ceased.

Whether or not that was true at the time, it has become apparent that Borealis has received claims from most British tank manufacturers of any size.  At this meeting Borealis advised Balmoral that they should move to a further version of borecene, with an MFR of 4, and that it should be fully compounded with the pigment.  Balmoral followed this advice and on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001 began production with fully compounded MFR 4 material, which, by arrangement with ICO, whose David Howarth was at the meeting, they obtained for the same overall price as a grind blended product.

Balmoral decided to switch from borecene for all non-vertical tanks and to raise a claim against Borealis for tank failures. At a meeting between Balmoral and Borealis on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February Mr Halvorsen suggested that the cracking might be attributable to problems of “<span style="font-style:italic">sharp geometry</span>”, the application of the release agent or aggressive demoulding.</p>

Mr Woolley’s evidence was that the products were mounted on the arms as per the machine design with the base of the tanks connected to the “plate”. The way of mounting was not changed and  the only place where heat could have been minimised by virtue of the shielding effect of the arm mounting would be the bases, and there was no problem around the base<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="55">

Prior to then complaints had been dealt with in the Sales Department, initially by one individual working on a part time basis. When a complaint is deemed to have been resolved the relevant file is closed and passed to the “Archive” department. This Department was set up in late 2003 to collate information on individual  complaint files, beginning with files where the complaint was closed. The Accounts Department was trawled for evidence of the specific costs for individual complaints. Staff in the Archive Department compiled a summary of cost information in relation to complaints on a sheet, and key data was input into an “Emergency Spreadsheet”, which has formed the basis for assessing the cost of tank failures.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The number of failures for the SL 1250 and H 2500 tanks is significantly higher than for the other major tanks designs. The third report of  Miss Sally Hassell, Balmoral’s forensic accountant, reveals (paragraph 2.3) that the SL 1250 and H 2500 account for almost two-thirds of tank failures to date, although they are only 30% of production. The failures were particularly high in respect of tanks manufactured in 2000 and 2001, when MFR 6 borecene was being used. Of the H 2500 tanks manufactured in ZN material 131 of those manufactured in 1995 failed and 117 of those manufactured in 1996 – on average 8.2% of production (appendix 1).</p>

As to the former, it is the job of the rotomoulder to design his tanks. A polyethylene supplier is not responsible for failings in design. As to the latter,  a competent rotomoulder would realise that all raw material products are different, that a new product  may perform in ways that differ from the way in which products that he has previously used have performed, and may react differently to the same pigments and methods of pigment incorporation as he has used before, as well as to different ones. One of the reasons why raw material suppliers supply samples of their products free of charge before purchases begin is in order to enable manufacturers to gauge the suitability of the supplier’s material for the particular purpose for which they intend to use it, i.e. by using their own moulds, pigments, blending methods, and processing parameters.

This means that tanks filled with such oils are prone, over time, to crack at stress points, even though subject to stress levels lower than those at which they would be expected to fail. In the end all polyethylenes subject to long term stress below their yield stress will fail in a brittle manner. In the presence of an ESC agent they will fail sooner. ESC comes about because the ESC agent plasticizes and, thereby, softens the material. Softening, in the presence of stress, causes crazes (small voids) to develop in the amorphous phase of the material. In time these develop into cracks on the outside of the tanks<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="66">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Figure 13 in Mr Clements’ first report is a good example. </p>
	      </authorialNote>. Once the cracks reach a critical length, catastrophic brittle failure occurs. Kerosene is a weak ESC agent so that failure, if it occurs, may not happen for 10 – 20 years or more.   </p>

Other, less frequent,  areas of failure are around the holes through the tank and at the central base of the long side of the tank. Vertical tanks, whose failure rates are a small percentage of production, tend to fail towards the base of the tanks around the “mouse hole” or on the top of the tank around the lifting eye.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the case of the two tanks with the highest degree of failure (H 2500 and SL 1250) FEA analysis, carried out by a firm called Wilde FEA Ltd, shows that high stress regions coincide with the primary points of failure. The failures, which Capcis also observed in tanks that they examined, are usually associated with changes in section (such as an internal corner) producing stress concentration and, usually, a change in wall section thickness, or where  localised thinning concentrates stress. Thus there are high stress concentrations in the areas where thinning is most likely. This does not mean that the point of failure is always at the thinnest point in the area. Failure is a function of stress. Stress at point A may be insufficient to lead to failure; whereas a greater stress at point B will do so, even though the material is thicker at point B than at point A.  </p>

The skill of the rotomoulder is to reduce the variation to an acceptable level. Substantial wall thickness variations are prejudicial to the integrity of the product for two reasons. Firstly, thinning of one area will mean that that area is more stressed than it would be if it was thicker because of the reduced cross sectional area. The flexural stiffness of a structure is proportional to the cube of its thickness. So, doubling a wall thickness will increase flexural stiffness by a factor of 8 (2³). Secondly, a difference in wall thickness will concentrate stress in the thinner portion, particularly if there is a change from thick to thin to thick<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="71">

In relation to “design” Borealis do not suggest that the general shape of the tanks had to be different; rather that the tanks should have been redesigned so as to reduce stresses at critical points, e.g. by the elimination of sharp corners or rapid changes of section, and by optimising processing parameters.  In particular designs, such as the SL 1250 and H 2500, which showed much greater failure rates than others, stress was concentrated in areas of the tank where the design meant that wall thickness variation was likely.  Balmoral, they say, failed to ensure that their rotomoulding process would secure a sufficient wall thickness and a sufficiently even wall thickness distribution, particularly in areas of high stress. The combination of a design that concentrated stress and promoted wall thickness variation in certain areas and a manufacturing process that led to wall thickness variations in those areas caused the tanks to fail. </p>

In this Borealis is, in my view,  correct. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of an oil leak, an accepted  failure rate of 3 in a 100 is too much. </p>

The work did not include testing for ESCR<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="72">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> When he was at QUB Professor Crawford had never examined, or been asked to examine, ESCR, in any  project.

I do, however, take into account the fact that Professor Crawford has not seen Balmoral’s practices in action nor do his criticisms amount to any specific suggestion as to how any specific design or production method should have been altered in order to secure a satisfactory result.  </p>

The time to failure of 50% of the samples is plotted.  Despite its widespread use, the test is not very satisfactory for a number of reasons including the following (i) the stress to which the samples are exposed is usually in excess of the sample’s yield stress and does not therefore reflect reality; (ii) the individual times to failure of the 10 samples often vary very greatly, by as much as a factor of between 10 and 100; (iii) results taken at different centres vary very widely. The Bell telephone test is very sensitive to minor changes e.g., in how you make the notch, how you bend the sample into its holder, and temperature control.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As a result of the deficiencies of the Bell Telephone test , the Association of Rotomoulders (“ARM”) introduced a Constant Tensile Load (“CTL”) test. This is a form of creep rupture test, in which a notched sample, in the shape of a dog bone is suspended vertically with a weight attached to the bottom. The time to failure of the specimen is then monitored.  In the ARM CTL test the specimen is immersed in 10% Igepal at 30° C.  Borealis used CTL tests for pipe applications, but it was not in 1996 an established test of theirs for rotomoulding. Accordingly all their ESC tests before the launch of borecene were BTT tests, the then market standard. They only became able to do the ARM CTL test on borecene for rotomoulding in about 1997.</p>

ME 8154 had a butane comonomer, which, all other things being equal, might be expected to have results lower than for a ZN with a hexene comonomer.   As I have said, when quoting a rating for ESCR in their data sheets Borealis used a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being at the top). The reason why Borealis used such a rating rather than a figure in hours was because their tests were often carried out at any one of three different sites, in Norway, Sweden and Belgium. The absolute values as between those sites varied very considerably, making comparisons between those results and the results obtained at other testing places on other materials inapposite.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was some contradiction in the evidence as to whether ME 8154 had been rated as having an ESCR of 3 or 4. In her second statement,  paragraphs 12 – 14, Miss Fatnes says that  ME 8154 had been assigned a rating of 4 before she assumed responsibility for the development of borecene and thought it appropriate to put borecene with 940 density in the <span style="font-style:italic">same</span> category but did not think it was significantly better so as to increase the rating to 5 <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="79">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> In January 1998 Miss Fatnes agreed with some of her colleagues that blow moulding products should be rated for ESCR in hours, provided the appropriate method of testing for such products was defined and harmonised and enough results were available.  The impetus for this had come from customers in that market. </p>
	      </authorialNote>. In her third statement she corrected that and said that ME 8154 had a rating of 3, as she confirmed, no doubt correctly, in cross examination. This is consistent with her first statement, paragraph 114, as amplified in her third statement, where she said that a material which survived between 50 and 200 hours, in the 100% Igepal test, would be a 4. In due course the 100% test was phased out in favour of a test using the 10% solution, which is a more aggressive  ESC agent. </p>

The samples were immersed in 10% Antarox (similar to Igepal) and produced similar BTT results, the figures being 21 and 25 hours respectively.     Creep rupture testing data on borecene for up to 1000 hours in air was generated at various temperatures and stresses and the borecenes were shown to be more creep resistant than Borealis ZN rotomoulding grades. </p>

Since, in practice, tanks will fail over a period of years, some means must be found to make an earlier assessment of their propensity to brittle failure. Creep rupture testing at elevated temperatures is a means of evaluating that propensity.  In the case of MFR 3 borecene the samples were taken from a failed H 1590 tank.

Testing in air at ambient temperature is of limited significance, unless carried out over a very extended period. Testing in Igepal at an elevated temperature was a recognised method of providing a rapid qualitative assessment of susceptibility to ESC. Testing in kerosene and diesel at elevated temperatures is another method that allows a quantitative prediction of service life in the actual environment in which the Balmoral tanks were to be used. Testing at elevated temperatures simulates the effect of time. The results at those temperatures have then to be converted to results at ambient temperatures by applying a “<span style="font-style:italic">time-temperature superposition</span>” i.e. a method of calculation which will convert results at one temperature to results at another. The results have a considerable degree of variability. Mr Clements indicated that at any particular stress level a +/- shift in time of 0.25 of a decade<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>was typical: in other words if failure occurred at 1000 seconds in one sample<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="82">

From the plotted data four curves have been created. These show that the order of failure is, broadly speaking, (i) MFR 6, (ii) MFR 3, (iii) Dow and (iv) BP. I doubt, however, whether much reliance can be placed on the ranking of the last three in the light of the inherent scatter of the data.   Mr Clements’ report states that the data indicates that Borecene MFR3 would be expected to survive about 3-4 times longer than MFR 6; Dow material would be expected to survive about 3 times longer than MFR 3 and about 9 times longer than MFR 6; and the BP material about 16 times longer than MFR 6. </p>

Firstly, paragraph 73 referred to specimens tested at 60, 70 and 80° C after saturation in kerosene. The data from those tests was not annexed. What was annexed was data at those temperatures from<span style="font-weight:bold"> unsoaked</span> specimens, although Appendix 3 did not state whether the kerosene was soaked or unsoaked.

	      </authorialNote>. In their supplemental report Capcis commented that they had been unsure whether the data used to construct the master curve was indeed that in Appendix 3. Secondly, figure 5 which shows master curves of time to failure at 20° C, i.e. at ambient temperature, is an extrapolation from the raw soaked kerosene data at elevated temperatures. That made it particularly important that there should be sufficient testing (at different temperatures and stress levels) in order to provide a sound basis for extrapolation. If the values taken before extrapolation are invalid or unrepresentative the error will be magnified in the extrapolation and produce an inaccurate master curve.  Thirdly, there is a dispute as to whether or not soaked data is a reliable guide. </p>

Four gauges were placed two above and two below (so that there were two gauges on each side) the horizontal rib section traversing the tank.

Part of the reason why the extrapolations are flawed may be because the strain gauging is unreliable.  Or the assumption of 2/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> use may be unreliable, although figure 9 indicates that at 1000 litres (i.e. about 2/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> full for a tank of 1590 litres ) the stress is near to zero, so that the real life stress could not be less.

The results were inconclusive as against MFR 3. Subsequently samples of MFR 3 and 6 were tested against two further ZN grades in air and Igepal at 60°C; and borecene at MFR 3 performed substantially worse. These results were disclosed. In Summer 2004 a testing programme was undertaken for Deso using the BTT test and creep rupture testing with unsoaked samples. The BTT tests showed Dowlex 2432 substantially outperforming MFR 3 and MFR 6 borecene. But in the creep rupture tests Dowlex 2432 performed worse. These results were sent to Capcis. In 2005 further creep rupture tests were carried out for Balmoral at elevated temperatures. These revealed that MFR 6 performed much worse than the ZN comparator but MFR 4 only marginally worse. In summer 2005 Rapra were instructed by Kingspan and Clarehill, two manufacturers who had only used MFR 6 borecene. In the course of creep rupture tests on unsoaked samples of MFR 6 in kerosene at elevated temperatures Mr Clements noticed that the thinner samples provided by one manufacturer failed notably earlier <span style="font-style:italic">despite being under the same stress</span>. He suspected that the difference in performance was directly related to permeability. “<span style="font-style:italic">The penny dropped</span>” at the very end of summer 2005. Accordingly a testing programme using pre-soaked samples was started in late summer /early Autumn. Only a very few results were available by the time of his first report in this action on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005.  Further data from the testing programme was contained in his supplemental report. Deso never instructed Rapra to carry out testing on soaked samples. As a result his report in that action relied on unsoaked data, but with a reference to the possible significance of permeability. He remained of the view that the only way in which finally and firmly to test the ESCR properties of borecene was to use samples pre-soaked to equilibrium in order to reflect the in service conditions. </p>

In real life there will be kerosene on the inside and air on the outside.  The polyethylene is not saturated throughout its entire volume.  There will be a gradient of absorption from the inner to the outer surface, from which vapour will escape. ESC starts on the outer surface, which will have a lower concentration of diesel or kerosene than the inner surface. The outer surface will be subject to tensile stress and thus be more permeable than the inside. In the conditions of the creep rupture test both sides are permeated by kerosene. </p>

Otherwise you are not comparing like with like. If both samples have been permeated to equilibrium, the only relevant difference between the two samples is their chemical composition, and it is that which is to be tested. </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> He used the analogy of a carrot, which will break in a brittle manner, but which if left in the larder for some time will fracture in an entirely different manner.</p>

On the contrary crack initiation and propagation takes place at or very near to the exposed surface of the samples as the cracking agent penetrates the surface of the polymer and initiates craze formation by disentangling or pulling out tie molecules and exploiting existing micro-defects, long before equilibrium is reached. I accept that this is so, not least because it is consistent with the chemical evidence to which I refer below. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not persuaded that results from unsoaked data are unreliable, or even that results from soaked data are more reliable. In either case the test conditions will not replicate reality since tanks are never immersed on both sides, whether before they enter service or during it. Pre-soaking to equilibrium is, in my view, a more significant departure from reality than using unsoaked specimens. The fact, if it be such, that borecene takes up kerosene more slowly might create a bias in its favour (of uncertain extent and cause). But, for the reasons give by Dr Clemens, pre-soaking to equilibrium before the test starts would make so fundamental a change in the material and its eventual method of failure,  compared with reality,  as to cast doubt on the validity of the resulting data, or at any rate its  reliability when compared with unsoaked data. Mr Clements has made use of extensive unsoaked data in this action and the DESO action without any more than a tentative qualification.  </p>

Mr Clements’ first report has figures of the percentage kerosene uptake of borecene and Dow and BP material at 80° C. That is a very high temperature. It is by no means clear that the same relationship would apply at lesser or ambient temperatures, particularly when borecene has, as it does, a fraction which melts at 75° C which ZN material does not. In addition there appears to be a greater variation in the speed of uptake between the two ZN materials than between the borecenes and the Dow material. </p>

In addition the Borealis test was a notched test (notching reduces the time to failure); whether the DSM test was notched is unknown.  Further, the material used by Balmoral was a blend of Stamylex 2H900 (75%) and Stamylex 5036 (25%). According to the relevant data sheets the former material has a failure time of 50 hours and the latter one of 30 hours. So the failure time of the combination was somewhere between 30 and 50. Lastly, as appears from Miss Fatnes’ statement, Borealis had conducted ARM CTL testing at 30° which had produced a figure of 290 hours to failure for MFR 3.</p>

This test method ensured that the maximum stress was applied to the outer surface, that being the point at which failures started. The apparatus used establishes a bending moment similar to that experienced by the tank wall in the field. Tests were undertaken at 60, 70 and 80° C in air, diesel and kerosene.  The specimens tested in diesel and kerosene were totally immersed (but not pre-soaked to equilibrium). At the time of their first report there was insufficient data available for time temperature superimposition. On the data available Capcis concluded that, at temperatures of 60, 70 and 80° C in diesel and kerosene, unused Balmoral green tank samples performed worse than unpigmented materials produced using optimised rotomoulding conditions (as was to be expected), and that there was no consistent evidence of any difference in the CRT curves of their borecene materials and BP Rigidex 4330. By the time of the second report (January 2006) the only brittle failures that had been recorded in respect of green Balmoral tank samples were in respect of a number of the ZN samples at 70 and 80° C. </p>

The molecules that are not incorporated into spherulites remain as amorphous material located between the lamellae and between spherulites. Branched chains cannot, however, all fold into the regular lamella structure and elements of the polymer are segregated to the amorphous region between the crystalline lamellae.  Bridging/tie molecules arise from the natural tendency, as a result of entanglement and branching (particularly the former), for elements of the polymer to be segregated to the amorphous regions between crystalline lamellae. Entangled molecules will slow down the formation of crystalline regions. Entanglement is best envisaged by the analogy of spaghetti. Short lengths of spaghetti can remain relatively separate. Longer lengths entangle into a mass. The greater the number of entanglements the more force is need to break them. The wide distribution of branches in ZN materials assists entanglement.</p>

At ambient temperatures diesel and kerosene are not solvents for crystalline polyethylene; but they will be able to interact strongly with the amorphous regions. These agents will endeavour to plasticize the amorphous regions between the crystallites. That plasticization is resisted by the tie molecules that bridge the lamellae. The ability of the polymer to resist cracking is dependent on the extent to which the tie molecules can retain structural integrity and resist crack propagation. If they cannot resist the applied stress, scission of the molecules occurs and crazing of the surface takes place. This provides a means for crack propagation, ultimately leading to failure in those regions of the tank the subject of higher stresses. </p>

As the powder becomes tacky it sticks to the walls of the mould. The extent to which it does so is in part dependent on the viscosity (i.e. the resistance to flow) of the polymer. The lower the viscosity the greater the flow and the more the material will fall away from internal protrusions.  For that reason a lower viscosity may make it more difficult to avoid wall thickness variations at those protrusions. But if the polymer is highly viscous the result may be that air is trapped in the melt and the wall structure is unduly foam like rather than dense and compacted. Reducing viscosity thus assists the removal of bubbles. Another potentially relevant characteristic is the visco-elasticity of the material i.e. its ability to recover its form once any force applied to it is removed or, more graphically for present purposes, its ability to drape around a protrusion as the mould rotates so as not to fall away. </p>

That research is potentially relevant both to ESCR and rheological properties. The viscosity of a polymer melt is measured by placing the polymer between two oscillating plates. The energy required to rotate the plates is then measured. The speed of rotation can be varied so as to produce a variation in shear rate (the measure of the speed of movement of liquid against a surface). The sheer rates experienced in rotational moulding are very low. Since, at those rates, viscosity is independent of shear rate, the viscosity, in this context is referred to as zero shear viscosity [η◦]. Rotational moulding is undertaken at shear rates of between 0.001 and 0.01 sֿ¹.</p>

If, however, the viscosity of a polymer is dependent on shear rates so that viscosity reduces as shear rate increases (frequency dependence) at relatively low shear rates, that is an indication, in Professor Pethrick’s view, of a number of factors: a broad distribution of chain length or molecular weight distribution, entanglement of the chains in the melt and clustering of polymers.  Borecene showed a very different dependence on shear rate when compared with BP and DSM’s ZN materials. In the case of borecene with MFRs of 3, 4, and 6, frequency dependence did not occur until higher shear frequencies than was the case with the ZN material.  This indicated that in the case of the ZN materials the polymer chains in the melt were either entangling or were much longer in length. Polymer chains above a critical molecular weight will entangle and the viscosity of the melt will increase significantly (the spaghetti analogy).  The behaviour of the ZN catalysts leads to the creation of a small number of longer chains which in turn leads to the higher viscosity of ZN material as compared with borecene. </p>

The materials in the former category had viscosities in excess of those in the latter at all shear rates. The materials in the latter category had viscosity values which remained broadly constant until a given shear rate was reached at which stage they began to decline. Viewed from left to right those values, when plotted, displayed three roughly parallel lines, which at a certain shear rate turned downwards as viscosity reduced. By contrast the materials in the former category had, from the very start, a reduction in viscosity as shear rate increased (“shear thinning”), so that the three lines were never parallel but curving downwards as from the lowest shear rate. </p>

	      </authorialNote>, if you plot viscosity against molecular weight, there will be a step change in the relationship between viscosity and molecular weight. Before that point viscosity will increase in proportion to the molecular weight (here <span style="font-weight:bold">Mn: </span>see paragraph 239). After that point viscosity will increase at a 3.5 power of the molecular weight. This is because the longer chains (whose existence increases the molecular weight figure) produce a disproportionate increase in viscosity. It is these longer chains that produce entanglements which enable the polymer to resist ESC. Below the Mc point there is no entanglement and generation of tie molecules is dependent on bridging. As a result material with a molecular weight below Mc is less suitable for ESCR purposes. The molecular weights of borecene were he said<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="116">

Further the fact that, until relatively high shear rates, borecene had a constant viscosity against shear rate was indicative of the fact that the material was not entangling.

Viscoelasticity is the ability of a material to recover after the application of a force has ceased. In rotomoulding, as the mould rotates and the melting powder tumbles, the force of gravity acting on the polymer continues although it operates in different directions. The upshot of Professor Pethrick’s evidence was, as it seemed to me, that viscosity and viscoelasticity are components of  <span style="font-style:italic">complex viscosity</span> [η] <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="123">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> At Day 17/105/16 he described viscosity and viscoelasticity as synonymous. </p>
	      </authorialNote> – and that if the material has a degree of elasticity it is likely to be more viscous. This accords with common sense. A material that has a certain degree of elasticity is inherently likely to have a greater resistance to flow. It also explains why borecene has a lower viscosity than ZN material. It is common ground that a polymer with a narrower molecular distribution, such as borecene, will behave more like a Newtonian liquid (e.g. water whose viscosity does not change with an increase in shear rate) than a polymer with a wider distribution, such as ZN material, which will behave in a more pseudoplastic way.</p>

He disputed the proposition that the data showed that at shear rates found in rotomoulding significant entanglement is not happening in any of the materials, including the ZN materials.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the data at 200° C is concerned (figure 4), there are a number of points. Firstly, figure 4 does not appear to me to display any noticeable increase in viscosity until about 1000 seconds which is close to the limit of time in which the mould would be in the oven. Secondly, any increase in viscosity could only contribute to satisfactory wall formation after a period of time during which the distribution of polymer will have been unaffected by this phenomenon because the temperature of the polymer is too low. This period will end substantially after the melt point, by which time the wall thickness distribution is likely to have been substantially determined. Thirdly, whilst the highest temperatures will be experienced where the melt meets the mould, lower temperatures will be experienced towards the interior surface of the mould. So any change in viscosity is likely to take place, if at all, at the mould wall. But the polymer is likely to be adherent or even bonded to the mould wall so that the benefit of any increase in viscosity is limited. Fourthly, I note that MFR 6 showed the steepest increase in viscosity of all, albeit not starting until about 2000 seconds, and DSM the second lowest, starting at about 3000 seconds.  In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the data set out at figure 4 casts any light on the suitability or otherwise of borecene for rotomoulding. Professor Pethrick did not suggest that I should set much store by this data and I do not.</p>

They point out that Balmoral have produced no evidence that would permit an analysis of their engineering design for the tanks and no relevant engineering calculations. In the light of those figures Balmoral should either have changed the design of the mould to reduce stress concentrations at failure sites, or increased the thickness of the tank walls either generally or at failure sites, and continuously monitored the result by a form of testing which would accurately reveal the wall thickness distribution in critical areas.

They cut out sections around crack sites, and took wall thickness measurements of those sections.  A table of the maximum and minimum thicknesses and the max/min ratio of these samples is at paragraph 3.8 of their first report. In only one case – an SL 1250 tank - was the minimum wall thickness less than the OFTEC 4.5 mm and that was not at the point of failure. Cracking was found to coincide with minimum measured wall thickness in four of the failure sites examined<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="134">

In the case of the slim line tanks a typical location is at the interface between the two halves of the mould where there is a “step” between the material on different sides of the join. An example of a section showing this was put before me at the hearing. It appears to me clear that there is, indeed, what could be called a step which is probably due to a misalignment of the two halves of the mould. The Capcis figures show that in the case of most of their samples the minimum thickness of the sample<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="135">

Mr Richard Mawrey, Q.C., criticised Capcis’ reliance on these figures on the basis that they had taken failed to take measurements immediately adjacent to the crack site, and that the appropriate measurement would have been to take a section along the line of the crack. I do not accept the validity of this criticism. Such a measurement (which might well have been relatively uniform) would not measure variations in thickness around the area of the crack which affect the stress concentration at that point.  </p>

Finite element analysis is a computer based method, originally designed for the aviation industry, of estimating the stresses and deformation likely to be experienced in a particular product design.

The exercise therefore assumes rotomoulding perfection so far as wall thickness distribution is concerned. In reality tanks will not have uniform wall thicknesses and thickness variations will concentrate stresses and increase the potential for failure. An attempt was also made to model a variation in wall thickness at corners by taking a 5mm thickness with 9.5.mm at “rounds” and vice versa. Capcis regard the results as to be treated with caution and I do not propose to rely on them.</p>

Further the simulation in the FEA exercise assumes that the base of the tank is fixed to the ground and cannot move in any direction when in reality the base of the tank may be capable of a little movement, although this will be limited because of friction if it is on a concrete base (more if the tank is supported on piers), and there can be bowing of the tank.

		<p class="FootnoteText"> The stress at which irreversible plastic deformation is first observed.</p>
	      </authorialNote> of a typical PE material under static load. Wall thickness variations, and the step would increase the potential for failure. Capcis would have recommended reconsideration of the designs because of the high stress areas shown.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="142">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> One method of alleviating the effect of wall thickness variation at internal/external corners is to redesign the mould to give a more generous curvature at the corner.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Secondly the fact that several of the points of high stress are also points of failure where wall thickness variations would increase stress concentration supports the conclusion that tanks have failed because of the stresses imposed in consequence of those variations.  Professor Crawford agrees with this analysis.  The exercise tells you that the hot spots are placed where special care is needed to build up wall thickness so as to reduce the stress level, or that you should increase the wall thickness generally.  If for some reason the stress cannot be so reduced a change in design (e.g.  by changing the shape or the corner radii) would be necessary. There are several different ways of altering the manufacturing conditions, or the design, or both, to achieve the required objective. Capcis accept that the FEA analysis is not a perfect simulation of the tank material but say that it is sufficient to locate the areas of high stress and the fact that they coincided to a large degree with the observed position of actual tank cracking failures.</p>

Insofar as it reveals that the two most popular tanks failed at points of high stress that is no more than was to be expected. The mechanism of failure was environmental stress cracking; so failure was likely to occur at areas of higher stress. Those stress points were there when the tanks were made in ZN, and the tanks did not fail to anything like the same extent.  </p>

The pigment appeared in the form of tram lines within which lay the base resin particles so that there was a form of “schnitzel”: see figure 3.22c. The lines themselves were immediately surrounded by a transcrystalline structure (lighter in colour on the photograph – the same phenomenon can be seen on figure 2.35c surrounding a portion of masterbatch).  A  transcrystalline structure is known to be detrimental to physical properties. Where a tecroblend was used and the masterbatch was concentrated at the outer surface of the tank wall the transcrystalline structure was concentrated at the walls which would be detrimental to tank properties. In addition masterbatch particles were very angular leading to points of stress concentration. The BP Rigidex material, which Balmoral was using at the time of the report, was fully compounded and the structure was very homogeneous with no transcrystalline morphology.  </p>

If measurements are only taken in non critical areas, such as flat surfaces, and the weight is reduced to the minimum tolerance at those locations, an unacceptable level of failures will be inevitable.

Tanks were cut up in order to examine the distribution of the polymer with the given charge weight. Part of the aim of the trials was to ensure that there was as little thickening and thinning at internal/external corners as possible. So far as rotation ratio was concerned, he would start with a 4:1 ratio as a starting point (which he usually found satisfactory), look at the distribution of the material and see whether or not it needed to be changed. If there was a thin area he would adjust the ratio so as to track that area through the powder pool. If there were areas with thick and thin sections, he would either use shields to reduce, or funnels or venturis to increase, heat and, therefore, thickness.  If there was a change of material, Mr Hay would carry out the same sort of checking as he did with a new mould.  In the early days he would even go through the full optimisation cycle for every material batch change.</p>

He found that the moulding operation ran better at lower speeds whilst higher speeds would give problems of vibration or excessive movement and throw the material around. He would never employ a speed above 5 rpm for the arm or 2.5 rpm for the plate, although he had experimented with arm speeds of up to 6, at which speed, he said, there was a risk of contact between the mould and fixed structures e.g. the oven doors, especially with big moulds and large charge weights. </p>

However, the  production specification sheets that have survived show something somewhat different. Some of these are undated; some are dated 2000 and 2001. Many of these have ratios of 5:1.  </p>

On some occasions, if so required, lamp testing was used in conjunction with thickness checking by cutting up the tanks into pieces. Mr Ross’ evidence indicates that cutting up tanks happened on relatively rare occasions during trials, and normally only if Balmoral was alerted to the need for it e.g. by lamp testing.</p>

First,  the absence of a contradictor to Professor Crawford seems to me more significant than the absence of one to Professor Pethrick whose evidence does not, in my view take Balmoral far enough. Second, it would have been open to Balmoral to show, by practical experiment, that, using their machines and moulds, it was not possible or practicable to obtain an acceptable wall thickness distribution, however you change the parameters. I appreciate (a) the difficulties of proving a negative (albeit that is what Balmoral seek to prove)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="152">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See Balmoral final submissions, paragraph 121.</p>
	      </authorialNote>; (b) that, had Balmoral conducted such an experiment it might have been said that, if only some change had been made which they did not in fact make, all would have been well, and  (c) that there is more than one way of establishing Balmoral’s case. Nevertheless the absence of any empirical testing does seem to me of some significance, and of more significance than the fact that Professor Crawford was not able to specify exactly what should have been done in relation to each design by way of change of parameter, an exercise that cannot be done by  reference to the design drawings alone.</p>

It was suggested to Dr Clemens that he had adopted a testing procedure which was calculated not to reveal brittle failure because it was carried out at inappropriately high stress levels as a result of which there was a preponderance of ductile failures. I accept that the reason why the tests started at  high stress levels was in order to discover the point of ductile-brittle transition and that he was not seeking to avoid getting brittle failures. Nevertheless the effect is that the results are not very informative. But the results of the tests do not point towards a marked ESCR deficiency in borecene. In the tests on pigmented rotomoulded samples in diesel and kerosene it was only BP material which produced brittle failures in diesel at 80° and in kerosene at 70 and 80° C;</p>

It is not, however of that character. I approach the evidence with a degree of caution since, as Borealis submits and as I  accept, the ESCR of a polymer  is largely  dependent on the density of tie molecules, which in turn is dependent on a number of aspects of the polythene’s  molecular and crystalline structure, such as molecular weight distribution, density of short-chain branches, whether those branches are located on small or long chains and the length of those branches. This list of factors I have taken from the article of Lu and Ishikawa cited at paragraph 177, footnote 74.

It also involved (according to the July 2001 update) testing for wall thickness of the first product made after each tool change and of the first product of the Sunday and Tuesday night shifts during each week that the tool was being used.   This testing involved checking by ultrasound that a minimum thickness had been obtained at certain predetermined points on each particular design of tank. But it did not involve destructive testing or measurement at corner areas where the ultrasound would not function. Nor was the test concerned with changes in thickness, provided that the requisite minimum was achieved at the designated points. Nor does it appear to have focused on areas in particular designs where failures had been experienced. I accept Professor Crawford’s evidence that this is a valid criticism of the procedures. Failed tanks were coming back in ever increasing numbers, despite the quality control system. This was an indication that that system was defective and needed improvement e.g. by destructive testing.

	      </authorialNote>, that, in general failure has occurred at specific locations in respect of each design, regardless of material, and that stress hotspots were often coincident with areas of failure.  I do not regard these latter considerations as conclusive. It is possible to postulate a material so defective that it cannot, practically speaking, be used to make oil tanks, whatever design or process is used, so that tanks made from it, despite perfectly satisfactory processing, fail, not wholly surprisingly, at high stress points. But in the light of all the evidence I regard this as an unlikely explanation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I prefer the simpler explanation that the tanks failed because, partly as a result of their design, they were subject to stresses for which the method of processing did not adequately cater<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="162">

	      </authorialNote>. Whether that is to be characterised as a design or a processing fault, or both, does not matter much. Design and processing are interacting factors. Stress hotspots thrown up by a design can be eliminated or reduced by changes in that design e.g. by providing a more generous curvature at corners or a less severe change in sections. Alternatively they can be addressed by a change of processing parameters to produce greater wall thickness and better wall thickness distribution. If, whatever the processing parameters, the stresses are so high that failure will ensue, the fault is one of design.  If they can be addressed either by a change in design or an alteration in manufacturing conditions the fault can be put in either category, or both.  If the change needed is a change in wall thickness, either generally or in specific places, that could be characterised as a change of design or one of process.  Professor Crawford and Dr Clemens thought, and I accept, that, even if there was no design change, in the sense of a change in the geometry of the tank, tanks with satisfactory wall thickness distribution could have been made in borecene with appropriate rotomoulding processes<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="163">

In the early stages  wall thicknesses were reduced from a proposed  8 – 12 mm level.  Reductions in wall thickness have a “<span style="font-style:italic">dramatic</span>” effect on the lifetime of a tank. The fact that there was, with ZN material, a 2.96% failure rate on average is an indication that with some of the designs there may have been no, or no adequate, safety factor for a product that had no redundancy. A change to borecene without optimisation may well have crossed the line leading to failures on a logarithmic scale, since crack growth rates accumulate on such a scale. Small changes in stress can produce large increases in failure numbers. </p>

The high incidence of failures in the SL 1250 and H 5000 designs strongly suggests a design weakness; and the fact that only  a proportion of those tanks have failed points to inconsistencies in the manufacturing process.</p>

They say, not without force, that they were given to understand that borecene was an improvement on previous ZN materials, with which they had, successfully (in their view), been making oil tanks.  They were not told that they would have to make radical or significant changes to their processing parameters (or designs) or a change of pigment. Nor were they told that it would be more difficult to achieve even wall thickness with borecene or of the risk that wall thicknesses would reduce and variations increase to a point where ESC would occur. So they were entitled to assume, and did assume, that they could proceed as before, apart from any necessary tweaking of curing time.  If borecene was only suitable for making oil tanks after an elaborate exercise to change either the design of the tanks or the processing parameters or both, then it was not reasonably fit for their purpose of making oil tanks without such changes. </p>

In deciding whether a product is reasonably suitable it is necessary to consider what a reasonable purchaser of the product could be expected to do. In the light of (i) Professor Crawford’s evidence (and that of Dr Clemens)  as to what a rotomoulder should do, (ii) what Balmoral did in fact do<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="164">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> E.g. (a) the approach adopted by Mr Hay when he was Production Manager; (b) Dr Walls’ optimisation in 1997 of processing parameters for borecene with lower charge weights); and (c) Mr Macleod’s discovery in November 1998, that different wall thickness distributions were obtained for different plastics when the same moulding conditions were used in the same mould and that if those conditions were altered wall thickness distributions could be improved.</p>
	      </authorialNote>,  I do not accept that Balmoral were entitled to proceed on the basis that, on switching to what they knew to be a new generation of polyethylene with different characteristics intended to produce better performance (the efficacy of which for them would,  as they knew depend on trials<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="165">

	      </authorialNote>), they could assume that borecene required no material change of processing parameters (or designs).   Nor is it established that radical changes were needed, if by that is meant anything outside what Professor Crawford described as “<span style="font-style:italic">the normal exploration of changes that would occur if you are switching from different grades of polyethylene</span>”. The tenor of Professor Crawford’s evidence was that the alterations needed would not have been radical. It may be that borecene called for a tighter control of the processing operation. But that did not make it unfit for purpose.</p>

My experience of this case indicates to me that each user is likely to have particular distinguishing characteristics. The only other claimant of substance in Great Britain is DESO, which is not large, and had made very few (about 50 -60) tanks before it began to use borecene, which it began using in 1997. They used both MFR 3 and MFR 6. Some of its wall thicknesses were, Rapra discovered, less than 3 mm at some locations.  Rapra’s expert evidence in that case does not support Balmoral’s claims about the ESCR of borecene. The two Irish companies, Carbery and Kingspan, are large companies.  In the case of Carbery, and, it may be, Kingspan the tanks have failed in the upper regions and the crack opens up in a form of fish mouth, suggesting a considerable residual stress. Carbery started buying borecene in May 2001 and Kingspan in early or mid 2002. They complain of increased failures from late 2002 in the former case and not later than 2005 in the latter.  Clarehill had trialled tanks with borecene  MFR 6 in February 1999 using a speed ratio of 8:1.4 instead of the 6:1 normally used with Borealis’ ME 8154 (ZN). In respect of a 1200 litre 40 kg tank the result of the change of ratio and adjustments to the temperature and oven cooling time was a 40% reduction in cycle time (approx) and improved material distribution.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="166">

	      </authorialNote>  In May 2005 a representative of Clarehill confirmed to Borealis that borecene-made tanks had been in the field for 3-4 years and that Clarehill had suffered only background failure rates and that all failures had been identified as not being due to material issues<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="167">

The only rational explanation for random failure is some factor other than such  variation.  In the absence of some external factor this must be the material itself.  If (ii) is correct it is necessary to account for why some tanks have acceptable variations and some do not. In the absence of any evidence of failure by batch, the inference must be that tanks with the same wall designs and processes are suffering from random wall variations. If the variations are random they are something against which Balmoral could not guard and must be attributable to the rheological defects of the material, which render it incapable of producing consistent wall thicknesses.</p>

It does not, and is not designed to, provide any assistance to Balmoral’s case on ESCR. The selective ESC failure of Balmoral’s borecene-made tanks predicates a cause or causes which apply to some tanks but not others. If the cause is an inherent characteristic of the material, such as very poor ESCR, the proposition meets the difficulty that the mechanical properties of a material are a constant. If all the material had this defect, borecenes could be expected to have a very widespread failure.  </p>

Items (a) and (b) will differ for every tank and item (c) for most of them.

Further there may be minor, but important changes or adjustments in those parameters, e.g. in shot weight actually put in, temperature, and timing as between one tank and another.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are no customary terms in the polymer trade in the United Kingdom in the sense of terms which are so “<span style="font-style:italic">certain, notorious and reasonable</span>” that anyone purchasing polymer must be taken to have contracted on those terms, unless expressly excluded or otherwise expressly agreed.  But suppliers of polymer in the UK habitually seek to sell on their standard terms and conditions. I use the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">seek to sell</span>” because the fact that suppliers have standard terms does not mean that they are always successful in incorporating them. In many cases those terms exclude one or other, or both, of the warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose, particularly the latter, and limit liability to replacement of defective goods or repayment of the purchase price. But suppliers’ terms differ. Borealis UK’s terms excluded both warranties. Borealis’ General Terms only excluded the latter, but allowed for a warranty of fitness if Borealis had approved such purpose in writing (which Borealis UK’s terms did not).  Both had the limit of liability to which I have referred.</p>

In the real world, as he submits, none of the individuals who were doing business with each other on behalf of Balmoral and Borealis paid any attention to the terms and conditions that the lawyers had drafted for them. Balmoral’s terms were adverted to in the bottom left hand corner of its purchase orders, but were never otherwise referred to nor provided to Borealis. Borealis’ terms appeared on the back of their invoices but were never discussed, either when complaints were made about blooming and warping, or when compensation was agreed, or when the dispute about the suitability of borecene arose. It was only when the lawyers came on the scene that the parties were transposed to an artificial world where reliance was placed on standard terms and a supposed change in contractual party (on two occasions) that the Claimant is said to be taken to have accepted, but never did.</p>

Alternatively, if the question has to be determined by a conventional application of the concepts of offer and acceptance, Borealis’ terms were never incorporated. Although it is true that Borealis’ terms were set out on the back of its invoices, all of these invoices post-dated the making of the contract and did not form part of the documentation constituting the subsequent one. </p>

Two relevant tests were identified, the first of which may, perhaps,  be regarded as part of the second: (a) whether reasonable notice had been given of the forwarder’s conditions and (b) what had each party by his words and conduct led the other party reasonably to believe him to be accepting. It was not necessary that the terms relied on should be specifically set out, provided they were conditions in common form or usual terms in the relevant business, nor was it necessary that they should be contained in a contractual document. The parties were commercial companies. There had been 11 invoices which gave notice that business was conducted on IFF terms. The exporter’s managing director knew that forwarding agents might impose terms which would frequently be standard terms and would sometimes deal with risk. Accordingly reasonable notice was given by the forwarders and the exporters’ conduct would have led the forwarders reasonably to believe that their terms were accepted.</p>

One of the issues was whether, in relation to one of the contracts, the standard terms of either party was incorporated. The order in question was the fifth in a series. The first order had been preceded by a quotation which was subject to the supplier’s terms and conditions of sale. After that the purchaser faxed a “blanket” order which stipulated that supply should be subject to the purchaser’s conditions. The order was confirmed by telephone. Delivery  took place.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These cases show two things. Firstly, at any rate where parties have dealt with each other more than once or twice, it may not be critical to the incorporation of standard terms that those terms be set out in a contractual document, i.e. one that itself constitutes an offer or its acceptance, or even in a purported record of the contract, nor that the document containing the terms relied on has preceded the making of every contract. Secondly, the sequence of events is important.  An invoice following a concluded contract effected by a clear offer on standard terms which are accepted, even if only by delivery, will or may be too late. But, if there has been no reference to rival terms, the appearance of terms on the back of every invoice and the acceptance of delivery of goods without objection may indicate acceptance of the terms.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">British Crane Hire </span>both parties were crane hirers. They each hired out cranes on similar conditions. The defendants had signed and sent back the plaintiff’s conditions twice before; and would have done so again if the accident had not happened.  In December 2004 Balmoral had not purchased material from Borealis before; nor had they ever signed or sent back Borealis’ conditions; nor, so far as the evidence shows, had they received a copy of those conditions when they sent their purchase order or took delivery. In those circumstances I do not think that Borealis was entitled to conclude that Balmoral had agreed to their terms.</p>

Firstly, Borealis would probably not have been prepared to supply its product at the price quoted or any price, if its terms were not, as it believed, accepted. Secondly, the effect of the fax was to make clear that the quoted price was contractually dependent on acceptance of the terms. In any event it seems to me unrealistic to suppose that the prices quoted would not differ at all if Borealis could not, as it believed, rely on its own terms. Borealis has insurance in respect of the claims the subject of these proceedings.  If Borealis had no terms and conditions the cost of that insurance is likely to have been greater than it was and to be reflected in the price. Even if that were not so, exposure to liability for fitness for purpose would be  likely to impel Borealis to take measures to reduce their exposure (e.g. by examining in detail the uses, designs, processing parameters, terms of sale and the like applicable to each  particular customer) which would themselves impact on the price.</p>

I accept that, if a contract has been made for the supply of a relatively small quantity of product on one set of terms on only a few occasions, it may, depending on the precise circumstances, be difficult to establish that later contracts for large quantities of a different product are also made on those terms.  But, here, at the beginning of the trading relationship Borealis made plain that its prices were quoted, and it was only willing to supply, on the basis of Borealis UK’s terms.</p>

The order of December 1995 was, in my judgment insufficient to reverse the previous position and to signify (much less to secure agreement) that Balmoral’s terms were now to apply instead. Balmoral said nothing about any <span style="font-style:italic">change</span> in terms. It did not say that Balmoral was going to treat Borealis’ quotes as no longer linked to Borealis’ conditions.

I do not think that the clause should be so construed.   The effect of clause 2.3. is that the purchase order ceases to be available for acceptance if it has not been accepted in writing within 14 days. It does not, however, provide that the only way in which an acceptance is possible is in writing. The contracts between Balmoral and Borealis were, as it seems to me, made when Borealis, having discovered that the producing company could deliver, orally confirmed Balmoral’s order. Although the evidence is unspecific, I infer that this would probably have occurred within the 14 day period.  Accordingly, on this hypothesis, there would have been an acceptance of  Balmoral’s order, on its terms, when the confirmation was given.</p>

Although agreement was reached as to prices, no agreement was reached as to the other terms prior to the expiry of the agreement. Tomlinson J held that after the expiry of the agreement neither party’s terms and conditions applied. In circumstances where there were management discussions as to the terms that were to apply he declined to hold that different contractual terms had been agreed either as a result of delivery notes incorporating standard terms which were handed by Messer to Britvic employees, and signed by them, or as a result of financial staff observing (if they did) those terms on the reverse side of the invoices they were required to process.

	      </authorialNote>, their content appears to me to be clear enough, even though they are couched in wording that presents an important change of contractual partner and terms as a service improvement. Whereas previously the delivering production unit would invoice the local sales company which would re-invoice the customer, from now on that unit was to invoice direct. That would require customers to maintain different files, because they would be dealing with different suppliers. But that additional administrative burden would be lessened by the fact that, whoever was the supplier, the payment would go to the same bank account. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These letters cannot, in my view, be treated as nothing more than an indication that, for purposes internal to Borealis, the mechanics of invoicing would change, but the contractual position would not. Their natural meaning is that there was to be a change from the previous position, where the supplier contracted with the sales office, which contracted with and therefore re-invoiced the customer, to one where the supplier to the customer was to be the producing company – hence the need for different supplier files.  It was equally apparent from the letter of November 1998 that there was to be a change of terms (“<span style="font-style:italic">You will find the revised document attached</span>”). As Mr Joyce said in evidence “<span style="font-style:italic">that is what it says”</span>.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="176">

Even if I am wrong on that it seems to me that, in circumstances where Borealis’ conditions had applied throughout 1999, the failure of Balmoral to object to the term in the rebate letter to the effect that  they should continue to apply, and their claim to the 2000 rebate without objection,  would have further conveyed to someone in Borealis’ position that Balmoral agreed to the application of Borealis UK’s terms.</p>

In the light of the explanation given in the letters of November and December 1998 and the use of the words “INVOICED BY”  it seems to me clear that it is the invoicing party which is the entity that is to be the seller. After Borealis UK was expressly described as Commercial Agent the position was even clearer. The terms themselves make clear that there is only one entity which is selling. </p>

If Borealis UK had no actual authority to confirm an order for borecene without contact with the producing company it would have had apparent authority so to do. If not, Balmoral UK would be liable for breach of an implied warranty of such authority. </p>

Mr Mawrey contends that this clause cannot have effect if the defective product cannot be exchanged because, in that event, there is no option that can be exercised in one of two different ways. I do not agree. The clause gives Borealis two options. If only one option is open to it, it is that option that it will have to choose. The fact that it cannot chose the other does not mean that the limit on liability cannot operate at all.</p>

Borealis produces raw materials with a wide range of uses and applications across the world. Borealis can and does perform a number of standard tests on samples of its product; but Borealis cannot be expected to test it for all uses of any prospective purchaser. Purchasers of borecene will, in their manufacturing processes, change its form, and may change its properties, by applying heat to it and mixing it with pigment by differing methods of incorporation.  Those purchasers are specialist manufacturers. Borealis is not. It is the manufacturers who will know how they intend to use borecene, what will be the design of the product made from it and of the moulds used to produce it, how that product will be engineered, to what stresses it will be subject, and what method of processing will be used, as well as the uses for which and the terms on which it will be sold.   It is they who are the experts in working out whether the material is going to work for their purposes and then making things out of that material.  The way in which the product is made (e.g. the amount of wall thickness and the quality of wall thickness distribution) will affect the quality of the product. Borealis habitually provides, and in the present case did provide, free samples to enable testing to take place. If asked to carry out further tests in order to obtain data relevant to an intended use of the material Borealis is likely to do so. In the nature of things Borealis will have little or no control over the manner in which borecene is used, and little or no knowledge, much less control, as to the extent to which, and the terms upon which, products manufactured from it  are marketed and sold. Every use or application may give rise to a large, even enormous, claim against Borealis. The success or failure of such claims may depend, to a significant extent, on matters that are internal to the claimant (such as the precise method of manufacture) in relation to which Borealis may have limited knowledge or access to evidence.  In those circumstances, it was legitimate for Borealis to protect themselves against that exposure. </p>

Here the transaction includes carriage of goods by sea and insurance. These spheres of commercial activity standing on their own are excluded from the Act (see Schedule 1 para 1a (insurance) and 2c and 3 (carriage of goods by ship). In this case the element of road transport was sufficient to render the transaction subject to the Act, but the mixed nature of the contract of carriage emphasises the interest of the freight forwarder in having a time limitation which is applicable across the spectrum of his obligations”.</span>

So far as the terms<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>of the contract are concerned, Borealis would not knowingly have supplied borecene otherwise than on its terms, or terms to equivalent effect, unless they had been persuaded to do so for some very good reason.  If Balmoral had raised with Borealis the question of supplying Borecene on Balmoral’s terms, they would, in all probability, have been told that borecene was not available on those terms. As Mr Cartwright put it he would have “<span style="font-style:italic">walked away</span>” the moment the proposal was suggested. This is, also, demonstrated by what happened, in relation to the proposed Industrial Supply Agreement where the proposed Balmoral warranty was crossed out by Mr Wood.  </p>

The possibility of Balmoral switching supplier, as in the end it did, was always a factor tending to keep the price down, and Balmoral succeeded in driving good bargains in that respect.   Further Balmoral did not have to take Borecene. They could have continued with ZN material, even in 1997 when DSM had given notice of withdrawal, since Matrix Polymers was waiting in the wings.  </p>

I do not however accept that Balmoral’s assent to the terms should be regarded as more apparent than real, having regard to the number of different occasions when they either signed documents expressly incorporating those terms or had the opportunity to demur when Borealis explained that they were going to apply.</p>

Mr Joyce’s witness statement said that, as he understood it, it would have been difficult and prohibitively expensive for Balmoral to insure and that he was seeking further information. None has been provided. Mr Webster’s evidence is to the effect that the availability of such insurance and its price was linked to the quality assurance procedures at the insured’s premises. I infer from that that product recall and guarantee insurance would have been obtainable, if Balmoral’s quality assurance programmes were acceptable to insurers, but that it would probably have been  expensive.

This showed “<span style="font-style:italic">that Watford was well aware of the commercial considerations which lead a supplier to include a provision restricting liability for indirect or consequential loss; and, in particular , was well aware that a  supplier would be likely to determine the price at which it was prepared to sell its products by reference (amongst other things) to its exposure to the risk of unquantifiable claims to indirect or consequential losses which might be suffered by the customer if things went wrong”. </span>The fact, however, that a purchaser has similar conditions of sale to those which he impugns cannot be conclusive, not least because the purchaser may be hard pressed to defend his own conditions of sale against a 1977 Act challenge. Further, in the present case Balmoral supplied oil tanks with a 10 year warranty. Thus, although Balmoral’s standard sale terms indicate the type of awareness to which Chadwick L.J. referred, it cannot be said that it was reasonable for Borealis to include its exclusionary terms because Balmoral did much the same in relation to oil tanks manufactured from borecene. </p>

It was the assumption of both sides that it was so capable. The supply of a product which, because of a latent defect (whether in respect of ESCR or rheological properties or both) made the manufacture of consistently satisfactory tanks impossible would confound those assumptions. In those circumstances a blanket exclusion of any liability whatever  is prima facie unreasonable (as was the exclusion of any liability for the supply of carbon dioxide with an excessive benzene content in <span style="font-style:italic">Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd v Messer UK </span>[2002] EWCA  Civ 548; and <span style="font-style:italic">Bacardi-Martini Beverages v Thomas Hardy Packaging Ltd </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 549).

I have not been persuaded that requiring Balmoral to bear the entire risk of a latent defect in Borealis’ product is an appropriate allocation of risk. The Sale of Goods Act itself recognises that, all other things being equal, it should be the seller who bears the responsibility. Borealis has extensive insurance against just such a risk. Whilst product recall insurance would probably have been available to Balmoral, albeit expensively, Balmoral did not have such insurance. The evidence does not establish that product recall insurance would have been normal for someone in Balmoral’s position. </p>

Borealis’ terms were presented on a take-it-or leave it basis and Balmoral’s scope for going elsewhere on any better terms was very limited (on the evidence before me to Matrix and, even with them, obtaining any substantial sum would depend on proving negligence). Whilst Borealis UK’s terms were standard in the trade they are not the product of any agreed process of negotiation between representatives of sellers and buyers. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I take into account the submissions made by Borealis which I have set out in paragraph 401 above as to the extent of their potential liability and the cost implications of their being potentially liable for claims in respect of unfitness for any of the many purposes for which borecene might be bought. In respect of these submissions two matters strike me as of particular relevance. Firstly, whilst liability for fitness for purpose can be onerous it is not unqualified. It only arises when the buyer reasonably relies on the seller and the goods are not reasonably fit for what the seller knows is their intended purpose. The defect must be one that lies within the seller’s sphere of expertise. The seller can, of course, still be liable for a latent defect of which he is himself unaware. But, as between seller and buyer, it is more appropriate that loss from such a defect should be borne by the seller. As Scott Baker, J, as he then was, said in <span style="font-style:italic">St Alban’s City and District Council v International Computers Ltd</span> [1995] F.S.R 686 is not unreasonable that he who stands to make the profit should carry the loss.  Borealis is a very large organisation, much larger than Balmoral both in term of assets and technical expertise, and has insurance against liabilities such as these. It can spread the cost of that insurance, and of any exposure not covered by insurance, over a very wide range of purchasers.  Balmoral might be able to pass on the cost of product recall insurance but whether that is so is, on the present evidence, an open question.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is material also to look at the consequences. If borecene was, contrary to my findings, not suitable for making oil tanks because of a latent defect, Balmoral will have suffered a huge loss (a foreseeable consequence of such a defect) which they had no real opportunity to avoid at the manufacturing stage. It is not reasonable that they should be without any redress from the manufacturer at all.</p>

That cannot automatically mean that reliance on the impugned terms would have been unreasonable, or that the terms themselves were unreasonable. But, especially when the settlement is as high as £170,000, it is an indication to that effect.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Damberg v Damberg</span> [2001] 52 NSWLR the New South Wales Court of Appeal refused, despite the assumption of the parties that it would be bound to do so, to accept that German law in relation to the taxation of capital gains, and the evasion or avoidance thereof, was the same as that of  Australia. The assumption was, on the facts, particularly inapposite since there were indications that German and Australian law were completely different. At the relevant time for most of the transactions in issue Germany had a capital gains tax but Australia had none, save for short term capital gains. Heydon J.A., referred to a wealth of authority, English and Commonwealth, as to the presumption that the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> applies as well as to cases where the presumption had not been applied. The cases cited in the latter category reveal a number of possible criteria as to when the presumption will not be applied e.g. (a) where it is not in the interests of justice; (b) where the foreign law is not based on the common law; (c) where the English law relied on alters the common law; (d) where it is inherently improbable that the foreign law is the same; (e) where fairness requires it. The Court did not find it necessary to specify criteria that would determine when the presumptions would not be applied. It simply decided that it could not be assumed that German law and Australian law in relation to avoidance or evasion of capital gains tax were the same. Taxation law could not be assumed to rest “<span style="font-style:italic">on great and broad principles likely to be part of any legal system</span>”. </p>

The Court of Appeal referred to cases where the rule was inapplicable e.g. (a) where English law creates some special institution; (b) in prosecutions in respect of acts committed abroad; (c) where summary judgment is sought. They reached the view that if Part VIII were to apply to the company the statutory provisions would have to be significantly adapted, and thought (obiter) that that might of itself be a sufficient indication that the case was one where some special institution was created in English law such that those provisions could not apply to a Pennsylvanian company. The basis of the Court’s decision was that the Second Directive could not, at that stage, be accepted as showing that the requirement for relevant accounts was one which was generally applicable to private, as opposed to public companies. </p>

They further submit that section 27 (1) of the Act (which provides that, if the law of any part of the United Kingdom is the law of the contract only by choice of the parties, most of the Act is not to apply if apart from that choice the law of the contract would be a non UK law), shows that the draftsman of the Act did not intend that contracts which were, or, but for an express choice of foreign law, would be subject to foreign law should attract its provisions. Further section 27 (2) (a) provides that the Act has effect notwithstanding any contract term applying some foreign law if that term was imposed in order to evade the operation of the Act. That provision suggests that, absent an imposition for that purpose, the Act should not have effect. It would then be very odd, Mr Allen submits, if a contract  expressly subject to a non United Kingdom law should, in the absence of evidence that that law does not have the same provisions as the Act, be subject to it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Firstly, I regard it as artificial to apply the English law of contract without reference to the 1977 Act. If, as I must, I have to have regard to the Sale of Goods Act 1979, why should I ignore the 1977 Act?  A possible ground is that the 1979 Act, as successor to the Act of 1893, is, in relation to the matters which it addresses, largely declaratory of the common law. But the 1893 Act has itself been the subject of amendment.  The provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 Act might well have been put into effect by way of amendment to the Act of 1893, as happened with the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. The latter Act implemented the English and Scottish Law Commissions’ First Report on Exemption Clauses. The 1977 Act was passed in consequence of the Commissions’ Second Report.   I respectfully concur with the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ship “Mercury Bell” v Amosin </span>[1986] 27 DLR (4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>) 641 where Marceau J distinguished “<span style="font-style:italic">substantive provisions of a general character</span>” from “<span style="font-style:italic">others of a localized or regulatory character</span>” and treated the rule as rationally acceptable <span style="font-style:italic">“only when limited to provisions of the law potentially having some degree of universality</span>”. In the same case Hugessen J observed that  <span style="font-style:italic">“the proper expression of the rule … is that the court will apply only those parts of the lex fori which form part of the general law of the country”. </span>The 1977 Act may properly be regarded as falling within that category.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I think that it would be unfair to do so. The prime purpose of the rule is to establish on whom lies the onus of producing evidence of the content of foreign law. In the absence of any pleading that the 1977 Act had no application Balmoral was by the time of the trial reasonably entitled to assume that the case would be conducted by reference to English law including the 1977 Act. Balmoral pleaded the Act in its Reply. Borealis pleaded, and then abandoned, time bar defences in Danish and Norwegian Law in its Defence. In a Further Reply on foreign law Balmoral relied on the presumption. There was a rejoinder to that Reply. Borealis did not plead that the presumption was inapplicable. In those circumstances I do not think that I should decline to apply the 1977 Act. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am confirmed in that view by two further considerations. Firstly it would have been very easy to adduce evidence as to whether Norway or Denmark has provisions identical or similar to those contained in the 1977 Act. Borealis, who, in effect, contend that neither Norway nor Denmark has any provision equivalent to the relevant provisions of the 1977 Act has failed to adduce evidence to that effect, notwithstanding that Norway and Denmark are the places of incorporation of the Borealis entities relying on those laws. If Borealis was going to say that these laws had no provision that would restrict the applicability of the exclusion clauses, it should, and could easily, have produced the evidence to establish that. Secondly, the laws of those countries may have provisions restricting the entitlement of suppliers to exclude or restrict liability which are (a) the same as English law; or (b) more; or (c) less favourable to the purchaser; or (d) may have no such provision at all. The effect of applying English law, but without reference to the 1977, Act is that I shall have assumed that the answer is (d). Whilst this is a possible answer it is by no means the only one. To make that assumption might be a great injustice. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not derive any assistance in reaching this conclusion from section 27 of the 1977 Act. The Act plainly contemplates that its provisions (a) will not apply to a foreign law contract unless the foreign law has only been chosen in order to evade the operation of the Act and (b) that its most significant provisions will still not apply even if the parties have expressly chosen the law of England, Scotland or Northern Ireland if, but for that choice, the contract would be governed by a foreign law. The purpose was, no doubt, to ensure (a) that people did not evade the operation of the Act by an artificial choice of law and (b) that parties who chose English law did not, by litigating in England, find themselves forced to have the 1977 Act apply in circumstances where that was not the natural law of the contract. But neither of those facts has any bearing on the incidence of responsibility for adducing evidence of foreign law. The section says nothing about the rule or presumption, which was in force well before the Act was passed.</p>

The basis of that decision was that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">as clear as could be</span>” that the reference to parties was to the principals. I do not regard that clarity as diminished if either the buyer or the seller’s agent assumes personal liability. If that is so, there are up to four “parties” -  the seller, the seller’s agent , the buyer, and the buyer’s agent. The statute gives no indication that, if seller and buyer are in different States the fact that at least two of such “parties”, presumably one on either side of the contract, are in the same State, then the Act must apply. Nor does such a conclusion appear to me consistent with the statutory purpose.   The policy behind the Act is that it should not strike down exclusions from liability contained in international supply contracts. It would be very surprising if a contact for the supply of a cargo of crude oil f.o.b. Bonny in Nigeria made between a Nigerian seller and an English buyer, both acting through English brokers, should cease to be an international supply contract, if either broker undertook personal liability on the contract.  The purpose of the section is to deal with contracts where the supplier and the purchaser are in different States and the goods are being, or are to be, carried from one State to another, or to a State other than the one where the contract was made. It is not concerned with whether the agent of the supplier is in the same State as the purchaser or his agent. </p>

In the example given the goods can be properly said to be in the course of carriage from one State to another, just as a passenger may be said to be in the course of carriage from London to Paris when the Eurostar stops at Lille. </p>

The course of business involved Borealis UK checking with Borealis Norway that the goods could be produced and then confirming the order to Balmoral. It would follow that the goods would not, when the contract was concluded, have been in the United Kingdom and were to be carried thither once they had been manufactured. The evidence before me does not indicate that Borealis’ warehouses in the UK were anything other than transhipment centres or that borecene ordered by Balmoral was supplied to them from stock which, at the time of the contract, was in store in the United Kingdom waiting for a purchaser. </p>

By the end of 2002 Balmoral was beginning to face a flood of complaints. The problem with borecene made tanks became public knowledge. The Environment Agency became involved. Balmoral had to increase the number of staff members devoted to dealing with complaints. By November 2003 9 staff were involved; by February 2004 13. Detailed records were kept of each complaint and entered on a spreadsheet (the “Emergency Spreadsheet”) which forms the basis of the quantum claim. Additional files were created for “Environmental” claims i.e. claims in respect of damage caused by oil spillages. </p>

Balmoral contacted its distributors and advertised in the national media and on its website in order to identify as many of those tanks as possible. Distributors were invited to make contact with the end-user, sending a form to be returned to Balmoral if the user owned a tank with a serial number beginning with 0001 up to 0201. Advice was given to customers, distributors and fuel suppliers that tanks within that range should not be filled to over 50% capacity.  A separate department of two people implemented the programme.   In Spring 2005 some fuel suppliers decided to advise their customers to adopt this policy with all Balmoral tanks.</p>

It derives from a calculation, to be found at paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3. of Miss Hassell’s supplemental report (“Hassell 2”), of the cost of dealing with tanks made from borecene which failed in excess of the agreed, underlying, non-borecene rate of failure of 2.96 %. As at 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2005 a number of complaints had been dealt with (“completes”), a number had been deferred, and a number were open. The figures for dealing with completed (£526) and deferred (£51.48) complaints are agreed. A “<span style="font-style:italic">deferred</span>” complaint is one where the complaint has been rejected e.g. because the end user has failed to provide proof of purchase, or to organise and pay for his own site survey, or because installation was not in accordance with the guidelines. The sum for dealing with a deferred complaint covers the cost of initial processing and rejection of the complaint. The complaint is described as “deferred” (a) because of Balmoral’s doubts as to whether the policy will hold; and (b) because the end user may challenge this rejection.  Miss Hassell’s calculation assumes that the open complaints will become completes or deferred in the same proportion as the actual figures in those categories. </p>

That figure is based on the same methodology as produces the £2,779,420 total but with more up to date figures for the average cost of dealing with complaints<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="182">
		<p class="FootnoteText">MFR 3 : £ 41, MFR 6 : £ 512, and MFR 4 : £ 556.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. That cost has reduced, partly because there has been a higher proportion of refunds and refunds are now of residual value. The cost of deferred items has also reduced to £4 because Balmoral now shifts responsibility for obtaining site surveys to the end user. Miss Hassell also puts forward an alternative calculation of £578,131. This alternative calculation (paragraph 6.7.2) assumes that claims that have been completed or deferred will not be reopened, but that all open claims will be dealt with in accordance with the policy in force before the change in 2005, on the basis that that harder line policy cannot last.

The hypothesis upon which this question arise is that (contrary to the fact) I have decided  that borecene is not fit for the purpose of making oil tanks and that, particularly in relation to MFR 6, borecene, tanks have failed in large quantities for that reason. On that hypothesis it does not seem to me that Balmoral would be able to resist having to maintain at least their former policy. It would not be possible to hold the line that end users must bear the costs of surveys, that only the residual value should be refunded, and that there should be very limited, if any, compensation.</p>

I regard this as too speculative to rely on.</p>

He would only allow £10,095.75 of the transport costs. The basis upon which he would only allow the latter sum is that he does not accept that none of these tanks could have been brought back as a backload after delivery of tanks to a distributor. The suggestion is that 81% of the tanks could have been backhauled: see paragraph 5.5 of Mr Jensen’s second report (“Jensen 2”) and paragraphs 363 – 364 of Borealis’ final submissions. The 19.2% figure, which reduces £50,478,75 to £10,095.75, is the proportion that the third party turnover of the Transport Division for the year ending March 2004 (£331,000) bears to the inter company turnover (£1,726,000).  </p>

Mr Main gave evidence that the transport division, which provided services to the other divisions at commercial rates, endeavoured to find backloads from third parties and did so with a high percentage of success, such that there were very few miles driven without loads. However in the marine part of the Transport Division the work, which often involved taking cranes and low loaders to the docks, was mainly local, and did not generate back loads.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This general evidence does not seem to be supported by the only figures available. The income from back loads is the third party element of turnover. Some back loads, however, involved the carriage of raw material for Balmoral’s Divisions, which generated an inter company charge. Inter company turnover also included the recharge of cranage and low loaders, and of third party transport sometimes used to deliver products. So, even if every delivery had had a backload of equal value the inter company and third party turnover figures would not be the same.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I approach the matter in this way.  There are in the papers no documents that indicate which lorries returned empty, and which full. The evidence does,  however, show that Balmoral tried, as one would expect, to obtain back loads from third parties in cases where it did not have a back load of its own. The fact that some 11% of the total turnover for 2003/4 (i.e. the ratio of £331,000 to £331,000 + £1,726,000) derives from third parties shows the extent of its success. But the fact that the third party proportion of inter company turnover is nearly 20% does not establish that in 80% of the cases there was no back load, not least because inter company turnover is not limited to receipts from outward journeys but includes the matters referred to in the previous paragraph, and because loads and backloads cannot be regarded as always of equal value.  There was some confusion in the evidence as to whether the 80% figure included a charge to Balmoral for returning empty to Aberdeen.  Mr Main’s evidence was that where raw material for the division was carried in a backload, there was an inter company charge. I infer from that evidence that empty back hauls were not charged. There is no positive evidence that they were.  That would not be the way in which transport costs are usually charged.   </p>

No accurate estimate is possible, not least because the amount by which the £1,726,000 figure would have to be reduced in order that it should represent only the cost of outward journeys for which there was no inter company backhaul is unknown. In view of the smallness of the item, I would have taken a broad brush approach and have awarded Balmoral 1/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> of their £50,479 claim viz £16,826, say £16,850.</p>

The issue that divides the parties is whether the change out policy was a reasonable one and whether Balmoral is seeking to recover for tanks that did not need to have been changed out at all.  Balmoral changed tanks whose production fell within the serial range “0001….” to 0201….” The first two digits - “00” and “02” - denote the years 2000 and 2002. The second two digits denote the month.

For instance, some MFR 3 tanks manufactured in very early January 2000 immediately before the introduction of  MFR 6 came into the 0001 range; and some MFR 4 tanks manufactured in January 2002 immediately after the change to MFR 4 came into the 0201 range. In the period up to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2005 930 tanks were called in of which, as is now known or estimated<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="184">

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Borealis’ first, but not its second, point. As to (i), it was no doubt sensible to give the public a range of numbers between which the MFR 6 population would lie. But it was not impractical for Balmoral to check, from the serial number of any responding customer’s tank, whether it was made of borecene MFR 6. The production records contain details of the serial numbers, which are in sequential order, and the material<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="185">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See, for instance, CF 2/330.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Change out of a tank is quite expensive; and the cost of checking whether the material of the tank was borecene MFR 6 would have been small in comparison. Even if the records were archived they could be accessed. As to (ii), Borealis was faced with substantial failings of tanks made with MFR6 borecene. It was under pressure from the Environment Agency. By 2004 and 2005, the years when the policy was being put into effect, some tank designs were failing much more than others, as Balmoral would have known. As it has turned out so far, there have continued to be markedly different failure percentages for different designs. But, when the policy was made, Balmoral was not to know that this pattern would continue. Their policy to change out MFR 6 was, in my judgment, a reasonable response at the time to the dilemma in which they then found themselves, particularly having regard to the fact that a failure to call in a tank because, say, there had only been a 7.5% failure rate to date, could have catastrophic consequences.  Further the matching of production data to failure data, which would allow an accurate calculation of those designs in which there was a failure rate higher than 10% has proved a mammoth task, only completed in the course of preparation of the experts’ reports in this action. </p>

These claims can appear unexpectedly, or in unexpected amounts, either in addition to a claim for replacement of the tank or where no such claim has been made e.g. because the end user finds it easier to deal with his own insurer, or is forced to do so because Borealis has rejected his claim. Balmoral will often have no idea of the costs involved for a long time. The incidence of further unexpected claims is also very difficult to predict, both as to number and amount. It seemed to me that the appropriate course would be to make an interim award of damages in relation to the matters that could be dealt with now, leaving these claims over until later.</p>

A managing director will typically be paid a fixed salary, perhaps with profit related bonuses.  If he requires to spend part of his time organising rectification work following a breach of contract, he will not be paid any more, and there is thus no direct cost to his employer as a result of the need to perform the rectification work.  In reality, however, there is still a loss to his employer as a result of the rectification work.  A managing director will normally be expected to devote the whole of his working time and effort to the affairs of his employer; a term of that nature is commonly found in managing directors' service contracts, and in many cases would be implied even if it were not expressed...  If one of the company's suppliers commits a breach of contract, and in consequence the managing director requires to spend a significant amount of time supervising remedial measures, that time is lost to the other tasks that the managing director is obliged to perform.  That in my opinion clearly represents a loss to the company.  It may not leave the company out of pocket, in the sense of having to pay more to the managing director; nevertheless, the company will inevitably be deprived of part of the services that it would normally expect from the managing director.  That might mean, for example, that the managing director was unable to devote as much time as would otherwise have been possible to the planning of an important marketing initiative, or the development of a new product, or to general administration of the company's affairs and the supervision of its employees...</span></p>

On the figures given in the relevant exhibits that does not appear to me to be the case for the staff now under consideration. Similarly circumstances can be envisaged in which the employees are so underemployed that the company suffers no loss because they have to work a bit more.

They are simply percentages given to Miss Hassell by Balmoral as representing the estimated proportion of time that the relevant individuals had to spend dealing with the problem. I do not think it would be just to exclude the claim on that ground. The percentages put forward appear to me to be reasonable, having regard to the magnitude of the problem. The case is not in the same category as <span style="font-style:italic">Tate &amp; Lyle Food and Distributions Ltd Plc v G.L.C.</span> [1982] 1 W.L.R. 149, where a percentage of the total damages was claimed in respect of overheads.

There is very little difference between the parties on the figures (the defendants’ figure of £21,973 is based on the documents seen by Mr Jensen by 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006). I accept Miss Hassell’s evidence that  the recruited individuals are as set out in her Exhibit 26 and that the costs are sufficiently established.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Hassell’s calculation consists of taking the number of customer services staff in the years 2002 – 2004 and calculating what percentage they represent of the total staff . Those percentages are then applied to those expenses for the relevant years that would increase as a result of the employment of those additional staff. Mr Jensen has a much higher overhead figure (£486,940) reached by taking certain costs for a base period of January to August 2002 so as to arrive at an average monthly amount. This amount is then adjusted monthly in accordance with the Consumer Price Indices and then compared to the actual cost from September 2002 to December 2004. I propose to use Miss Hassell’s figure because it is smaller, and because to use Mr Jensen’s higher overhead figure as well as Miss Hassell’s figures for direct and indirect labour, would introduce an element of duplication.</p>

Both experts are agreed that the Archive staff is appropriately treated as litigation cost. The material before me does not enable me to reach a view as to the £40,690 figure. Had I awarded damages, I would have required further information on this point, if it could not be agreed.  </p>

The 10% figure is the percentage that Marsh Ltd, the brokers, say was applied to Balmoral’s public/products rating because of market conditions, the balance being almost exclusively as a result of the intimation of pollution losses from Balmoral’s tanks. Borealis are concerned that the increase in premium for the primary layer arises because overall cover has been doubled; but there seems to me no basis for inferring that.  Nor do I accept Mr Jensen’s suggestion that the expected 2002 premium should have been increased by 100% rather than 10% for which there appears to me to be no warrant.</p>

But Miss Hassell produced a further calculation (see the document entitled “Additional Analyses”) which assumed that the excess of loss premium for those years was the same percentage (10.3%) of the total premium as it was in 2003. In my judgment this is a proper approach, in consequence of which the amount of Balmoral’s loss is as follows:</p>

I have no crystal ball to determine the answer.  It is, however, clear to me that Balmoral must have suffered a loss of profit on account of the problems with cracked tanks and that it would be unjust to decline to determine any figure on account of the formidable difficulties involved in doing so. That Balmoral might suffer such a loss of profit was something that Borealis should have had in contemplation as a possible consequence of supplying borecene which was unfit for the purpose of making oil tanks. I reject the suggestion that any profit attributable to the additional demand for bunded tanks in consequence of the new legislation was too remote. </p>

The evidence does not however establish that Balmoral was constrained, either physically or psychologically, to a level of production measured by that level of turnover. Paragraphs 46 ff of Mr Joyce’s second statement indicate that existing machine capacity could cope with at least the levels of production in Illustrations 1 and 2, although more dubiously in relation to Illustration 3 (see paragraph 9.64 of Jensen 2). </p>

Borealis contend that three data points are wholly inadequate to establish a trend line to the end of 2005 or beyond. There would be more force in this contention if the line being plotted was of data subject to a high degree of unpredictability or scatter. Whilst continuation of turnover is always to some extent unpredictable the figures show that, in respect of fuel tanks, Balmoral was consistently maintaining a 10% increase in turnover year on year over a four year period, in circumstances where it was under what a March 1996 internal report described as “<span style="font-style:italic">extreme price pressure in the market</span>”.

Even if that was so (and none of his previous memoranda were as gloomy), the facts referred to in the letter - written toward the end of 2001, the first year of the period which illustration 1 takes as the start  of a series of years from 2001 to 2005 with 10% annual increases - indicate that  market conditions were tough because of the competition.  Kingspan, with “<span style="font-style:italic">exceptionally low</span>” prices, was way and above the market leader. The Richard Lowrie referred to was the former Sales Director of Kingspan, who had, according to what he told Mr Joyce, been offered £1,000,000 by Kingspan not to set up in competition and had told Balmoral he would not compete with them. In the event he had set up Atlas Tanks, which entered the market in April 2001, and was, according to the letter, “<span style="font-style:italic">exceptionally active</span>” with bargain offers amongst Balmoral’s accounts<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="189">

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Mawrey submits that it would be wrong to place much reliance on this letter and that it cannot be read as showing a serious and permanent downturn in business; nor can the absence of reference to cracking detract from the fact that Balmoral was beginning to realise that the cracking problem was serious. Balmoral also draws attention to a number of other factors. It had a reputation for quality. In a 1997 survey about 88% of distributor respondents placed Balmoral first in terms of quality and 84% placed it first in terms of service. It had a wider range of tanks than its competitors. Although the results for the first half of 2001 were below budget the dip was not particularly large; there had been dips before and sales had risen again. Further the period from September to November was the time when sales usually reached their monthly peaks, October usually being the highest.  The new regulations increased demand for bunded tanks, which, themselves, were at the more expensive end of the market<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="193">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> For example, in September 2005 a single skin SL 1250 had a price of £ 345 and a bunded version either £ 1,160 or £ 1,200 (with a “Watchman Plus” fitted as standard).</p>
	      </authorialNote>. So a small change in the proportion of tanks sold that were bunded could produce a significant change in the turnover received for the sale of the same number of tanks. Consistently with this, between 2000 and 2004/5 Balmoral’s volume of sales fell by 75%, but because of the change to bunded tanks, sales value fell by only 45%.</p>

It had spent £250,000 on new moulds in order to exploit the opportunity for such tanks. True it is that there were new entrants but that should be regarded as a response to increased demand rather than an attempt to take Balmoral’s market share. Balmoral had always been more expensive, but that had not stopped them progressing before. In order to meet Miss Hassell’s Illustration 3 for 2005, it would need about 8% compound volume growth from 2000.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2001 the upward trend of Balmoral’s tank sales changed dramatically. By September 2001 actual sales had begun to diverge significantly from 2000 actual and 2001 budgeted figures<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="194">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See the graph at paragraph 15.2.5 of Hassell 1.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. The true cause of this decline is debatable. Mr Joyce’s letter suggests that the cause was a crowded market and price competition from companies seeking to gain market share in order to take advantages of the additional sales that the regulations would generate.  The fact that  between January and August sales figures were 9.1 % down on the same period for 2000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="195">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See Schedule E 2 to Jensen 1 (DF 1/223). The decrease by comparison to budgeted figures was even more marked. In August and September 2001 the reduction was about 25%: see DF 2/430.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, with all months save February and May down on 2000,  would tend to support that, and to suggest that there were factors affecting Balmoral other than  problems of tank cracking.  Mr Joyce thought that Balmoral’s withdrawal from the Irish fuel market in 2000 and the absence of  a sales manager from October 2000 to October 2001 might be to blame. If so, these were factors that (a) had nothing to do with cracking and (b) would have, particularly in the case of the former, continuing effect. Another factor may have been that buyers were preparing to shift to bunded tanks. Mr Joyce expected that the dip in sales in the first two quarters would be reversed in the last two.</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> The total number of complaints about split tanks was of the order of 158 in 2000 and 390 in 2001.</p>

(There were also complaints of bulging in respect of the SL 1250 tank). By the end of the month Mr Joyce was recording in an internal memorandum<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="197">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> 18/6019</p>
	      </authorialNote> that Balmoral’s reputation had been severely affected by the cracking problem and that competitors could <span style="font-style:italic">begin </span>to use it against them, bearing in mind that some of Balmoral’s key stockists were already dual stocking.  After September the increasing divergence between actual and budgeted figures for the remainder of the year may be attributable in part to the delivery of defective batches of borecene and the consequent interruption of production. But the effect on production cannot have been that large. 603 tanks were manufactured  from the defective borecene – about 3 days lost production; 403 had to be scrapped and the remainder sold on a concessionary basis.   Sales continued to decline thereafter.  </p>

A sustained run of that size, which Balmoral’s projections carry on until 2012, would be quite an achievement, and there were, as it seems to me, indications that the good run of year on year increases up to 2000 was about to run out. Market conditions had changed. Bunded tanks were the coming product. The low pricing and increased competition referred to in Mr Joyce’s letter were matters that depressed his view of prospects, quite apart from any significance that the cracking problem might have. Although the cracking problem was beginning to be felt it does not seem to me that by the autumn of 2001 it had reached such a point that it was likely to have been a substantial cause of the shortfall  in sales between both budgeted and 2000 figures. </p>

DEFRA estimated that, on a worst case analysis, about 60% of the overall existing stock of 818,423 tanks in the non-domestic market were either unbunded (40%) or inadequately bunded (20%).<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="198">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF 2 454 and 18/5846 paragraph 22.</p>
	      </authorialNote> It also estimated that 36,378 new above ground tanks were purchased annually. A Regulatory Impact Assessment issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimated that in 1998 about 80,000 tanks were sold to the domestic market with about half of them having a capacity in excess of 2,500 litres; that 10% of them were currently bunded and that J6 of the Building Regulations would require a level of bunding of 15% with an additional national cost of £1.8 million.  But there were several manufacturers chasing the business, many with low prices e.g. (i) Kingspan; (ii) Harlequin, the brand name of Clarehill; (iii) Atlas (new); (iv) Carbery; (v) Deso; (vi) Tuffa; and (vii) PC Rotomoulding.

That indicated that 5 principal manufacturers of above ground plastic oil tanks sold 79% single skin and 21% bunded (in units). By 2000 20% of Balmoral’s sales were of bunded tanks. Too much should not be read into these statistics since the comparison is between the respondents to the survey (Kingspan, Carbery, Deso, Clarehill and Balmoral) in 2004 and Balmoral alone in 2000. But in 2000 Balmoral had not been beset by cracking problems and was a prominent member of the market. If its share of the market in 2000 was representative there would seem to have been little change in the proportion of bunded tanks sold by the market between 2000 and 2004. </p>

Some users would be ignorant of the Regulations and some would ignore them, at least until they have to change a tank. The extent to which the Regulations would prove to be the driver for bunded tanks is, in any event, uncertain. In its Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment on the COP Regulations DEFRA estimated that some 60 to 90% of new tanks ordered would have been ordered in bunded form, whether the Regulations were brought in or not<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="200">

At least three different users are relevant (a) the user who already has a Balmoral single skin tank; (b) the user who already has a single skin tank from some other supplier; and (c) the user who has no tank at all. Users in category (a) would, I expect, on the whole be likely to replace their existing Balmoral tank with another, but some in this category would take the opportunity to trade down, especially if they found themselves compelled to buy a new tank soon after an earlier purchase. Users in category (b) would be unlikely to trade up, although some might. Those who were acquiring a tank for the first time would make their choice according to the importance to them of quality and service (as reported to them in most cases by the distributor) over price. </p>

Some distributors who became wary of Balmoral’s single skin tanks may have had less anxiety or no anxiety at all in relation to bunded tanks. One such distributor was Mr Chris Glass of Hesset Grain &amp; HG Tanks who had ceased buying single skin but continued to buy bunded tanks and sewage treatment products from Balmoral. He bought his single skin tanks from Atlas and Midas. By contrast Mr Ian Mackie of CHF Supplies stopped purchasing all but a small percentage of oil tanks from Balmoral.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I did not find the position of Kingspan much of a reliable guide to Balmoral’s prospects in the bunded market. Kingspan is a significantly different company. It is the market leader. Its products are cheaper (Balmoral’s prices are about 30% higher) and had a useful “Watchman” accessory, as some of Balmoral’s tanks came to do. It operates in the Irish market, which Balmoral no longer does. Its environmental containers division includes tanks; but it is not possible to discover the division’s figures in relation to tanks alone. In its 2001 accounts the division, which includes but is not limited to tanks, is expressed as growing “<span style="font-style:italic">on the back of increased demand for products that offer increased environmental protection</span>” although turnover growth in environmental containers appears fairly flat. Its 2002 accounts indicated that it had led the conversion in commercial applications in the UK from single skin to bunded, but the division’s growth in sales was 2%. The accounts also indicated that Kingspan had focused on the UK and Irish markets but had now identified other markets to be supplied from their new Polish facility. In 2003 the division’s 17% increase in turnover was said to be underpinned in the main by increased conversion to double-skinned domestic oil storage tanks and “<span style="font-style:italic">by a much improved position in the Irish domestic waste treatment market</span>”.  In 2004 the division had an increase of sales of 11% said to be based on a shift towards “<span style="font-style:italic">more value-added environmental solutions</span>” (presumably a reference to, or including, bunded tanks) and its value adding Watchman system and the success of the Polish based mainland European business. The interim statement to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2005 records that organic (i.e. not derived from acquisitions) revenue in the division increased by 20% but with much of that growth coming from a range of effluent treatment products. It also records that “<span style="font-style:italic">revenue in fuel storage products in the UK and Ireland continued to grow despite an underlying reduction in the total volume available in the market. This growth reflects the continuing conversion to higher value double skinned products with  telemetry enhancements”</span>”. Nothing in these accounts makes out a 10% year on year increase in tank sales.</p>

Miss Hassell has first calculated the gross margin (i.e. sales less cost of sales) for the year ending 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2005 for single skin and bunded tanks. She chose that year because she thought that the earlier figures would have been distorted because warranty costs had been put through the cost of sales. She then calculated the share of the cost of <span style="font-style:italic">carriage and rebates</span> that sales of single skin and bunded tanks should bear by applying the proportions of sales of each of those tank types to those two costs. She then calculated the share of <span style="font-style:italic">fixed costs</span> included in the cost of sales which ought to be allocated to sales of the two tank types and then added back into gross profit (because they are not costs that would increase with increased sales). She did this by taking the relevant product’s share of the total cost of sales and applying it to the fixed costs. By this process she derived a gross margin of 35% for single skin and 40% for bunded tanks. She then assumed that 75% of tanks would be bunded during the period. With this data, applied to the loss of sales calculated in respect of illustrations 1, 2 and 3, she derived a loss of profit, down to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2005.</p>

Like Miss Hassell he included in addition to the costs of sales <span style="font-style:italic">carriage and rebates</span> as further variable costs. He took a different approach to the calculation of fixed costs, which was to take the standard costing for a SL 1250 tank - Schedule E 16 -  which had a figure for overhead costs included in it. He then derived from Exhibit 12 to Hassell 1 what percentage of Balmoral Tanks’ factory overheads was variable (54.93%): Schedule E 17. He applied that percentage to the overhead costs in the standard costing. He thus established the variable (84.27%) and fixed (15.73%) proportions of costs of sales. The result of his exercise was to show a rate of gross profit ranging from 27% to 44%<span style="font-weight:bold">:</span> Schedule E 11. By the time of his supplemental report he had, in consequence of discussions with Miss Hassell, made further revisions to his calculation of the fixed element of the cost of sales by using the percentages of fixed costs which had formed the assumptions upon which the cost of replacement tanks had been agreed in the Joint Statement (“the new percentages” e.g. Rent 100%; Salaries – 67%; Fuel 20 %): Jensen 2 Schedule E 16.This produced different and higher profit margins: see Jensen, Schedule E1.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In her second report Miss Hassell employed a similar methodology. First she updated Exhibit 12 to her first report which had allocated factory overheads between fixed and variable costs, but, now using the new percentages. This suggested that 38.12% of the costs included in the <span style="font-style:italic">factory overhead</span> were variable (the figure used in Jensen 2 Schedule E 16).   She then took Mr Jensen’s summary of the SL 1250 tank production, updated with the 38.12% figure,  and produced the result that 21.61% of <span style="font-style:italic">total manufacturing costs</span> were fixed. She then used this figure as the fixed cost adjustment to be added back to the gross profit, thus deducing a gross profit margin for each of the years 2002/3 to 2004/5 for single and bunded tanks. I call this “Method A”. </p>

From that she derived the percentage of fixed costs of total costs of sales and applied those percentages to the cost of sales of single skin and bunded tanks. That enabled her to calculate an adjusted cost of sales (Cost of Sales plus additional variable costs i.e. carriage and rebates less fixed cost adjustment) and thus produce a gross profit margin.

Miss Hassell accordingly took the higher margins for 2002/3, the average of the estimates for 2003/4, and the 2004/5 figure, producing  gross margins as follows:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment it is appropriate to use Mr Jensen’s method of calculating the loss of profit down to December 2001. I do not regard it as established that Balmoral’s reduction in turnover in the nine months up to September 2001 is attributable to the cracking problem. Until mid 2001 the volume of complaints was relatively small (just over 100 to the end of June) , and even in 2001 was markedly less than in 2002 – 2004; further the effect of a rising ride of complaints would take time to have an effect on sales. There were, moreover, other factors operating to reduce sales (e.g. increased competition, pulling out of Ireland, and loss of a sales manager). In those circumstances damages should be calculated by reference to the period September to December 2001. It seems to me reasonable to assume that, but for the cracking problem, the sales for that period would bear the same relationship to the sales for the same period in 2000 as the sales in the period January to August 2001 bore to those in that period in 2000.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For this period I propose to take an average of <span style="font-style:italic">fuel tank sales</span> alone, and not of the whole rotomoulding business, because I am not persuaded that Balmoral could not have achieved both greater sales of fuel tanks and also the increase it did achieve in sales of other tanks. To take the average of sales in the three years up to and including 2001 reflects the fact (a) that 2001 sales of fuel tanks were down for reasons that probably had little to do with Balmoral’s tank cracking problems, and (b) that one year is not necessarily representative. A year in which relevant turnover decreases by over 9% before the cracking problem has any significant impact may be not only unrepresentative but rogue, in that, but for that problem, fuel tank sales would have resumed their upwards 10% a year increase. Or it may be a sign of further deterioration or stagnation to come. In those circumstances I think that the least unsatisfactory basis for estimating Balmoral’s loss of profits on account of the cracking problem is to take the shortfall between Balmoral’s fuel tank sales turnover and the average turnover for the three years ending with 2001 (estimated in relation to September to December). That shortfall, at any rate, seems to me properly attributable to the effect on Balmoral’s  reputation of the cracking problems.  However, the base figure of projected fuel tank sales of £3,391,255 should be index linked to allow for inflation.</p>

Mr Jensen’s method, as explained in paragraph 546 above, appears to me artificially to fix the ratio of single skin to bunded tanks by reference to the ratio that existed in 2000, when the reality is that bunded tanks took a higher portion of turnover in later years. This may, in part, have been due to the impact of the cracking problem on Balmoral’s sales of single skin tanks. But, even without the problem, the proportion of turnover attributable to bunded tanks would surely have increased. Mr Jensen’s calculations produce the result that for 2004 and the first three months of 2005 the proportion of lost sales attributed to bunded tanks is 1%. Although there is evidence that some distributors were prepared to buy bunded but not single skin tanks from Balmoral, (e.g. Mr Glass), some were not prepared to purchase tanks  at all (e.g. Mr Mackie). It is not sensible to assume that there was practically no loss of bunded sales in 2004 when some distributors ceased buying bunded tanks from Balmoral. In my judgment the appropriate course, for want of any more reliable figure, is to take the ratios of the value of single to bunded tank sales contained in the table at 11.14.2 of Hassell 2 viz:</p>

The £570 figure is agreed. The critical question therefore, is whether the illustrated failure rates represent the likely incidence of failure. The calculation in the table assumes no deferrals. If Balmoral is able to apply its warranty terms as it has done historically, without end users returning to Balmoral later, then Miss Hassell would value 5% of the failures at the lower, agreed, rate of £49. That rate assumes that the current policy of requiring the end user to pay for a survey does not continue to apply. This would produce a claim of £11,983,219 (see Hassell 2 paragraph 7.2.5). 5% was the historical rate of deferrals to March 2005. The rate for 2004 was about 7.75%. Miss Hassell took 5% on the ground that the 7.75% rate reflected the tougher line policy which she thought would probably not be maintainable. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to these points Balmoral observes the following. Firstly, the reduction of  predicted against actual failure rates in 2005, applicable as it is to most materials and years of manufacture, and, in particular to MFR 6, must be attributable to some factor independent of the material, of which the MFR 6 change outs and the 50% fill policy for those tanks (which, if followed, would reduce the stress to close to nil) are the obvious candidates<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="207">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Consistently with this proposition the MFR 6 2000 failure rates show a decline in 2004 (but the MFR 6 2001 do not). There are other candidates – e.g. weather trends.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Secondly the difference in the figures is little more than a rounding exercise or a degree of estimation. Thirdly, Mr Clements’ revised opinion was, none the less, that some models of MFR 6 tank would fail as to 100% within the ten year period. Fourthly,  Mr Mawrey contended that the probable result of an adverse judgment to the effect that borecene was not suitable for making oil tanks and that as a result tanks, particularly those made from MFR 6 borecene, had failed in large numbers, would be that Balmoral would have to replace all MFR 6 tanks. It was most unlikely that tank owners would be content merely to continue to adopt the 50% fill policy (or oil suppliers prepared to do so); and likely that the Environment Agency would put pressure on Balmoral to change out all MFR 6 tanks. In that context 33% was a cautious estimate for MFR 4 tanks; and 25 % was a reasonable estimate for MFR 3 tanks. Mr Joyce’s fear is that the attitude of the authorities may extend to all tanks made from all grades of borecene, although such a policy would seem to me to be open to a charge of irrationality, having regard to the very low incidence of  failure in some designs (some lower than the average failure of ZN materials).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jensen offers two approaches for projecting future failure. Approach 1 bases future failures on the most recent trend<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span> The exercise is essentially as follows. Firstly he calculated the <span style="font-style:italic">expected tank failures</span> in respect of each year of production (1997 – 2002) for such of the years 1997 to 2012 as were applicable in the case of a ten year guarantee: see Schedule A 16.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="208">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF 1/137</p>
	      </authorialNote> He did that by applying the failure percentages for each year from production that went to make up the 2.96 % underlying rate. Then he took, for each year of production from 1997 -2002 the <span style="font-style:italic">actual failures </span>down to <span style="text-decoration:underline">2004:</span> Schedule A 19<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="209">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF 1/140</p>
	      </authorialNote>.   In respect of <span style="text-decoration:underline">2005</span> he took – Schedule A 17 <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="210">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF1/138</p>
	      </authorialNote> – the known complaints down to September 2005 and added a pro rata estimate for the last three months of 2005, thus producing a total of complaints for 2005 in respect of each year of production. In respect of the period from <span style="text-decoration:underline">2006 to 2012</span> he forecast failure rates by assuming that over those years’ failures would reduce in respect of tanks from each year of production by a percentage that was related to the last known trend of reduction for that year of production. Thus in respect of 1997 production the reduction in complaints from 2004 to 2005 (from year 7 to year 8) was 54%. So he assumed that complaints in 2006 would be 54% less than in 2005. He, also, assumed that failures in 2007 would be 54% less than what they were in 2006.  This was, I assume, because he had no data in respect of reductions from Year 8 – 9. In respect of 1998 production he assumed that the reduction for 2006 (years 7-8) would be 8%. That was the average of the rates of reduction from years 7-8 in the number of complaints in respect of production of 1997 and 1998. In respect of the reduction in 2007 and 2008 (years 8-9 and 9 – 10) he again used the 54% figure. The workings can be found at Appendix 18 <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="211">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF 1/139</p>
	      </authorialNote> – calculation of percent change each year; and Appendix 20 <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="212">

		<p class="FootnoteText"> DF 1/130. Some of the figures in Appendix 13 said to be derived from Appendices 17 and 20 have been adjusted on a basis that is not clear to me.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.The actual and forecasted figures then have the projected failure rates deducted so as to produce an excess i.e. the number of failures attributable to borecene.

Under this approach Mr Jensen takes, in respect of each year of production the average of the complaints for the three years 2003, 2004 and 2005 and assumes that the same number of complaints will arise in succeeding years. For the last year from production (year 11) he takes 50% of the average to reflect the fact that tanks will have been purchased throughout the year of production and the warranty will expire on dates throughout that year.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the appropriate course is to take Mr Jensen’s second approach. Here again, this seems to me the least unsatisfactory option. The assumption that underpins Miss Hassell’s approach is neither self evident nor supported by any cogent evidence.  In relation to the latest years (2002, 2001, 2000) the number of data points for actual failures is small so that the assumption rests on a very slender base.  If tanks made from MFR 6 are prone to fail in early or relatively early life, as the “<span style="font-style:italic">Failure rate by material by age of tank</span>” graph at paragraph 2.9.1 of Miss Hassell’s third report tends to suggest, Miss Hassell’s calculation will greatly overstate the total failures for the 10 year warranty period. As it is it produces very sizeable figures (over 5,500 tanks per year in the case of 2008 – 2010: see paragraph 5.88 of Jensen 1).  The calculation also assumes that the downward trend of failures in 2005 does not signify any continued dip or flattening out in failures, but rather that failures, despite what happened in 2005, will continue at such a rate as will achieve the large totals set out in the table at paragraph 551 above. The dip is predominantly attributed to the MFR 6 change out and 50% fill policy. Whilst those are likely to have reduced the number of emergency change outs, it does not follow that they were the only contributor to that reduction. I note, also, that in 2004 (when the policy was in effect) the number of MFR 6 2001failures increased.</p>

Accordingly, by my calculations, Balmoral’s loss is:</p>

In her first report she suggested that those costs would continue at the 2004 level until 2010 and would then fall so as to reach zero in 2013, so that 67% of the figure was charged for 2011 and 33% for 2012.</p>

Under the first, he takes the calculation of future excess failures on a declining trends basis and then assumes that costs would reduce on the same basis as the change in annual complaint activity Thus in 2004 the number of excess failures was 2,247. In 2005 the number of excess failures was 1,665, which is 74.09% of 2,247. Mr Jensen took the amount of costs calculated for 2004 and estimated that those for 2005 would be 74.09% of those for 2004. In relation to future IT costs he calculated amounts for 2006 and 2009 only, on the footing that computer equipment only requires replacing every three years. Under the second basis he takes the calculation of future excess failures on a mean basis, and then makes the same assumption as in the calculation on the declining trends basis.  </p>

A decision that the cracking arose because borecene was unfit for purpose may reduce the degree of opprobrium suffered by Balmoral but cannot wholly erase the effect on their reputation. The evidence of Mr Joyce indicates the considerable extent to which that reputation has suffered because of the cracking problem with end users, distributors, and public authorities. I regard it as unrealistic to assume that the continuing effect of that will disappear when this judgment is delivered. Distributors who have left Balmoral may well be difficult to woo back. At the same time I see no reason why the period over which the effect on Balmoral’s reputation should be expected to continue is until the end of 2011. In my judgment a fair assessment of Balmoral’s loss would be to take the figure for loss of profit for 2005, as calculated on the basis set out above, as the loss of profit for 2006 and reduce it on a straight line basis so as to expire at the end of 2008 i.e. so that the loss for 2007 is 2/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>s and for 2008 1/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>.</p>

The complication of the exercise is such that I recognise that there may be refinements in my calculations that need to be addressed.</p>

Such reports must (a) append what they say they append; (b) identify clearly and accurately the facts upon which they are based; (c) state clearly and prominently any key points of disagreement with the opposing side; and (d) include reference to facts known to the expert which have, or may have, a significant bearing on the issue, even if unfavourable to his clients’ cause. They must also be as concise as possible.</p>

Appendix 3 contained curves which apparently supported figure 5 when they did not. Neither the report nor the appendices revealed that the data in appendix 3 related to unsoaked samples. The data in support of figure 3, and the expansion of it on page 302 of the second report, was not contained in either report or its appendices. The contention that unsoaked samples were unreliable did not feature in the reports at all. Nor was any reference of any kind made to the fact that Mr Clements had, albeit with a qualification (considerably weaker than his later assertion as to the unreliability of unsoaked data), used unsoaked data in the Deso action which pointed in a different direction to what he was saying in this action. I appreciate that Mr Clements may have felt under some restriction in referring to the Deso material; but I do not think he was justified in omitting any reference to it.</p>

Having heard Mr Clements, I am satisfied that the omission was not deliberate.  But his reports should not have contained the flaws that I have identified. </p>

But what was later said to be the most significant article - “<span style="font-style:italic">The Critical Molecular Weight for Resisting Slow Crack Growth in a Polyethylene”</span> was neither referred to in his reports nor attached to them. The documents he handed in at the beginning of his evidence, whilst in part merely illustrative, also referred to Mc, said to be of great importance but entirely unheralded.  Mc was said to have been introduced only in response to the cross examination of Mr Clements, but, if it had the significance sought to be attached to it, I am surprised that it was not referred to before.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The reports of the forensic accountants were inordinately large. The volume of Mr Jensen’s reports and, in particular their labyrinthine attachments, was such that I found them at times bewildering, with one schedule referring to several other schedules often without any clear guide in the body of the report as to which conclusion the several attachments were designed to support and how. It was only with difficulty, and after considerable questioning on my part, that I found it possible to identify what calculations in the appendices supported the propositions in the text. The appendices, as well as being enormous, had references (e.g. <span style="font-size:9pt">“Tab E1”</span>) in such small font or so faintly photocopied as to make it difficult to discern which attachment was which, not least because the tabs had been removed from the copy for the Court (but not that for Counsel). Swathes of the appendices had no apparent relevance or one which could only be discerned by a process of forensic archaeology. I should record, however, that, after the conclusion of the evidence, Mr Jensen helpfully supplied me with a copy of his first report in which his monetary assessments were annotated to the Trial Bundles.</p>
