	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to the schemes was the UK Government’s desire to encourage investment in information and communication technology (“ICT”) following the dot.com crash in the early 2000’s.  To that end generous first year capital allowances for income and capital gains tax purposes were allowed on the acquisition of ICT with a view to its exploitation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">These schemes (“the Innovator Schemes”) were devised with a view to taking maximum advantage of the available tax benefits.  There were a number of other ICT tax investment schemes which were introduced at this time.  Many had similar features to earlier schemes which had sought to take advantage of the tax benefits of investing in films.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The marketing of each Innovator Scheme involved the issue of an Information Memorandum (“IM”) inviting investors to submit applications and (in most cases) subscription monies so as to become partners of a Partnership formed as a vehicle to carry on a trade, consisting of the acquisition and exploitation of rights to ICT. 16 of the 19 Innovator Schemes which are the subject of the litigation were limited liability partnerships (“LLPs”), and 3 were general partnerships (“GPs”).</p>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">: it was anticipated that each partner could claim tax relief by way of first-year capital allowance for both income and capital gains tax purposes in respect of his or her share of the loss generated by the Partnership. This loss was caused by the Partnership’s ability to write off the capital cost of acquiring the Technology at 100% First Year Allowances;</span>

However, this risk was managed by an arrangement whereby the 80% loan, when paid as part of the purchase price for the Technology, was placed by the Technology Vendor back on deposit with the lender effectively as security.  In the event that the Technology was successfully exploited then the loan would be repaid and the bank would release similar amounts back to the Technology Vendor. If the Technology was not successful then the loan would be repaid after three years unless alternative arrangements were subsequently made.  In such circumstances the protection envisaged for the partners was that there would be an agreement to hive the Partnership’s assets and liabilities down to a limited company or a debt for equity swap with the Vendor.</p>

This form of circular movement of monies was a common feature of tax schemes at the time.

In that case the Supreme Court, reversing the decisions of the courts below, held that the circular nature of the loan meant that there had not in any meaningful sense been an incurring of expenditure of the borrowed money on the acquisition of software rights, but rather that it had gone in a loop to enable the LLPs to indulge in a tax avoidance scheme.</p>

However, in July 2003 the Special Investigations Section of the IR (led by Mr Peter Frost) began investigating the Schemes.  In the course of 2004 there were various meetings with the IR.  The IR challenged the Schemes, essentially on the basis that they were not satisfied with the commerciality of the Schemes, it being a requirement of tax relief that the trade be carried on on a commercial basis with a view to realising profits within a reasonable time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The IR was prepared to settle the matter on the basis that the tax relief would only be available in relation to the capital contribution made by each partner rather than the grossed up amount of the investment.  Instead of receiving tax relief representing 200% of the capital contribution the partners would now only receive tax relief representing 40% of that capital contribution.  A capital contribution of £20,000 would therefore yield relief of £8,000 rather than the £40,000 anticipated and in many cases received.  Most partners in the Partnerships decided to accept the IR’s offer on the basis that, on advice, it was the best they were likely to achieve.</p>

This was all the more so given that many of them had received and spent the tax relief and now faced the prospect of having to find funds to repay the IR and of interest and penalty charges if this was not done.  Their grievances were heightened by the IR’s criticisms of the lack of commerciality of the Schemes and the fact that none of the Technologies had been successfully exploited.  They were heightened still further by the discovery that it appeared that the architect of and the driving force behind the Schemes was Mr Bjorn Stiedl, who in November 2004 was convicted at Southwark Crown Court of pension fraud, for which he was subsequently imprisoned.</p>

It was concerned with alleged duties owed to the subscribers themselves and the existence of those duties was very much in issue.

This restricted the amount of recoverable sideways relief in the case of “non active” members of a Partnership. In effect, this amendment restricted the available relief to the amount contributed by the member, rather than to that member’s liability upon a winding up of the Partnership. ICTA 1988 sections 118ZE to 118ZK were introduced by section 124(1) of Finance Act 2004 with effect from 22 July 2004. ICTA 1988 section 118ZE applied to basis periods ending on or after 10 February 2004 (subject to certain transitional measures for periods which straddled this date – see s. 118ZJ).</p>

He identified the importance, for the purpose of obtaining sideways relief (as distinct from eligibility under CAA 2001 s 45), of the trade being “carried on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits in the trade”.  He noted the proposed purchase price of the Technology (referred to as “IP”). He stated that while he was not in position to comment on it, the price was relevant to the availability of sideways relief.  He also advised that it was essential that the costs of acquisition should qualify for capital allowances and that the IP be purchased for a lump sum (proposed to be £10m) made on or before 31 March 2003.</p>

His revised view was that, where the AA in question was silent as to payment date, s. 5(5) did not apply so as to treat payment made more than 4 months after the date of the agreement as made on the date of payment.  Rather in such cases, s. 5(1) applied so as to treat the expenditure as incurred “as soon as there was an unconditional obligation to pay it”.   Thus, on this view, there was such an obligation “as soon as the relative Acquisition Agreement was entered into, the obligation to buy (and, hence, to pay).”  </p>

In relation to Chapter X of FSMA CISs Mr Crystal stated that Chapter X was inapplicable “due to the partners having day to day control over the management of the property”.  </p>

It also records the FSA as having concluded that the appointment of Ogier since January 2005 had not resulted in the regulatory position of the Partnerships being acceptable under FSMA: “It seems that Ogier are effectively an outsourced resource to whom certain administrative and compliance functions have been delegated and therefore they are not the operators, or at least not the sole operators, of the LLPs.  The operation of the LLPs therefore remains with the LLPs themselves or the person who is actually responsible for that operation”.

Further, at all times both the LLP and Ellsburg acted on the basis that there was a valid AA between them on the terms set out in the 9 December 2002 AA.

He was emailed by Mr Stiedl on 8 April 2003 who noted that: “I believe Paul has forwarded you the first 9 schedules earlier today” and providing the last schedule, for Gentech 1. He continued: “You will note that we have 110 partners”. The Claimants submitted that the likelihood is that that was a reference to the schedules of names attached to the D/A. The Claimants also relied upon a diary entry created on 4 April 2003 but for an appointment, in Mr Roper’s diary, on 9 April 2003, entitled “sign off on Tech Partnerships”.  It was submitted that the likelihood is that this referred to the signing off of the D/As.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence of Mr Roper was that this correspondence and meeting related to banking documents and the need to sign Board Minutes by which the LLPs approved the entering into of the banking documents, such as the Term Loan Facility.  This evidence was supported by the Board Minutes themselves, a number of which were signed between 9am and shortly after 10am on 9 April 2003. That this was the subject matter of the 9 April meeting was borne out by a number of other matters.  In particular:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.88in">Mr Roper, who had only become substantively involved in the Innovator Schemes in March 2003, was involved in the bank financing, not the process by which new members adhered to the LLP. From his point of view, it is entirely plausible that the reference to a “sign off on Tech Partnership” would be to the financing transactions, not the D/As. The Board Minutes do indeed represent the “sign off” of the various Innovator LLPs on the financing transactions, as they provide the relevant approval for the LLPs to enter into those transactions.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.83in">(2) Mr Carter confirmed in evidence that he was acting as attorney on behalf of the members and the Board Minutes are each executed by Mr Carter acting as “attorney for the remaining members of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of his appointment.” One would expect that the LLP which is to approve the entry into the bank financing documents would be an LLP which the relevant investors were partners of (rather than one which merely had the founding “Innovator” partners as members), which would require the D/As to have already been executed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">It is apparent, however, that the subscription applications were for applicants who had made earlier applications to other Schemes which were being “replaced and superceded” by those for YTC.  In each case the original application to invest in an Innovator Scheme was therefore made well before 4 April 2003 and I accept Mr Carter’s evidence that the likely explanation is that the investments were transferred to the YTC Scheme when the other Scheme became over-subscribed on or before 4 April 2003 and that the replacement paperwork was only completed at a later stage.  </p>

Mr Carter’s evidence was that Innovator stopped bringing in new business after 26 March 2003 (the date of the Ministerial Statement) and hence they had plenty of time to transfer partners between Partnerships to ensure all Schemes were fully subscribed.  I accept that evidence.</p>

However, the explanation for that is that Mr Roper mistakenly re-forwarded an old email to DWS which attached a list of members. That email was dated 14 March 2003, and thus the list of members as it appeared at that date contained fewer members than the D/A which was subsequently executed on 4 April 2003.</p>

I felt no uneasiness when signing, but I do remember a feeling of triumph it had been done.”  Mr Carter’s evidence was similarly that there was a long signing session and that it took place on 4 April 2003.

I reject the unrealistic submission that it limited the liability of the LLP to Ellsburg to 20% of the agreed price.  Although one can see how this argument arises from a literal consideration of the wording of the agreement divorced from its context, when considered against the background of the Scheme arrangements and the existing agreements it is clear that it was addressing only the non-bank loan element of the purchase price.  The bank loan was integral to the Scheme arrangements and was an important part of the potential benefit to Ellsburg.  There was never an intention to remove the responsibility to pay the full consideration to Ellsburg and the parties continued to act on the basis that there would be a bank loan and deposit of the security amount as set out in the AA, as indeed thereafter happened.</p>

Nor would references in the exchanges to them being “subject to contract” or “without prejudice” alter the position if in fact there already was a binding agreement.  Further, even if there is an inconsistency the more compelling evidence is to be found in the documents signed by Mr Lewis himself acknowledging the earlier making of the agreements. </p>

However, the fact that the final terms of that agreement had not been determined does not mean that there was not an already binding sale agreement. In any event none of these documents bear directly on the First Global/Etrino AA. Mr Lewis was not involved in the execution of this agreement and had no direct knowledge of its execution. If an already binding offshore sale had been made, or was believed to have been made, there is no reason why the onshore sale should not have been made on 24 March 2003.

AAs and Guarantee Agreements were sent by email by Ms Lone Christensen to Ms Laura Mouck of Covington by email on 24 March 2003. The change to split the guarantee from the remainder of the AA had therefore already occurred before the Ministerial Statement of 26 March 2003, let alone the 10 April 2003.</p>

It follows that these two agreements are the same agreements that were sent by Fedex to Innovator by Covington on 25 March 2003. Moreover, every page of these agreements is initialled by Ms Nicola Mouck, including page 3 which states that the Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price no later than <span style="text-decoration:underline">1 July 2003</span>. This shows that the Optibet AA that was returned by Fedex on 25 March 2003 did contain the date of 1 July 2003 for final payment and not 31 July 2003.  I accordingly find that the Optibet AA sent to Covington on 24 March 2003 contained the date of 1 July 2003 for payment of the final purchase price.</p>

The fact that the deed may not have been delivered until 25 March 2003 but is dated 24 March 2003 is of no significance. A deed takes effect from delivery and does not necessarily need to be dated - see <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000;background-color:FFFFFF">Goddard's Case</span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:FFFFFF"> (1584) 2 Co Rep. 4b.</span></p>

On that basis, as there are no formalities required for an AA, even if the Claimants were correct in their assertions, the Optibet AA was entered into before the Ministerial Statement and thus could be used as a Golden Contract, it having the date for final payment of 1 July 2003.</p>

The difference was unintentional.  Such a Partnership was incorporated on 30 September 2003 under Partnership number OC305678. On the same day the name of the “Charit dash” LLP was changed to The Innovator “K” Partnership LLP”.  The only Charit named LLP in existence thereafter (until July 2004) was accordingly “Charit gap”.</p>

Again, each of the Board minutes proceeds on the basis that Mr Carter is acting as attorney for the “remaining Members of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of his appointment” which presupposes that the D/A was executed on a date prior to that on which the relevant Board meetings took place.  </p>

Independently of the D/A, Mr Roper required such information for the purpose of the work that he was conducting concerning the bank financing documentation.

The fact that some investors had been made members of LLP did not preclude further investors being joined to the same LLP at a subsequent date (as happened in the case of Agent Mole in respect of the Generation 1 Schemes).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that the most likely explanation is that the Charit LLP Deed was, as Mr Carter stated, executed on or about 30 September 2003. The documentary evidence clearly establishes that the Deed was sent out by Mr Roper for signature on 24 September 2003. The amendments that subsequently appear to have been made to that document on or before 9 December 2003, whether by Innovator or CB, as set out were minor, and it is likely that, by way of what Mr Carter termed a “short cut”, these amendments were incorporated into the Deed by means of replacement pages which were amended and saved, either by Innovator or someone at CB, on 9 December 2003.  Whilst that means that the final version of the LLP Deed was not executed until that date, it does not involve backdating. The LLP Deed was executed and signed on 30 September 2003, albeit that it appears to have been amended at a later date and not re-executed.</p>

Whilst it was put to Mr Roper that the Charit LLP Deed had been backdated, it was not suggested to Mr Roper that he was either contemporaneously aware of this or complicit in any backdating. Finally, there was no suggestion that there was any particular reason for back dating the Charit LLP Deed. </p>

The letter, sent by courier, enclosed the majority of the documentation requested. In respect of three categories of documents, however, Ms Christensen stated: “As you have the originals, could you please date them.

In other words she was checking to ensure that they were dated; not giving some instruction to do so (which would not be her function anyway).</p>

It was suggested that the inference to be drawn is that this was added in order to accommodate the resignation of Baker Tilly from other Innovator LLPs and its withdrawal from its involvement in the Schemes in March 2004.  Whilst, Mr Carter’s manuscript amendment is likely to have been made after Baker Tilly’s resignation that is no reason for supposing that the rest of the Deed itself was executed then.  As Mr Carter explained, the Arte LLP was incorporated on 27 November 2004 and it would have made absolute sense to execute the LLP Deed at the same time.</p>

By letter dated 22 August 2005 Mr Carter sent the AEA to Mr Gebhard and requested that he arrange to have this executed by Artex Solutions Ltd.  It is apparent that the AEA was not finally signed off until this time but it was Mr Carter’s evidence that the date reflected the date upon which the AEA was in place and operational.

The very existence of the agreement can only be inferred from overt acts. Participation in a conspiracy is infinitely variable: it can be active or passive. If the majority shareholder and director of a company consents to the company being used for drug smuggling carried out in the company's name by a fellow director and minority shareholder, he is guilty of conspiracy. Consent, that is agreement or adherence to the agreement, can be inferred if it is proved that he knew what was going on and the intention to participate in the furtherance of the criminal purpose is also established by his failure to stop the unlawful activity.”</p>

In most cases it will be necessary to scrutinise the acts relied upon to see what inferences can be drawn as to the existence or otherwise of the alleged conspiracy or combination, for it will be a rare case in which there will be evidence of the agreement itself: Kuwait at [112].”</p>

On the other hand where, as with YTC, the Technology is aimed at a specific market one would expect it to be possible to make investigations of that market and of the potential appeal of the Technology in that market.

The likely outcome of any such due diligence would be to support a wide range of income projections, and the projections actually produced are unlikely to have been outside that range.

Software development did not reach an end point, it was an ongoing process.  Further, where problems existed, Mr Gray confirmed that it would normally take only a few days at £250 per day to fix them.  Mr McCallum explained in evidence that it was conventional within the industry to describe technology in the present tense even though it was still in development. Mr Gates stated that if the Business Plan was commercially sound, problems with the source code could always be fixed.</p>

Further, as Mr Honeywell accepted, if one sells something for cash, as opposed to on deferred payment terms or with other restrictions, one would expect a lower price and he agreed that a deposit arrangement would inevitably inflate the price. He also accepted that the negotiations would have been predicated on the informal understanding that the Vendor may not get his 80% back.

The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax: see </span>

Taking the Etrino IM by way of example, Innovator’s stated objective was to “advise and administer” the Partnership.  To that end Innovator was stated to have engaged “Technology Advisers”, a “Technology Valuer”, Collyer Bristow as “its legal advisers”, Pridie Brewster to advise it “in relation to auditing and tax planning” and leading counsel to confirm the tax assumptions.  It was Innovator which was to be responsible for the payment of those fees and for the application of subscription monies for the purposes set out in the IM.  This was to be done from the fee payable to Innovator as set out in the contractual documentation, which was not expected to exceed 11%.</p>

One cannot make acceptance conditional on an event that lies in the future at the time for acceptance.  However, the Claimants clarified their case as being that that “all other things being equal the structure of the scheme arrangements is such as at the time that the offer is both made and purportedly accepted that relief in the proportions and amounts set out in the IM was capable of being obtained. To put it another way, the tax relief condition is only fulfilled if, as at the time of purported acceptance of the subscription offer, there are no defects in the scheme arrangements which would imperil (in the sense of changing the risk profile or prospects of obtaining relief) or remove the entitlement to relief as set out in the IM.”  This is not how the claim is pleaded and it is important that any condition of the acceptance of an offer is made clear.</p>

In the present case it is not clear that there are any conditions at all, still less conditions in the terms contended for by the Claimants.  Further, in order to decide whether the conditions were met would in almost every case involve difficult issues of judgment.

It is clear on the evidence that neither Mr Bailey nor Mr Roper, still less Mr Carter or Mr Gates, was aware of the IM Conditions.  Although such knowledge was asserted in the Claimants’ pleaded case, it was faintly put, if at all, to these witnesses.  To the extent that it was put it was certainly not made out.</p>

Moreover, the possibility of other rights of recourse or limitations on authority in such cases was not considered when addressing the more extreme examples.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is borne out by the Definitions section upon which the Claimants placed so much reliance.

It is the Partnership which was formed for this purpose that the subscribers were to be entered into, not a Partnership with a particular name which could not carry out that trade, still less one which did not even exist.  </p>

Further, the implication of such conditions would put the P/A donee in an impossible position.  His authority would depend on unstated terms of which he was not aware, nor should he reasonably have been so aware.  Even if he had been so aware the ambiguity of and uncertainty surrounding most of the alleged terms would render the P/A unworkable.</p>

I am not satisfied that it is open to the Claimants to advance any wider case in closing.  Further, the backdating amendment application made during the course of the trial proceeded on the basis that backdating was relevant to the issues of dishonest assistance and conspiracy to defraud.  Nor does GS13, which was the subject matter of the amendment application, make any reference to authority issues in either its unamended or its amended form.  In my judgment it would be unfair to allow the Claimants to introduce in closing a wider authority case which had not been clearly pleaded and put.  </p>

This duly occurred but a mistake was made in the naming of the new LLP and it was incorporated as Charit gap rather than Charit dash.

This suggested that a loan was in place and the issue was whether Fairbairn would take it over. When Mr Carter wrote in October 2006 the position was still not made clear.

The letter of October 2006 states that “no loans were ever drawn down”.  The letter explained that in the light of the IR’s attitude it was recommended that the loan not be drawn down and to “amend the tax return previously prepared”.  That recommendation was then voted on.  The amendment of the tax return would reasonably be understood as removing the reference to any loan element in the light of the non drawdown of the loan.  Further, if there had been a bank loan subscribers would reasonably expect to have knowledge of it, even if it had been arranged by Innovator, since it was being made to them personally, not the LLP. In all the circumstances I am satisfied on the evidence as a whole that the Arte subscribers did have knowledge of the fact that there had been no personal bank loan.  </p>

For example, a statement which is literally true may nevertheless involve a misrepresentation because of matters which the representor omits to mention.  The old cases about statements made in a company prospectus contain illustrations of this principle – for example, Oakes v Turquand (1867) LR 2 HL 325, where Lord Chelmsford said (at 342-3):</p>

That involves considering whether a reasonable representee in the position and with the known characteristics of the actual representee would reasonably have understood that an implied representation was being made and being made substantially in the terms or to the effect alleged.  </p>

A person cannot make a fraudulent statement unless he is aware that he is making that statement.  To establish liability in deceit it is necessary “to show that the representor intended his statement to be understood by the representee in the sense in which it was false” – per Morritt LJ in Goose v Wilson Sandford &amp; Co. [2001] Lloyd’s Rep PN 189 at para. 41.  In other cases of misrepresentation this is not a requirement, but one would generally expect it to be reasonably apparent to both representor and representee that the implied representation alleged was being made.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">222.<marker name="tab"/>It is necessary for the statement relied on to have the character of a statement upon which the representee was intended, and entitled, to rely. In some cases, for example, the statement in question may have been accompanied by other statements by way of qualification or explanation which would indicate to a reasonable person that the putative representor was not assuming a responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statement or was saying that no reliance can be placed upon it. Thus the representor may qualify what might otherwise have been an outright statement of fact by saying that it is only a statement of belief, that it may not be accurate, that he has not verified its accuracy or completeness, or that it is not to be relied on: Raiffeisen, supra, at [86]. </p>

As further observed in Raiffeisen, at [87], the claimant must show that he in fact understood the statement in the sense (so far as material) which the court ascribes to it; and that, having that understanding, he relied on it. Analytically, this is probably not a separate requirement of a misrepresentation claim but rather is part of what the claimant needs to show in order to prove inducement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.18in">“First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states. To prevent a false statement from being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth.”</p>

Nor is the defendant’s motive in making the representation relevant: “If fraud be established it is immaterial that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the false statement was made.” - Clerk &amp; Lindsell, para 18-20, quoting Bradford Third Benefit Building Society v Borders [1941] 2 All ER 205, 211 per Viscount Maugham; and see also Derry v Peek, supra, at 409. What is required is dishonest knowledge, in the sense of an absence of belief in truth - The Kriti Palm, supra, para 257 (Rix LJ); and see also para 258, quoting Armstrong v Strain [1951] TLR 856, 871, per Devlin J (“When Judges say, therefore, that wickedness and dishonesty must be present, they are not requiring a new ingredient for the tort of deceit so much as describing the sort of knowledge that its necessary”).</p>

However, the unreasonableness of the grounds of the belief, though not of itself supporting an action for deceit, will be evidence from which fraud may be inferred.  As Lord Herschell pointed out in Derry v Peek, supra, at 376, there must be many cases: “where the fact that an alleged belief was destitute of all reasonable foundation would suffice of itself to convince the court that it was not really entertained, and that the representation was a fraudulent one.”</p>

However, the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established - The Kriti Palm, supra, para 259, quoting Lord Nicholls in re H (Minors) [1996] AC 563, 586.”</p>

Nothing could be clearer than that GSI were not assuming any responsibility to the participants: Hedley Byrne v Heller &amp; Partners [1964] A.C. 465. The foundation for liability for negligent misstatements demonstrates that where the terms on which someone is prepared to give advice or make a statement negatives any assumption of responsibility, no duty of care will be owed. Although there might be cases where the law would impose a duty by virtue of a particular state of facts despite an attempt not “to assume responsibility” the relationship between GSI either as arranger or as vendor would not be one of them. I entirely agree with the judge on this aspect.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.38in">(1) The alleged “deadlines representation” does not appear in the IMs and no such representation falls to be implied.  At the time the IMs were promulgated, the relevant tax deadlines were a considerable distance in the future, and they remained in the future when the subscribers made their irrevocable subscription applications and (given that no D/A was backdated into the prior tax year) when they were made partners.   In any event, the tax deadlines were complied with and so there could be no misrepresentation.  </p>

A statement as to what “would” happen is a statement as to the future.  The Claimants recast their pleaded case as one relating to the capability of tax relief being obtained.  There is no express statement of capability made in the IM.  There is a statement that the “Partnership is constructed in such a way as to allow Partners to take advantage of the tax reliefs available” but that needs to be read together with all the other statements in the IM relating to tax relief which collectively make it clear that such statements are at most statements of expectation, belief or opinion.</p>

There is therefore no basis for implying any such representation.  Whilst the IM may have represented that such expenditure would be incurred that is not a statement of present fact but is rather a statement of expectation, belief or intention.  Although it was not pleaded the Claimants sought to recast this as a representation of intention.  Even if such case was open to them no such case was clearly put; nor, if it was, was any misrepresentation established.  As was intended, in every case expenditure was incurred on qualifying Technologies, and on Technologies which did exist.</p>

However, as addressed more fully elsewhere, there were such rights.  In so far as the representation is meant to mean that the rights were to Technology exactly as described, that is not what is stated in the IM and it would be unreasonable to expect this or to understand the IM in this way given that the Technology was inevitably going to be developed.

In other IMs the Technology Developer was defined as the owner of the Technology from whom the Technology was being purchased.  Even if such a statement is to be implied the Claimants did not advance a case to the effect that the Technology Developer did not develop Technology rights. In so far as the alleged representation is that to the effect that the Technology was already fully developed, that is not expressly stated.  Further, page 4 of the IMs stated, under the heading ‘Activity’, that the opportunity being offered was for individuals to become members of an LLP involved in the business of acquiring, <span style="text-decoration:underline">developing</span> and commercially exploiting Technology. This shows that the IM contained no representation to the effect that the Technology was fully developed and also that the investors should reasonably have known that the LLP would also be <span style="text-decoration:underline">developin</span>g the Technology. </p>

	    <p class="indent11" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in">17. Second, the mere fact that the payer has paid the money to the recipient for the recipient to use it in a particular way is not of itself enough. The recipient may have represented or warranted that he intends to use it in a particular way or have promised to use it in a particular way. Such an arrangement would give rise to personal obligations but would not of itself necessarily create fiduciary obligations or a trust: Twinsectra at [73]. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">18. So, thirdly, it must be clear from the express terms of the transaction (properly construed) or must be objectively ascertained from the circumstances of the transaction that the mutual intention of payer and recipient (and the essence of their bargain) is that the funds transferred should not be part of the general assets of the recipient but should be used <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">exclusively </span>to effect particular identified payments, so that if the money cannot be so used then it is to be returned to the payer: Toovey v Milne (1819) 2 B&amp;A 683 and <span class="underline1" style="text-decoration:none">Quistclose Investments</span> at 580B. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">19. Fourth, the mechanism by which this is achieved is a trust giving rise to fiduciary obligations on the part of the recipient which a court of equity will enforce: Twinsectra at [69]. Equity intervenes because it is unconscionable for the recipient to obtain money on terms as to its application and then to disregard the terms on which he received it from a payer who had placed trust and confidence in the recipient to ensure the proper application of the money paid: Twinsectra at [76]. </p>

Fifth, such a trust is akin to a “retention of title” clause, enabling the recipient to have recourse to the payer's money for the particular purpose specified but without entrenching on the payer's property rights more than necessary to enable the purpose to be achieved. It is not as such a “purpose” trust of which the recipient is a trustee, the beneficial interest in the money reverting to the payer if the purpose is incapable of achievement. It is a resulting trust in favour of the payer with a mandate granted to the recipient to apply the money paid for the purpose stated. The key feature of the arrangement is that the recipient is precluded from misapplying the money paid to him. The recipient has no beneficial interest in the money: generally the beneficial interest remains vested in the payer subject only to the recipient's power to apply the money in accordance with the stated purpose. If the stated purpose cannot be achieved then the mandate ceases to be effective, the recipient simply holds the money paid on resulting trust for the payer, and the recipient must repay it: Twinsectra at [81], [87], [92] and [100]. </p>

If the properly construed terms upon which (or the objectively ascertained circumstances in which) payer and recipient enter into an arrangement have the effect of creating a trust, then it is not necessary that either payer or recipient should intend to create a trust: it is sufficient that they intend to enter into the relevant arrangement: Twinsectra at [71]. </p>

Further, the implication of such terms would put the trustee in an impossible position.  His fulfilment of the terms of the trust would depend on unstated terms of which he was unlikely to be aware, nor should he reasonably have been so aware.  Even if he had been so aware the ambiguity of and uncertainty surrounding most of the alleged terms would render the trust and the exercise of powers thereunder uncertain and unworkable.</p>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.36in">(3) the IM and subscription application reserved to Innovator (or in the case of GT2 MFS) the right to reject any application at its sole discretion, and stated that excess partners’ contributions would be refunded to partners in proportion to their respective interests in the Partnership.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.36in">(4) The Acknowledgment Letters in which it was stated that the subscriber’s funds would be held in the CB account until the subscriber had become a partner whereupon the Technology would be purchased.  Further, early versions of the letter referred to these being “your funds”.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.36in">(5) Subscribers would reasonably expect to have been entitled to demand the entirety of their subscription monies if Innovator either decided not to proceed, or was unable to proceed, or indeed went into liquidation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.36in">(6) The fees, in order that the entirety of the subscription monies could attract (and could be promoted as attracting) tax relief, were payable by Technology Vendors (and in part by LLPs in the case e.g. of the Administrator’s fees), not Innovator. That is consistent with the notion that monies were held for the exclusive purpose of investing in a Partnership. Once that had occurred, in the sense of the Partnership becoming beneficially entitled to the monies, fees could be discharged in the proper manner.</p>

However, it was an important element of the scheme structure that all the subscription monies were used by the Partnership in the acquisition of the Technology so as to maximise the tax relief available.  As was apparent from the IM and the contractual documentation, this was to be done by using the subscription monies in payment of the acquisition price to the Technology Vendor and the Vendor paying about 11% of the amount received to Innovator so as to enable it to pay all necessary fees and expenses.   The first step envisaged was therefore payment of the purchase price by the Partnership.</p>

Some means had to be found to enable payments to be made which were properly incidental to the Schemes and necessary to their implementation, out of the money subscribed, but which would in due course become costs to be defrayed by Innovator out of the monies it received from the Technology Vendor, (which monies were themselves part of the price paid by the Partnerships).  This was to be done by treating sums applied directly out of the account to the payment of commission, fees or otherwise as advance payments to the Technology Vendor which in turn would make them available to Innovator as an advance on its fee.  Mr Carter’s evidence supported this analysis.</p>

So, if, for example, a payment was made which was authorised by the Technology Vendor as an advance payment by the Partnership of the purchase price and which was then, for example, used to pay fees and expenses due out of Innovator’s fee, that would be a proper payment and involve no breach of trust.</p>

In a case where an interest is settled into a separate settlement, we consider that it is clear that the trustees of that settlement have locus standi to sue the trustees of the head-settlement since the trustees of the head-settlement have duties to the trustees of the separate settlement in their capacity as such. We also consider that it is clear that the beneficiaries of the separate settlement can sue the trustees of the head-settlement for breach of trust if there are special circumstances justifying a derivative action by the beneficiaries against the trustees of the head settlement.

However, the trust property remains held and administered by the trustees of settlement A. In this case if the trustees of settlement A exercise their administrative powers over the trust property in breach of trust, for example they invest in unauthorised investments, then the trustees of settlement B can sue the trustees of settlement A for breach of trust.

Accordingly the Court had to consider whether the IR’s interest had crystallised and concluded that it did.

Although this is not spelt out expressly I am satisfied that it would reasonably be understood as relating to the total capital contribution.  It was clear from the IM that substantial initial and ongoing fees and expenses were going to be incurred which it would be unlikely could be met from 11% of the net cash contribution alone.  This would have been obvious to the IFAs whose own fees alone exceeded 11% of the net figure.  Although the Claimants did not generally know the level of the IFAs commission, they did know that the IFAs would be receiving commission and if the 11% was a net figure it would be apparent that that would leave little for the other substantial fees and expenses that were necessarily going to be incurred.</p>

This is demonstrated by the reconciliations that Mr Carter did in relation to each ledger for each Scheme and the Payment Schedules produced by CB at trial. These show that the entirety of the subscription monies raised were accounted for as received by the relevant Partnership and spent on a combination of bank fees and the acquisition of the Technology.  It was on that basis that the Partnership accounts were filed and each of the partners claimed (and generally received) their tax relief. Importantly, it was also on that basis that they retained the more limited tax relief on their tax contribution that was eventually negotiated with the IR.</p>

Provided the payment was authorised as an advance payment of the purchase price there would not be a breach of trust.  The evidence is that the Technology Vendors gave Innovator authority to direct the management of the funds in order to satisfy the Technology Vendor’s obligations under the financing scheme and that they authorised CB to accept instructions from Innovator as to the disbursement of those funds.  Mr Carter’s evidence was that all payments were made in accordance with the authority conferred, as later reflected in the accounts.  On that basis there would have been no breach of trust.  Even if that be wrong, no recoverable loss was caused thereby.</p>

CB was entitled, on Innovator’s instructions, to disburse those monies to which Innovator was entitled directly to those third parties whom Innovator would have paid from its own account, had the monies followed the above circuitous path. </p>

As the Claimants accepted, non-compliance with FSMA does not found any cause of action for breach of statutory duty.

	      <span style="color:#000000">“The judge stated the law in terms largely derived from the advice of the Board given by Lord Nicholls in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378. In summary, she said that liability for dishonest assistance requires a dishonest state of mind on the part of the person who assists in the breach of trust. Such a state of mind may consist in knowledge that the transaction is one in which he cannot honestly participate (for example, misappropriation of other people’s money), or it may consist in suspicion combined with a conscious decision not to make inquiries which might result in knowledge: see Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v Uni-Polaris Insurance Co Ltd [2003] 1 AC 469. </span>

But they do not consider that this is what Lord Hutton meant. The reference to ‘what he knows would offend normally accepted standards of honest conduct’ meant only that his knowledge of the transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct.

The principal authorities are the decisions of the Privy Council in Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378, of the House of Lords in Twinsectra Ltd –v- Yardley [2002] 2 AC 164 and of the Privy Council in Barlow Clowes International Ltd –v- Eurotrust International Ltd [2006] 1 WLR 1476.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">The test as to dishonesty, distilled from the above authorities, is as follows. Dishonesty is synonymous with a lack of probity. It means not acting as an honest person would in the circumstances. The standard is an objective one. The application of the standard requires one to put oneself in the shoes of the defendant to the extent that his conduct is to be assessed in the light of what he knew at the relevant time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. For the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety. But a person is not free to set his own standard of honesty. This is what is meant by saying that the standard is objective. If by ordinary objective standards, the defendant's mental state would be judged to be dishonest, it is irrelevant that the defendant has adopted a different standard or can see nothing wrong in his behaviour.” </p>

In another sense of the word a man knows a fact only when he is fully conscious of it. For an action of deceit there must be knowledge in the narrower sense; and conscious knowledge of falsity must always amount to wickedness and dishonesty. When Judges say, therefore, that wickedness and dishonesty must be present, they are not requiring a new ingredient for the tort of deceit so much as describing the sort of knowledge which is necessary."</span>

Neuberger Products Ltd [1957] 1 QB 247 to In re H (Minors) [1996] AC 563. In the latter case Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said this (at 586): <span style="color:#000000">"Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established. Ungoed-Thomas J. expressed this neatly in In re Dellow's Trusts [1964] 1 W.L.R. 451, 455: "The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it."</span></p>

During this call, Mr Bretten QC proposed  (1) that the relevant partnerships acknowledge that they were in default of their payment obligation, (2) for a loan to be given from the Technology Vendor to the partnerships, (3) for such a short term loan to be made with interest running from 1 July 2003 with monies advanced and (4) for the purchase price to be paid preferably before 24 July 2003.</p>

He advised that because the AAs in question either specified a date within 4 months of the date of the agreements (the Golden Contracts partnerships) or did not specify a date at all (Schemes 1-8), section 5(5) was in fact not in point since, on his reading, it only applied where the contract “in terms provides for a payment date falling more than 4 months after the obligation to pay becomes unconditional”.

The resulting opinion from Mr Bretten QC dated 31 October 2003 maintained the revised stance as set out in the manuscript note of 17 July 2003, namely that actual payment within 4 months was not in fact required by s. 5(5) of CAA 2001.

After the Court of Appeal’s judgment, Mr Bretten QC advised in clear terms that the Ramsay principle was not able to be applied in determining whether expenditure had been incurred for the purpose of s. 45.  Whilst the circular movement of funds is now criticised as not altering the economic reality as between the Technology Vendor and the relevant LLP/Partnership, at the time in question the advice of leading counsel was that it was proper and sufficient in order to ensure that the valuable pre-26 March 2003 status of the AA was preserved.

Criticism was also made of the fact that the lending banks were apparently not informed of these prior arrangements and that there was no satisfactory documentary evidence of the CLFL loans being cancelled and replaced.  Whilst the documentary position is not entirely satisfactory the reality is that once the bank loans had been secured CLFL never expected or demanded repayment of the bridging loans and they were treated as having been taken over by the banks.</p>

The present documentation needs revision if the LLP is not to be considered a [CIS]”.  Although much stress was placed on the statement that the control of management of the LLP must “in substance and reality” be by the partners, the advice also suggests that revisions to the documentation may assist in ensuring that the LLP is not to be considered a CIS.</p>

Mr Carter further stated that the partners had control of the trading of the LLP as a result of the EGMs. He believed that the Partnerships were actually trading vehicles and not investment vehicles, and that the way the procedures were set up (and precisely because some partnerships were very large such that not all investors could be actively involved day to day), meant that they were compliant with FSMA.</p>

It is correct that for a considerable time Mr Carter painted an optimistic picture of the IR negotiations and their likely outcome.  The IR correspondence and meeting notes suggest that this optimism may have been misplaced, at least with hindsight.  It was Mr Carter’s evidence that IR challenges to the Schemes had always been expected and that the expert legal input with which the Schemes had been set up encouraged him in the view that the IR challenges would be resisted. I accept that this remained his belief and understanding until a late stage.  Criticism was also made of some inaccurate statements made by Mr Carter at EGMs as to the Scheme arrangements.  Whilst some of these criticisms are justified they reflect mistakes made by someone under huge pressure rather than any innate dishonesty or dishonest purpose.   </p>

The one exception was Mr Carter’s statement to Mr Frost that Mr Stiedl was never more than a consultant in the November 2004 meeting with Mr Frost.  This was untrue, as Mr Carter effectively acknowledged in evidence.  Mr Bailey and Mr Roper were criticised for remaining silent when these statements were made but it is understandable that they would be reluctant to openly contradict their own client and it was Mr Bailey’s evidence that he did take the issue up with Mr Carter after the meeting.</p>

Under the heading ‘Legal uncertainty in the definition of CIS’, the report states: “The notion of ‘day to day control’ is vague and FSMA does not give any further guidance on how it should be interpreted. Furthermore, the phrase “whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions”, which purports to clarify the “day to day control of the property” notion, is also obscure. There is not a clear picture as to which level of control the “right to be consulted or to give directions” encompasses” (para. 2.5).

On the other hand “day to day control” must clearly mean more than “have the right” to be consulted or to give directions”. In Elliott, Laddie J referred in “colloquial terms” to “minding the shop”. In practice it is not always easy to apply the test, though it appears that as a minimum the participants should be in a position to tell the person who is actually managing the property what to do on a continuing day to day basis”.</span>

Therefore, the fact that an investor’s funds may rest in client account pending putting in place a particular loan, does not stop it being in a CIS. If the money was placed there for the purpose of such an arrangement, it is from that time in a CIS. The ‘arrangements’ to which s.75 (1) relate are those which enable, or are intended to enable, the communal funds to be invested. They include the preparatory steps which allow individual investors to park their money in the Elliott’s’ client account with a view to future investment in a communal property-based loan as well as the investment itself.”</span>

In the former case, the account is common both as to what it contains and as to what it will be used for. In the latter, it is only common in the first sense. The co-residence in the account of sums from different individuals may be an administrative convenience, but it does not mean that those individuals are clubbing together to make a common investment.

Although they were both involved in the establishment of the Schemes they did so as directors of Innovator, and were acting for Innovator rather than on their own behalf.  Mr Bailey was a non-executive director and chairman and did not in any meaningful sense establish the Schemes.  Even if he did, he equally did so on behalf of Innovator.

However, it seems to me clear that he did not have any beneficial interest in the money (save only to the extent of taking out his pay). I think there is also force in Mr Croxford's reliance on the definition of “the operator” in Section 75(8), which shows that the legislature envisaged the manager, rather than the trustee, as the person “operating” a unit trust. He says that this tends to support the view that, as a mere trustee of monies obtained from investors in the scheme, Mr Hesling should not be treated as “operating” the scheme. Accordingly, in my view, paragraph 16 does not apply to Mr Hesling.”</p>

Further, it did not apply to communications in respect of an investment under the terms of which the investor could incur a liability or obligation to pay or contribute more than he committed by way of investment (art.48 (1)(d) and (5)).  Most importantly it did not apply to communications in respect of an investment for units in a CIS (other than one which invested wholly or predominantly in stocks and shares in an unlisted company or instruments acknowledging indebtedness in such a company).</p>

This is reinforced by the reference to the right being to recover money paid “under the agreement”. It is also reinforced by s.28(8) which provides that if property transferred under an agreement to which s.26 applies has passed to a third party, then references in that section and s. 28 to property are to be read as a reference to its value at the time of its transfer under the agreement: this suggests that third parties are outside the scope of s.26.</p>

This clearly shows that it is the person who made the agreement against whom the remedy may be obtained since he is the person (and the only person) who may seek relief against such a claim.  If it were otherwise it would mean that relief could be obtained by the person who made the agreement and was contravening the general prohibition, but not by the third party recipient who made no such agreement and was not so in contravention.

On my findings they were not (aside from Mr Gates) carrying on a regulated activity in contravention of the general prohibition.  All the reasons given for so finding are equally reasons why it was reasonable for them to believe that they were not contravening the general prohibition.  In the case of Mr Gates his evidence was that CPUK asked the FSA what permissions were needed and was informed that it had the requisite permissions.  MFS had the same permissions.  It was also his evidence that it would have been a simple matter to obtain the requisite authorisation had it been realised that it was required.  In the circumstances I accept that he too reasonably believed that he was not contravening the general prohibition. </p>

Secondly a person, who was a counterparty to "controlled agreement" but not the communicator of the "unlawful communication” or who caused it to be made.

The parties were agreed that the authorities disclose three tests which have been used in deciding whether a defendant sued as causing pure economic loss to a claimant owed him a duty of care in tort. The first is whether the defendant assumed responsibility for what he said and did vis-…-vis the claimant, or is to be treated by the law as having done so. The second is commonly known as the threefold test: whether loss to the claimant was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of what the defendant did or failed to do; whether the relationship between the parties was one of sufficient proximity; and whether in all the circumstances it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the defendant towards the claimant (what Kirby J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180, para 259, succinctly labelled “policy”). Third is the incremental test, based on the observation of Brennan J in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424 , 481, approved by Lord Bridge of Harwich in <a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;&amp;context=12&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I821B84F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9">

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.75in">“4. First, there are cases in which one party can accurately be said to have assumed responsibility for what is said or done to another, the paradigm situation being a relationship having all the indicia of contract save consideration.   Hedley Byrne would, but for the express disclaimer, have been such a case. White v Jones and Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd, although the relationship was more remote, can be seen as analogous.  Thus, like Colman J (whose methodology was commended by Paul Mitchell and Charles Mitchell, “Negligence Liability for Pure Economic Loss” (2005) 121 LQR 194, 199), I think it is correct to regard an assumption of responsibility as a sufficient but not a necessary condition of liability, a first test which, if answered positively, may obviate the need for further inquiry.  If answered negatively, further consideration is called for.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.75in">5. Secondly, however, it is clear that the assumption of responsibility test is to be applied objectively (Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1994] 2 AC 145, 181) and is not answered by consideration of what the defendant thought or intended.  ... The problem here is, as I see it, that the further this test is removed from the actions and intentions of the actual defendant, and the more notional the assumption of responsibility becomes, the less difference there is between this test and the threefold test.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.75in">6. Thirdly, the threefold test itself provides no straightforward answer to the vexed question whether or not, in a novel situation, a party owes a duty of care.  </p>

Fourthly, I incline to agree with the view ...  that the incremental test is of little value as a test in itself, and is only helpful when used in combination with a test or principle which identifies the legally significant features of a situation.  The closer the facts of the case in issue to those of a case in which a duty of care has been held to exist, the readier a court will be, on the approach of Brennan J adopted in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman, to find that there has been an assumption of responsibility or that the proximity and policy conditions of the threefold test are satisfied.  The converse is also true.</p>

Fifthly, it seems to me that the outcomes (or majority outcomes) of the leading cases cited above are in every or almost every instance sensible and just, irrespective of the test applied to achieve that outcome.  This is not to disparage the value of and need for a test of liability in tortious negligence, which any law of tort must propound if it is not to become a morass of single instances.  But it does in my opinion concentrate attention on the detailed circumstances of the particular case and the particular relationship between the parties in the context of their legal and factual situation as a whole.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.58in">“It will be recalled that Waite L.J. took the view that in the context of directors of companies the general principle must not “set at naught” the protection of limited liability. In Trevor Ivory Ltd. v. Anderson [1992] 2 N.Z.L.R. 517, 524, Cooke P. expressed a very similar view. It is clear what they meant. What matters is not that the liability of the shareholders of a company is limited but that a company is a separate entity, distinct from its directors, servants or other agents. The trader who incorporates a company to which he transfers his business creates a legal person on whose behalf he may afterwards act as director. For present purposes, his position is the same as if he had sold his business to another individual and agreed to act on his behalf. Thus the issue in this case is not peculiar to companies. Whether the principal is a company or a natural person, someone acting on his behalf may incur personal liability in tort as well as imposing vicarious or attributed liability upon his principal. But in order to establish personal liability under the principle of <a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;&amp;context=12&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=IBC23A100E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9">

An objective test means that the primary focus must be on things said or done by the defendant or on his behalf in dealings with the plaintiff. Obviously, the impact of what a defendant says or does must be judged in the light of the relevant contextual scene. Subject to this qualification the primary focus must be on exchanges (in which term I include statements and conduct) which cross the line between the defendant and the plaintiff. Sometimes such an issue arises in a simple bilateral relationship. In the present case a triangular position is under consideration: the prospective franchisees, the franchisor company, and the director. In such a case where the personal liability of the director is in question the internal arrangements between a director and his company cannot be the foundation of a director's personal liability in tort. The inquiry must be whether the director, or anybody on his behalf, conveyed directly or indirectly to the prospective franchisees that the director assumed personal responsibility towards the prospective franchisees…</p>

Parliament did not provide expressly that a breach of the Listing Rules would give rise to a cause of action at the suit of a private person. Other remedies and penalties were provided by ss 382, 384 and 91. That is a clear indication that Parliament did not intend a breach of the Listing Rules <span style="text-decoration:underline">would give rise to a cause of action at the suit of a private person. To hold that Parliament did so intend would interfere with the scheme and modes of enforcement provided by FSMA”</span> [at 16] (emphasis added). Teare J’s observations about breaches of the Listing Rules apply equally to the alleged breach of s 19 and s.21 of FSMA which the Claimants rely upon to found their claim in negligence. FSMA does not expressly provide that a contravention of these sections shall give rise to a cause of action at the suit of a private person and other remedies and penalties for breach of the general prohibition are expressly provided in FSMA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the nature of fiduciary obligations, Millett LJ said as follows: “The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith: he must not make a profit out of his trust; he may not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or for a third party without the informed consent of his principal.”</p>

It follows that a commercial relationship at arm’s length, with both parties on an equal footing is less likely to give rise to fiduciary obligations: <span style="font-style:italic">Halton International Inc v Guernroy Ltd</span> [2005] EWHC 1968. As <span style="font-style:italic">Snell</span> explains: “The reason fiduciary duties do not commonly arise in commercial settings outside the settled categories of fiduciary relationships is that it is normally inappropriate to expect a commercial party to subordinate its own interests to those of another commercial party. But if that expectation is not appropriate in the circumstances of the relationship between the parties then fiduciary duties will arise.”</p>

If I had said to Mr Stiedl: I am not accepting 35 million, it’s 50 million. I am pretty confident I would have been out on Berkeley Street reasonably quickly and unlikely to be able to find another purchaser at that value. So when you are in dealing situation, you are going to be reading what the other guy is looking for and what he wants, and what you yourself must have, and that was the situation as far as I was concerned in the deal with Innovator. All I was concerned about was if I did a deal, was it one that was in line with what I felt I needed to make it happen.”</span>

The Schemes were very successful and substantial fees were generated for Innovator, from which Mr Stiedl derived benefits additional to payments made to him as a consultant.  However, as I have found, there was no misappropriation of funds.  The Technology Vendors and other third parties were paid in accordance with the Scheme documentation and there was a balance of profit left for Innovator from its fees.

These were carefully designed schemes with significant input from professionals, including leading counsel.  They were reviewed and considered by many experts, including numerous IFAs and accountants.  They were judged by many honest, conscientious people to be sound, if ingenious, Schemes.  That is what Mr Stiedl believed them to be.  He believed that they would obtain the anticipated tax relief and that some, at least, of the Technologies would take off.  Criticisms can be made of the implementation of the Schemes and, with hindsight, elements of its structure, but the basic conception of the Schemes was sound.  As matters have turned out, the changed attitude and approach of the IR and the courts to circular funding mean that the tax benefits would probably not have been achieved, however well implemented the Schemes may have been.  But that is with the benefit of hindsight.</span>

He was subjected to extensive cross examination over a number of days which he withstood calmly and consistently.  No doubt, as Mr Carter acknowledged, aspects of the documentation and its execution could have been improved.  Although I have found Mr Carter exceeded his authority on two occasions and backdated the Arte D/A, I do not find that he did so with any dishonest intent.  His principal motivation throughout was to try and make the Schemes work and succeed.  The CLFL Bridging Loan arrangements is a good example of this.  Although the Claimants were highly critical of these arrangements and their artificiality, they were entered into in order to try to secure tax relief for partners, not to defraud or mislead. </span>

	      <span class="subject">As the Schemes ran into difficulties Mr Carter came under increasing pressure.  The success of the Schemes meant that he was probably already overburdened, but this burden was multiplied when tax and other issues were raised and he was having to deal with numerous individual partners’ questions and complaints.  Undoubtedly there were times when Mr Carter was slow to respond and also when he responded in terms that proved to be over optimistic. He also, as I have found, minimised and misdescribed Mr Stiedl’s role in Innovator.  However, I find Mr Carter to have been a fundamentally honest witness and also fundamentally honest in his involvement in and handling of the Innovator Schemes.  Mistakes were made but they were not dishonest mistakes.</span>

I ruled that they could not be introduced as part of any pleaded case.  The Claimants nevertheless sought to rely upon them and indeed on an expanded version produced during closing.  I do not consider that it would be fair to Mr Carter, an unrepresented Defendant, to allow them to do so.  To the extent that the Claimants obtained answers in cross examination on related matters they can rely on them, but not on any detailed case based on these schedules.  In any event, I am not satisfied that they show any impropriety.  They address what was done with funds which formed part of Innovator’s own share of the agreed fee.  That is a matter for Innovator, not the Claimants.  It is also to be noted that although the Claimants apparently spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on accountancy fees, no accountancy evidence was sought to be relied upon.  </span>

Apparent discrepancies in documentation in which CB was involved have fuelled the Claimants’ conspiracy theories.  The CIS aspects of arrangements such as these are matters that it may be said CB should have considered for themselves.  However, I am not concerned with any complaints that Innovator or the LLPs might have against CB.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, for example, the involvement of third parties and in particular professional third parties in the allegedly fraudulent scheme.  These include Mr Bretten QC; Mr Crystal; Pridie Brewster; Baker Tilly; Crouch Chapman; H2M and Mr McCallum; American Appraisal and Xexco.  No allegations of dishonesty were made against any of these parties but they were all closely involved with the allegedly fraudulent and sham Schemes.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that so many third parties were brought into the Schemes is inconsistent with a fraudulent conspiracy.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There is also the fact that no personal advantage was obtained by many of the alleged wrongdoers.  Thus it was not alleged that Mr Bailey and Mr Roper profited other than as partners of CB or directors on a fixed fee.  Further, although Messrs Stiedl, Carter and Gates did profit financially from the Innovator Schemes that was mainly derived from Innovator’s own profits in accordance with the disclosed fee structure and did not involve misappropriation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, the Schemes were put together in accordance with a structure which was extensively and expensively advised upon by leading counsel, Mr Bretten QC.  That structure was not substantially criticised.  Indeed it was similar to that in the Tower M Cashback schemes about which no allegations of fraud, conspiracy or dishonesty were apparently made.  The essential criticism made by the IR of the Schemes related to their implementation rather than their structure, and in particular the failure to establish sufficient trade within the relevant tax year.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if, however, there had been no implementation issues the likelihood is that the Schemes would have faced the same challenge from Mr Frost of the IR as the Tower M Cashback schemes, and with the same result – i.e. tax relief on the partners’ cash contributions only.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the Claimants were understandably aggrieved to lose their cash contributions and receive back only limited tax relief, there are obvious risks in going into aggressive tax schemes which offer the prospect of almost immediately doubling your money. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, the greatest risk to the Claimants was not losing their cash contribution, but being exposed to repayment of the 80% loan.  This had to be a real liability for the tax relief to be claimable, as was reasonably apparent from the IMs and is the logic of a geared investment.  However, few Claimants appreciated the reality of the liability and the consequent risk.  In the event that risk did not materialise in respect of virtually all Schemes since a hive down to a limited company was achieved, as was anticipated but never assured.  In relation to those Schemes, such as Charit, where no hive down was achieved, the consequence of the contraventions of FSMA may well be that there is no liability.  If so, then, ironically, the relevant Claimants will in one sense have benefited from the FSMA contraventions about which so much complaint was made.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst the Claimants will no doubt be generally disappointed at the outcome of the litigation, they can be solaced in the fact that a very possible outcome of entering into these highly geared tax Schemes would have been a liability for four times their capital contribution, and that has been avoided.  Further, the tax relief obtained (or, in the case of Arte, offered) was probably no more than would have ultimately been achieved, however well these Schemes had been implemented.</p>
