	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Abramovich disputed the Sibneft claim.  His case was that, while the precise percentage shareholding fluctuated over time, at all material times, the majority of Sibneft’s shares were (indirectly) owned by him through trusts and companies which he controlled;  that neither Mr. Berezovsky, nor any entity controlled by him, had ever been the registered or beneficial owner of any significant number of Sibneft shares.  He asserted that there never had been any agreement to confer any interest in the company, or in its share capital, or in the profits derived from such interest, on Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili;  that, on the contrary, the deal between them was that, in return for substantial cash payments to Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Abramovich and Sibneft would enjoy Mr. Berezovsky’s political patronage and influence, which was indispensible to the construction of any major business in the conditions of the 1990s, the Russian term for such support being “<span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>” (literally translated “roof”).  Mr. Abramovich contended that the amount of the various payments made to Mr. Berezovsky for such support was determined by a combination of unilateral demands by Mr. Berezovsky, and <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> horse-trading between him or Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Abramovich,  but did not represent dividend or other payments linked to an ownership interest in Sibneft.  Mr. Abramovich denied that any threats were ever made by him directly or indirectly to Mr. Berezovsky to persuade the latter to part with any alleged ownership interest in Sibneft or otherwise.  He alleged that the payment of $1.3 billion made by him in 2001 to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had nothing to do with any alleged sale of the latter’s alleged ownership interests in Sibneft, but, on the contrary, was a final pay-off to discharge Mr. Abramovich’s <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>obligations to the two men in relation to Sibneft.  He asserted that, in any event, Mr. Berezovsky had suffered no loss:  if he had indeed had some sort of ownership interest in Sibneft, he had never parted with it;  if, on the other hand (contrary to Mr. Abramovich’s contentions), the sum of $1.3 billion in fact represented the price paid by Mr. Abramovich to acquire Mr. Berezovsky’s ownership interest in Sibneft, such sum was a great deal more than the value of Mr. Berezovsky’s alleged ownership interest at the time.  As a matter of law, he contended that, in any event, the alleged agreements concluded in 1995 and/or 1996 in relation to Sibneft were not valid as a matter of Russian law.  Moreover, even if (contrary to Mr. Abramovich’s contentions) threats had been made to persuade Mr. Berezovsky to sell his alleged ownership interest in Sibneft, any intimidation claim, together with any other claim that might be put forward, was time-barred as a matter of Russian law, which was the relevant law governing the alleged tort of intimidation.</p>

He further denied that he had ever agreed in 1999, or at any other time, to participate with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets on the same terms as the alleged 1995 Agreement.  He denied that there had been any agreement made at the Dorchester Hotel meeting (or elsewhere) that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have a share of the aluminium business created by the merger of the pre-merger aluminium assets with Mr. Deripaska’s aluminium assets;  or that there had been any agreement that he, Mr. Abramovich, would hold that interest for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili under an English law trust.  He further denied that it had been agreed at the Dorchester Hotel meeting between Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska that none of them should be entitled to sell his interest in the merged business without the consent of the others;  or that his sale of a 25% share in RusAl in September 2003 to Mr. Deripaska’s holding companies was a breach of such agreement.  Further he contended that the governing law of any such arrangement would have been Russian law, under which no concept of trust or equitable proprietary interest was recognised and that, in any event, any arguable claim under Russian law would have been time barred under the relevant Russian law of limitation.  He alleged that, in any event, any trust claim would have been bad even under English law, because of the uncertainty of its alleged terms.  Finally, he claimed that the RusAl claim had in any event been the subject of a contractual release, which was binding on Mr. Berezovsky.  Accordingly, Mr. Abramovich asserted that he had no liability to Mr. Berezovsky in respect of the RusAl claim.  </p>

That was because it was necessary to look at the business relationship between Mr. Abramovich, on the one hand, and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on the other, as one continuum.  Thus the evidence relating to the manner in which the three men subsequently conducted themselves in relation to the RusAl merger, although later in time than the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements, was itself relevant to an assessment of whether the original relationship between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky was the contractual relationship alleged by Mr. Berezovsky or the <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> relationship alleged by Mr. Abramovich.  For this reason, in coming to my conclusions in relation to the Sibneft issues, I have taken into account the subsequent evidence in relation to the RusAl issues, and vice versa.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the centre of the main Chancery action is Mr. Berezovsky’s claim that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili made an oral agreement in Russia in 1995 that all commercial investments made by either of them would be shared on a 50:50 basis.  Before me, this allegation has been referred to as “the bilateral joint venture” or the “over-arching joint venture”.  As an alternative to this allegation, in the main Chancery action Mr. Berezovsky asserts a number of individual agreements pursuant to which he says he acquired an interest in various assets.  One such agreement is alleged to have been made at the Dorchester Hotel meeting where, as set out above, Mr. Berezovsky claims that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili obtained a 25% interest in RusAl.  Mr. Berezovsky says that he is entitled to trace into the assets acquired with the proceeds of sale of that interest, and to the extent he is unable to recover them, seeks damages in the main Chancery action against Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s estate for failing properly to secure them.  </p>

The defendants to that action are the Interim Administrators, the Family defendants, and Vasily Anisimov (“Mr. Anisimov”), a Russian businessman, together with a number of entities controlled by him (“the Anisimov defendants”).  In that action Mr. Berezovsky claims an interest in a stake held by Mr. Anisimov in CJSC Holding Company Metalloinvest (“Metalloinvest”), a valuable Russian ore and mining company.  It is alleged that the Metalloinvest stake was purchased using monies from the sale of the second 25% interest in RusAl in July 2004.  Mr. Berezovsky claims to have acquired an interest in those monies - and, thus, in the Metalloinvest stake purchased with them - as a result of the alleged agreement concluded at the Dorchester Hotel meeting.  </p>

The 4th to 9th and 11th defendants in that action (“the Salford defendants”) were, or were alleged to be, members or associates of a group of companies including Salford Capital Partners Inc, a private equity firm specialising in the developing markets of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, alleged to have been involved in the sale of the second tranche of RusAl shares.  The Interim Administrators and Ms. Gudavadze are also defendants in the Salford action.  The Salford defendants contend that the proceeds of the sale of the second tranche of RusAl shares, and the alleged abortive instruction of the Salford defendants in connection therewith, form no part of the Salford action;  and that the claims against the Salford defendants in the Salford action rest upon quite different foundations:  namely the alleged bilateral Joint Venture between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and the arrangements which are said to have been made between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on the one hand, and the Salford defendants on the other, in May 2002.  The Salford defendants say that the question of Mr. Berezovsky’s ownership of RusAl and the fruits of that investment form no more than part of the narrative background to the case that is made against them.  </p>

The 16 August order identified a number of issues, defined as “the Overlap Issues”, which arise in both the Commercial court action and the Chancery actions.  Mann J and I directed that the Overlap Issues should be tried and determined as preliminary issues in the Chancery actions at the same time as the trial of the Commercial court action.  We further ordered that each of the parties to the Chancery actions should be bound only by the findings made at the Joint Trial on, and might participate fully in, the Overlap Issues, but should not be bound by findings at the Joint Trial on any other issues.  The Overlap Issues, as defined in the Order of 16 August 2010, were slightly amended by orders made respectively on 7 July and 23 January 2012.  As finally defined, they were as follows:  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Family defendants and Mr. Anisimov have a very significant interest in the outcome of this trial and the determination of the Overlap Issues.  In the Metalloinvest action, whilst recognizing Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interest in the RusAl proceeds, Mr. Anisimov denies that Mr. Berezovsky had any interest in RusAl or its proceeds or in the Metalloinvest stake held by Mr. Anisimov.  Were Mr. Berezovsky to establish an interest in half of the RusAl proceeds by means of the alleged agreement made at the Dorchester Hotel, that would, according to the Family defendants, halve Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interest in the RusAl proceeds, and therefore that of his estate (of which the Family defendants are principal beneficiaries).  In the main Chancery action, in reliance on his claimed interest in the RusAl proceeds, said to arise, inter alia, as a result of the alleged agreement at the Dorchester Hotel, Mr. Berezovsky asserts a claim to a number of valuable assets – in addition to Metalloinvest - which are prima facie held for Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s estate.  In addition, Mr. Berezovsky says that the estate is liable to him in damages to the extent that he is unable to secure and recover any such assets.  Again, the determination of whether or not Mr. Berezovsky had such an interest in RusAl (and therefore in its proceeds) is of importance to the estate in that action and, thus, to the Family defendants.  </p>

Most importantly, for the trial alone, there were approximately 4000 pages of written submissions submitted by counsel.</p>

There was extensive hyper-linking, which rendered access even easier.

Indeed, Mr. Berezovsky sought to rely, in support of his case, on a lengthy and detailed report by Professor Stephen Fortescue about contemporary Russian history, together with a large number of press articles and similar materials upon which the report was based.  The claim could also be characterised as a uniquely personal story, centred as it was on a relationship between two men, of different ages, both in their time extremely successful and powerful, and whose fortunes changed as the dynamic of their relationship changed.  The dispute between the two men has to be evaluated against the sometimes turbulent political and economic backcloth of Russia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and in the context of the deterioration of their relationship.  Nonetheless, the dispute is in essence a commercial one, which, like any other tried in this court, has to be decided on the factual evidence, both oral and documentary, relating to the specific transactions in issue. And, although this court necessarily views that evidence “Under Western Eyes<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="21">

During this period a political system, an economic model and a legal framework for trade and industry were scrapped and replaced.  After the final collapse of Communism in 1992, Russia became Europe’s “Wild East”.  A country, which had never in its entire history been either liberal or democratic in its governmental institutions, experienced, in less than a decade, a transition to capitalism which had taken other European countries more than a century to achieve. The result of this was an immense social upheaval, the partial collapse of old structures of authority, the enfeeblement and the impoverishment of the state, and the disappearance of the rule of law.</p>

In that context, it meant ‘protection’.  Protection racketeering was a very large part of the activities of criminal gangs in the 1990s although with all the violent and involuntary connotations of the word protection, a criminal <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> was likely to also provide services beyond the immediate one of keeping other criminal groups away from your business.  These included debt collection, i.e. contract enforcement, and conflict resolution.  In the absence of an effective state, the <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> fulfilled some of the functions of the state, and collected tax for doing so.  </p>

This not only reduced the role of criminal groups but also led to a new application of the word <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> (which was not in general usage in the early and mid-1990s).  It was now bureaucrats and politicians who provided a <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>.  Like the criminal gangs, they also provided protection from a business person’s enemies and competitors.  They also advanced the interests of their business client within the bureaucracy and political arena and were well remunerated for doing so.

The founding members of AVVA included AvtoVAZ, LogoVAZ, Forus and Consolidated Bank.  Mr. Berezovsky was General Director.  The scheme was that AVVA would raise funds by selling shares both privately and to members of the public.  However, for various reasons the scheme failed.  It was alleged on Mr. Abramovich’s behalf that AVVA was involved in pyramid selling, an allegation which Mr. Berezovsky denied.  It is not an issue which I need to decide.</p>

Andava was set up to raise capital in the West for AVVA and as a treasury centre for AVVA.  However, it does not appear that Western capital was in fact raised for such purpose.  From 1996, Andava provided central treasury services for Aeroflot, the Russian State airline, but, according to Mr. Berezovsky, that was not something which was apparently envisaged when Andava was founded.

Mr. Berezovsky argued that the channel could be used to support the interests of democratically inclined Russians whose interests were represented by President Yeltsin’s re-election campaign.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was proposed that Ostankino’s assets should be transferred to a new company, OAO Obshestvennoye Rossiyskoe Televvidenie (“ORT”), with a view to its being partially privatised.  ORT had been created by Presidential Decree on 29 November 1994.  The plan was for the State to sell 49% of the shares in ORT to a syndicate of private investors organised by Mr. Berezovsky, whilst retaining a controlling 51%.  The 49% shareholders would be expected to fund ORT’s media operations, and in return would obtain effective editorial control.  Thus although, technically, the private investors were buying a minority stake in a State-owned company, in fact, the votes of minority shareholders of ORT were necessary for central aspects of its decision-making.  For example, under ORT’s Charter, a quorum of 2/3 was necessary for the General Meeting of Shareholders, and a simple majority vote at a General Meeting of Shareholders was insufficient for the appointment of the Board of Directors.  At the original privatisation of ORT, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili acquired 8% through LogoVAZ.  In addition, Mr. Berezovsky persuaded a number of ‘oligarchs’ with whom he had a relationship, to take stakes in ORT, on the basis that they would allow Mr. Berezovsky to manage their shareholdings on their behalf.  In September and October 1995, Mr. Berezovsky was given a power of attorney over their shareholdings (which effectively gave him control of their ORT shares).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 August 1999, Vladimir Putin (“Mr. Putin”, or “President Putin”) was appointed acting Prime Minister by President Yeltsin.  On 1 January 2000, Mr. Putin became acting President of Russia.  On 26 March 2000, he was elected President and, on 7 May 2000, was inaugurated as such.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus the evidence established that Mr. Berezovsky in his prime was the archetypal “well-connected powerbroker”.  According to Professor Fortescue, in the early and mid-1990s Mr. Berezovsky was “one of the most politically influential ‘oligarchs’ in Russia”, an assessment with which Mr. Berezovsky readily agreed in cross-examination.  Professor Fortescue identified three main factors which accounted for his influence:  (i) his relationship with the so-called family advisers of President Yeltsin;  (ii) his close relations with other “oligarchs”;  and (iii) his media interests.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was broadly confirmed by Mr. Berezovsky, with the characteristic proviso that the main factor accounting for his influence was “my intellectual capacity”.  Mr. Berezovsky’s ability to lobby for the creation and privatisation of ORT, and its transfer into his control, and thereafter to run it, apparently without interference, clearly demonstrated the level of influence which he was able to exert at the time.  The evidence also established that he exercised close control over its editorial policy and that, between 1995 and 2000, editorial control of ORT was the main source of Mr. Berezovsky’s political influence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Patarkatsishvili was a Georgian citizen who began his career in the Georgian operations of the State-owned car manufacturer AvtoVAZ. By 1980/81 he had become head of the division responsible for the distribution of spare parts in the Caucasus.  He later told Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors that he had provided the start up capital for LogoVAZ in 1989, or at least for Mr. Berezovsky’s share of it.  At some stage he moved to Moscow at Mr. Berezovsky’s invitation to join its management.  Mr. Berezovsky’s account of the origins of their relationship was rather different.  He said that Mr. Patarkatsishvili joined LogoVAZ as an employee in 1992, at a time when he had no significant private assets.  By 1994, he had risen under Mr. Berezovsky’s patronage to become its First Deputy General Director for Commerce, and had begun to acquire a modest shareholding (4%) in LogoVAZ as well as interests in other enterprises in which Mr. Berezovsky was involved.  It is not necessary for me to decide any issues about the origins of the two men’s business relationship in these proceedings, and I do not do so.  It was common ground that Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s strong feature was that he was an outstanding financial manager.  According to Eugene Shvidler (“Mr. Shvidler”), one of Mr. Abramovich’s close business associates, who was President of Sibneft from July 1998 to October 2005, and Chairman of the Board of RusAl from 2000 – 2003, Mr. Patarkatsishvili also had a reputation, apparently acquired in Georgia, as a “tough guy” with connections to even “tougher individuals”.  When, in early 1995, Mr. Berezovsky acquired an interest in ORT, Mr. Patarkatsishvili was very quickly installed as its First Deputy General Director.  In about March 1995, while his discussions with Mr. Berezovsky were continuing, Mr. Abramovich first met Mr. Patarkatsishvili at the LogoVAZ club.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Berezovsky alleges that in 1995 he reached agreement with Mr. Patarkatsishvili that, unless otherwise agreed, they would participate in any future and existing businesses on a 50:50 basis.  As I have already mentioned, that is disputed, in particular by the defendants in the Chancery proceedings.  As a result of an earlier decision of mine dated 6 May 2011, in which I refused Mr. Berezovsky leave to amend to raise the point in his claim against Mr. Abramovich, it is common ground that it is not an issue which can or should be resolved at this trial.  Mr. Abramovich’s position is that he appreciated that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were close business associates but never knew the exact nature or terms of their relationship.  Mr. Berezovsky claims to have told Mr. Abramovich in 1995 that he had a 50:50 partnership with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, who managed their joint business.  Mr. Abramovich does not accept that he was told this. Again, these are not issues which arise for determination at this trial, and are not issues which can subsequently be raised as against Mr. Abramovich.</p>

The court was being asked, in effect, to make findings based on limited direct evidence relating to events which occurred many years ago;  these included the alleged agreements between Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in 1995 and 1996 relating to Sibneft;  between the three men in 1999 relating to the aluminium interests;  the alleged Dorchester Hotel Agreement said to have been concluded between Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Deripaska on 13 March, 2000, relating to RusAl;  and alleged threats said to have been made by Mr. Abramovich relating to the sale of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests in ORT in 2000, and in relation to their alleged interests in Sibneft in 2001.  In a case which is dependent upon establishing oral agreements, evidence relating to events which occurred a long time ago necessarily gives rise to particular problems.  Apart from the fact that, not surprisingly, it is often difficult for witnesses to remember what happened many years ago, and they can rarely be expected to remember the specific words which they used, witnesses can easily persuade themselves that their recollection of what happened is the correct one.  That problem was compounded in this case by the fact there had been substantial summary judgment proceedings, followed by the appeal to the Court of Appeal, during the course of which round after round of evidence was produced by various witnesses on each side.  Given the substantial resources of the parties, and the serious allegations of dishonesty, the case was heavily lawyered on both sides.  That meant that no evidential stone was left unturned, unaddressed or unpolished.  Those features, not surprisingly, resulted in shifts or changes in the parties’ evidence or cases, as the lawyers microscopically examined each aspect of the evidence and acquired a greater in-depth understanding of the facts.  It also led to some scepticism on the court’s part as to whether the lengthy witness statements reflected more the industrious work product of the lawyers, than the actual evidence of the witnesses.  However, it would not have been practical, given the length and complexity of the factual issues involved, for the court to have required evidence in chief to have been given orally.  It was for that reason that cross-examination, in particular of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich, assumed such a critical importance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the lapse of time and staleness of the claims also gave rise to the inevitable problem that the court did not have before it all the evidence which it might otherwise have done, had the dispute been resolved nearer the time that the alleged oral agreements had been made, rather than 16 years after they were alleged to have been concluded.  A number of witnesses, who would, or might, have been able to have given key evidence, were dead;  these included Mr. Patarkatsishvili himself, an English solicitor, Stephen Curtis (“Mr. Curtis”) and two other English solicitors, Nick Keeling (“Mr. Keeling”) and Mr. Stephen Moss (“Mr. Moss”).  A number of witnesses were not prepared to give evidence.  Documents which might have been available at the time had been destroyed in the normal course of business, or were not able to be found.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the burden of proof was on Mr. Berezovsky to establish his claims.  As the only witness, on his side, who could give direct oral evidence of the making of the alleged agreements or the alleged threats, the evidential burden on him was substantial.  Whilst Mr. Rabinowitz submitted in his oral closing submissions that:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… there was one overarching question that the court will want to ask itself, namely has Mr. Abramovich on his case provided a plausible explanation for the enormous and indeed admitted payments made to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili”,</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">this somewhat distorted the reality that the burden of proof at all times lay fairly and squarely on Mr. Berezovsky.  It was true that the evidential burden shifted to Mr. Abramovich to explain the reason for the substantial payments which he made to the two men (and this is a topic with which I deal below), but, ultimately, it was for Mr. Berezovsky to convince the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the alleged oral agreements and threats had indeed been made, not for Mr. Abramovich to convince the court otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, as I have already mentioned, the context in which the business arrangements between Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were concluded was the Russian business and political environment in the period 1995-2001.  Whilst the respective parties’ historical experts were able to give certain background evidence in relation to the period, ultimately it was for the court to decide whether, or the extent to which, that context explained or informed the probabilities of the arrangements being as respectively contended for by either side.  The Russian context gave rise to another problem;  apart from the fact that many witnesses gave their evidence in Russian, the business arrangements between Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have been discussed, made and conducted in Russian;  the nuances of the words used between them in such discussions would not necessarily be conveyed in translation to the non-Russian speaker;  particular care therefore had to be taken when considering, for example, information given by Mr. Patarkatsishvili to non-Russian speakers such as Mr. Curtis, and Mr. Berezovsky’s English solicitors.</p>

Because of the nature of the factual issues, the case was one where, in the ultimate analysis, the court had to decide whether to believe Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Abramovich.  It was not the type of case where the court was able to accept one party’s evidence in relation to one set of issues and the other party’s evidence in relation to another set of issues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because both the Sibneft and the RusAl claims depended so very heavily on the oral evidence of Mr. Berezovsky, the court needed to have a high degree of confidence in the quality of his evidence.  That meant confidence not only in his ability to recollect things accurately, but also in his objectivity and truthfulness as a witness.  Before addressing his credibility in more detail, I record that Mr. Berezovsky spoke excellent English.  Although his evidence did not always appear on the transcript as syntactically correct, it was easy to understand.  Sometimes he had difficulty in expressing himself and I give full allowance for the fact that, under pressure, he may sometimes have given an answer which did not accurately reflect what he wanted to say.  But he gave his evidence in an assured and confident manner and had little, if any difficulty, in understanding the questions put to him in cross-examination by Mr. Sumption.  Indeed he gave the impression, if not of precisely enjoying the experience, at least of relishing the opportunity to present his story to the court and a large audience, and to fence with Mr. Sumption.  However, I have little doubt that he found the experience a stressful one.  At all times he had a Russian interpreter at his side, who was able to provide immediate assistance on the relatively few occasions he required it.  He appeared to have diligently read the transcripts.  He was cross-examined for seven days in all, six days by Mr. Sumption and, on the seventh day, by Mr. Malek and Mr. Adkin.  He was unfailingly courteous to the court and to counsel who cross-examined him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A court’s assessment of the credibility of a witness is not meant to be some sort of pseudo-psychological analysis of his character.  But, as submitted by Mr. Sumption, Mr. Berezovsky’s personality was one of the dominant themes of the trial, which provided a key to his credibility as a witness, as well as an explanation for his evidence in relation to some of the critical events.  For that reason, it is appropriate to refer to certain aspects of his personality which were displayed in his evidence, and in his demeanour.  In his time, Mr. Berezovsky had clearly been a person of real political significance in Russia, who had played his part in its transition from a Communist state to a free market and capital-based economy.  He was, and is, as he would be the first to profess, an intelligent man, who was able to engender considerable loyalty and support from the many people around him who believed in his abilities and powers of influence.  He had been a skilful manipulator of the Russian media, and was astute in deploying it, and his numerous contacts, in order to achieve his political and personal goals.  He certainly regarded himself as a champion of the free press in Russia.  But, by the time of the trial he had been in exile for some 11 years, and was no longer a colossus bestriding centre stage of the Russian political scene, as he had once been.  The evidence demonstrated that he personally resented Mr. Abramovich, whom he regarded as a former protégé whom he had created from nothing, but who had survived under a Russian regime, which Mr. Berezovsky hates, for what he regards as its unacceptable political values and for driving him into exile.  The evidence also established that Mr. Berezovsky resented the business stature and wealth which Mr. Abramovich had acquired, as a result of being publicly perceived as the owner of Sibneft and, with Mr. Deripaska, as the creator of RusAl.  </p>

At times, the evidence which he gave was deliberately dishonest;  sometimes he was clearly making his evidence up as he went along in response to the perceived difficulty in answering the questions in a manner consistent with his case;  at other times, I gained the impression that he was not necessarily being deliberately dishonest, but had deluded himself into believing his own version of events.  On occasions he tried to avoid answering questions by making long and irrelevant speeches, or by professing to have forgotten facts which he had been happy to record in his pleadings or witness statements.  He embroidered and supplemented statements in his witness statements, or directly contradicted them.  He departed from his own previous oral evidence, sometimes within minutes of having given it.  When the evidence presented problems, Mr. Berezovsky simply changed his case so as to dovetail it in with the new facts, as best he could.  He repeatedly sought to distance himself from statements in pleadings and in witness statements which he had signed or approved, blaming the “interpretation” of his lawyers, as if this somehow diminished his personal responsibility for accounts of the facts, which must have been derived from him and which he had verified as his own.</p>

In response to the justification defence put forward by <span style="font-style:italic">Forbes,</span> Mr. Berezovsky denied in pleadings and statements many of the facts alleged by Forbes.  However, in the present proceedings, Mr. Berezovsky relies upon many of those same facts, which he now says are true, as the basis for his claims in respect of Sibneft.  There were significantly inconsistencies between the evidence which he gave in this litigation, and the statements which he made in the <span style="font-style:italic">Forbes</span> litigation.  In that case, it suited his purposes to lie about the true nature of his relationship with the Yeltsin government;  for example he denied allegations concerning his use of his relationship with Ms. Dyachenko and Mr. Yumashev to influence President Yeltsin;  he also denied that he had personally lobbied President Yeltsin or that he had been involved in the “fixing” of the Sibneft loans for shares auction (a topic addressed below).  In the present case, however, it suited his purposes to emphasise that relationship and to claim that he had played a significant role in the auction.  There was no explanation for the divergences in his evidence other than that, in one case, it suited Mr. Berezovsky to present the facts in one way, and, in the second case, it suited him to present them wholly differently.

As Mr. Berezovsky admitted in his evidence about this:  “I changed my recollection many times<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="38">

However, once documents had been discovered showing that he been in the United States during that period, he changed his position and asserted for the first time in a sixth witness statement that the meeting occurred on or very shortly after 7 December 2000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="39">

Given the passage of time, I would not have had a problem about that change in dating the occurrence of the meeting, had not Mr. Berezovsky, in his oral evidence, claimed to have an actual recollection that the meeting occurred on 7 December and to be able to give a number of circumstantial details about it.  As I find later in this judgment, the meeting did not take place in December 2000, and therefore Mr. Berezovsky must have deliberately fabricated his evidence about this topic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Another example of Mr. Berezovsky’s propensity to change his case, where it was shown not to fit with the known facts, was the change following his Russian law expert’s opinion that the alleged 1995 Agreement was insufficiently certain to extend to the partnership said to have been created under its terms in respect of the pre-merger aluminium assets acquired in 2000.  In order to meet this difficulty, Mr. Berezovsky introduced a new agreement, said to have been made in 1999, specifically applying to the aluminium assets.  Then, when told by his expert that, under Russian law, his claim in relation to RusAl was bound to fail, suddenly, in the face of the summary judgment application, Mr. Berezovsky belatedly recalled a “distinct recollection” that there was an express agreement that “British law” would apply.  It is quite normal that a party’s case may develop and change in the course of lengthy and complex litigation.  But the persistent changes in Mr. Berezovsky’s recollections, over the course of the proceedings, in response to a perceived need of what he had to prove, was, to say the least, out of the ordinary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This aspect of his evidence requires greater elaboration.  I regard Mr. Berezovsky’s attempts to conceal the fact that two of his witnesses, Dr. Nosova and her husband, Mr. Lindley, a solicitor, each stood to gain 1% of Mr. Berezovsky’s winnings, (up to $140 million in total) if he won the action, as typical of his attitude towards the integrity of the trial process.  Dr. Nosova was one of the key witnesses for Mr. Berezovsky in this litigation.  In correspondence and in her disclosure statement, Dr. Nosova sought to emphasise her independence from Mr. Berezovsky for the purposes of disclosure, describing herself as a “businesswoman” who had “use of” an office at Mr. Berezovsky’s office premises.  Mr. Lindley was described by Dr. Nosova as having a “managerial” role in this litigation although he sought to downplay it by describing it merely as that of a financial controller.  He attended at least two meetings with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in relation to the litigation in June 2007, where he took lengthy attendance notes and was called to give evidence about them.  Mr. Lindley’s evidence, to the effect that he had not mentally made the connection between the payment and his evidence, was an astounding answer.  In addition, Mr. Berezovsky had agreed to pay 1% of the proceeds of any successful recovery against Mr. Abramovich to a Mr. Cotlick, a long-standing assistant of Mr. Berezovsky’s and a qualified Israeli lawyer, who not only assisted Mr. Berezovsky in the conduct of this litigation but who also played a major role, in conjunction with Addleshaw Goddard, in relation to disclosure of Mr. Berezovsky’s documents, but who was not going to feature as a witness.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These contingency fee agreements were apparently entered into to compensate Mr. Lindley, Dr. Nosova and Mr. Cotlick for managing the litigation on Mr. Berezovsky’s behalf.  According to Mr. Lindley, he drafted Mr. Cotlick’s agreement and Mr. Cotlick (using Mr. Lindley’s draft as a template) prepared Mr. Lindley’s agreement and that of his wife, Dr. Nosova.  The contingency fee arrangements were documented by means of express written agreements about which there can have been no doubt as to their existence or consequences.  There was no justification whatsoever for the fact that these arrangements were not disclosed to Mr. Abramovich’s lawyers, until they were introduced into evidence by Mr. Rabinowitz in re-examination.  Neither Mr. Lindley nor Dr. Nosova referred to their contingency fee arrangements in their witness statements.  It was also notable that Mr. Lindley had not informed his firm, Streathers, in which he was a partner, and which had been previously instructed by Mr. Berezovsky in this litigation, of his contingency fee arrangements until their disclosure in the course of Mr. Berezovsky’s re-examination, notwithstanding that Streathers were receiving professional fees for his work in connection with the case.  Nor were Addleshaw Goddard informed of their existence by any of Dr. Nosova, Mr. Lindley, Mr. Cotlick or Mr. Berezovsky himself.  They were first informed on Friday, 14 October, 2011, after Mr. Berezovsky had given his evidence in cross-examination.  </p>

In particular, on 23 March 2011, Mr. Hastings of Addleshaw Goddard served his fifth witness statement.  The background to the statement was the revelation that Mr. Berezovsky had entered into a contingency fee agreement whereby he agreed to pay 5% of any recovery from the claim to the intermediary who had provided the Le Bourget recording.  In that context, Skadden had applied for details of that arrangement and for details of any other payments made to any witnesses in the dispute.  It was known by that point in time that Dr. Nosova would be a witness.  Mr. Lindley was sent a copy of the fifth witness statement of Mr. Hastings and he accepted in cross-examination that he had read it.  Mr. Cotlick was referred to expressly in that witness statement.  As Mr. Lindley acknowledged, Mr. Cotlick was also aware of Mr. Hastings’ witness statement.  On 29 March 2011 there was a court hearing at which reference was made to Mr. Hastings’ witness statement.  Both Mr. Cotlick and Mr. Lindley were present in court on that occasion and, indeed, sat next to each other.</p>

As was properly accepted in correspondence by Addleshaw Goddard, in light of the contingency fee arrangements, those paragraphs of Mr. Hastings’ witness statement and the confirmation given in the letter dated 13 July 2011 were (unbeknownst to Addleshaw Goddard at the time) incorrect.</p>

But even approaching this incident on the most generous of bases, so far as Mr. Berezovsky is concerned, and assuming that he did not appreciate that there had been a deception, it still raises real concerns about his attitude to the trial process and his credibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The witnesses called by Mr. Berezovsky had no direct evidence to give about critical issues such as the alleged 1995, 1996 and 1999 Agreements or the alleged threats in relation to ORT or Sibneft.  Nor, with the exception of Mr. David Reuben (whose evidence was not in fact supportive of Mr. Berezovsky’s case), and of Mr. Michael Cherney (who declined to appear as a witness, and with whose evidence I deal subsequently), were they able to give any direct evidence in relation to the alleged acquisition by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili of interests in the aluminium assets or RusAl or in relation to the Dorchester Hotel meeting.  These witnesses had not been involved in the relevant events.  The most which their evidence amounted to was, effectively, that the evidence which Mr. Berezovsky was giving at trial was consistent with what he had previously told them.  All Mr. Berezovsky’s witnesses who gave such evidence of previous, allegedly consistent, statements fell into the category of his loyal supporters, who were either fellow exiles with him, or who were, or had at some time been, financially reliant upon him to a considerable extent.  Their evidence was almost exclusively derived from what the witnesses had been told by Mr. Berezovsky.  They were all plainly motivated by a loyal desire to support evidence that had previously been given by Mr. Berezovsky.  Indeed, Mr. Glushkov, who sat through Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence, changed his own evidence in relation to whether his arrest had been a foregone conclusion, from the account which he had previously given not only in his witness statement, but also in his own asylum proceedings, apparently in order to support Mr. Berezovsky’s revised case on this topic.  I could attach very little weight to the evidence of this type given by witnesses such as Mr. Glushkov, Mr. Goldfarb and Mr. Dubov.  Their recollection was, not surprisingly, vague as to details, dates and specifics, and, apart from being totally dependent on what Mr. Berezovsky had told them, also required an ability to differentiate between the various occasions on which the particular witness had discussed the issues with Mr. Berezovsky.  </p>

Although she claimed to know a lot about the background to the case, she was not directly involved in the critical discussions or events relating to Sibneft and RusAl.  Given her undisclosed contingency fee agreement, and that of her husband, she had a substantial financial interest in the outcome of the proceedings, which clearly coloured her approach to her evidence.  She sat in court throughout Mr. Berezovsky’s cross-examination and the impression I formed was that she was motivated by a desire to craft her evidence to promote his case.  Apart from her loyalty to Mr. Berezovsky, she departed from her evidence, both written and oral, when it suited her, and at times gave the impression of making up her evidence as she went along.  I address specific aspects of her evidence in greater detail below.  Consequently, I therefore approached her evidence with considerable caution.</p>

It was obvious that his ability to speak, understand or read English was limited and I had no reservations about the genuine nature of his wish to give his evidence in Russian.  Although it is always more difficult to cross-examine through an interpreter, in this case, because of the technical skills and abilities of the simultaneous translators, that difficulty was significantly reduced.  I did not form the impression that Mr. Abramovich in any way used the translation process as a means of evading giving a direct answer or of delaying his answers to any questions put to him.  Despite the fact that he gave his evidence in Russian, I was able to form a clear view of his demeanour and credibility from the answers which he gave and the manner in which he gave them.

However well-prepared a witness may be, or however controlled he may appear to be, when giving his answers, it is very rare that the court is not able to reach a conclusion as to whether he is telling the truth or not.  Contrary to Mr. Berezovsky’s views, Mr. Abramovich did not present himself in cross-examination as a “humble man” or as someone who was attempting to appear likeable, or to be liked.  Whilst his demeanour was reserved and restrained, he made no attempt to pretend that he was anything other than a highly successful and very wealthy businessman, who had made a very substantial fortune in the challenging Russian business environment of the 1990s and early 2000s, largely as a result of his and his colleagues’ entrepreneurial, management and financial skills.  I also had little doubt that, if the need arose, he would have been prepared to act ruthlessly in a business context to achieve his commercial goals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But there was a marked contrast between the manner in which Mr. Berezovsky gave his evidence and that in which Mr. Abramovich did so.  Mr. Abramovich indeed gave careful and thoughtful answers, which were focused on the specific issues about which he was being questioned.  At all times, he was concerned to ensure that he understood the precise question, and the precise premise underlying the question which he was being asked.  He was meticulous in making sure that, despite the difficulties of the translation process, he understood the sense of the questions which were being put to him.  To a certain extent that difference, no doubt, reflected the different personalities of the two men, for which I gave every allowance possible to Mr. Berezovsky.  But it also reflected Mr. Abramovich’s responsible approach to giving answers which he could honestly support.  Where he had relevant knowledge, he was able to give full and detailed answers; he took care to distinguish between his own knowledge, reconstructed assumptions and speculation.  He was not afraid to give answers which a less scrupulous witness would have considered unhelpful to his case.  For example, he never sought to underplay the significant and essential role which Mr. Berezovsky had played in the acquisition of Sibneft, and, likewise, the essential contribution which Mr. Patarkatsishvili had made in connection with the acquisition of the aluminium assets.  There were few differences between Mr. Abramovich’s oral evidence and the evidence given in his witness statements.  Such differences as there were, were largely attributable to the legitimate addition of corroborative detail in response to questions in cross-examination, and to difficulties inherent in the translation process.  Whilst, not surprisingly, there were occasions where his evidence was inconsistent, or his recollection was faulty, or had changed over time, none of these occurrences was so startling as to give me concerns about his basic truthfulness and reliability as a witness.</p>

Mr. Abramovich clearly found the cross-examination process a stressful one, not least because he was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> in control of the questions which he was being asked, or of the court process, and because he clearly needed to concentrate hard to understand and answer the questions.  </p>

Contrary to the assertion that he, together with Mr. Shvidler and Mr. Tenenbaum, were involved in a smear campaign, Mr. Abramovich was extremely reticent about referring to personal or reputational matters concerning Mr. Berezovsky and did not attempt to embarrass him.

Similarly there was no basis for the suggestion that Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Shvidler had colluded in relation to such evidence, or that Mr. Shvidler and Mr. Tenenbaum had colluded in relation to the text message evidence concerning Mr. Fomichev, with which I deal in greater detail below.</p>

Their evidence was broadly consistent with that of Mr. Abramovich.  Their evidence was attacked on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky on the basis that, so far as the employees were concerned, their loyalty overrode their honesty, and so far as they and Mr. Deripaska were concerned, that they had colluded in relation to various aspects of their evidence.  It is not necessary for me to analyse the detailed evidence relating to the issue of alleged collusion set out in Mr. Berezovsky’s closing submissions, Mr. Abramovich’s Errata schedule and Mr. Berezovsky’s Second Schedule.  The allegation was not supported by the evidence.  The evidence showed that, although Mr. Abramovich’s various witnesses had, to a certain extent, discussed the events in which they had been mutually involved, prior to making their witness statements, each, when making their witness statements and giving their oral evidence had given their own personal evidence and recollection.  Indeed Dr. Nosova described a very similar process within the inner circle of Mr. Berezovsky’s advisers, as well as their attempts to reconstruct dates and events from documents.  Such practices are the normal, everyday reality of litigation, and unobjectionable, provided that the particular witness applies his own mind to what he can remember from his own knowledge, and distinguishes between what he personally can recall and what he has learned from someone else.  It is rare to find that the integrity of individual recollection is preserved 100% intact;  but, absent something more, such practices do not amount to “collusion”.  I did not find it “astonishing”, as Mr. Rabinowitz suggested, that Mr. Abramovich’s witnesses did not refer to these type of discussions in their witness statements.  Mr. Berezovsky’s witnesses did not do so either.</p>

I address this topic elsewhere but merely comment here that full and satisfactory explanations were given for the absence of certain documents, in particular by Ms. Goncharova.

Mr. Bosov was an independent third party witness out of the jurisdiction, whose witness statement was served under a hearsay notice solely to address a disclosure matter relating to an alleged video recording in the possession of Mr. Abramovich.

That is because, as I have already explained, Mr. Berezovsky’s claim to have had an interest in RusAl is ultimately dependent on his assertion that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had previously owned half of the aluminium assets which were contributed to the merger with Mr. Deripaska.  That suggestion in turn depends upon Mr. Berezovsky’s contention that there was an agreement to give him the same interest in the pre-merger aluminium assets as he claims to have had in Sibneft, and that the aluminium assets were acquired with Sibneft assets or with that of his, Mr. Berezovsky’s, claimed share in Sibneft profits.  </p>

That is because, for example, evidence of the subsequent conduct of the parties in the period 2000-2004, that might tend to show that Mr. Abramovich was operating as a partner to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in relation to RusAl, might have had a bearing on whether the parties had indeed made an agreement in the terms alleged by Mr. Berezovsky to share their business interests on a 50:50 basis.</p>

I proposed that the ownership should be split 50:50 between Badri and me on the one side and Mr. Abramovich on the other.  My reasoning was that Mr. Abramovich would be in charge of the management of the company.  I knew that Mr. Abramovich might offer some of the benefits of his ownership of the company to his associates such as Eugene Shvidler.  I made this decision on the same principle as I had proposed to share with Badri, 50:50.”</p>

This process involved a loan to the State (effectively by the pledgee), a pledge by the State of 51% of the share capital of Sibneft as security for the loan, and the possibility of default by the State, when the shares would be sold by the pledgee and available for purchase by the highest bidder.</p>

He had known Mr. Abramovich for only a few months, had not yet participated with him in any business venture, and in any event regarded Mr. Abramovich as a small-time oil trader with no business track record. His case was that he allowed Mr. Abramovich a 50% stake in Sibneft in order to incentivise him as its manager. But on the basis of this term as to future business, he was giving Mr. Abramovich the right to take a stake in any of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s future ventures, even if Mr. Abramovich was not managing such a venture.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:-0.57in">“53.  <marker name="tab"/>I remember explaining to Mr. Berezovsky [on a Caribbean cruise] that I wanted to combine the Omsk Oil Refinery and Noyabrskneftegaz into a single company, whose management I would control.  I explained that there was the potential to make a lot of money by consolidating control over these companies and directing their sales through my Trading Companies.  At that time, I thought it was necessary first of all to get management control of the new company and only once that was achieved to then start preparations for the auctions to acquire its shares.  I am absolutely certain that at the time he and I did not discuss any ‘loans-for-shares’ programme, because I knew nothing about this at the time, since the idea for such programme itself arose only in the spring of 1995, which I describe below.  Although I gathered from our conversation that Mr. Berezovsky knew little about the oil industry, he was clearly excited by the prospect of a business which had excellent potential for the creation of substantial and regular cash flows.  For myself, I considered that once I got access to the flow of products and ·could introduce efficiency to the management, I would be able to improve my trading income and so be able afford to pay for protection services rendered to my business.  I appreciated from the outset that if he were to provide me with any assistance in relation to the creation of the new company, Mr. Berezovsky would expect a substantial financial reward in return.  This was not something I relished but I was realistic enough to know that without <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> my idea of creating a vertically integrated oil company would remain just an idea.  We absolutely did not discuss either during the Caribbean cruise or subsequently the idea of Mr. Berezovsky owning half of the company.  That frankly did not interest him since our discussion did not assume that the integrated company itself would produce profit, at least not in the short term, and he was only interested in cash flow.  I was also certainly not offering to make Mr. Berezovsky a 50% owner in my Trading Companies since I had built my trading business without him.  I recall that during the cruise Mr. Berezovsky flew to Moscow and then came back to the Caribbean and we continued our communication.  He was then full of talk about OAO Obshestvennoye Rossiyskoe Televidennie (“ORT”), which owned the central Russian television channel, and the importance for him of being able to fund his ORT project.  Mr. Berezovsky and I agreed to continue our discussions once we had returned to Moscow.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky agreed to provide the so-called <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> in return for payments towards his substantial ‘expenses’.  We had a discussion about what these ‘expenses’ were likely to be.  He explained that he required money to fund a company which he actually regarded as ‘his’ company, ORT.  I was aware from our discussions that Mr. Berezovsky regarded it as a key tool for furthering his political ambitions.  I understood from him that one of the conditions of his acquisition of ORT shares from the Russian Government was that he would secure financing for ORT.  Some time after Mr. Berezovsky’s purchase of shares, ORT’s management had declared a temporary moratorium on advertising.  Without the revenue from advertising, Mr. Berezovsky had an even stronger need for cash for ORT in particular.</p>

That number was discussed during our meetings at Aleksandrovka.  I also remember that Mr. Berezovsky inquired how much I could make per year if my idea of creation of a vertically-integrated company succeeded.  I understood the inquiry as addressing the total income I could generate from my Trading Companies since at the time that was my only source of income.  I formed the impression that Mr. Berezovsky was making his own judgment about which of the many projects he was being offered at around that time would be worth agreeing to support.  I knew he needed to be satisfied that I could pay his fee, particularly if the new business was not the success I had hoped.  Accordingly, I informed him that I currently generated around US$40 million per year through my Trading Companies and that I expected to be able increase that to around US$100 million per year, assuming I could secure control of a new company comprising both the Omsk Oil Refinery and Noyabrskneftegaz.  I am absolutely clear· that he did not fix his fee by reference to 50% of my anticipated trading income or otherwise make any reference to sharing profits.  Rather, he told me the approximate fee and asked about my likely income the following year in order to see if I could afford him.</p>

However, already in March 1995, he demanded that I make the first payment, which I assumed at the time was his way of both indicating that our <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> relationship had started and also letting me know where the balance of power lay.  It was clear to me that he wanted to receive money from me up front, before actually providing any service.</p>

Nor did we have an agreement as to what particular amounts would have to be paid other than for the first year, and I assumed that this would depend each year on the nature of services to be provided during particular time periods and what the expenses of Mr. Berezovsky and ORT would be.  Mr. Berezovsky showed no interest in the Trading Companies or their names, never required me to furnish him with accounts or financial statements for the Trading Companies, and we did not consider formalising what we discussed.  Our agreement was a practical arrangement where each party had to prove his worth as events developed and the participants would be bound by mutual understanding;  moreover, breaking such an understanding would not only end the relationship but entail certain negative repercussions as well.  There were too many uncertainties at that time in Russia about what the future business and political climate would be.  We certainly never discussed or agreed about plans to acquire jointly (in any proportions) the oil company.  Moreover, there was no discussion about Sibneft cash flows ever becoming the source of funding for Mr. Berezovsky.  Nor did we discuss then or afterwards forming a partnership for any such purpose, as I understand Mr. Berezovsky now alleges.</p>

The evidence showed that he was the classic power broker;  he described himself as one of the most influential oligarchs in Russia.  His influence derived, as Professor Fortescue stated, and as he himself confirmed in his evidence, primarily from his connections within the Kremlin but also from his ability to operate in conjunction with other oligarchs, and from the control which he was, in 1995, in the process of acquiring over the national television network in Russia, ORT, formerly owned by the State corporation, Ostankino.  </p>

The broadcasting business was known to be heavily loss-making.  Mr. Berezovsky faced a funding shortfall despite drawing on LogoVAZ and other fellow investors.  The lack of advertising revenue limited the prospect of financial recovery at least in the medium term.  Mr. Berezovsky was therefore looking for another source of funding.  </p>

Dr. Nosova suggested in her written evidence that in November 1993 Mr. Berezovsky had visited various cities primarily for the purpose of promoting investments in AVVA.  However, she claimed that Mr. Berezovsky also used this trip to explore investment opportunities in the oil sector, and, whilst he and the colleagues travelling with him were in Noyabrsk, Mr. Berezovsky organised a visit to the oil fields there, in order to meet Mr. Viktor Gorodilov, the President of Noyabrskneftegaz, for the purpose of having exploratory discussions about investing in Noyabrskneftegaz’s business.  Mr. Voloshin, however, said that the purpose of the trip to the city of Noyabrsk, as with the visits to the other cities, was to attract co-investors in AVVA, and they involved а series of promotional presentations to potential investors (private and corporate).  Mr. Voloshin gave evidence in his witness statement to the effect that Mr. Berezovsky did not express any interest in oil investments during the period of this trip, or that if he did, he did not discuss such proposals with him.  Nor did Mr. Voloshin have any recollection of hearing about а meeting with Mr. Viktor Gorodilov during this trip.  Neither witness was cross-examined on the point however.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">His business career had begun in 1987, when he was employed as a mechanic in a construction office.  At the time of Mr. Gorbachev’s announcement of the start of “perestroika”, allowing for the establishment of small businesses known as “cooperatives”, he was one of the country’s early entrepreneurs, serving from 1989 through 1991 as chairman of a cooperative which specialised in the manufacture of plastic toys for children.  In 1991, he had begun to participate in the trading and transportation of oil, petroleum products, mineral fertilisers and cement.  In the period from 1991 to 1996, he founded his first petroleum trading companies:  Russian MPI A.V.K and AOZT Petroltrans (“Petroltrans”) from 1991 to 1993, and then, in 1994, a Swiss company, Runicom SA (“Runicom SA”).  He had two other petroleum products trading businesses as well as fuel oil and cement trading companies, the most important of which was BMP in Germany.  Petroltrans, BMP and Runicom SA together became one of the largest petroleum trading networks in Russia, sourcing their products, from among other sources, from the government-owned Omsk Oil, in Western Siberia, as well as from refineries in Ukhta, Samara and Moscow.  Petroltrans managed logistics, sales and distribution of petroleum products on the domestic market.  According to Mr. Abramovich, and Mr. Shvidler, whose accounts I have no reason to disbelieve:  from 1993 BMP was a leading exporter of fuel oil, petrol and diesel to markets in Romania and Moldova;  the network of companies began by trading nearly 400,000 tonnes of petroleum product exports in 1993 and rapidly expanded to handle an annual volume of 3 - 3.5 million tonnes in the following year;  in 1994, it also expanded its product line to include petrochemicals and aromatic hydrocarbons, which it exported to markets in Western Europe;  the network was the top supplier of fuel to power stations and factories in Romania and Moldova;  it was thus a natural progression to move into trading electricity, cement and aluminium produced in that region.  At trial these trading companies were referred to as Mr. Abramovich’s “Trading Companies”, regardless of whether they were domiciled in Russia or abroad.  I shall likewise so refer to them hereafter.</p>

In his principal witness statement at trial, Mr. Berezovsky described Mr. Abramovich as “a small scale oil trader who had not achieved anything in business in late 1994”.  Mr. Berezovsky was equally scathing in his oral evidence about Mr. Abramovich’s success at that time.  He described Mr. Abramovich as not being “smart”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="85">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Berezovsky Day 4, page 16.</p>

He accepted that he knew nothing about the size of Mr. Abramovich’s business or the financial situation of his Trading Companies.  According to Mr. Patarkatsishvili, when Mr. Berezovsky later introduced him to Mr. Abramovich he described him as a “nice boy who wanted to discuss commercial projects”.  That description underestimated Mr. Abramovich’s business achievements at that date, and was also inconsistent with Mr. Berezovsky’s own recognition, in an earlier witness statement, that Mr. Abramovich had given him “the impression of being a serious businessman” when they first met in 1994.  It was also inconsistent with a description of Mr. Abramovich given by Pietro Marino, Mr. Berezovsky’s then solicitor, as “an emerging and reasonably successful oil trader” in his first statement (the accuracy of which Mr. Berezovsky expressly confirmed).  However, even after their first meeting, Mr. Berezovsky never, subsequently looked upon Mr. Abramovich as an equal to himself.  At trial, Mr. Berezovsky spoke disparagingly of Mr. Abramovich’s business talents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the principal trading counterparties of Mr. Abramovich’s oil trading group was Omsk Oil, which operated a large modern refinery at Omsk in Western Siberia.  The refinery was supplied with crude oil by Noyabrskneftegaz, one of the largest producers in Russia.  In the course of his trading operations, Mr. Abramovich had developed good relationships with both companies.  Both were at the time in public ownership, and, in Mr. Abramovich’s opinion, were not well managed.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that, as a result of a meeting that he had attended in October 1994, he had conceived the idea of creating a new vertically integrated oil company combining both the production and the refining businesses.  He believed that he could make more money if he could obtain management control of the combined entity and run it in conjunction with his existing oil trading network.  To achieve the integration of Omsk refinery and Noyabrskneftegaz as a free-standing enterprise, and acquire management control over them, so as to create a new vertically integrated oil company, Mr. Abramovich needed access to someone who was in a position to influence the key decision-makers in government and to assist in securing the necessary legislation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was suggested to Mr. Abramovich in cross-examination that the idea, or “vision” of integrating the two companies had originated with Mr. Victor Gorodilov, the general director of Noyabrskneftegaz, and not with him.  Mr. Abramovich did not accept this.  Precisely what proposal Mr. Victor Gorodilov may have conceived, or had in mind, or discussed with Mr. Abramovich, is irrelevant.  What was clear from the evidence, as indeed Mr. Berezovsky accepted in both his written and oral evidence, was that it was Mr. Abramovich who brought the proposal of establishing a new vertically integrated oil company, through the merger of the two companies and their effective privatisation, to Mr. Berezovsky.  In his witness statement Mr. Vladimir Voronoff, an associate and close friend of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, claimed that Mr. Berezovsky regarded the creation of Sibneft as his “brainchild”.  Whilst Mr. Berezovsky may well have presented the creation of Sibneft as his own idea to others such as Mr. Voronoff, I am satisfied that, as between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich, the idea of creating Sibneft was brought to the table by Mr. Abramovich.  Such a concept required knowledge of how the various oil enterprises operated and interacted.  This Mr. Abramovich had acquired as a result of his dealings with those enterprises as an oil trader.  It was clear that Mr. Berezovsky did not have such knowledge.  </p>

For the reasons I explain below, our relationship may not qualify as friendship or regular business association.  He did not regard me as an equal.  Our relationship was a peculiarly Russian relationship typical for a particular time in Russia’s post-communist history.  The Russian word to describe the nature of his relationship with me is ‘<span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> [roof]’.  A person providing <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> to another was a person who acted as a protector.  <span style="font-style:italic">Krysha</span> could take the form of political protection or physical protection.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider that the evidence relating to the undoubted friendship between the two men and their families supports Mr. Berezovsky’s case, even if, as Mr. Rabinowitz submitted, Mr. Abramovich attempted to underplay the closeness of that friendship.  In 1995, at the start of their relationship, Mr. Abramovich was a moderately successful, 28 year old businessman, with resources, but not enormous resources, who clearly needed the political influence of a powerful and influential older politician such as Mr. Berezovsky.  The evidence clearly showed that Mr. Berezovsky never regarded Mr. Abramovich as an intellectual or social equal, notwithstanding that their relationship developed into one of friendship.  That was apparent, not only from the evidence relating to incidents such as the Dorchester Hotel meeting, but also from the disparaging terms in which Mr. Berezovsky spoke about Mr. Abramovich’s brain and business achievements.  It was clear, moreover, that the younger man, initially at least, looked up to and respected the elder man.</p>

In order to assess the probabilities as to whether there were indeed contractually binding agreements between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky, in the terms alleged by the latter in relation to Sibneft, it is necessary to have a detailed understanding not only of those events, but also of the part each of the two men played in them and their respective contributions to what happened.  The evidence as to the events themselves (i.e. objectively what happened) was largely not in dispute.  What was in dispute were the roles respectively played by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich in relation to the creation of Sibneft, what was referred to as the loans-for shares programme, and Sibneft’s subsequent privatisation.  In so far as facts were in dispute, the following account reflects my findings in relation to those issues which I consider material.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further Presidential Decree and a Government Decree, both dated 27 November 1995, approved arrangements for selling, by auction, the right to enter into a “loans-for-shares” agreement in respect of the 51% of Sibneft shares to be retained in State ownership.  Under these arrangements, participants in the auction were to make competitive bids stating the amounts which they were willing to lend to the State.  The bidder offering the largest loan would enter into a loan agreement and security documentation in prescribed form, taking a pledge by way of security over the 51% of the equity reserved to the State, and acquiring the right to manage that holding for three years.  The successful bidder would obtain no property in the Sibneft shares by virtue of these arrangements.  In the event of a default, the successful bidder would be required to auction the shares and apply the proceeds in repayment of the loan.  </p>

What was being sold was the right to lend money to the State on the security of a pledge of the 51% shareholding in Sibneft which the State proposed to retain.  Under the terms of the pledge, the lender would have the right to manage the company for a period of three years.  Under the terms of the pledge, the lender became nominal holder of the shares only whilst ownership remained with the Russian government<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="93">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was an issue about whether it was inevitable that the Russian government would default on these loans, with the result that the State’s 51% holding would in due course be sold, but the area of dispute was narrow.  At the time of the decree authorising the loans, there was no provision in the Russian federal budget for their repayment, but that might or might not have changed later.  Mr. Berezovsky said that it was practically inevitable that the loan would go into default because the Russian government was bankrupt.  Mr. Shvidler’s evidence was that default was probable but by no means certain.  One of the many uncertainties affecting the position was the forthcoming 1996 Presidential election.  If the Communist candidate were to be elected, there would be no question of the shares then being allowed to fall into private hands.  The precise degree of likelihood that the loan to the State would go into default is not an issue that it is necessary for me to decide;  all I need say is that it was highly likely, but not inevitable.  </p>

Inkombank was the main creditor of Sameko at the time and had been pushing Sameko to take part in the Sibneft auction as Inkombank’s bidding vehicle.  Mr. Abramovich had learnt of its proposed bid, and had discussed it with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, who had said that he would seek to persuade the General Director of Sameko, Maxim Ovodenko (“Mr. Ovodenko”), to withdraw Sameko’s bid.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili, together with Mr. Victor Gorodilov, travelled to Samara a day or two before the auction to negotiate with Mr. Ovodenko.

Mr. Berezovsky has always robustly rejected these criticisms, but at trial neither he, nor Mr. Abramovich, demurred from them.  Mr. Berezovsky made the different point, however, that the State received good value because, until the businesses incorporated in Sibneft were turned round by their new management, they made large losses which were a burden to the State.  It is not necessary for me to comment upon, let alone decide, whether the criticisms of the Audit Chamber were well-founded, or whether the authorisation, or conduct of the auction was corrupt or unlawful practice as a matter of Russian law at the time<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="98">

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Once the introduction had been made, however, it was Mr. Abramovich who conducted the negotiations to raise the finance for NFK’s bid.  Whilst Mr. Smolensky may have met informally with Mr. Berezovsky to discuss the loans-for-shares auction with him, the negotiations with SBS of the terms for the financing of the loan were conducted by Mr. Abramovich and his team, including in particular Mr. Andrei Gorodilov, with, on the SBS side, Mr. Smolensky, Mr. Aleksey Rasskazov, Mr. Grigoriev and other employees of SBS.  The commercial reason why SBS was willing to lend its name to the bid, apart from the fact that it was fully cash collateralised, was the agreement that, if the bid were successful, SBS would obtain all Sibneft’s and Runicom’s banking business.  Sibneft’s cash flow by late 1995 was in the region of $ 1 billion per year, and thus to become the principal banker to Sibneft was a significant coup for SBS.  That commercial driver had nothing to do with Mr. Berezovsky’s association with Mr. Smolensky.  Mr. Grigoriev’s evidence also made it clear that the fact that SBS agreed to provide financing for NFK’s bid had nothing to do with SBS’ financing of ORT.  According to Mr. Grigoriev, SBS did not regard the ORT project funding as commercially profitable and had provided a soft loan of $ 55.4 million finance to ORT quite regardless of the loans-for-shares auction relating to Sibneft.  </p>

	      </authorialNote>, Mr. Abramovich did indeed contribute his own, or, at least his own company, Runicom’s, funds, in an amount of US $17.3 million to NFK’s bid, since that amount was deposited with SBS by way of cash collateral.  To that extent Mr. Abramovich and his business interests were at risk.  There was no evidence to suggest that Mr. Berezovsky in any way contributed to the ability of Runicom to raise such a sum by means of trade financing agreements.  Mr. Berezovsky asserted in his evidence that it was “completely wrong” that Mr. Abramovich had provided funds through Runicom because, alleged Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Abramovich did not have such amounts available at that time.

	      </authorialNote> that the trade finance agreements that were entered into by Noyabrskneftegaz and Omsk Oil, which enabled those companies to lodge cash collateral in the sum of US $100.3 million in their deposit accounts with SBS, resulted from the assistance of Mr. Berezovsky.  Nor do I accept the implied suggestion that it was because of his relationship with the Red directors that Noyabrskneftegaz and Omsk Oil were prepared in effect to provide their own funds as collateral for the financing of NFK’s bid to acquire management control of Sibneft.  There was no evidence to support any such suggestion.  Apart from the participation referred to above on the part of Mr. Berezovsky in persuading Bank Menatep to put in a lower bid at the auction, it was Mr. Abramovich and his team who were responsible for making the arrangements for the loans-for-shares auction, including those relating to the back-to-back guarantee given by Bank Menatep.  I do not accept the assertion that the involvement of Bank Menatep as guarantor of SBS’s obligation to the State under the loans-for-shares agreement was also “… thanks in very large measure to Mr. Berezovsky’s involvement”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="109">

	      </authorialNote>.  Whilst, no doubt, Mr. Berezovsky’s relationship with Mr. Khodorkovsky, the owner of Bank Menatep, and Leonid Nevzlin, a President of Bank Menatep, greased the wheels for Mr. Abramovich, and was very valuable in that respect, it was the latter, together with his colleagues, who were responsible for negotiating the terms of the guarantee which involved little or no risk to Bank Menatep, given the cash collateral deposited with SBS.  Mr. Nevzlin claimed, that, at Mr. Berezovsky’s request, he had had a role in relation to Bank Menatep’s involvement.  But this was not borne out in cross-examination.  He admitted that he did not know anything about the security for the loan, or the details of the deposits at SBS, and did not appear to be aware that the only reason for the Bank Menatep guarantee was because of the Central Bank rules, rather than because SBS (given its fully secured status) needed the guarantee.  Moreover neither he nor Mr. Berezovsky were involved in the negotiations between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Konstantin Kagalovsky of Bank Menatep in relation to its involvement as guarantor.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence was that he expended considerable effort in attempting to obtain funding for the project.  I have no doubt that the critical issue of raising finance would have been discussed as between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky, possibly also with Mr. Shvidler present, on occasions prior to the auction.  As the latter described, at that time they were all reviewing their connections to see if they knew people who might be able to assist.  However, although Mr. Berezovsky did contact his acquaintance, the financier, George Soros, in the hope that Mr. Soros would assist, and may well also have canvassed other potential investors in Europe and the Far East, these approaches came to nothing.  The proposal was regarded as far too risky for investors outside Russia.  </p>

I prefer Mr. Shvidler’s account.  He was a principal negotiator in Mr. Abramovich’s team and was responsible for organising funding and financial matters in consultation with Mr. Abramovich.  His evidence was that, although Dr. Nosova may have been advising Mr. Berezovsky, she was not involved in the auction process, or with the negotiations between NKF and third parties.  Indeed she was not generally even present at meetings at which the real business was discussed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr. Dubov, one of Mr. Berezovsky’s witnesses, gave unchallenged evidence that, towards the end of 1995, he attended SBS with the LogoVAZ seal, having been told by Mr. Patarkatsishvili that he was in financial negotiations with SBS and might require a guarantee from LogoVAZ and Dr. Dubov’s signature.  Dr. Dubov was shown a draft of the guarantee which it was proposed that LogoVAZ would give.  He did not recall to whom the loan was to be given.  He was kept hanging around SBS offices for some time but, in the event, no guarantee from LogoVAZ was required.  It was for an amount close to $100 million, which, according to Dr. Dubov, was approximately half of what LogoVAZ was worth at the time, which was a matter which concerned him.  Mr. Grigoriev did not recall any discussion of a guarantee;  he commented that such a guarantee might have been prepared, but that, if it was, then it was not in connection with the Sibneft transaction but rather in connection with a loan to ORT which was also being documented at that time.  However ORT’s line of credit which was being negotiated was only in the sum of approximately $20million, whereas a figure of $100 million was close to the amount which SBS had undertaken to lend in respect of the Sibneft transaction.  Mr. Abramovich himself did not recall any discussion about a proposed guarantee from LogoVAZ and pointed out that, in his view, the required amount would have been significantly greater than half of the financial capacity of LogoVAZ at that time.  Whilst I accept that there may have been some discussion as between Mr. Patarkatsishvili and an SBS representative about the possibility of LogoVAZ providing a guarantee, it clearly came to nothing.  </p>

Firma Sins was a company owned as to 49.99% by ZAO Branko and as to 49.99% by ZAO PK-Trast.  It was common ground that ZAO Branko was (indirectly) owned by Mr. Abramovich.

Mr. Abramovich’s evidence (which I accept) was:  that he asked Mr. Berezovsky to become a co-founder of the new company, given the latter’s powerful political position in order to make it easier to resolve various issues with different governmental agencies and because the association with Mr. Berezovsky gave credibility to the bid;  and that Mr. Berezovsky agreed to do so.

The latter discussed the details with Mr. Alexei Grigoriev, at that time the Chairman of the SBS Management Board.  The loan was initially secured by guarantees provided by Noyabrskneftegaz, Omsk Oil and Runicom, and then by the pledge of the Sibneft shares previously acquired by Runicom.  Again Mr. Berezovsky suggested that the reason why he had not been asked by Mr. Abramovich to contribute to the funding of the bid, or had not needed to discuss the bid with him, was that the funds used to finance the bid had been generated from profits earned by Sibneft, “… which belonged to me, to Badri [Mr. Patarkatsishvili] and to [Mr. Abramovich]”.

	      </authorialNote>.  Mr. Grigoriev was extensively cross-examined in relation to certain inconsistent evidence which he had given to the Russian prosecuting authorities in relation to Mr. Abramovich’s participation in this process.  Mr. Grigoriev explained in his cross-examination why his evidence to the Russian prosecutor was incorrect.  He had been summoned to answer questions about a particular loan to Runicom SA and it was in that context that he said that he had not met or discussed matters with Mr. Abramovich.  At the time, he thought, in the context of the enquiry, that it was a “minor issue” that did not warrant correction.  Despite the fact that he had clearly not given a full and truthful explanation to the Russian prosecutor, I accept his explanation as to why he had not corrected his evidence.  As far as the evidence he gave in these proceedings was concerned, I conclude that he gave his evidence honestly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third and last cash auction was held on 25 October 1996.  The remaining 15% of the 49% of the share capital of Sibneft, which had been earmarked for privatisation, was sold to ZAO Refine Oil (“Refine Oil”) for approximately $ 48 million.  The purchase price consisted of $ 12.5 million paid by Refine Oil under the share sale agreement, and $ 35.5 million in obligations undertaken to fund Sibneft’s investment programme;  these included direct investments into Sibneft’s subsidiaries;  annual lease payments for Sibneft’s Moscow Representative Office;  and payment of tax arrears owed by Sibneft’s subsidiaries, payable to the federal budget.  It was common ground that Refine Oil was (indirectly) owned by Mr. Abramovich.  The bid was funded by a further loan from SBS, secured by guarantees by Sibneft group companies and the pledge of Sibneft shares by companies controlled by Mr. Abramovich.  Again Mr. Berezovsky accepted that he was not involved in the auction and contributed nothing to the funding of the acquisition of the 15% holding.  Mr. Andrei Gorodilov gave evidence that no assistance had been received from Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili in relation to the acquisition or its funding.  Again Mr. Berezovsky suggested that the reason why he had not been asked by Mr. Abramovich to contribute to the funding of the bid, or had been involved in it, was that the funds used to finance the bid had been generated from profits earned by Sibneft which he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili jointly owned with Mr. Abramovich.  </p>

According to Mr. Shvidler, Mr. Patarkatsishvili would certainly have seen it as his role to discourage other bidders.  Mr. Abramovich’s team, and, in particular, Mr. Gorodilov, arranged the incorporation of another vehicle for the purpose of bidding in this auction, namely OOO Finansovaya Neftyanaya Korporatsiya (“FNK”), a different corporate entity from NFK.

In other words, as with the funds used to finance the earlier auctions, he claimed that, in reality, the cash collateral used to provide security for the SBS finance derived directly or indirectly from profits generated either by Sibneft and its subsidiaries (Noyabrskneftegaz and Omsk Oil) themselves, or by Runicom as a result of its trading with those companies, whether by means of transfer pricing or otherwise.

All other funds used to acquire shares were therefore a result of the efforts of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in 1995, in securing support from SBS;  in securing control of Noyabrskneftegaz and Omsk oil refinery;  and (after January 1996) in enabling Mr. Abramovich to acquire shares in Sibneft.”</p>

But Mr. Berezovsky did not participate in the cash auctions of Sibneft shares or in the negotiations conducted by Mr. Abramovich’s team to obtain finance for those share acquisitions.

There was a marked difference between Mr. Berezovsky’s active involvement and participation in the former, and his apparent indifference to the latter acquisitions, which is difficult to comprehend if indeed the deal between him and Mr. Abramovich was that Mr. Berezovsky (together with Mr. Patarkatsishvili) were to acquire Sibneft shares in partnership with Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence was that he played no part in the subsequent auctions and did not need to do so, because Mr. Abramovich was organising everything.  But that hardly explained Mr. Berezovsky’s lack of interest in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">result</span> of the auctions if he personally was indeed acquiring an interest in any Sibneft shares acquired as a result of the auction process.  </p>

According to Mr. Berezovsky’s case, at this stage – i.e. late 1995 early 1996 - there were no arrangements in place (under the terms of the alleged 1995 Agreement) for his stake to be held for him indirectly via Mr. Abramovich or one of his companies;  it was only in May or June 1996 that such an agreement (the alleged 1996 Agreement) was made.  </p>

At the least, one might have expected Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to have raised some point with Mr. Abramovich as to what price was going to be paid for any Sibneft shares which the three partners were to acquire, how “their” Sibneft shares were going to be paid for, and how they were going to be held on their behalf, and to have expressed some interest in the outcome of the auction.  </p>

Yet there did not appear to have been any obligation on Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to pay for any Sibneft shares acquired by Mr. Abramovich;  none was pleaded or referred to in Mr. Berezovsky’s witness statements.  </p>

I have set out my conclusions above as to the role played by Mr. Berezovsky in this respect.  The use which was made of his contacts with SBS and Bank Menatep, and the political influence which he exercised behind the scenes, again was wholly consistent with a <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>-type relationship.  His non-participation in the arrangements for the bids made at the subsequent share auctions at which the Sibneft shares were acquired, and his indifference to what was going on in relation to such acquisitions, is likewise wholly explicable in a situation where Mr. Berezovsky was providing political patronage for cash.  It is not explicable if Mr. Berezovsky was himself acquiring a partnership interest in such assets.  His constant refrain that his priorities at the relevant time were ORT and the forthcoming presidential election was not convincing;  such priorities were not a reason why he (or, at least, his in-house advisers, on his behalf) would not have been interested, at least, in the number of Sibneft shares that had been acquired, the cost of such acquisition and the manner in which they were held upon his and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s behalf.  </p>

I have already expressed my view above that the availability of such funds was not “the direct result of the three partners’ efforts in 1995”.  Mr. Berezovsky’s initial exercise of political influence had created the opportunity for Mr. Abramovich;  but it was Mr. Abramovich who exploited that opportunity, by thereafter buying Sibneft shares and utilising Sibneft’s subsidiaries’ own cash deposits to secure the financing, or, possibly<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="119">

Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was convincing on this point;  there could be no realistic expectation of Mr. Berezovsky exerting his influence at the Kremlin without a prior commitment on Mr. Abramovich’s part to remunerate him for that activity;  Mr. Abramovich regarded Mr. Berezovsky’s personal and political reputation and standing at that time as considerable;  given the potential future revenues which Mr. Abramovich rightly believed he could generate by consolidating control over Omsk Oil Refinery and Noyabrskneftegaz, through the incorporation of Sibneft, and directing their sales through his Trading Companies, he would not have needed the track record of a prior business relationship to justify an agreement to pay large sums for Mr. Berezovsky’s future assistance.  </p>

I accept, of course, that this is not what was pleaded by Mr. Berezovsky.  He did not suggest, for example, that the payments made from February 1995 and thereafter in that year were payments on account of anticipated profits from the alleged joint venture.

Mr. Abramovich said that this was because of my political involvement and my high-profile support for and relationship with President Yeltsin.  In the event that President Yeltsin lost his re-election bid and the Communists returned to power (as many thought would happen), it was expected that I would be their first and foremost target.  This was a commonly held view by those inside and outside of Russia.  George Soros warned me that if the Communists were elected I would ‘hang from a lamp post’.  Mr. Abramovich said that I should distance myself from the company and that there should not be any papers linking me to it as otherwise this might harm Sibneft.  Though the agreement between Mr. Abramovich, Badri and me was not written down, all parties to it were clear as to what their obligations were to their partners.  There was no question in my mind that all three of us understood that we were binding ourselves to behave in accordance with our agreement.  I am sure that we all understood that we were to treat each other in good faith as partners.  I do not believe that it occurred to any of us that the force of our agreement, or the rights which we obtained, was affected by not having written it down.  I am told that Mr. Abramovich has argued that the agreement between the three of us should have been in writing.  I did not know that.  I had at this point never been involved in any Russian court proceedings, and it did not occur to me that an agreement between three individuals such as ourselves needed to be in writing.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky seeks to excuse the lack of what would obviously be necessary documentation by making the false claim that I insisted that the agreement between us with regard to Sibneft and all other agreements remain in oral form (Berezovsky 4, paragraph 106).  In fact, the only arrangement between us was in the nature of ‘protection’, and we did not discuss any formalising.  By virtue of its non-legal nature, ‘krysha’ could not have been the subject of compulsory performance through а court petition.  Mr. Berezovsky’s claim that I did not want to formalise our relations in written form, since I was afraid of association with him, is contradicted by my particular efforts during this time to advertise my connection with Mr. Berezovsky and his patronage for my undertakings, including the future Sibneft, as I described in my previous statement.

An agreement of this type on any sensible objective basis was far too complex to be dealt with by a purely oral agreement, even in a culture where purely oral agreements were more common than they are in the West.  Any such joint venture agreement would have had to have contained detailed provisions addressing significant issues such as, for example:  a definition of the profits, or revenues, of Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies regarded as deriving from his acquisition of control of, or involvement with, Sibneft;  management structures;  composition of the board of directors;  whether the restriction on transfers of shares without consent gave rise to pre-emption rights or obligations;  whether, if a right to participate in a new business venture was exercised, what would be the required contribution of the respective partners towards financing and acquisition costs;  and many other matters.  </p>

Moreover even on the assumption that, as Mr. Berezovsky contended, and Mr. Abramovich denied, it was correct as a matter of Russian law that, once the court was satisfied that a partnership or joint venture activity existed between the three men, it would be able to “fill in” any missing details in the terms of the agreement under its relevant default rules<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="128">

The consequences of such an agreement for his future business activities would have been so swingeing, given, for example, the alleged obligation to provide a 50% participation to Mr. Berezovsky/Mr. Patarkatsishvili in every new venture, and the constraints upon dealing with the Sibneft shares, that it is inherently unlikely that he would have agreed to such a proposal without a written record clearly setting out the conditions (for example as to timing of the exercise of the rights, and the provision of capital) attaching to such rights of first refusal and the other constraints on his ability to deal with his assets.  </p>

At that stage, Mr. Berezovsky had only just met Mr. Abramovich, a man of whom he had never previously heard and whom he says he regarded as someone with no significant track record in business.  Indeed, as I have already mentioned, in the early part of his evidence in cross-examination Mr. Berezovsky spoke of Mr. Abramovich’s abilities with some degree of contempt.  The two men had never done a deal together before.  I did not find Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence that by August 1995 he trusted Mr. Abramovich so implicitly, there was no need to have any written agreement, as remotely plausible.  On Mr. Berezovsky’s hypothesis, Mr. Abramovich was being trusted not only to run a multimillion dollar oil business in which Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili owned a 50% share, but also to hold the two men’s ownership interests on their behalf, in a manner that was never made clear to them.  Mr. Berezovsky’s lack of concern with the detail of his financial affairs and the fact that at that date he was concentrating on the re-election of Mr. Yeltsin, provided no satisfactory explanation for the absence of a written agreement.</p>

	      </authorialNote> (on any basis somewhat late in the day), a factor which does not reinforce its credibility.  Second, the reason given by Mr. Berezovsky for Mr. Abramovich’s “insistence” on there being no written record was very difficult to follow.  He appeared to be saying that any written agreement would reveal to the Communists, if they came into power, that he was associated with the company, and that, as a result, they would be more likely to re-nationalise Sibneft, than if merely Mr. Abramovich appeared to be associated with the company.  But the evidence showed that the declared policy of the Communists at the time was to retain the business assets of the State and to renationalise all those which had been previously privatised.  Thus, if the Communists came to power, the likelihood was that any project for acquiring shares in Sibneft would have been doomed, whether Mr. Berezovsky was associated with it or not, and irrespective of whether there was any agreement in writing.  Third, the reality was that Mr. Berezovsky <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>publicly associated with NFK at the time of the Sibneft loans-for-shares auction of 28 December 1995, and Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that, far from keeping Mr. Berezovsky’s association hidden, he regarded Mr. Berezovsky’s association with the project as a political asset which he wanted to advertise, because Mr. Berezovsky was known to have the ear of President Yeltsin.  Mr. Berezovsky himself admitted in cross-examination that everybody knew that he was connected with NFK which managed Sibneft, but said that “… not everything is absolutely logical, we should understand, and my behaviour … also was not very logical sometimes”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="135">

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The acquisition of ownership of, or an interest in, Sibneft shares, would not have achieved the purpose of providing immediate funding for ORT.  Mr. Berezovsky needed money to fund ORT much more quickly than he could ever have obtained such funding out of Sibneft dividends.  In the first place, it would have taken time for the necessary legislation to be passed creating Sibneft, and for management control to be acquired.  In the event, Mr. Abramovich did not acquire control of Sibneft until the beginning of 1996, just six months before the elections.  Secondly, the component businesses of Sibneft were old-style Soviet State enterprises, which had never been exposed to market disciplines and were then making substantial losses.  They would have to be fused into a single business, and then turned round.  Mr. Berezovsky’s assertion that it would have been perfectly straightforward to have integrated the component businesses of the two Siberian companies into one, with the old-style Soviet management and their billion dollars of accumulated debt, and that large sums of money from the combined businesses could have been extracted as soon as Mr. Abramovich acquired management control, was absurd, and was given from the standpoint of complete ignorance of the industry.  Mr. Berezovsky admitted that at the time when he needed funding for ORT, “Sibneft was not profitable”.  He confirmed that even in 1996 Sibneft also made no profits.  In the event profits were not made until 1997.  Even then they were on a modest scale and had to be retained for investment in order to grow the business.  Significant profits were not made by Sibneft until 1999, and no dividend was paid until 2000.  Since the reward for Mr. Berezovsky’s efforts was required straight away in order to fund ORT, he could not possibly have stipulated for a form of reward that, even on his own evidence, might take months to arrive and, in fact, took years to arrive.  By comparison, by exacting payments from Mr. Abramovich in early 1995, and thereafter, in return for the <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili provided, Mr. Berezovsky was in a position to, and did, make an immediate and significant contribution to ORT’s funding shortfall.  This funding was worth far more than a share of the modest profits which Sibneft was likely to make in the early years after Mr. Abramovich acquired control of it.  It was hardly conceivable that Mr. Berezovsky was not aware of this.  </p>

On the contrary, on my analysis of the evidence, his interest and purpose in entering into the arrangements with Mr. Abramovich was to secure a future cash flow stream.  That explains why he was interested in the amount that Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies could generate and not in what might ultimately be the profits generated by Sibneft itself.  </p>

Mr. Berezovsky then amended his account of the alleged 1996 Agreement, to remove any suggestion of original ownership or control on his part, and then transfer of, any shares.

If there was going to have been some such agreement along these lines, it is surprising that the point was not raised, or such an agreement reached in the context of the first cash auction, which opened on 1 November 1995 in relation to the privatisation of the first 15% tranche of Sibneft shares.  In that auction, Runicom acquired a 12.2% shareholding.  But, as I have already described, Mr. Berezovsky took no interest in that auction, nor in how “his” shares were going to be held.</p>

The fact that subsequently, in late 2000 and early 2001, Mr. Abramovich had come to view Mr. Berezovsky as a political risk, because of the latter’s publicly made criticisms of Mr. Putin’s governance, is no reason why he should have adopted such a stance earlier.</p>

As I have already described, Mr. Abramovich made arrangements to have Mr. Berezovsky publicly associated with PK-Trast in advance of the second cash auction in September 1996;  in the same month, Mr. Berezovsky was appointed to the board of Sibneft (resigning in December 1996, upon his appointment to the Security Council);  in June 1997, Mr. Patarkatsishvili became a director of Sibneft, remaining on the board until 1999.  I was not impressed with the suggestion in Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence, that Mr. Berezovsky’s appointment to the Sibneft board was designed to divert attention from his alleged shareholding.  The appointment appeared to have the opposite effect, so far as contemporary press reports were concerned.  Subsequently, in August 1997, Mr. Berezovsky’s close association with the management of Sibneft was expressly referred to in the Saloman Brothers Eurobond circular for Sibneft, as described in greater detail below.  In January 1998, Mr. Berezovsky appeared at the very public ceremony at the LogoVAZ Club, where the merger “heads of terms” between Sibneft and Yukos were signed, a fact which was also widely reported in the press.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The only real issue on the figures related to whether Mr. Berezovsky had received any payments in 1995.  He denied receiving anything in that year pursuant to his version of the alleged 1995 Agreement.  Such denial was consistent with his case that the payments represented Sibneft profits, or related to profits derived from the acquisition or control of Sibneft, since Sibneft was not formed until October 1995 and management control of the company was not acquired until the following year.  But since he claimed to have no precise recollection of dates or figures, and said that he did not concern himself with the details of payments which he received, because this was left to Mr. Patarkatsishvili, his own evidence was not of much assistance on this issue.  He was unable to give any satisfactory explanation in cross-examination for payments which certain documents showed had been made to him or LogoVAZ in 1995, including a sum of $4 million paid in September 1995.  His suggestion that payments were made to LogoVAZ because Mr. Abramovich’s companies had bought cars for its employees was unconvincing, and was, I find, rebutted by Mr. Abramovich in his oral evidence.  </p>

As both Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Shvidler said in their written and oral evidence, the great majority of the funds constituting $30 million paid in the first year did in fact go to ORT, but the scope of Mr. Berezovsky’s demands expanded over time, so that there was a gradual increase in the proportion of Mr. Berezovsky’s personal expenditure that was being funded by Mr. Abramovich.  It was Mr. Berezovsky’s own evidence that, by 1997, his entire personal expenditure was in fact being funded by Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Abramovich was not involved in ORT and had no particular reason to be concerned about whether or not the money was strictly being applied for ORT purposes.  Mr. Berezovsky has never alleged that it was a term of the alleged 1995 Agreement that the money paid to him had to be applied for ORT purposes.  Mr. Abramovich’s concern was with the amounts, not with what the purpose to which Mr. Berezovsky applied the funds.  </p>

Mr. Mitchard’s third witness statement (served for the summary judgment application) states on the basis of information provided by Mr. Abramovich that the payments began “… in the first half of 1995 before Sibneft had even been established”, and that Ms. Goncharova had confirmed that “… she was responsible for payments to ORT from about the beginning of 1995”.

Indeed, vague, broad-brush wording, such as “Settlement Agreement”, is just the type of wording one might expect a payer to use to describe a payment destined to secure political influence, in circumstances where, on the one hand, as Mr. Abramovich described, the payer needed to convince the bank that the payment was legitimate so that it would effect payment, and, on the other, might wish to conceal from the bank the true nature of the payment.  Whilst such description is one that might justifiably be open to criticism in a Western accounting context, as providing a false explanation, its use was understandable in the circumstances.  Mr. Berezovsky speculated in his evidence that this payment might have been for motor cars purchased by Runicom SA from LogoVAZ, but that suggestion was rebutted by Mr. Abramovich’s evidence, which on this point I accept.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, I conclude on the evidence that sums in the region of $20-30 million were indeed paid by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky, or to his order, in the year 1995.  Whilst these payments could have been characterised as being consistent with Mr. Berezovsky’s case, on the grounds, for example, that they were effectively payments on account of an entitlement to 50% of future or anticipated profits to be earned by Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies as a result of the acquisition of control of Sibneft, that was not the way in which Mr. Berezovsky chose to address the issue.  As I have said, he simply denied that payments had been made in 1995.  In those circumstances, I conclude that the evidence in relation to the 1995 payments does indeed undermine Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the alleged 1995 Agreement.</p>

Sibneft sold export crude and products to Runicom SA/Runicom Ltd until 2000 when the oil trading operations were consolidated with the Sibneft group.  The accounts in the relevant period dealt specifically with transactions between Sibneft and these companies, stating, for example, the percentage of total sales made to such companies and amounts receivable from such companies.  In 1996 there was a specific statement to the effect that the sales were at market prices, although this statement did not appear in subsequent years.  The auditors would have been obliged to have noted any inappropriate transfer pricing transactions that artificially or improperly reduced Sibneft’s profits, to the detriment of its shareholders who were not related parties.  No such irregularities were reported.  </p>

	      </authorialNote>.  The accuracy of the information in the circular was verified by Salomon Brothers and Cleary Gottlieb.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili, who was a director of Sibneft at the time, was among those who took responsibility for it.  In summary, export crude oil was sold to Runicom SA or Runicom Ltd at world market prices less a commission of about 2% until March 1997 when the commission discounts ceased.  Products were sold at world market prices throughout.  Both companies, moreover, had other trading operations unconnected to Sibneft.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that, in addition to Sibneft, his Trading Companies obtained significant business from elsewhere, for example as exporters of Rosneft products.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that his Trading Companies did not engage in transfer pricing, and were not in a position to do so because the oil price was highly regulated<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="179">

He explained the use that Sibneft made of such entities and the distribution of the amounts earned by the tax efficient companies as between the Trading Companies controlled by Mr. Abramovich and Sibneft, in such a way as to ensure that Sibneft itself was in the same financial position as it would have been if the tax efficient companies had not been used.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> which might possibly have supported an allegation of improper transfer pricing was the 2002 Audit Chamber’s Report (although this was referred to by Mr. Rabinowitz in the different context of the quantum of receipts of Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies), but Mr. Rabinowitz did not seek to rely on such report and, as I have said, expressly disavowed any allegation of improper transfer pricing.  Certainly, if such an allegation had been pursued, I would have expected evidence, expert or otherwise, to show that the Sibneft audited financial statements had either mis-stated the position, or could not be relied on to reveal the fact that the “real” profits from Sibneft’s oil were being captured by trading counterparties.  Accordingly, I do not accept the suggestion, to the extent that it was made by Mr. Berezovsky, that Sibneft’s funds or profits were improperly diverted or siphoned off to Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies or tax vehicles, and therefore that, for that reason, the profits of the Trading Companies should be treated as “Sibneft’s profits”.</p>

	      </authorialNote>.  Mr. Berezovsky’s argument depended upon him showing an actual correlation between what he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were paid in each of the years 1995 – 2000 on the one hand, and, on the other hand, 50% of the profits generated by Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies that were attributable to trading with Sibneft, or Mr. Abramovich’s control of, or involvement with, Sibneft.

Even leaving to one side the absence of any pleading of this alleged express term, his case as to the relevant profit source was wholly unclear.  Was it to be a share only in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">increased</span> profits of Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies, generated as a result of Mr. Abramovich acquiring influence and control of Sibneft (as paragraph 445 of Mr. Berezovsky’s closing, and its reference to $30 million as 50% of $60 million, would appear to suggest)? If that were so, there would, it is to be supposed, have had to have been a fairly complex annual calculation of what the Trading Companies were making prior to such acquisition (as they were already making profits and trading with Noyabrskneftegaz and Omsk Oil), followed by a calculation which stripped out those profits, as well as those generated by trading with non-Sibneft entities, from the quantification of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s 50% profit share.  On that basis, there would also have had to have been a calculation of the profits earned by Sibneft itself.  Or was the claimed share to include <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> profits of Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies, even those generated as a result of trading with non-Sibneft entities? And would a proportionate share of the losses incurred by Sibneft in 1995 and 1996 have fallen to be deducted from Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s 50% share?  Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence did not attempt to provide the answers to any of these questions.  </p>

Mr. Berezovsky had purchased Chateau de la Garoupe at Cap d’Antibes, France, for FF55 million through a French company controlled by him, Société d’Investissements France Immeubles Sari (“SIFI”).  The purchase of the Chateau, and subsequently of the antique furniture in it, and its redecoration, had been funded by payments from Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies.  These had been purportedly structured as loans, but it was common ground that there was no intention that such so-called loans should be repaid.  Subsequently, in July 1997, an adjoining property, Clocher de la Garoupe, was also purchased by SIFI, for FF90 million, and was similarly funded.  Mr. Jenni, Mr. Berezovsky’s Swiss lawyer, described the “… rather chaotic system which evolved …” as “… a result of the constant demand for additional monies” to meet Mr. Berezovsky’s expenses associated with his French properties.  What happened was that Mr. Berezovsky’s property agent, M.  Bordes, would demand some payment from Mr. Jenni or his associate, Mr. Stiefel, who would pass the demand on to Mr. Shvidler.  If Mr. Shvidler resisted it, as he sometimes did, Mr. Berezovsky would ring Mr. Patarkatsishvili so that he could contact Mr. Abramovich and demand that it be paid.  </p>

The Bolshoi Balance was not intended to provide information on profits and losses relating to specific projects but it did enable me to track cash effectively.</p>

As the Bolshoi Balance also contains a complete record of the payments made to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in 2000-2002, we have disclosed the entirety of the documents, even though much of the information is unrelated to Mr. Berezovsky.  This was not a document prepared for him.  We did, however, extract some of the information on this Bolshoi Balance into a separate table called the Fom table (short for ‘Fomichev’, a reference to Mr. Ruslan Fomichev) which summarised the payments made to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  The Bolshoi Balance does not explain the sources of payments to Mr. Berezovsky and/or Mr. Patarkatsishvili but shows the availability of funds at a specific point in time within the companies relating to a given project.</p>

This was a vastly different level of payments to that made in previous years but the year 2000 was different <span style="font-family:Arial">in </span>a number of key respects.  In previous years, Mr. Berezovsky was paid around $50 million each year (although in 1996 it was around $80 million).  In 2000, I recall that the intention was to pay Mr. Berezovsky around $50 million but, as matters developed through the year, this amount increased.  To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Abramovich did not fix the annual amounts according to any partnership share or accounting process because I am certain that he would have been asked me to obtain the relevant figures.  I was never asked by Mr. Abramovich or Mr. Berezovsky/Patarkatsishvili at any time to provide them with a summary of Sibneft profits or trading group profits or profit from any other ‘situation’, project or group of assets belonging to Mr. Abramovich for the purpose of calculating what Mr. Berezovsky should be paid.  My understanding was that from 1995 to 1999 all agreements regarding payment totals were made by reference to what <span style="font-family:Arial">Mr. Berezovsky</span> needed to maintain ORT and his own status.</p>

First, wherever Mr. Patarkatsishvili obtained the $900 million figure from, it bore no relation either to Sibneft’s actual profits in 2000 ($675 million), or the net cash flow sums which the Bolshoi Balance records as having been received by Mr. Abramovich’s oil-related businesses including ZATOs in 2000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="199">

It was common ground on the evidence that it was Mr. Patarkatsishvili who controlled the payments and generally handled the “commercial side” of Mr. Berezovsky’s affairs.  It was also common ground that both Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky would make requests for payments and that payments were made to one or other or both of them (whether in cash or otherwise, and whether directly or indirectly to entities or persons associated with them) pursuant to Mr. Abramovich’s arrangements with Mr. Berezovsky.  </p>

This was because payments were generally made to accounts designated on Mr. Berezovsky’s behalf, which were either those of nominee companies whose exact beneficial ownership was not apparent, or else those of third party payees who had provided goods or services to Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili or to ORT.  Even in 2000, when some payments were, possibly, allocated in the Bolshoi Balance to either Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili (although even this was unclear on the evidence before me), it was possible that amounts were redistributed between the two of them after receipt.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the circumstances, I am not persuaded by Mr. Berezovsky’s argument that the fact that payments were made to both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili is inconsistent with Mr. Abramovich’s <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>allegation and supports Mr. Berezovsky’s partnership allegation.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence explained Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s role and involvement, and Mr. Abramovich’s (limited) understanding of the association between him and Mr. Berezovsky.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s evidence that Mr. Patarkatsishvili clearly did provide<span style="font-style:italic"> krysha</span> type services, not only in relation to RusAL but also in relation to Sibneft – for example “persuading” Mr. Ovodenko to withdraw Sameko’s bid in the loans-for-shares auction.  If there had been any evidence of periodic, or indeed any, calculations as to what was due in respect of “the partners’” alleged 50% or calculation of what was each of their respective profit shares, the submission might have had more force.  But the reality was that the manner in which monies required by Mr. Berezovsky were demanded, negotiated and paid had all the hallmarks of <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> type payments, and not payments of a specific profit share to either man.  </p>

In December 2009 Mr. Berezovsky purchased the audio recording from an intermediary, whose identity he was unwilling to disclose on grounds of concern for the physical safety of such person.  Under the terms of Mr. Berezovsky’s agreement with the intermediary, the latter stands to make an enormous financial gain in the event that Mr. Berezovsky were to win this litigation;  the deal gives the intermediary 5% of Mr. Berezovsky’s winnings.  A transcript of the recording was first disclosed by Mr. Berezovsky on 3 December 2010;  the audio recording was first provided on 5 January 2011.  The original transcript, which was wrongly dated, contained errors of transcription and translation (which have since been corrected).  The recording itself contains gaps and sound distortions.  Mr. Rabinowitz criticised Mr. Abramovich for not admitting the authenticity of the recording or transcript, or even that the Le Bourget meeting had taken place, until his third statement served on 31 May 2011.  I do not consider that, in the circumstances surrounding the production of the recording, such criticism was well-founded.  </p>

Mr. Abramovich explained that his relationship with Mr. Berezovsky changed after the <span style="font-style:italic">Kursk </span>tragedy of August 2000.  Mr. Abramovich took the view that the former had taken an overtly hostile and one-sided stance in using the media which he controlled, to exploit a public tragedy of that sort to further his own political agenda against the government.  Mr. Abramovich had made clear to Mr. Berezovsky what his views were.  As he did not openly disagree with Mr. Berezovsky very often, this fact had adversely affected their relationship, and thereafter they almost stopped meeting in person and Mr. Abramovich increasingly dealt with Mr. Berezovsky through Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal purpose of the meeting was to discuss the mechanics of how to structure the ORT share sale and the state of the mutual accounting as between Mr. Abramovich on the one hand and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on the other.  Both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were concerned by this stage that the vast sums of money that were required to fund their lifestyles should be received by them out of Russia.  They were concerned, for example, as to whether exchange control would be given to remit the proceeds of the sale of their ORT shares outside Russia.  Previously, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had received an income stream from two non-Russian sources.  One was Andava SA, which from 1996 had taken on the role of a treasury vehicle for Aeroflot.  As I have already described, Andava produced an income stream for Mr. Berezovsky which was derived from Aeroflot’s dealings with Andava in Switzerland.  But, by 2000, that income stream had dried up, not least because of the allegations by the Russian public prosecutors that the Andava monies had been misappropriated by Mr. Berezovsky from Aeroflot, and the charges against Mr. Berezovsky which had led to his flight from Russia in October 2000.  The other providers of funds to Mr. Berezovsky outside Russia were the Runicom companies, which had been used to pay most of the sums which Mr. Berezovsky had received from Mr. Abramovich, including in particular the sums he received for buying and doing up the properties on the Cote d’Azur.  </p>

These could be paid only twice a year and would be subject to Russian tax, making it more difficult for him to pay Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Payments would also be visible to the Russian authorities, a potential problem now that Mr. Berezovsky was a fugitive from Russia<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="202">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">From the beginning of 2000, and well before Mr. Berezovsky left Russia in October 2000, he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had been trying to transfer their assets into offshore structures in the West.  As he accepted in his evidence, by December 2000 he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were certainly aware of the money-laundering regulations in force in most Western jurisdictions, and the consequent need to obtain documentary explanation of the origins of any payment in order to satisfy money-laundering enquiries from transferee banks or asset managers.  Indeed the evidence of Mr. Ivlev (one of Mr. Berezovsky’s witnesses) was to the effect that Western financial institutions were, at that time, more than usually sensitive in relation to the transfer of substantial monies from wealthy Russians, because of the scale on which such Russians were attempting to transfer monies out of Russia.  They were particularly so in relation to Mr. Berezovsky.  Mr. Ivlev said:  </p>

So they had to be really satisfied in order to proceed with the money originated or belonged to wealthy Russians.  And, you know, Berezovsky was an extreme case.  Everybody knew that he is a - he just became an enemy of the state, left the country.  So it was in the air, it was in the media at that time.”</p>

Indeed their concern was borne out by the fact that subsequently there were official or judicial enquiries into allegations of money-laundering by Mr. Berezovsky and/or Mr. Patarkatsishvili in Switzerland, The Netherlands, France and Brazil, in addition to Russia itself.  </p>

Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that this agreement had been made in October, when Mr. Berezovsky’s position in Russia was becoming increasingly difficult and his finances were strained.

I do not accept this criticism.  First of all, it was clear from Mr. Abramovich’s evidence and his reference to reconstruction, that his memory had been jogged by what he had read in the Le Bourget transcript.  Second, Mr. Abramovich’s evidence about the amount and the timing was borne out by the Bolshoi Balance, which shows a significance increase in the payments made to Mr. Berezovsky from October 2000.  Although the transcript records Mr. Patarkatsishvili initially complaining that he and Mr. Berezovsky had at that stage received only $100 million out of the $305 million, subsequently the transcript shows that he accepted that in fact only $85 million was outstanding.

Mr. Abramovich was cross-examined to that effect.  In support of this contention Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that, whilst it made perfect sense for Mr. Abramovich to have identified how much money was due from each of the oil and aluminium investments, if the other two men were indeed his partners, it was impossible to see why Mr. Abramovich should have identified the source of the money, if there was really just an agreement to make a <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>payment of $305 million.  </p>

The wording in the transcript, neither in itself, nor in context, is sufficiently clear to support such an interpretation.

	      </authorialNote>, that, when he had agreed with Mr. Patarkatsishvili earlier in the year to pay $305 million, Mr. Abramovich had indicated that it would be difficult to find such a large sum and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had asked where the money was going to be coming from, as he wanted to satisfy himself that the money would indeed be paid.  In the circumstances, such a question was not a surprising one (although Mr. Rabinowitz described it as a “ludicrous suggestion”), since the sum was far larger than any which Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had previously been paid.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that he mentioned the $275 million and $30 million as being respectively sourced from his oil trading businesses and his aluminium businesses, and that the spreadsheet which he had brought to the meeting recorded the internal breakdown as to the source from which the funds derived.  I do not find it in the least surprising that Mr. Patarkatsishvili might have been interested in the cash flows of the oil and aluminium operations;  in making his demands for <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>payments, he might well have been assisted in pitching the demand at the right level, if he knew what quantum of payment the businesses could service.  As indicated above Mr. Rabinowitz could not demonstrate any correlation between the cash flow figures for the oil and aluminium operations as contained in the Bolshoi Balance and the $305 million as representing 50% of such profits for the year 2000.  </p>

But Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to Sibneft was premised on the assertion that Mr. Abramovich had been “fronting” his and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests since 1996;  the suggestion that in this part of the conversation Mr. Abramovich was only <span style="text-decoration:underline">now</span> offering to front their shareholding for them in future<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="209">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There then follows from Box 468 onwards various discussions about Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili becoming registered shareholders in Sibneft, whether through the nomineeship of a Western bank or otherwise.  Mr. Abramovich was clearly reluctant for this to occur because of the adverse effect that any public association of the two men as registered shareholders of Sibneft would have on the company.  Mr. Berezovsky contended that these passages were only consistent with him and Mr. Patarkatsishvili having <span style="text-decoration:underline">existing</span> interests in Sibneft.  For example, he referred to Box 495, where he said “… but this does not mean my legalisation, and this is the heart of the problem”.  He relied on this as demonstrating that he wanted his existing stake in Sibneft formally recognised.  I am unable to accept this analysis of the transcript.  In so far as anything is clear from what (at least in translation) appears to be a disjointed and incompletely recorded conversation, that is difficult to follow, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s concerns appear to be centred on the “legalisation” of their income stream;  in other words their need to receive future funds from Mr. Abramovich legally in Western bank accounts with some plausible and innocent explanation of their origins.  It is in that context that the men were discussing the possibility of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili becoming registered shareholders.  Whilst the transcript shows that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili considered they had an entitlement to receive future payments from Mr. Abramovich and every expectation of doing so, the language used goes nowhere near to recognising some existing contractual or beneficial entitlement to a 50% shareholding interest in Sibneft.  </p>

He submitted that these discussions were only consistent with word “dividends” being used in the conventional sense and that Mr. Abramovich’s attempt in his commentary on the transcript to characterise Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s use of the word as a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>payments was “utterly implausible.” Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that the only analysis of the transcript in these passages was that this was a discussion between shareholders as to the dividends that “we” (i.e. the three men) would be entitled to receive, and would be receiving, from Sibneft.  </p>

It was not surprising that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was interested in the likely quantum of Sibneft dividends, and in the manner in which they would be paid, given that Mr. Abramovich had previously explained that the only way of his (i.e. Mr. Abramovich) deriving revenue in 2001, and consequently paying Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili their required income stream, would be out of dividends declared to him by Sibneft.  Nor, on Mr. Abramovich’s case, would it have been at all surprising for Mr. Patarkatsishvili to have been keenly interested in how much Sibneft would be declaring by way of dividends, since not only would they have provided the means by which he and Mr. Berezovsky would be paid, but also, no doubt, would have determined how much Mr. Patarkatsishvili could demand and expect Mr. Abramovich to agree to pay.  Indeed Mr. Abramovich said as much when accepting in cross-examination that, at least to some extent, the amount of Sibneft dividends would determine how much Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would receive in the year;  he said<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="213">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When reading the transcript one also has to remember that, at various stages, the parties go back to discussing what, at that stage, was only a proposal that the two men might become formally registered as shareholders, as well as other alternative mechanisms for paying monies to them.  The fact that Mr. Patarkatsishvili refers, for example, at Box 540 to dividends in the following way:  </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">is not surprising in the context of the preceding discussions.  Although on one view his reference to “[how]we will be able to receive dividends?” could be read as a reference to a “beneficial” entitlement to dividends, I conclude that in context the language used is equivocal;  it is just as likely that he was simply referring to how he and Mr. Berezovsky were going to get their regular <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> payments.  Similar comments may be made about other passages relied upon by Mr. Rabinowitz.  The whole tenor of the transcript is far too vague to bear the evidential weight which Mr. Rabinowitz seeks to place upon it, as supporting Mr. Berezovsky’s case.  </p>

Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that Mr. Patarkatsishvili mixed up the singular and plural pronouns<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="214">

	      </authorialNote>.  Even if one can infer from the transcript some sort of proprietorial attitude displayed by Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky to the oil operations, that is not inconsistent with Mr. Abramovich’s case.  As Mr. Sumption submitted, it is in the nature of the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>, that both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili might have regarded Sibneft as “theirs” in the sense that the company could not have been created or prospered without the protection that they provided.  As Mr. Sumption accepted, some of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s statements in the transcript, certainly suggest not only a sense of entitlement on his part to participate in the profits being generated by Sibneft, but also a feeling that the more money Mr. Abramovich was making, the more he could be required to pay to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  However, in my judgment, the transcript itself does not in any way reveal whether such apparent feeling of entitlement was based on a <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> type relationship, some other deal or arrangement between the three men, or a contractual entitlement to an ownership interest in shares in Sibneft and/or to a participation in its profits or those made by Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies as a result of Mr. Abramovich’s acquisition of control of Sibneft.  </p>

There were two successive trusts:  a Liechtenstein foundation operative between 1999 and 2001;  and a Cyprus trust operative from 1 March 2001.

Thus in my view both Boxes 468 and 541 were referring to Mr. Abramovich’s existing arrangements for ownership of Sibneft shares, and Box 541 was explaining the mechanisms by which payments could continue to be made to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:2.15in;text-indent:-0.57in">(1) <marker name="tab"/>By persuading President Yeltsin (through members of his circle) first to create Sibneft, and then to privatise part of the state’s holding in it and to include the rest in the loans-for-shares scheme, Mr. Berezovsky had made it possible for Mr. Abramovich to acquire management control in 1996 and almost all of the shares in the course of 1996 and 1997.  It is plain that Mr. Berezovsky appears really to have believed that this was all that really mattered and that all that Mr. Abramovich later achieved was due to him.  In keeping with his whole approach to this transaction, Mr. Berezovsky regarded Mr. Abramovich as a subordinate, a functionary, whom he had installed as ‘his’ manager, generously incentivising him by allowing him to take a proportion of the profits far in excess of the real value of his contribution to the outcome.  It is clear that he had no knowledge or understanding of Mr. Abramovich’s achievement in integrating the two Siberian businesses into one organisation and transforming old-style Soviet state enterprises carrying a billion dollars of accumulated historic debt into a modern and highly profitable capitalist organisation.  Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence is that he regarded this as straightforward, and that one had only to acquire control for the money to come pouring in.  This presumably explains why he  regarded shares which he had not bought or paid for as ‘his’, and payments for krysha which were plainly unrelated to Sibneft’s profits, as nothing less than his due if Mr. Abramovich could afford to make them.  </p>

NFK acquired a pledge of the state’s 51% retained shareholding and effective management control over Sibneft, but it never owned any Sibneft shares.  Mr. Berezovsky controlled (but did not own) Consolidated Bank, which in turn owned half of NFK:  … Mr. Berezovsky may have believed that in some way this made him a part-owner of Sibneft.

In fact there was no such transfer.  But Mr. Berezovsky continued to assert that there was.  His evidence in cross-examination was that he regarded his control over Consolidated Bank’s 50% stake in NFK as giving him and Mr. Patarkatsishvili a 50% holding in FNK.  According to him, this was because by some mechanism which he was unable to explain, the 50% interest of Consolidated Bank in NFK had been transmuted into an interest of himself and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in FNK.</p>

What it suggests is that Mr. Berezovsky felt that he was entitled to half of what Mr. Abramovich had, because he had enabled him to acquire practical control of Sibneft and its cash-flows, but not because he himself owned anything.  This would be characteristic of a relationship founded on krysha.</p>

The interview notes and draft proofs of Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors certainly show that he also regarded himself, at any rate by 2005, as having an interest in Sibneft jointly with Mr. Berezovsky.  They also tend to suggest, although the point was never explored with him, (i) that he believed that this arose from the fact that Mr. Berezovsky was solely responsible for the acquisition of Sibneft (‘It is important to remember that BB made it happen.  He was the one who persuaded Boris Yeltsin to transfer the various enterprises to Sibneft’);  and (ii) that he thought that this had been achieved by way of his original participation in the loans-for-shares auction.</p>

The distance between an inchoate sense of entitlement and a legal right is immense.  Of course, the difference hardly mattered while Mr. Berezovsky remained a power to be reckoned with in Russia.  It only mattered once (i) Mr. Berezovsky started trying to move his assets out of Russia and found himself having to satisfy Western money-laundering regulations, and (ii) he very shortly afterwards lost his political influence and his ability to provide <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>.  Suddenly, the ownership of assets became important to him in a way that it had never been in the prime of his power.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In a fact-heavy case, it is vital to be able to discern the pattern in the carpet.  The pattern in this case (as was manifestly clear from Mr. Berezovsky’s own evidence) was that Mr. Berezovsky regarded Mr. Abramovich’s successes in relation to Sibneft as achieved directly as a result of Mr. Berezovsky’s (and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s) own political and other efforts in ensuring the privatisation of Sibneft.  Mr. Berezovsky also regarded Mr. Abramovich as a subordinate, whom he had made, put in place and, as Mr. Sumption put it, “owned”.  I have no doubt that Mr. Berezovsky, and probably also Mr. Patarkatsishvili, considered that, as a result, they were entitled to a substantial piece of the Sibneft action<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="225">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Including profits generated by Mr. Abramovich’s trading companies from their dealings with Sibneft.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, and on a continuing basis.  But in my judgment that “inchoate sense of entitlement” was entirely different from a genuine belief in an actual legal entitlement under a contractual, albeit oral, agreement;  it was also entirely different from an honest recollection of what occurred at the date of the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements.  But, as was submitted on behalf of Mr. Abramovich, an “inchoate sense of entitlement” was entirely consistent with an arrangement between the three men based on protection or <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>.</p>

He resigned in December 1996, having become the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council on 29 October 1996 (a body of which he remained a member until November 1997).  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that he supported Mr. Berezovsky’s appointment as a director of Sibneft, because it continued the public association between Mr. Berezovsky and Sibneft, which was valuable to Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Berezovsky on the other hand, suggested that Mr. Abramovich had said that such appointment would give the impression that Mr. Berezovsky had no shareholding interest in Sibneft.  I consider this to have been an unlikely reason.  Mr. Abramovich was appointed to the Board of Directors of Sibneft in September 1996, and remained a director until December 1999.  Mr. Shvidler became the CFO and Vice President of Sibneft in 1996.  In June 1997, Mr. Patarkatsishvili joined the Sibneft board.  He remained a director until mid 1999.</p>

There were regular statements in the press and in books to that effect, which are now relied upon by Mr. Berezovsky as evidence supporting his case.  However, whilst he was still living in Russia, when questions were asked of him in press interviews on the assumed basis that he was a shareholder, he neither confirmed nor denied the assumption, but simply did not engage with it.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that, at the time, he had no problem whatsoever with the public assumption that Mr. Berezovsky was a shareholder, because, within Russia, Mr. Abramovich was anxious that he should indeed be publicly associated with a protector as influential as Mr. Berezovsky.

At the time, he was a director of Salomon Brothers, in London, and was part of the team working on the bid, although he himself was not directly involved in the due diligence exercise into share ownership.  Subsequently he joined Sibneft in 1998 and thereafter became a close business associate and colleague of Mr. Abramovich.  In his written evidence he gave the following explanation as to why Salomon Brothers  and Cleary Gottlieb perceived it necessary for there to have been a specific statement about Mr. Berezovsky’s  position:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:-0.57in">“10.<marker name="tab"/>The reason why this particular statement was contained in the Offering Circular was, as I recall, because Mr. Berezovsky’s association with Sibneft was one of the issues raised by investors.  In particular, I recall being made aware of the reluctance of many in the market to be associated with any company which Mr. Berezovsky owned or part owned.  I understood that the negative reaction of some investors to any sign of Mr. Berezovsky’s ownership was due to his well-known association with criminal elements and what investors described to me as his ‘Godfather’ like figure (with all the mafia related connotations of that term, including treating people and businesses as personal property).  Indeed, by that time, there had been consistent media reports concerning Mr. Berezovsky’s alleged ordering of contract killings of various well-known Russian politicians and journalists.  The most well-known of these was the 1996 Forbes article accusing Mr. Berezovsky of masterminding the March 1995 murder of Vladislav Listiev, a Russian journalist who at the time served as the General Director of OAO Obshestvennoye Rossiyskoe Televidenie (“ORT”).  Investors are inherently conservative and, in my experience, generally react negatively if a company is too strongly associated with figures who have anything other than a business focus.  In the case of Mr. Berezovsky, there was not only his reported connections with organised crime and the Chechen rebels, but also his strong political agenda, all of which gave rise to the perceived risk that he was not interested in the long term strategic vision of Sibneft.  Rather, he was seen as someone who might potentially loot any company with which he was associated to satisfy his own personal agenda, as was suggested by the same 1996 Forbes article.  Unsurprisingly, investors usually prefer business people who are clearly focused on introducing cost efficiencies and building a serious and profitable company.  In fact, this is exactly why Mr. Abramovich’s ultimate ownership of the company was by 1999 generally perceived as an attractive factor by the investment community, as by that time Mr. Abramovich had already become known as a strategically minded and principled businessman, which tremendously enhanced investors’ confidence in the company.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:-0.57in">11.<marker name="tab"/>Given the concerns of some investors, therefore, it was necessary for the Offering Circular to make a specific disclosure reference to Mr. Berezovsky and make it clear that, although he did maintain a relationship with Sibneft’s owners and managers (as had been already reported in the media), that relationship was not based on any actual ownership in the company.  This was done to assure investors that Mr. Berezovsky had no right to influence the company’s affairs.  On the other hand, the realities of Russian oil business at the time necessitated an association with people like Mr. Berezovsky because of the need for a strong ‘krysha’ (‘krysha’, meaning literally ‘roof’ in Russian, in this context means political support and physical protection).  Investors would have been aware that the fortunes of an oil company are entirely reliant on its ability to replenish its reserves, which is achieved both through obtaining new licenses from the government (usually at auction) and by buying existing oil concerns (which, at the time, were almost all government owned).  Political support is therefore essential to an oil company and, at that time, Mr. Berezovsky was a prominent political figure.  The oil business had also been (and still was at that time) plagued by violence and organised crime connections.  The fact that there was someone like Mr. Berezovsky associated with the owners also gave at least some investors a positive signal that to some extent, and at least temporarily, the company had some protection against a certain kind of interference.  At Salomon Brothers, we had dealt with the Russian oil business on prior occasions and, as such, were well versed in these realities.”</p>

Although there was no direct evidence on the point, the strong inference must be that someone from the due diligence team at Salomon Brothers and Cleary Gottlieb, or from Sibneft’s own English lawyers, Frere Cholmeley Bischoff, would have confirmed the statement with him, with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and/or with someone in Mr. Berezovsky’s office, before its inclusion.  This was clearly a material statement in the context of this offering, for which the company and its directors would have taken responsibility, and one in respect of which a high degree of due diligence was, in the circumstances, necessary, given the structure of the registered shareholdings and the adverse, and in certain cases, defamatory, press reports about Mr. Berezovsky, such as the 1996 <span style="font-style:italic">Forbes</span> article which were in the public domain at the time.  </p>

But on either basis, I do not accept Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence that he and Mr. Abramovich agreed that a false statement should be included in the Offering Circular to conceal the true nature of his interest in Sibneft, whether because of investors’ concerns or for some other reason.  I find that he and Dr. Nosova appreciated that the statement in the Offering Circular (whether or not he saw it) presented real difficulties in the way of his case and that it was accordingly necessary for a story to be concocted that laid the blame for the inclusion of such statement in the Offering Circular on Mr. Abramovich.  </p>

It also demonstrates Mr. Berezovsky’s ability to use his access to media reportage to further his particular commercial goal at any one time.  The timing of this statement was curious, to say the least.  On Mr. Berezovsky’s own case, in this action, prior to the date of the interview (27 June 2001), he had recently parted with his alleged interest in Sibneft pursuant to an agreement referred to as the Devonia Agreement, which was entered into on 5 June 2001 and said to have become effective on 12 June 2001.  I deal with the agreement in greater detail below, but, in summary, it provided, or purported to provide, for the sale by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to Devonia Investments Ltd of their beneficial interests in 2,062,335,000 Sibneft shares.  In cross-examination Mr. Berezovsky suggested that he made the announcement to encourage Mr. Abramovich to keep up payments of $1.3 billion (which the latter had agreed to make at that time).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject that explanation.  The documentary evidence obtained from the files of Clydesdale Bank and other circumstantial evidence clearly demonstrated that the statement had been made to the press in order to provide material to satisfy the bank’s money-laundering enquiries into the provenance of the funds.  Mr. Curtis, Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitor at the time, had been trying to satisfy the bank of the existence of the interest being sold.  Mr. Curtis had written to Mr. Fomichev, Mr. Berezovsky’s financial assistant, on 1 June 2001 saying that the bank was likely to require more information, and suggesting that Mr. Fomichev should find some press copy supporting its existence.  There was no such copy, as Mr. Berezovsky had not previously claimed in public to have any interest in Sibneft, and the Offering Circular asserted that he did not.  The press cutting was sent to Mr. Curtis shortly after it appeared, and was duly supplied by Mr. Curtis to the bank.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky himself admitted in cross-examination that his press announcement, if not a lie, was at least “disinformation”, a comment typical of Mr. Berezovsky’s flexible attitude to the truth.  It was certainly not a statement that could be relied upon to support his case as to any interest under the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements in Sibneft.  </p>

As Mr. Jenni explained, as a result of the Aeroflot case, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had experienced problems in 1999 in Switzerland, involving the sequestration of their funds and the blocking of their bank accounts as a result of a request for legal assistance by the Russian prosecutors.  Although Mr. Jenni tried to suggest that the principal purpose of the exercise of setting up offshore structures was a wish on the part of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to “structure their relationship in a way that it was clear who was holding what  shares in what”, there was little doubt that the real driver was to establish a complex structure of trusts and companies, with the assistance of Swiss confidentiality laws, in order to protect their assets from attack from the Russian authorities.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky gave no specific evidence about them, and given his lack of detailed knowledge about his own financial affairs was probably in no position to do so.

No one was called who was in a position to explain them.  Dr. Nosova had nothing to say about them.  Neither Mr. Fomichev nor Mr. Kay was called as witnesses, Mr. Berezovsky having fallen out with them.  No one was called from Valmet.

The evidence showed that Mr. Berezovsky made inconsistent statements in public and in private about his assets, and that, by this stage, Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and their staff were extremely concerned by the need to satisfy Western money-laundering regulations, at a time when they were trying to shelter their assets in offshore trusts and companies, and were receiving very large sums of money from undocumented sources.  </p>

For example, Mr. Samuelson’s Inter-Office Memorandum referred to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili “… own[ing] a large stake in Aeroflot”, and the Explanatory Note listed Aeroflot as one of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s business interests.  Likewise Mr. Curtis told Clydesdale Bank in 2001, presumably on the basis of what he had been told by Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili, or one of their staff, that Mr. Berezovsky “has shares in Aeroflot and receives Russian flyover fees”.  Mr. Berezovsky’s English accountants, PwC, were also subsequently told that he had an interest in Aeroflot in the course of their investigation of his tax affairs.  However the reality was (as Mr. Berezovsky accepted), that these statements were untrue and in fact the two men had no more than an income stream derived from the management of Aeroflot’s non-rouble treasury operations by the Swiss company Andava.  </p>

These discussions were not in the nature of in-depth discussions, but rather we would talk about Sibneft in passing.  For instance, I recall Mr. Abramovich saying at dinner that Boris, Badri and he were pleased with the progress they were making.  At no point during any discussions with Boris, Badri or Mr. Abramovich (together, in combination or separately) have I ever heard any suggestion that Sibneft was Mr. Abramovich’s project alone, or that it was a project in which Boris and Badri were in some way simply helping him out.  Nor have I ever heard it suggested that Boris and Badri did not have an interest in Sibneft.  The opposite is true.  Mr. Abramovich, when talking of Sibneft, would always talk in terms of ‘we’ and never ‘I’.  Boris and Badri did the same.  I recall Mr. Abramovich coming into the LogoVAZ club one time in 1998 or 1999, saying ‘We are having problems right now’ and setting out how ‘we’ - being him, Boris and Badri – were concerned about some particular problem with Sibneft.  It was always very clear that the project was a joint one and that each party had a significant interest in Sibneft.</p>

At that time, Mr. Abramovich had no money and no connections.  He thus brought the idea of establishing a new oil company, which was later named Sibneft, to Mr. Berezovsky, with the intention of relying on Mr. Berezovsky’s skills, expertise and political connections to ensure that the idea which he had in mind was seriously heard and considered within the Government.  I know, based on a conversation with Mr. Aven that Mr. Abramovich had approached Mr. Aven and Mikhail Friedman first with the idea, but both had told him that Mr. Berezovsky was the only person who could successfully lobby for the creation of Sibneft and convince the Government of the merits of such an idea.  Mr. Abramovich knew what to do and how to do it at a management level, but it was only Mr. Berezovsky who could raise support within the Government for including Sibneft in the privatisation process, which he successfully managed to do.</p>

I assumed that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have by far the greater share of the business.  Given the unique ability that Mr. Berezovsky had to lobby successfully for the creation of Sibneft, and the importance of his political influence generally, compared to the small contribution being made by Mr. Abramovich - I would have regarded a fair split as being ninety per cent for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and ten per cent for Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Abramovich’s contribution was one which could have been provided by any of a number of people;  to my knowledge, he had no particular skills, expertise or connections.  Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili could have just compensated him for his idea;  they didn’t need to make him a partner.</p>

I regarded that as extraordinarily generous given Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich’s unequal contributions to the creation of Sibneft.  I learnt this during the abortive attempt to merge Yukos and Sibneft into a company called Yuksi in 1998.  Though I was not personally involved, during the merger negotiations, Mr. Khodorkovsky told me and Mr. Dubov that he had been shown papers by Mr. Abramovich which made clear that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a fifty per cent stake in Sibneft.

As his witness statement and his oral evidence made clear, because of what Mr. Nevzlin regarded as Mr. Abramovich’s obstructive and opportunistic approach to two successive proposals for a merger between Sibneft and Yukos, he was antagonistic towards Mr. Abramovich.  Both in his witness statement and in cross-examination, he was tendentious and expressed opinions about matters in respect of which he had no knowledge.  His evidence was undermined to a considerable extent in cross-examination.  He had not been personally involved in the Sibneft project, the loans-for-shares auction or the subsequent privatisations<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="249">

He repeatedly insisted that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had told him that he and Mr. Berezovsky would always have the final say in any major decisions affecting Sibneft, and that Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Shvidler had subsequently confirmed this.  In re-examination he reiterated the suggestion that Mr. Abramovich had said that he and Mr. Berezovsky were equal partners in Sibneft, with Mr. Berezovsky having the final say, and added the somewhat surprising comment that apparently Mr. Abramovich had actually said, in relation to ownership of Sibneft, that Mr. Berezovsky “was like <span style="font-style:italic">primus inter pares</span>” - the senior among equals<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="250">

He told Mr. Samuelson in 2000 that Mr. Fomichev was “effectively the most trusted lieutenant of BB and AP, who handles their personal affairs”.  He was not </span>called as a witness in these proceedings by Mr. Berezovsky.  The latter regarded Mr. Fomichev as a “crook” against whom one of his companies had an outstanding judgment, as a result of the North Shore proceedings, for over $35 million.  Mr. Fomichev was not present at the time of the making of the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements, so again his evidence would have derived from his understanding, or interpretation, of what Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili told him.  Whilst one can understand Mr. Berezovsky’s reluctance in such circumstances to call Mr. Fomichev, given his absence as a witness in these proceedings, I would be reluctant to place any weight on his evidence in the North Shore proceedings, where the relevant issue for present purposes simply did not arise for determination.  The fact that his evidence on this point was - not surprisingly – not contested by Mr. Berezovsky hardly makes it more valuable.  That view is reinforced by my view as to Mr. Fomichev’s conduct in connection with the Devonia transaction, to which I refer below.  I also deal, in the RusAl section of this judgment, with Mr. Rabinowitz’s argument that adverse inferences should be against Mr. Abramovich for <span style="text-decoration:underline">his</span> failure to call Mr. Fomichev.</p>

Mr. Ian McKim, a barrister at Cadwalader working on the case at the time, was also at the meeting and gave similar evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time of the meeting in Tbilisi in 2005, Mr. Berezovsky had already decided to bring proceedings against Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili was clearly willing to assist Mr. Berezovsky in formulating his claim, but not, apparently, prepared to be a co-claimant.  According to Ms. Duncan’s evidence, by the date of the Tel Aviv meeting in 2007, Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s position was that he still had relations with Mr. Abramovich, and hoped that he might be able to resolve the matter with Mr. Abramovich, but there was a possibility that he, Mr. Patarkatsishvili, would join Mr. Berezovsky’s action later.  At the meeting in 2005, Dr. Nosova was present and, according to a draft proof of evidence prepared by Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Lankshear, translated Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s evidence into English (except over lunch, when Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s wife did so).  The proof recorded that “At other times, Mr. Patarkatsishvili spoke English”.  At the meeting in 2007, where Mr. Berezovsky was present throughout, both Ms. Duncan and Mr. McKim said that Mr. Berezovsky did most of the talking, and indeed, Ms. Duncan’s subsequent (2011) attribution of who said what at the meeting suggests that it was Mr. Berezovsky who was referring to the 50:50 split of share ownership and profit entitlement in relation to Sibneft.  Accordingly, it is highly likely that the statements recorded as having been made by Mr. Patarkatsishvili were not only based upon discussions with Mr. Berezovsky and/or Dr. Nosova as to how best to present Mr. Berezovsky’s case, but also self-serving.</p>

Moreover, such representations had been supported by documents produced for that purpose.  Had Mr. Patarkatsishvili now given any other account as to the source of their funds, it would have harmed not only the interests of his friend, Mr. Berezovsky, but his own.  It is unsurprising that he chose not to do so.  What Mr. Patarkatsishvili did not do, however, at any stage, was to threaten or assert any claims against Mr. Abramovich.</p>

Where they differed, I tended to find Mr. Rozenberg a more careful and objective witness, who both in his written and in his oral evidence was clear and focused.  Dr. Rachkov presented his arguments in a more partisan fashion, and gave the impression at times that he was arguing Mr. Berezovsky’s case for him.  </p>

But, contrary to Mr. Rabinowitz’s submission, it was not common ground, and was not, in my judgment, the case, that the alleged 1995 Agreement had been sufficiently performed, either on the part of Mr. Berezovsky or on the part of Mr. Abramovich, so as adequately to define the parties’ respective obligations under the alleged 1995 Agreement.  The experts agreed that the alleged performance had to enable the court to define the essential term which was otherwise undefined.  Thus, it followed that the performance in question had to be clearly referable to their alleged contract.  Such alleged “performance” that had taken place (whether one looked at the payments made by Mr. Abramovich, the lobbying activities performed by Mr. Berezovsky, or the role played by Mr. Patarkatsishvili or any other act of alleged part-performance) were none of them sufficiently referable to the alleged Agreements, so as to enable the court to define the essential terms of the agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, in my judgment, the parties failed sufficiently to define the contributions that each of them was to make under the agreement.  Neither the pleadings, nor Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence, defined Mr. Berezovsky’s lobbying obligations, or the other contributions which he, or Mr. Patarkatsishvili, was obliged to make, whether in relation to Sibneft or to “… any future business interests [the participants] acquired, whether or not related to Sibneft” in a manner that was sufficiently certain to satisfy Russian law requirements.  Dr. Rachkov acknowledged as much in his cross-examination in relation to Mr. Berezovsky’s lobbying obligations<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="263">

	      </authorialNote>.  For example, statements to the effect that Mr. Berezovsky would be responsible for “… lobbying for the assets to be included as part of the ‘loans-for-shares’ programme”, that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would “raise funds for the project” or that Mr. Patarkatsishvili would “… lead commercial negotiations with key business counterparties” were far too vague to satisfy any requirement of objective ascertainability.  Nor, in my judgment, did Russian law provide that, if the contributions were inadequately defined, the alleged 1995 Agreement would nonetheless take effect as a partnership under which the parties would be obliged to make “contributions in reasonable amounts”, as Mr. Berezovsky suggested in his Re-re-re-Amended Reply.  As Mr. Rozenberg explained, the court is not entitled to make good a failure to comply with the mandatory requirement under RCC Article 432, Section 1 to agree the essential terms of a contract by substituting a term providing for “reasonable amounts” of contributions;  Russian court practice is stringent and very consistent in regarding a joint activity agreement as non-concluded if one of the essential terms required by law is missing<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="264">

	      </authorialNote>.  The fact that Mr. Berezovsky’s alleged contribution obligations were incapable of evaluation supports this conclusion;  the court could never have assessed whether such an obligation had been properly performed, nor specifically enforce it, or even assess damages for breach of it.  </p>

But, even on the assumption that Mr. Berezovsky’s pleading in paragraphs C33 and C34 of the Re-re-re-Amended Particulars of Claim is to be read as an allegation of an agreement between the parties to acquire a controlling share holding interest in Sibneft<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="273">

Moreover, on Mr. Berezovsky’s case, Russian law would clearly have regarded as an essential term of the alleged 1995 Agreement that he should participate in a wider pool of profits than those merely derived from Sibneft itself.

Success in this context meant that the President and government officials accepted Mr. Berezovsky’s proposal that, in return for Mr. Berezovsky funding and providing supportive media coverage by ORT, in the run-up to the forthcoming presidential elections, there would be a favourable decision by the former, in relation to the creation and privatisation of Sibneft and the State assets which it acquired.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">The court stated that the existence of contractual relations was supported by the written evidence.  On appeal, the Federal Arbitrazh Court sent the case back to the lower court to consider certain aspects of the facts more closely, including whether the parties directed their will “towards establishment of simple partnership obligations” rather than towards some other kind of contract.  The case illustrates how the subsequent conduct of the parties can evidence their agreement and how significant such conduct can be in a Russian court.  However as Dr. Rachkov accepted, the decision did not mention or support the existence any such presumption.  Nor is the case of any assistance in relation to the facts of this case, or as to the presence in this case of any intention to create legal relations.  It merely shows what was common ground between the experts, namely that, notwithstanding that a contract is in oral form, there may be an intention to create legal relations and the court may conclude, whether from prior, contemporaneous or subsequent conduct or from supporting documentation, that there was a binding contract.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My first reason for this conclusion is that which I have already addressed at several places above, namely the extremely vague and general nature of the terms of the alleged 1995 (and indeed 1996) Agreement.  Even if, contrary to my earlier conclusion, the essential terms were sufficiently certain to constitute a contract under Russian law, both these so-called essential terms and the further peripheral terms were, nonetheless, for reasons which I have already described above, extremely unclear, not only as to the obligations which the respective parties were to undertake under the alleged agreement, but also as to subject matter, contributions, and goal.  For example, in relation to the peripheral terms, it was common ground between the Russian law experts that the alleged term that each of them would have the right to participate in any future business that might be acquired by any of them, in the same proportions<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="291">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second factor which objectively points to the absence of any intention to create legal relations, as a matter of Russian law, is the fact that the alleged 1995 Agreement was made orally.  Whilst I accept that such factor is not determinative as to the existence of a binding contract, or as to the presence of an intention to create legal relations, in the circumstances of this case, it is a factor that strongly suggests a common intention that the agreement was to be binding in honour only.  As I have already held above, it was almost inconceivable that an agreement on the terms as alleged by Mr. Berezovsky, with its complexities and its far reaching consequences, would not have been concluded in writing, if indeed it had been made, and that, accordingly, was circumstantial evidence strongly supporting Mr. Abramovich’s case that no such agreement was concluded.  But on the alternative hypothesis that such an agreement was <span style="text-decoration:underline">indeed</span> concluded, in the terms alleged by Mr. Berezovsky, the absence of any written agreement, in my judgment, would have been a clear indication of the absence of any common intention that the arrangement should be contractually binding.  Irrespective of whether Mr. Berezovsky was aware of the Russian law requirements or the consequences of Article 161 and/or Article 162 of the RCC, the general principle to which Articles 161 and 162 gave effect was that contracts of significance should be concluded in writing<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="294">

His evidence was that Russian businessmen in the early to mid-1990s, often failed to document their arrangements and that they held various assets in informal arrangements and they made their agreements orally.

However, my reading about these types of oral arrangements, including the statements of Russian businessmen about these agreements such as the statement of Mr. Potanin set out above, indicates that the parties to such agreements (rightly or wrongly) considered them to be binding.  Such oral agreements inevitably involved a high level of trust, because of the difficulties of enforcement of such oral arrangements.  However, because of the lack of effective legal protection, the same was true in Russia at the time in relation to written contracts and recorded share ownership, and not just oral agreements.”</p>

On the contrary this meant that, if the parties intended to rely on their agreements or to be able to enforce them, deals were carefully and conservatively documented.  As I will set out below, the uncertain state of Russian law often meant (among other reasons) that transactions were structured so as to involve foreign components or structures, but businessmen in Russia in the 1990s were sufficiently sophisticated to understand the need to record clearly the terms of their agreements, to the extent that the arrangements they came to were intended to be legally binding and enforceable.  Indeed, during my years of legal practice in Russia I was never asked if an informal oral arrangement was enforceable in court and was never asked to document such an informal oral agreement that had been previously made.” [Emphasis in original]</p>

The alleged 1996 Agreement was not an agreement to hold property in common but rather an agreement that ownership should be vested in Mr. Abramovich or his companies alone, for the benefit of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and that rights in those shares should be split into what an English equity lawyer would call legal and beneficial title.  In other words, Mr. Berezovsky’s case was clearly an assertion based on the concept of trust, which the experts agreed does not exist in Russian law, but described in another way.</p>

The obligation alleged in C36(3) of the Particulars of Claim to transfer the shares on demand would have made Mr. Abramovich in reality a mere trustee or temporary possessor of the shares, inconsistent with an owner’s right of disposal of his assets.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">This analysis has an air of total unreality about it.  Mr. Berezovsky had never pleaded or previously suggested that he, and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, had any sort of claim against Mr. Abramovich, whether personal or proprietary, to participate in, or to have transferred to them, property held in, or rights conferred by, Liechtenstein or Cypriot trusts.  Mr. Berezovsky’s claim has always been that his Russian law rights arise in relation to an ownership interest in Sibneft shares.  Even the assertion made in his fourth witness statement that the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements extended to a right of participation in the extended pool of profits made by Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies, as a result of his acquisition of control of Sibneft, never suggested any entitlement to Liechtenstein or Cypriot trust property, or to a 50% interest in Mr. Abramovich’s beneficial entitlement under such trusts.  Such an argument is wholly inconsistent with the manner in which Mr. Berezovsky’s claim has been formulated to date, namely as an entitlement to an interest in Sibneft shares, whether contractual or proprietary, and the participation in the profits directly or indirectly derived from Sibneft.</p>

Initially he had resisted, because shares in a media organ was of absolutely no interest to him as he was well-known for having little interest in the media, and owning shares in ORT was not a business decision in which he would ever have been interested on its own merits.  Although initially resistant to the idea, he had agreed in principle with Mr. Patarkatsishvili to buy the ORT stake for $100 million.  His evidence was that he then met with Mr. Voloshin to discuss the purchase because, if Mr. Voloshin had indicated that he was against the sale, it would not have gone ahead.  He also discussed the matter with President Putin<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="329">

Thereafter Mr. Patarkatsishvili had subsequently reported to Mr. Abramovich, at a meeting in November 2000 at Mr. Abramovich’s office at Sibneft in Moscow, that Mr. Berezovsky was reluctant to sell but could be persuaded to do so if the price was increased to $150 million.  Mr. Abramovich said he agreed to pay this increased price.  His oral evidence was that this agreement was concluded some time about 6 November 2000 but that he could not be precise about the chronology.  His evidence was that, at about this time, Mr. Patarkatsishvili had also asked Mr. Abramovich to think about the “official” version of why Mr. Berezovsky was selling his shares in ORT, since the latter had claimed on prior occasions that he would not sell or would <span style="font-family:Arial">turn </span>the shares over <span style="font-family:Arial">to </span>reporters and the intelligentsia <span style="font-family:Arial">to </span>be managed.  Mr. Abramovich also said that it was probable that he discussed the possible sale of ORT shares directly with Mr. Berezovsky at a meeting in Cap d’ Antibes around 6 November 2000, when he went to visit Mr. Berezovsky, which was the first time he had seen Mr. Berezovsky after he had left Russia, although he did not recall the details of what was discussed at the meeting.  However Mr. Abramovich was sure that they parted on good terms;  and he certainly made no threats of any kind.  </p>

His evidence was that Mr. Berezovsky’s influence had been informal and that no formal steps were therefore required to remove that influence.  When it was put to him in cross-examination that Mr. Berezovsky had a clear recollection of Mr. Gusinsky being mentioned at the meeting, Mr. Voloshin said that although he did not recall Mr. Gusinsky being mentioned, it would have seemed very strange to him that he would have mentioned Mr. Gusinsky, as there would have been no need for him to have done so.  He roundly rejected the proposition that for so long as Mr. Berezovsky held 49% of ORT’s share capital he “… was plainly in a position where he could affect the coverage that ORT gave of events in Russia”;  he clearly explained that it was not Mr. Berezovsky’s minority 49% shareholding that gave him the opportunity “to impact the position of journalists”, but rather his informal relationship with, and exercise of influence over, them.  He pointed out that there was no need to do anything radical with, or make changes to the structure of, ORT;  the General Director, Mr. Ernst, remained in place (and indeed still does so to this day), and that all that was necessary was to give the message to Mr. Berezovsky, that from then on, he should cease to influence journalists, and also to the journalists, that they should operate free of his influence.  Mr. Voloshin believed that he discussed this meeting with Mr. Abramovich shortly afterwards.</p>

Irrespective of any personal views as to the desirability or propriety of State control of the media being exercised in such a way, I accept Mr. Voloshin’s account of what was perceived as necessary to bring to an end Mr. Berezovsky’s informal “impact” on journalists, and his evidence that no threat was made at the first meeting to require Mr. Berezovsky to surrender his ORT shares.  There was no need to do so.  Ultimately the Russian State had power, whether by exercise of its majority vote to remove or appoint the General Director, or by a threat to do so, or by exercise of its power to withdraw ORT’s licence or vary its conditions, to deprive Mr. Berezovsky of any effective influence over the content of ORT’s programming.  No doubt, previously, the State had been content for Mr. Berezovsky to exercise such influence, given that he had been largely supportive of the regime and had obtained funding for ORT.  But once he had ceased to be a benign supporter of the government, no doubt that position changed.</p>

He referred to the fact that not only was 2000 a dramatic year for Russia, with a number of tragedies and a heavy legislative programme, but also that, from a practical point of view, it was quite impossible to respond to all of Mr. Berezovsky’s “utterances”.  He pointed out that, over the course of 2000, Mr. Berezovsky had at different times talked about selling the ORT stake to the State;  then selling the shares to private investors;  then not selling the shares at all;  then putting the shares into trust management;  then not;  and then creating Teletrust and then not doing so.  He also said that, when he saw the letter at the time, he believed that Mr. Berezovsky had inserted the reference to Mr. Gusinsky as an attempt to justify to the public why he was no longer controlling ORT’s management.  As he also pointed out, the letter itself referred to the fact that he was intending to place the 49% stake into a trust to be managed by a group of journalists and other members of the public, and an invitation to President Putin to do the same with the State’s 51% stake - something that would appear to be inconsistent with him being subject to a continuing coercive threat to surrender the shares.  </p>

His account was also supported by Mr. Voloshin’s evidence to the effect that President Putin had not instructed Mr. Abramovich to purchase the shares.  After the meeting at which Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had agreed the sale in principle, Mr. Abramovich met Mr. Voloshin to discuss the purchase and whether it made sense for him to buy the shares in order to avoid any possible future conflicts between Mr. Berezovsky and the State, in relation to ORT.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that if Mr. Voloshin had indicated he was against the sale, it would not have gone ahead.  Mr. Voloshin’s response was that what was important to the government was that Mr. Berezovsky did not interfere with the channel’s operation anymore, while the rest was not essential.  I accept Mr. Voloshin’s account that he was not involved in any way in the purchase of the ORT shares by Mr. Abramovich;  or involved in, or aware of, any discussions about the price to be paid by Mr. Abramovich for them.</p>

Mr. Abramovich agreed to purchase at this price and, at least as between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, a commercial deal was struck at this price.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence on these points was corroborated by Mr. Andrei Gorodilov, who was instructed by Mr. Abramovich in late October to liaise with Mr. Fomichev in relation to the detailed arrangements for the deal<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="345">

However it was not surprising that, after the passage of time, Mr. Abramovich could not be certain about specific dates.  But the precise chronology did not matter.  What was critical was that the evidence showed that, as early as late October/November 2000, and in any event well before the date of the alleged Cap d’Antibes meeting on 7-9 December 2000 at which Mr. Berezovsky alleged he was intimidated into agreeing to sell the ORT stake, the transaction was subject to ongoing negotiation and detailed discussions, as between Mr. Abramovich’s representatives and Mr. Fomichev on Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s behalf, about the arrangements (including for payment) which were necessary for the sale to take place.  </p>

Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence on this point fluctuated, but ultimately he denied that there was any meeting on this date.  I accept that Mr. Abramovich’s recollection, albeit based on his reconstruction from the documents, is likely to be correct and that he did, at the request of Mr. Patarkatsishvili, fly down to Cap d’Antibes to have a meeting with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to discuss the ORT sale on that date.

On a normal reading of paragraph 27 in its entirety, this was an admission that they met before the contract was made, but not that they met in any particular period before the contract was made;  thus paragraph D27.2 pleaded that Mr. Abramovich did not believe that the meeting referred to was at Cap d’ Antibes, and paragraph D27.3 denied the remainder of the allegations made in paragraph C27 to which it was responding.  </p>
	      </authorialNote>, but, even if I were wrong on that, and the pleading is to be construed as suggested by Mr. Rabinowitz’s detailed exegesis, it is not surprising in a case of this sort that further evidentiary investigations made before trial result in the production of further documents, such as travel records, which shed a different light on the timing of events.  That clearly happened in this case.  Moreover given the changes in Mr. Berezovsky’s case as to the alleged date of the Cap d’Antibes meeting, it is not in the least surprising that, in preparation for trial, Mr. Abramovich focused more intently on the timings of the relevant meetings.  In addition, I find that it would have been wholly consistent with the manner in which the three men did business for Mr. Patarkatsishvili to have suggested that Mr. Abramovich should fly down to the south of France in a private plane to discuss the proposed sale with Mr. Berezovsky.  The suggestion put to Mr. Abramovich in cross-examination that he and Mr. Gorodilov travelled to Cap d’Antibes solely for purposes connected with Mr. Abramovich’s purchase of the Chateau de Croë was not made out.</p>

These documents included pre-emption notices, board minutes and transactional documents and showed the involvement of representatives both on Mr. Berezovsky’s side and on Mr. Abramovich’s side.  Mr. Fomichev was most unlikely to have been involved in the transaction with Mr. Gorodilov without Mr. Berezovsky’s approval.  Mr. Rabinowitz challenged some of the documents as being backdated, but although that might have been the case in relation to a few documents, the meta data or other evidence demonstrated that, even where backdating took place, the majority of the critical documents were nonetheless prepared, or in the course of preparation, in November 2000.</p>

These arose mainly from the wish of Messrs Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili to receive the funds into their personal bank accounts outside Russia without obtaining Russian exchange control permission or encountering problems with Western money-laundering regulations.  It appears that the Le Bourget meeting of 6 December 2000 was arranged in order, amongst other things, to finalise such matters before Mr. Abramovich’s imminent trip to Chukotka for the gubernatorial elections.</p>

As Mr. Abramovich explained, he did not have any relevant documents for signature with him and in any event the structure of the deal had changed, which would have required revised documentation.  Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that certain passages of the Le Bourget transcript demonstrated that Mr. Abramovich was acting as President Putin’s messenger in relation to ORT.  I do not accept that submission.  It was clear from both Mr. Abramovich’s and Mr. Voloshin’s evidence that Mr. Abramovich had  discussed Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s position and his own proposed purchase of the ORT shares with President Putin or Mr. Voloshin, and that he intended to inform President Putin of the sale once it was finalised.  From Mr. Abramovich’s point of view, the object of the purchase was to relieve pressure on Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili after the former’s public row with President Putin, and to avoid any adverse reputational or other consequences for Mr. Abramovich himself - as Mr. Abramovich put it, to take the political heat out of the relations between President Putin and Mr. Berezovsky.  In the circumstances it was not surprising that Mr. Abramovich was proposing, and indeed was keen, to inform President Putin of his acquisition.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that he had not promised President Putin that he would acquire the ORT shares, but only that, if he did buy them, he would inform him<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="358">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Rabinowitz also submitted that there was no sufficient explanation as to why, as at the date of the Le Bourget meeting, and prior to the arrest of Mr. Glushkov, Mr. Berezovsky would have been a willing seller of the shares in ORT for $150 million, in circumstances where he had previously refused the sum of $300 million for the same shares and there had been no relevant change in circumstances.  I disagree.  By November 2000, Mr. Berezovsky was a fugitive from Russia;  he had been engaged in a serious and public dispute with President Putin in the media;  he had been summoned to appear before the Deputy Prosecutor on 13 November on fraud charges connected with Aeroflot;  he had issued an open letter in the press which was published on 15 November to the effect that he was not going to return to Russia to face the charges and had alleged that the Aeroflot case had been revived by President Putin as a result of Mr. Berezovsky’s criticisms of him;  there was apparently no alternative offer still available from the Russian State to purchase the 49% OIT stake, or, if there was, it was not one that Mr. Patarkatsishvili considered was going to be honoured;  Mr. Abramovich was regarded as a man whom both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili could trust to make the relevant payment;  and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were in need of funds that were available to them outside Russia.  In my judgment all these factors were reasons why Mr. Berezovsky, and indeed Mr. Patarkatsishvili, might well have been extremely keen to sell their ORT stake for $150 million by the time of the Le Bourget meeting:  even if Mr. Berezovsky was, as he suggested, keeping his options open at that stage (a proposition which I find difficult to accept) I find that he did not convey that impression to Mr. Abramovich.</p>

Mr. Glushkov’s lawyer, Mr. Borovkov confirmed this fact in his evidence in support of Mr. Glushkov’s subsequent UK asylum application for asylum.  Moreover it was widely known that it was highly likely, if not inevitable, that Mr. Glushkov would be arrested when he attended for interview;  Deputy Prosecutor Kolmogorov had announced on television on 30 October 2000 that both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Glushkov would be charged with misfeasance relating to the affairs of Aeroflot (which was the event that provoked Mr. Berezovsky’s flight to France).  On 1 November 2000, after he had left, Mr. Berezovsky was summoned to appear before the Deputy Prosecutor on 13 November 2000.  On about 13 November 2000 <span style="font-style:italic">Kommersant</span> announced in the press that the interview was about to happen and that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Glushkov would be arrested when they appeared.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion, having heard all the evidence and considered all the detailed submissions, is that no meeting between Mr. Berezovsky  and Mr. Abramovich took place either on the 7, 8 or 9 December 2000 after Mr. Glushkov’s arrest, whether at Mr. Berezovsky’s chateau at the Cap d’Antibes, or elsewhere, at which the alleged threats were made by Mr. Abramovich to intimidate Mr. Berezovsky into making his decision to sell his shares in ORT.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before giving my reasons for this conclusion, I should say something about the manner in which Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the date of the alleged meeting at Cap d’Antibes has changed over time.  By his own admission in cross-examination, Mr. Berezovsky changed his “recollection” many times about when the meeting took place.  His case was originally that it occurred in late December 2000.  According to the Patarkatsishvili proofing notes, Mr. Berezovsky told his solicitors in 2007 that Mr. Abramovich came to France on 17 December 2000 and said that if Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili agreed to sell the ORT shares, Mr. Glushkov would be released.  In his oral evidence in support of Mr. Glushkov’s asylum application, he said that he thought it was around 17 or 18 December<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="365">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>“around 18 or 19 December”;  “probably about 17/18 December”.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, although he had also said in paragraph 23 of his witness statement in support of Mr. Glushkov’s asylum application that the meeting was at the end of December.  In his second witness statement served in response to the summary judgment application in these proceedings, he said that the meeting occurred “towards the end of December 2000” <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="366">

	      </authorialNote>.  However, the passports and other travel records disclosed by Mr. Berezovsky shortly before trial effectively showed that it was not possible for any meeting to have taken place at Cap d’Antibes with Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on any date from and including 10 December to the end of the month.  Thus the records showed that Mr. Berezovsky made various short journeys within Europe between 10 and 16 December, before travelling to England on 16 December and from there to the United States on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>December 2000.  He attended various press conferences in Washington on the following day, 18 December 2000, and then went skiing at Aspen, Colorado, together with Mr. Voronoff.  He returned via Luton on 27 December 2000, before leaving again for Spain on 31 December.  In addition, Mr. Patarkatsishvili, who is also alleged to have been present at the meeting with Mr. Abramovich in Cap d’Antibes, can be shown from his travel records to have been in Georgia between 16 December and 25 December 2000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have already said, in a case of this sort, involving events which occurred many years ago and which are not necessarily evidenced by documents, it is often not unusual that the recollection of parties or witnesses may change both before and during the trial as to what they believe to be the correct chronology of events.  That is particularly so in a case such as the present where the parties’ focus intensifies in the final preparations for trial.  However, even making every allowance for Mr. Berezovsky in this respect, I found it nonetheless surprising that his recollection of the date of the alleged meeting changed so frequently over time and that the precise date was not fixed in his mind.  If the meeting did indeed take the course which he alleged, and threats were made by Mr. Abramovich that Mr. Berezovsky’s ORT stake would be expropriated and Mr. Glushkov’s detention in jail would continue, unless Mr. Berezovsky agreed to sell his ORT shares, one might with some justification have expected that Mr. Berezovsky would have remembered the date upon which somebody whom, according to Mr. Berezovsky, he considered as a friend, behaved in such an appalling way.</p>

Although he accepted it was not impossible that he would have used a private jet provided by another company, he said that it was not very likely.  Records existed from Global Jet for each of the journeys from Russia taken by Mr. Abramovich which (on his evidence) involved a meeting with Mr. Patarkatsishvili or Mr. Berezovsky in the period October 2000 to May 2001<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="372">

There was none on 7 December, and the timings of the two flights on 8 and 9 December 2000 did not fit Mr. Berezovsky’s case.  The flight records also indicated that there were only two private aircraft flights from Moscow to Paris on 7 and 8 December 2000, both of which were operated by Global Jet.  Global Jet confirmed that the flight on 7 December 2000 was not booked by or on behalf of Mr. Abramovich;  and the flight on 8 December 2000 had on board only Messrs Shvidler and Tenenbaum.

His evidence as to his movements in this period was corroborated to a certain extent by the evidence given a trial by Mr. Voloshin, and by Mr. Sergei Kapkov, who helped Mr. Abramovich organise his gubernatorial campaign in 2000 given at trial, and was subsequently his assistant at the State Duma.  </p>

As I have already mentioned, I do not accept that he had initially admitted in his defence a meeting in Cap d’Antibes between 7 and 25 December 2000.  Such changes as they were to the timing of events in his evidence were explicable in the light of the change of focus in Mr. Berezovsky’s case.  Insofar as they were not explicable I have taken such matters into account in my general assessment of Mr. Abramovich’s evidence relating to this period.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Rabinowitz further suggested that the evidence relating to the passport stamps and the border authorities was unreliable, and that  little weight could be attached to it.  That was because, as the FSB Border Guard Service themselves confirmed (and as Mr. Abramovich accepted in cross-examination), passport stamps are not always made when the Russian border is crossed.  Mr. Rabinowitz pointed to the fact that there was no Russian exit stamp in Mr. Abramovich’s passport on 6 December 2000 (when he left Russia to attend the Le Bourget airport meeting) and that it had not been possible to identify any Russian entry stamp in Mr. Abramovich’s passport on 30 May 2001, when it appears he travelled from London to Moscow following the meeting in Cologne on 29 May 2001.  He also pointed to examples of missing French stamps in Mr. Abramovich’s passports.  But whilst it may be the case, that, where one is travelling by private jet, as Mr. Abramovich habitually did, passports are not invariably stamped, in fact an analysis of Mr. Abramovich’s passports reveal that they do contain at least one stamp (and in most cases both an entry and exit stamp) for each of the foreign trips that he took in the period October 2000 to May 2001 which involved meetings with Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  In  my judgment it would be a surprising coincidence if in relation to this alleged meeting there was no record whatsoever, either of exit from, or of entry to, Russia in the passport itself or in the border agency’s own records.  Mr. Rabinowitz’s suggestion that the evidence from the FSB Border Guard Service could not be relied upon as “authentic, independent evidence” was somewhat optimistic;  there was no evidence to support any suggestion that it had been improperly tailored to suit Mr. Abramovich’s case or was not authentic.  Whilst I accept that it was not exhaustive or complete, (because it was not clear upon what records it was based), it nonetheless provided some supporting evidence of the fact that Mr. Abramovich had not left Russia during the relevant period.</p>

He further submitted that, if such complete record were indeed maintained, then Mr. Abramovich should have sought information from Rosaviation in respect of flights from Russia into Lyons airport or Cannes airport, as well as Paris, Marseilles and Nice, as helicopters could have been chartered to have taken Mr. Abramovich from those airports to Cap d’Antibes.  Again this criticism was valid so far as it went, but the likelihood was that, although Mr. Abramovich accepted that Lyons or Marseilles (but not Cannes) were possible airports to fly to, if Mr. Abramovich was flying for a day trip to visit Mr. Berezovsky at Cap d’Antibes, he would go to the nearest airport suitable for a jet, namely Nice.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment these criticisms were not well founded.  Mr. Abramovich’s sixth witness statement made it quite clear that he and others had been making enquiries in an attempt to reconstruct what has occurred on the three days of the 7-9 December 2000.  The manner in which Mr. Abramovich gave his evidence orally in relation to this topic was carefully considered and he made a careful distinction between what he positively remembered and that which he had reconstructed from information obtained from others or from relevant documents.  He, and those witnesses who gave evidence in relation to his movements during this period, were able to reference their direct recollection to events such as Mr. Glushkov’s arrest, or, in the case of Mr. Kapkov, his birthday on 10 December and the impressions which he had had, as a 25 year old man, of visiting Mr. Abramovich’s home at Sareevo for the first time.  I found Mr. Kapkov to be a credible witness notwithstanding his association with Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Voloshin’s evidence of the meeting in the evening was likewise entirely credible, as were his reasons for remembering the actual date of the meeting, by reference to his secretary’s reconstruction of the telephone log of his calls with Mr. Abramovich, the date of Mr. Glushkov’s arrest, and the concern displayed by Mr. Krasnenker, that he too was going to be arrested.</p>

The improbability of timing does not just relate to the unlikelihood that Mr. Abramovich would have flown from Moscow for less than a day’s visit to Mr. Berezovsky at Cap d’Antibes during Mr. Abramovich’s preparations for his campaign in Chukotka.  The improbability also extends to the fact that Mr. Berezovsky appears to have decided to sell all the ORT shares on 7 December, before, realistically, any visit by Mr. Abramovich could have occurred.</p>

However, I announced immediately that I would be giving President Putin what he wanted, namely ORT.  In an interview on 7 December 2000 with NTV (which was reported in Russian newspapers), I announced that I was abandoning my plan to transfer ORT into a trust.  I explained that I was doing this because the trust would have been placed under incredible pressure by the Kremlin.  This was correct, but I also understood that I would have to give up ORT to the State so as to secure Nikolay’s release.”</p>

His account in cross-examination, however, shifted to one which was more along the lines of Mr. Berezovsky himself, in the course of a negotiation through Mr. Abramovich, seeking to impose the condition of Mr. Glushkov’s release, as a precondition to Mr. Berezovsky’s agreement to sell.  What was clear, as Mr. Berezovsky himself admitted, was that he did not remember exactly what had happened at the alleged meeting.  Even if I were to make the assumption in his favour that, because of the two-day consideration point, his case as to the timing of events was not in any way undermined by this evidence, the general veracity of his case on the ORT intimidation issue was indeed seriously undermined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further point which went to the inherent improbability of the alleged meeting taking place on 7 December (which was Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence as to the probable correct date of the meeting), was that, logistically, it was not possible, or, even if possible, it was logistically extremely difficult, for Mr. Abramovich to have flown back to France from Moscow on 7 December in time to meet Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili that afternoon - after lunchtime as Ms. Gorbunova suggested - and to have been back in Moscow that evening when, according to Mr. Abramovich’s and Mr. Voloshin’s evidence, Mr. Abramovich went to Mr. Voloshin’s house in Moscow together with Mr. Krasnenker.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence on this topic was not challenged, although Mr. Voloshin’s was.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that there would have been typically a six-hour leadtime from the making of a booking with a jet provider for an unplanned flight until boarding.  No suggestion was put to him in cross-examination as to when the decision was allegedly taken by him to return to France, nor was it suggested to him that he had been given instructions by President Putin or Mr. Voloshin to return to secure Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s agreement to the sale of the ORT shares.  And, on any basis, if Mr. Abramovich had been mandated to communicate threats from the Russian State, it is somewhat surprising that he did not do so at the Le Bourget meeting the day before, since the likelihood of Mr. Glushkov’s arrest would have been known to the State prosecutors on that date, given that the decision to arrest him had already been taken.</p>

I agree with the analysis in Mr. Abramovich’s written closing submissions that the most plausible reconstruction of events is that these witnesses remembered an occasion after Mr. Berezovsky’s flight from Russia when Mr. Abramovich came to the Chateau de la Garoupe, but that occasion was on 6 November 2000.  Given the nature of Mr. Berezovsky’s case as to the alleged threats made (threats as to Mr. Glushkov’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">continued</span> detention), however, it was necessary for Mr. Berezovsky to place the alleged meeting on or after 7 December 2000.  </p>

However, prior to his cross-examination, Mr. Berezovsky had not previously suggested that the meeting with Mr. Abramovich took place on the very same day that Mr. Glushkov was arrested.  Indeed he had made it clear that he could not remember the precise date.  But if the two events had indeed occurred on the same day, or even on successive days, I find it surprising that neither Mr. Berezovsky nor Ms. Gorbunova had any recollection of that fact.  Nor was Mr. Patarkatsishvili recorded in the briefing notes as having said that the two events happened on the same date or successive days.  In his sixth witness statement, Mr. Berezovsky said that he remembered events of emotional significance to him;  and that the arrest of Mr. Glushkov was one of the most emotional events of his life.  In cross-examination he also described Mr. Abramovich’s alleged visit as of “much less” emotional significance than the emotional significance of Mr. Glushkov’s arrest, “but also emotional strong” <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="383">

My impression was that Roman was trying to demonstrate that he was doing Boris a huge favour.  I heard the men talking about Boris and Badri’s interests in ORT.  I recall Roman saying that the government wanted to pay significantly less for the ORT shares than he was going to pay, and that it was only thanks to Roman that they would pay more.  I think Roman also said that he was personally paying some of the sale price as he was fed up with the story with Boris and Badri.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Contrary to the submission made on page 30 of Mr. Berezovsky’s First Schedule, this passage did not include a statement that she had <span style="text-decoration:underline">heard</span> Mr. Abramovich threatening the other two men.  As was clear from paragraph 41 of that witness statement, she recorded that she had been told about the “blackmail” by Mr. Berezovsky after the meeting.  The suggestion that she herself had heard blackmailing threats, and that she understood “the situation was blackmail” was only made for the first time in cross-examination.  Ms. Gorbunova, as Mr. Berezovsky’s long-time partner, was, understandably, fiercely loyal to him and had clearly discussed the issues in the case with him at length.  This clearly affected the nature and quality of her evidence.  I was not able to accept her evidence in relation to the issues in dispute.  She gave no satisfactory explanation as to why she had not included such allegations in her two witness statements, nor was she able satisfactorily to explain why she had not addressed the point, in such statements, that Mr. Abramovich had allegedly visited Mr. Berezovsky’s chateau at Cap d’Antibes either on the day of Mr. Glushkov’s arrest or two days thereafter.  Her description of the meeting was equally consistent with the analysis that it had taken place on 6 November.  Her evidence that she could “remember” Mr. Abramovich not coming to the house on 6 November was not credible.  I doubt whether she had actually heard what was being discussed by the three men, or, even if she had, that she had any true recollection of what was said.  She gave an unsatisfactory explanation as to the omission from her first statement as to any mention of an alleged trip to the United States referred to in her second witness statement.  I could not rely on her evidence as corroborative of Mr. Berezovsky’s case on the alleged date of the meeting at Cap d’Antibes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Richard Giroud was head of Mr. Berezovsky’s security team in France in 2000.  Mr. Giroud explained how Mr. Berezovsky’s security team was on high alert when he moved to France, and that the team was on even higher alert following Mr. Glushkov’s arrest.  He gave evidence to the effect that there was only one meeting at Cap d’Antibes between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich after his flight from Russia.  He had discussed Mr. Abramovich’s last visit to Cap d’Antibes with Mr. Berezovsky.  Although he said he no longer had any connection with Mr. Berezovsky, I formed the impression that his evidence was shaped by what Mr. Berezovsky had asked him to say.  I did not find his evidence, to the effect that the meeting with Mr. Abramovich took place after Mr. Glushkov’s arrest, reliable.  Despite the increased security measures, neither before, nor after, Mr. Glushkov’s arrest were any records kept of visits by VIP visitors to the chateau.  At one point he appeared to be suggesting that the meeting took place very shortly before Christmas, which was a previous, but now abandoned, case of Mr. Berezovsky’s.  His evidence appeared to be based on both a recollection of heightened security at the time of the meeting, and the fact that it was winter, rather than summer.  But as Mr. Giroud accepted, Mr. Berezovsky’s security would have been heightened from the moment he arrived as a fugitive in France in late October 2000.  As Mr. Giroud said, after Mr. Berezovsky had fled Russia “We was [sic] on big alert”.  Mr. Giroud also said that he recalled that Mr. Berezovsky left France shortly after the meeting, but Mr. Berezovsky’s travel records revealed that this was as consistent with a meeting on 6 November as it was with a meeting on or about 7 December.  I therefore could not place any real reliance on Mr. Giroud’s evidence as corroboration of Mr. Berezovsky’s assertion as to the date of the Cap d’Antibes meeting.</p>

Indeed in certain respects passages in their evidence undermined his case on this issue.  Moreover, even to the extent that such evidence corroborated Mr. Berezovsky’s case, it was not possible to attach any serious weight to it, given that it was wholly derived from what Mr. Berezovsky had allegedly told the witnesses, in some cases some time after the event (and, notably, not immediately), but, invariably, also from his discussions with them about the matter over the years.</p>

Dr. Nosova had sat in Court throughout Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence and had clearly observed from his cross-examination the difficulties which he faced in attempting to place the Cap d’Antibes meeting in the timeframe 7-9 December 2000.  The inference which I drew was that she made up this latest aspect of her evidence, having trawled through her travel records, and the relevant information about her and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s movements, in order to ascertain the earliest date on which she could say that he had told her about the meeting.  It was notable that no such suggestion had been made by her previously at a time when Mr. Berezovsky was claiming that the meeting had happened shortly before Christmas, or possibly between two trips which he had made to the United States between 16 and 26 December (in relation to which her recent statement fixing her alleged conversation at a breakfast meeting with Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the timeframe 13-16 December would not have been helpful).  Moreover her recent statement was not consistent with her earlier witness statement, in which she had effectively (by reference to other evidence) said that she was told by Mr. Patarkatsishvili about the meeting in January 2001.  Nor was her account consistent with what Mr. Patarkatsishvili had told Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors in June 2005 in her presence, as recorded in the briefing notes;  in those notes he was not recorded as mentioning any threat by Mr. Abramovich, and asserted that it was not within Mr. Abramovich’s power to procure Mr. Glushkov’s release.  She did not dispute that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had said what he is recorded as saying in those notes, but she tried to suggest that he was misleading Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors for fear that his words would leak out and become known to Mr. Abramovich.  </p>

There are two points to be made about these negotiations:  first, they did not involve Mr. Abramovich in any way whatsoever;  and second, and, interestingly, the terms in which Mr. Patarkatsishvili described them was that, in return for the release of Mr. Glushkov, the Kremlin insisted that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili should sell their entire media empire, including all broadcasting and television channels (such as NTV and TV-6) and newspapers, and that Mr. Berezovsky should “quit political activity”.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky was an active participant at all the meetings and had already started his action against Mr. Abramovich.  His solicitors would no doubt have been looking for evidence which supported his case.  Neither Ms.  Duncan nor Mr. McKim spoke Russian and there was no independent translator present.

Over the years, a number of people close to me had warned me not to trust Mr. Abramovich – Badri, Nikolay, Dr. Nosova, my partner Elena, George Soros (through Alex Goldfarb) – but I had paid no attention to them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By late 2000, Mr. Berezovsky had fled Russia and there was even less occasion for the two men to meet.  Thereafter, Mr. Berezovsky became an increasingly vocal critic of President Putin and the two men grew further apart politically.  Ms. Gorbunova’s evidence, which I have concluded related to a meeting at Mr. Berezovsky’s chateau at Cap d’Antibes on 6 November 2000, can be accepted insofar as it spoke of her appreciation of a change in the dynamic of the relationship between the two men.  It is not difficult to see why, by November/December 2000, relations between the two men were chilly:  on the one hand, Mr. Abramovich was frustrated by what he described as Mr. Berezovsky’s “irrational behaviour”;  as a fugitive from Russia, Mr. Berezovsky was of no use to Mr. Abramovich politically, at least for the time being, whilst the present regime remained in power, and indeed had become an expensive liability;  on the other hand, Mr. Berezovsky, as an exile, was no doubt angered or upset by what he would have perceived as the younger man’s disloyalty and presumption in expressing disapproval of Mr. Berezovsky’s public criticism of President Putin.  The appreciation that his protégé no longer had need of him may have wounded his pride.  As Mr. Abramovich described, after the <span style="font-style:italic">Kursk</span> disaster, a number of former acquaintances of Mr. Berezovsky also stopped communicating with him;  Mr. Berezovsky would not have been pleased that Mr. Abramovich had given similar indications of having become disaffected.  These would have been more than sufficient reasons for Mr. Berezovsky’s decision not to have invited Mr. Abramovich to his birthday party on 23 January 2001.</p>

Interestingly, he also said that, having originally offered to sell the ORT shares to President Putin right after the election, he had returned to the question of the sale of the shares “earlier than … a month ago”, as soon as he had realised that the trust company, which he had proposed to create, would not be able to perform its functions and would not be able to preserve ORT’s independence.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that, as I find, Mr. Abramovich continued to have a good relationship with Mr. Patarkatsishvili up until the time of the latter’s death in February 2008, was also inconsistent with Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the ORT intimidation issue.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili was also a friend of Mr. Glushkov, albeit not such a close friend as Mr. Berezovsky, and one might have expected him to have adopted a similar attitude to Mr. Abramovich, and cut off friendly relations with him, had the latter indeed made the alleged threats in relation to Mr. Glushkov’s continued detention at a Cap d’Antibes meeting on 7 December 2000.  On the contrary, the two men continued to see each other and Mr. Abramovich visited Mr. Patarkatsishvili in Georgia.  For example, as Mr. Abramovich recounted, having been “stunned” to read disparaging comments made in press interview by Mr. Berezovsky in December 2002, to the effect that he “did not know” Mr. Abramovich, he arranged to meet Mr. Patarkatsishvili in Georgia in February 2003.  After the two men had discussed Mr. Glushkov, Mr. Abramovich raised the topic of Mr. Berezovsky’s disparaging remarks.  I quote the evidence given by Mr. Abramovich in his fourth witness statement on this issue in full, because it provides an insight into what was probably the explanation for what became the enmity between the two men.  It is not necessary for me to express any view, and I make no judgment, as to whether Mr. Abramovich was justified in the view that Mr. Berezovsky had betrayed him:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Then I asked Mr. Patarkatsishvili about what happened with Mr. Berezovsky and why he suddenly had such a negative reaction to me.  I had been thinking all this time that I had pleased him and had ensured that both he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had enough income to allow them to pursue their various interests outside Russia and enjoy life.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili had been declared the richest man in Georgia.  Suddenly, when reading the interview in December, the idea presented itself for the first time that Mr. Berezovsky could be unhappy about something, and that made a strong impression on me.  I had been so sure that Mr. Berezovsky would think and speak well of me so his interview had shocked me.  I explained my feelings to Mr. Patarkatsishvili and he told me not to worry and pay no attention.  He said that Mr. Berezovsky was losing sleep over the capitalisation of Sibneft and was now wishing that he could be part of it.  He just said that Mr. Berezovsky was probably just jealous and could not cope with the fact that I might be richer than him.  He assured me that, so far as he was concerned, given the situation that Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky found themselves at the time, they had made very good money and were therefore very happy.  I felt that Mr. Patarkatsishvili took my side.  It was our first open conversation after the ‘final payment’ deal.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">We had similar conversations later, including in 2006 when he asked for my help in the ‘divorce’ from Mr. Berezovsky.  However, this conversation in Georgia was the first time that Mr. Patarkatsishvili said that Mr. Berezovsky was wrong and told that it was ‘Boris being Boris’, and ‘you can’t do anything about it’.  I still felt uncomfortable, as I did not want to believe that Mr. Berezovsky thought negatively of me;  moreover, it was unjustified.  Because of Mr. Berezovsky’s obsession with publicity, others might now believe that I had somehow deceived Mr. Berezovsky.  That feeling was particularly unpleasant considering the fact that I had paid him in cash an amount that was absolutely unheard of at the time and had made him apparently happy at the time.  I was the person who had been betrayed.”</p>

She suggested that in 2004 he was conducting negotiations with Mr. Patarkatsishvili with regards to him paying compensation for selling Sibneft at an artificially understated value;  and that in June 2005 and early 2006 the two men were negotiating some sort of settlement in relation to Sibneft and RUSAL.  Mr. Berezovsky made allegations to similar effect and attempted to suggest that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was “playing a game” against “the enemy”, Mr. Abramovich, and that, whilst the relations between the two men were outwardly friendly, the reality was that both men were behaving in a “perfectly, perfectly, perfectly hypocritical” manner.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s evidence to the effect that there were no such negotiations and that he maintained a genuinely friendly relationship with Mr. Patarkatsishvili after the final payment (to which I refer below).  This was supported by the evidence of Mr. Anisimov, who knew Mr. Patarkatsishvili from 1999, and who said that Mr. Patarkatsishvili “always spoke very nicely, very kindly and favourably about Mr. Abramovich”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="393">

Thus the Bolshoi Balance, under Tab “2000 total, cash incl.  monthly” showed a payment of cash out under the heading “ORT CASH” of $1.6 million in October 2000 and $2 million in December 2000.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In support of his case that Mr. Abramovich had acted as a tool of the Russian State, Mr. Berezovsky suggested that, following Mr. Abramovich’s acquisition of the 49% ORT stake, the State gained full control of ORT.  Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that at no time had he ceded control over his ORT stake to the Russian government;  he pointed out in his oral evidence that the government had always had a 51% controlling stake in ORT, and that the director general appointed by Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Ernst, remained at ORT to this day.  It was also suggested to Mr. Abramovich, by reference to certain press reports in early 2001, that he had not appointed any representatives to the ORT board but had allowed the government to make all the appointments.  However later press reports, to which Mr. Abramovich was not taken, showed that a general shareholders meeting originally scheduled for 29 June 2001 was postponed, because the proposed board, which was being put forward for election, made up entirely of government officials “did not reflect the essence of public television”, according to a statement made by Press Minister, Mr. Lesin, at the time.  Thereafter, on 7 September 2001, a new Board of Directors was elected which included independent cultural figures, such as the film director Nikita Mikhalkov and the Hermitage Museum director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, in the majority, and with State officials in the minority.  Accordingly, Mr. Berezovsky could place no reliance on this point in support of his case.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I conclude that, whilst Mr. Berezovsky did not sign the share sale agreement transferring his stake to an Abramovich company until 29 December 2000 (and the agreement transferring the LogoVAZ ORT stake was not signed until 28 December 2000), and whilst he may not have been contractually bound until late December, he certainly had in contemplation a sale to Mr. Abramovich from October/early November 2000, if not earlier.  Once he and Mr. Glushkov had been summoned to appear before the public prosecutor in connection with the Aeroflot investigation, it was clear that the writing was on the wall, and that both men faced the overwhelming likelihood of arrest if they remained in Russia.  It may be that Mr. Berezovsky personally did not make his final decision to sell until he heard of the arrest of Mr. Glushkov.  It matters not.  But I reject Mr. Berezovsky’s case that he only decided to sell his stake in ORT at the alleged meeting in Cap d’Antibes on 7, 8 or 9 December as a result of threats made by Mr. Abramovich in relation to the continued detention Mr. Glushkov or the expropriation of the 49% ORT stake, or as a result of any promise by him that Mr. Glushkov would be released.  </p>

All that is necessary for the purposes of this case is my determination that Mr. Abramovich himself did not communicate the threats alleged by Mr. Berezovsky.</p>

But, although the issue is strictly hypothetical in the light of my decision that Mr. Berezovsky in fact had no interest in Sibneft, which could have been expropriated, it is nonetheless appropriate that I should express my conclusions in relation to the Sibneft intimidation issue.  This is because both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich placed considerable weight on such evidence, not only in support of their general submissions as to the credibility of the two men and the various witnesses, but also in support of their respective substantive cases in relation to the existence or otherwise of the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements.  As Mr. Rabinowitz submitted, if indeed Mr. Abramovich had made threats to the effect that Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s Sibneft “interests” would be expropriated if they did not sell to Mr. Abramovich at the price he demanded, that would strongly support Mr. Berezovsky’s case that the latter did indeed have such an interest.  Secondly, if, as Mr. Berezovsky contended, the only explanation for the sum of $1.3 billion paid by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the circumstances described below was that the sum represented the sale price of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili Sibneft interests, that also would necessarily support Mr. Berezovsky’s case.  </p>

If indeed I were of the view, having read and heard all the evidence, that Mr. Abramovich had intimidated or blackmailed Mr. Berezovsky, whether in the manner alleged or otherwise, it would be right that I should say so, notwithstanding that, theoretically, the issue of intimidation/blackmail might not have been relevant to my ultimate determination of the case.  Conversely, if I were not of that view, it would be fair to Mr. Abramovich that I should likewise express my conclusion.  </p>

In particular, Mr. Abramovich did not threaten, in the course of meetings in Moscow with Mr. Patarkatsishvili from about August 2000 to May 2001, that he would use his influence with the Putin regime to seek to cause Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests in Sibneft to be expropriated unless they sold their interests to him;  nor, in the course of meetings at Munich and Cologne airport in May 2001, did Mr. Abramovich threaten that he would use his influence within the Putin regime to seek to ensure that Mr. Glushkov would not be released from prison.  I also conclude that the sum of $1.3 billion paid by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili did not represent the sale price of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s alleged Sibneft interest, but rather was a final lump sum payment in order to discharge what Mr. Abramovich regarded as his <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> obligations.</p>

I had, and have, no doubt that this was Mr. Abramovich’s doing:  he wanted Nikolay to stay in prison because he was determined to use the same pressure to which we had submitted in relation to ORT again for his own purposes, in order to take our share of Sibneft.”</p>

But when he recognised that he has amazing leverage, then he made -- he is progressing in his, I don’t like to say, violence.

Thus, on any basis, Mr. Berezovsky’s Sibneft intimidation allegations were extremely serious ones<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="397">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>It was common ground that, both under Russian law, and English law, improper expropriation and detention by a state officer, and its procurement, would amount to a criminal offence.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Unlike the ORT intimidation allegation, which involved Mr. Abramovich merely acting as the agent of the Russian State in conveying the State’s message that it would continue to detain Mr. Glushkov and expropriate the ORT stake, unless Mr. Berezovsky agreed to sell the stake to Mr. Abramovich, the Sibneft intimidation allegations postulated the accusation that <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mr. Abramovich himself</span>, through his influence over President Putin and the then current administration, would bring about not only the expropriation by the State of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s alleged Sibneft interests, but also the continued imprisonment of Mr. Glushkov.  In other words, Mr. Berezovsky was accusing Mr. Abramovich not merely of being the messenger of the State’s blackmail threat, but rather as the enforcer of such threat, if the demands were not met.  It is because of Mr. Berezovsky’s reliance on what he asserts happened at the alleged Cap d’Antibes meeting on 7 December 2000 that my conclusions in relation to the ORT intimidation issue have such significance.</p>

As I have already said, in a case of this type which relates back to events which occurred many years ago, it may well be that inconsistencies in the pleading or presentation of a party’s case should not attract criticism or be regarded as undermining the central thrust of the claim or defence put forward.  That is particularly so where, as the trial draws nearer, investigations into the evidentiary background are more focused, and witnesses’ memories may be prompted by their having to concentrate their minds on detail.  But in circumstances where, as here, the court is left with the uneasy suspicion that the changes to Mr. Berezovsky’s case on critical facts (such as what he understood the alleged threats were, and how he assessed them), were tailored to meet legal difficulties raised on behalf of Mr. Abramovich or by the court, during the course of the summary judgment application, they become a necessary part of the evaluation process.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky did not originally suggest that there was a threat to expropriate his interest.  The threat, as allegedly conveyed by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Patarkatsishvili was that Sibneft, as a company, would be attacked by agencies of the Russian State if Mr. Berezovsky continued to be associated with it.  The allegation was couched in these terms, for example, in various press interviews, in Carter Ruck’s letter before action dated 14 May 2007 and in a witness statement given by Mr. Berezovsky dated 25 September 2007 in the context of litigation between other Russian oligarchs, namely the <span style="font-style:italic">Cherney v Deripaska </span> litigation.  In the letter before action the case alleged, in summary, was that Mr. Abramovich “advised” Mr. Patarkatsishvili that if Mr. Berezovsky continued to be associated with Sibneft, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the company</span> would come under attack from the Russian Prosecutor’s office and tax authorities in the same way as had Mr. Gusinsky’s companies.  The claim in the letter was based, not on implicit threats from Mr. Abramovich, but rather on the proposition that Mr. Berezovsky had been induced to part with his interest on the basis of “threats and intimidation” made by the Russian State, of which Mr. Abramovich had taken “unfair and unconscionable advantage”.  It did not allege any threats of action by Mr. Abramovich;  any threats of expropriation by the Russian State of Mr. Berezovsky’s or Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests;  or indeed any threats at all, even by the Russian government, before the alleged Munich airport meeting.  In cross-examination Mr. Berezovsky agreed that letter described “absolutely correctly” what he said was the “reality”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="412">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Sumption submitted that there was a conceptual difficulty inherent in Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the alleged threat that, unless he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili sold their Sibneft interests to Mr. Abramovich, the Russian authorities would expropriate such interests and that Mr. Abramovich would use his influence with President Putin to bring that about;  the difficulty was that Mr. Berezovsky’s case now was that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili simply had personal contractual rights as against Mr. Abramovich, in relation to their Sibneft and Sibneft-derived interests and not proprietary rights.  Mr. Sumption submitted that it was difficult to envisage how the State was going to go about expropriating an undocumented personal contractual right;  the notion that Mr. Abramovich was going to procure the Russian State to require Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to transfer their alleged personal contractual rights against Mr. Abramovich to the State, thereby substituting itself as the alleged “partner” of Mr. Abramovich had an air of unreality about it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr. Rabinowitz submitted in response, as a matter of legal technicality it would, of course, be possible for the Russian State to interfere with personal contractual rights and deprive a person of them.  He gave theoretical examples such as the State:  declaring that all of Mr. Berezovsky’s assets were forfeit to the State, so that any contractual obligations due to him were then due to the State;  or declaring that his contractual rights no longer existed;  or putting pressure on prosecutors and judges to refuse to recognise Mr. Berezovsky’s rights.  Mr. Rabinowitz pointed out that in any event, Mr. Berezovsky had never suggested that Mr. Abramovich actually used the word “expropriation” in his discussions with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, nor had he alleged that the precise way in which his interests would be taken were spelt out in so many words;  it did not need to be.  Mr. Rabinowitz referred to the fact that, as Mr. Berezovsky had explained in paragraph 373 of his 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> witness statement, Mr. Berezovsky had no doubt that a range of strategies using criminal investigations, court procedures, insolvency procedures, tax investigations and the like could have been used, if Mr. Abramovich had wanted.  He also submitted that, under whichever was the correct law of the tort, it was irrelevant whether the threat was in fact possible to carry out;  all that mattered was that Mr. Berezovsky believed that such measures could have been adopted and he was not challenged on such belief.</p>

The last thing that Mr. Abramovich would have wanted from a commercial point of view, given the history of the Sibneft privatisation, was the State, in effect, as assignee of Mr. Berezovsky (and Mr. Patarkatsishvili), having an equal share in Sibneft.  The far more obvious course would have been for Mr. Abramovich simply to have threatened that the two men would never be able to prove their undocumented rights against him in a Russian court.  But that was not a suggestion made by Mr. Berezovsky in his witness statement - nor was the allegation made that pressure could be exerted by the State on prosecutors and judges to refuse to recognise Mr. Berezovsky’s rights, notwithstanding Mr. Rabinowitz’s reference to it in argument.</p>

	      </authorialNote> that “<span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>expropriation” of Mr. Berezovsky’s alleged Sibneft interest could have been achieved, all involved action targeted against Sibneft itself.  It was implausible to suppose that Mr. Abramovich would seek to procure such damaging action against a company of which, on this hypothesis, he was 50% owner.  The idea, suggested at page 200 of Mr. Berezovsky’s First Schedule, that Mr. Abramovich could, or would, have procured the placing of Sibneft into bankruptcy, following some spurious tax investigation (also procured by him), so that he could have purchased its assets at an undervalue and thus have become 100% owner of the business, was also fanciful, given Sibneft’s reliance on Western loan capital and the reputational consequences of such a scheme for Mr. Abramovich.</p>

It was also clear that Mr. Abramovich had privileged access to President Putin, in the sense that he could arrange meetings and discuss matters with him, such as the purchase of the ORT shares, the release of Mr. Glushkov and Mr. Abramovich’s campaign in respect of the Chukotkan gubernatorial election.  This access also included information being conveyed back to Mr. Abramovich, by, for example, Mr. Voloshin in relation to discussions with Mr. Berezovsky at the Kremlin.  In his own commentary on the Le Bourget transcript, he referred to the fact that he had stated to the press that he could “… theoretically act as a trusted intermediary between Mr. Berezovsky and the government”.  He clearly acted as a conduit for the relaying of information from President Putin to Mr. Patarkatsishvili as to the latter’s ability to visit Russia, and no doubt also as to President Putin’s views on Mr. Berezovsky.  The experts on contemporary Russian history agreed that there were widespread reports in the Russian and international press suggesting that Mr. Abramovich was one of the oligarchs most favoured by President Putin and his administration.  Mr. Abramovich himself accepted that he was regarded by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili as “close to people in power in Moscow”.  But, as Mr. Voloshin explained, at the time, he was not a member of President Putin’s “inner circle”.</p>

The experts also agreed that these incidents would have been known to experienced Russian businessmen like Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich.

Nor do I accept Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence that either he or Mr. Patarkatsishvili genuinely believed that Mr. Abramovich was in a position to procure the continued detention of Mr. Glushkov or the wrongful expropriation of Mr. Berezovsky’s Sibneft interests.  The evidence which Mr. Berezovsky gave in relation to this issue was extravagant and unconvincing.  The two men might justifiably have considered that Mr. Abramovich, because of his connection with President Putin, might have been in a position to make representations to him or to Mr. Voloshin, in an attempt to secure Mr. Glushkov’s release on humanitarian or similar grounds, but that is a very different matter.  There was no evidence to suggest that Mr. Abramovich knew, or was a confidant of, the public prosecutor, or that he was in a position to influence the conduct of criminal proceedings.

There was no evidential basis supporting the contention that Mr. Abramovich was in a position to manipulate, or otherwise influence, President Putin, or officers in his administration, to exercise their powers in such a way as to enable Mr. Abramovich to achieve his own commercial goals.  At the time, Mr. Abramovich was not that type of political animal;  I am prepared to assume that, on occasion, President Putin may have taken his views into account when making decisions, but the suggestion that Mr. Abramovich was in a position to pull the presidential strings was simply not borne out by the evidence.</p>

In such circumstances Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had every motivation, at the beginning of 2001, to seek a final, once and for all, lump sum payment from Mr. Abramovich, whereby he in effect would “buy out” or satisfy, for all-time, his <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>obligations.  Mr. Berezovsky’s assertion that at the time he had plenty of money to finance a future life in exile was not in point, irrespective of the fact that it was unsupported by any evidence to demonstrate availability of sufficient cash funds in the West to finance a lifestyle of the type which he had previously enjoyed.  Mr. Berezovsky’s previous proposal, made at<span style="color:#000000"> the Le Bourget meeting, had been that some Sibneft shares should be transferred to him - although, as Mr. Abramovich said, and as I find, he had no entitlement to such transfer.  But he had apparently lost interest in that proposal, perhaps because of the tax consequences, and therefore he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili requested a lump sum payment.</span></p>

Although, when Mr. Abramovich informed Mr. Shvidler that he had offered around $l billion to end his relationship with Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Shvidler made his feelings very clear (as did other close associates) that Mr. Abramovich should not have agreed to pay anything like $1 billion, Mr. Abramovich himself explained in what I found to be credible terms why he made the decision.  First of all, he had been struggling with how he was going to deal with what he regarded as the increasingly unreasonable demands being made by Mr. Berezovsky, directly, and via Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  At the Courchevel meeting Mr. Patarkatsishvili had specifically told him that if he made one substantial payment then thereafter they both would be able to manage for themselves.  He had understood that this would be a final payment.  Thus he described his motives as follows:</p>

From a business point of view, I needed to ensure that I did not make an enemy of Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Although in late 2000 Mr. Berezovsky left Russia, at the time I had no way of knowing whether this state of affairs would last.  At the time I met with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, he was still able to travel freely to Moscow and so far as I am aware, still had his direct connections with President Putin.  It was not out of the question that, within a few months, Mr. Berezovsky would be back in Russia.  Mr. Berezovsky had a reputation for bouncing back against all odds.  I remember that in 1994 there was an attempt on his life, and he had to move to Switzerland.  Many people I knew at the time thought that Mr. Berezovsky was finished, but he returned to Russia and became more powerful than before.  Similarly, late in 1997 it became known that President Yeltsin had become tired of Mr. Berezovsky;  but then, in April 1998, Mr. Berezovsky succeeded in getting himself appointed Executive Secretary of the CIS.  Similarly, Mr. Berezovsky once injured his spinal cord, an injury that would normally leave someone paralyzed for life, but not him.  On another occasion he contracted Hepatitis C which would have been the end of some people, but, after a period of looking a little yellow, he bounced back!  He was quite an extraordinary person and the normal rules seemed not to apply to him.</p>

Nonetheless, I felt a sense of responsibility for ensuring that he was ‘set up for life’;  this payment was therefore also my way of saying to Mr. Berezovsky that, no matter what was happening in Russia, I remained loyal and would always respect what he had done for me.

He had been a fugitive for only three months.  He had been a highly resilient politician in the 1990s.  The criminal charges against him had been made and withdrawn before.  In his time he had been an ally of President Putin.  It was by no means clear that he was finished as a force in Russian politics.  In the light of these factors and the very clear sense of obligation which Mr. Abramovich clearly felt that he had towards Mr. Berezovsky and the considerable contribution which Mr. Berezovsky had made to the success of Sibneft, I do not find it surprising either that Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky should have sought to negotiate a final payment or that Mr. Abramovich should have considered it in his interests, and indeed, in a personal way, consistent with his <span style="font-style:italic">krysha </span>relationship, incumbent upon him, to do so.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the ultimate analysis I found that explanation to be credible.  I accept the Russian historical and other evidence that in the 1990s <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>-type relationships were a part of the business environment.  Put as its simplest, effectively under the arrangement between the three men, Mr. Abramovich had “promised” Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili a slice, and certainly a substantial slice, of the “Sibneft” action, in return for their political influence and protection;  it may well be that there were other aspects of the dealings between the three men which the evidence in this trial has not explored.  I do not find it surprising that, for the various reasons which he gave, by early 2001 Mr. Abramovich was keen to rid himself of that “obligation”.  But in order to do so, Mr. Abramovich was required, by the conventions of <span style="font-style:italic">krysha,</span> to pay a substantial sum.  Despite Mr. Rabinowitz’s submissions, I do not find it surprising in the least that no assurance was apparently secured by Mr. Abramovich to the effect that Mr. Berezovsky would not thereafter hold himself out as having any association with Sibneft or with Mr. Abramovich;  as already described at Section VIII above, it was only in June 2001 that for the first time Mr. Berezovsky actually claimed to have a shareholding interest in Sibneft;  any such assurance would have been pointless given Mr. Berezovsky’s predilection for engagement with the media, and unenforceable in any event;  even a request for such an assurance would have betrayed a negotiating weakness or vulnerability on Mr. Abramovich’s part.</p>

In particular, Mr. Rabinowitz suggested that Mr. Abramovich had changed his case from his original defence so as to allege that there were two meetings (instead of just one with Mr. Patarkatsishvili alone), that there were certain inconsistencies in his evidence and that it was largely reconstruction.  I do not accept these criticisms, for which Mr. Abramovich had adequate explanations.  It was not surprising with the passage of time that certain details had not originally been remembered;  obviously to a certain extent his evidence had been reconstructed in the sense of being triggered by reference to the chronology as supported by the travel records and the supporting evidence of other witnesses.

Because of Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to intimidation, it is relevant to note that, on 11 April 2001, in the intervening period between the Megève meeting and the subsequent meetings with Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Glushkov was charged with attempting to escape from custody.  As Mr. Abramovich accepted, this charge increased the risk that Mr. Glushkov would not be released from prison.  Mr. Berezovsky asserted that this increased the opportunity for Mr. Abramovich to exploit the situation, by using Mr. Glushkov’s freedom as a bargaining chip, the precedent for this, it was said, having been established by the case of Mr. Gusinsky in the summer of the previous year.  </p>

The first meeting was at Munich airport on 10 May 2001;  this was supported by evidence of Mr. Abramovich’s travel documents and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s travel and credit card receipts, which showed that they were both in Munich on that date.  There may have been a second meeting in Paris on 15 May 2001, when Mr. Abramovich was in Paris, and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s travel and credit card receipts suggest he was also there.  Ms Panchenko was also in Paris at the time, but she has no recollection of attending such a meeting.  A third meeting occurred at Cologne airport on 29 May 2001, which was also attended by Ms Panchenko, an executive at Sibneft and financial adviser to and acting for Mr. Abramovich, and Mr. Fomichev who was acting on behalf of Mr. Patarkatsishvili and/or Mr. Berezovsky.  </p>

This exchange was said to have occurred at a point in the meeting when Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were alone in the room.  Mr. Berezovsky claimed that a report of the threat was relayed to him by telephone by Mr. Patarkatsishvili, apparently from the meeting itself.  In his sixth witness statement, served shortly before the start of the trial, Mr. Berezovsky acknowledged that it was “possible” that the Paris and Cologne meetings occurred, and that he may have confused the meetings in Munich and Cologne.  I do not draw any inference adverse to Mr. Berezovsky based on the fact that, in the light of the later production of Ms Panchenko’s travel records, he changed his evidence as to the date and location of the meeting in this respect.  Mr. Abramovich himself had originally admitted that a meeting between Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Fomichev, Mr. Abramovich and Ms Panchenko had occurred in Munich;  he too changed his case, based on the disclosure of the travel records, to assert that the meeting at which Mr. Fomichev and Ms Panchenko were present was the Cologne airport meeting.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But the evidence relating to the meetings themselves, and to the context in which they took place, did not, in my judgment, establish that any express or implied threats were made by Mr. Abramovich, to intimidate Mr. Patarkatsishvili, against his will, into accepting a payment of the sum of $1.3 billion, either by reference to the continued imprisonment of Mr. Glushkov or by reference to the expropriation of the alleged Sibneft “interests”.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s evidence to the effect that no such intimidation took place.  I have no doubt that Mr. Abramovich adopted a tough negotiating stance in the discussions with Mr. Patarkatsishvili as to what the final payout figure should be and that Mr. Abramovich took such commercial advantage as he was able to derive from Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s weak bargaining position.  But I do not accept that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were threatened or blackmailed into accepting the figure of $1.3 billion, irrespective of whether it was the agreed purchase price of their alleged interests in Sibneft, or a buyout of Mr. Abramovich’s <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> obligations.</p>

In the absence of the valuation evidence, however, I make no finding as to the objective value of either Sibneft, or of a 50% share of its equity capital at the relevant time.  But, even on the assumption that Mr. Berezovsky held that belief, the evidence does not establish that Mr. Patarkatsishvili agreed to the figure of $1.3 billion only as a result of blackmailing threats made by Mr. Abramovich.</p>

I have already explained the circumstances in which the notes, and draft proofs and witness statements were compiled and expressed my views in relation to their relative unreliability.  He also relied upon witness statements that Ms. Duncan and Mr. McKim (the 2007 interviewing solicitors) gave as to “their understanding” of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s position following their interviews with him, as to the circumstances in which the alleged Sibneft interests had been disposed of.  Mr. Berezovsky also relied on hearsay evidence given by seven of his friends and associates who gave evidence of what they said Mr. Berezovsky had said to them in various times about the “threats” which he said caused him to “sell” out of Sibneft.</p>

The 2005 interview notes undoubtedly suggest that, by 2005, Mr. Patarkatsishvili believed, or at least was asserting, that he and Mr. Berezovsky did have an interest of some kind in Sibneft, which they had “sold” in 2001.  This was consistent with the position that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had taken since they had begun to move their assets offshore in early 2000.  But, as was submitted in Mr. Abramovich’s written and oral closing submissions, and as I conclude, even taken at face value, the 2005 interview notes and draft proofs, are inconsistent with the suggestion that intimidation by Mr. Abramovich played any part in the alleged “sale” to which Mr. Patarkatsishvili alleged that he agreed.  </p>

At this time it was clear that I would not be able to return to Moscow and would be forced to live as a political émigré.  To live in such circumstances without money is difficult.  BB resisted my proposal at first but finally agreed to sell.  I spoke with RA.  A meeting was set up in Munich in April/early May 2001.  RA came to the airport with his wife Irina, and their children.  Ruslan Fomichev also attended the meeting.  We took a small room (approximately 4 square meters) at the airport.  Our asking price for the shares was $2.5 billion, which already represented a discount as the value of the company at that time was at least $6-7 billion.  RA refused to meet our asking price.  This may have been because he did not have the money, or because he simply did not want our shares that much.  It may be that he only wanted to pay out of the dividends! I was aware that our shares were held on behalf of RA and that there was nothing in writing to prove our ownership.  I was therefore concerned that RA could obtain our shares for nothing.  </p>

There was no indication that Mr. Patarkatsishvili perceived any threat of adverse action by Mr. Abramovich in relation to the alleged Sibneft interests;  on the contrary, Mr. Patarkatsishvili appeared to be concerned to relieve pressure from the Kremlin on Mr. Abramovich so as to ensure that Sibneft itself - the golden goose that was providing the funding for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili - would not become a target.  These exchanges showed that, as Mr. Patarkatsishvili saw it, the concern was not that his own or Mr. Berezovsky’s interests in Sibneft might be singled out for expropriation by the Russian government, but rather that Sibneft itself would suffer.</p>

Although the proof goes on to say that it was unnecessary to mention Mr. Glushkov, because it was in any event clear that “his release was <span style="text-decoration:underline">one</span> of the reasons” [emphasis added] that he and Mr. Berezovsky were prepared to sell, Mr. Patarkatsishvili was not recorded as indicating that either Mr. Glushkov’s release or his continued detention was held out as an inducement or threat by Mr. Abramovich.  The fact that one of the reasons why they were prepared “to sell” was said to have been the prospect of Mr. Glushkov’s release, was not equivalent to any allegation of a promise of his release, or a threat of his continued detention (whether by the State or by Mr. Abramovich), unless a Sibneft related “sale” or payment was agreed.  It was clear from the evidence that in 2001 Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky had come under pressure from the State to sell their other media interests and were in negotiation to do so, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, because of their concerns and fears about Mr. Glushkov.  Such a comment, if truthful, and if relevant to the negotiations with Mr. Abramovich at all, which is questionable, could have equally been explained by the hope or expectation that the State would look more favourably on Mr. Glushkov’s release in circumstances where it was informed that all commercial relationships between the two men and Mr. Abramovich had terminated.  Moreover there was no suggestion that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was coerced into agreeing to anything;  the recognised weakness of his negotiating position was simply a harsh fact of life.  </p>

I was not prepared to accept such evidence as rebutting Mr. Abramovich’s account of what was said and what was not said at the May 2001 meetings.

The notes do not distinguish clearly whose words were being recorded at any one point.  By this time, Mr. Berezovsky had started his proceedings against Mr. Abramovich and, in the light of his participation in the proof-taking process, the whole thrust of the discussion is likely to have been self-serving and driven by Mr. Berezovsky’s agenda.  Moreover, even then the notes do not unambiguously record any clear or specific threat being made by Mr. Abramovich either in relation to expropriation or in relation to the continued detention of Mr. Glushkov;  for example, they appear to record Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s perception that the sale of the Sibneft shares would simply give the Russian authorities “less incentive to keep Glushkov in jail”.</p>

The thrust of the account was directed at the weakness of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s bargaining position and the pressure allegedly being applied upon Sibneft and upon Mr. Abramovich by President Putin and the Kremlin, because Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were his partners.</p>

As was submitted in Mr. Abramovich’s written closing submissions, even on the assumption that there was a confirmation in some unspecified form, it cannot have amounted to more than, at most, an acknowledgment by Mr. Abramovich of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s  concerns or hopes or expectations;  a confirmatory wink or nod on the part of Mr. Abramovich, in response to an oblique reference by Mr. Patarkatsishvili, could not possibly have been understood as a “threat” on the part of Mr. Abramovich to procure Mr. Glushkov’s prolonged imprisonment.  </p>

First, whilst Mr. Daniel Jowell QC, one of  Mr. Abramovich’s counsel, who cross-examined these witnesses, may not expressly have challenged the specific paragraphs in which they summarised their alleged “understandings”, he clearly and thoroughly challenged the basis upon which they felt able to express such views, and the validity of their conclusions.  Second, such evidence, given many years after the event was of very limited value in any event.  Third, some of the answers which they gave about their impressions I found to be unreliable, as I did with certain answers given by other solicitors involved in the Patarkatsishvili proofing exercise.  This itself was not surprising, given the passage of time and the circumstances in which the interviews took place.  Fourth, and most importantly, Ms Duncan’s and Mr. McKim’s recollections of the 2007 meetings with Mr. Patarkatsishvili were necessarily informed not just by what Mr. Patarkatsishvili had said, but also by what Mr. Berezovsky himself had said or had translated as being Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s recollections.  As Mr. McKim acknowledged, at the end of the meetings his understanding of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s position on the various factual issues could have been drawn from any combination of what Mr. Berezovsky said, from what Mr. Patarkatsishvili said and from Mr. Berezovsky’s “translations”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="439">

But, up to the time of his death in 2008, he had never advanced such claim, but, on the contrary, had always given the impression to Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Shvidler that he was happy with the payments which had been made<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="440">

	      </authorialNote>.  Of course, there might have been all kinds of understandable personal and commercial reasons why Mr. Patarkatsishvili might not have wished to have become involved as a co-claimant with Mr. Berezovsky, in what was undoubtedly going to be expensive litigation, notwithstanding that Mr. Patarkatsishvili might have believed that he and Mr. Berezovsky had a good claim against Mr. Abramovich.  But there was never any suggestion made by Mr. Patarkatsishvili to Ms Duncan, or to any of Mr. Berezovsky’s other solicitors, that he was considering becoming a co-claimant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In an attempt to corroborate his account of the events relating to the Sibneft intimidation issue, Mr. Berezovsky relied upon seven witnesses who gave evidence of what they said Mr. Berezovsky had said to them at various times about the “threats” which he said had caused him to “sell” out of Sibneft.  Mr. Berezovsky relied upon this evidence to rebut the suggestion that his case in relation to the Sibneft intimidation issue was recent fabrication.  I found that the evidence of these witnesses was of very limited assistance in enabling me to reach my final conclusion on this issue.  None of the witnesses were directly involved in the relevant events.  Even where such evidence of recollection was honestly given, I could attach very little weight to it.  Much of the evidence of allegedly previous consistent statements was plainly influenced by the personal loyalties of the particular witness to Mr. Berezovsky;  they all gave the impression of being keen to support evidence that had previously been given by him.  Many of such witnesses had been, and continue to be, beneficiaries of his financial largesse.  Their evidence was clearly susceptible to having been influenced, even if only unconsciously, by personal loyalties and wishful thinking, particularly where the witness had had a significant part in the preparation of Mr. Berezovsky’s case.  Necessarily it was very hard for such witnesses to distinguish, many years after the event, between different occasions on which he or she has discussed the same subject with Mr. Berezovsky.</p>

But, even if I were to accept her as a witness who did her best to give truthful evidence, that account was not consistent with Mr. Berezovsky’s case, which was that the threats relating to Mr. Glushkov in the context of the disposal of the Sibneft interests, were not made until a meeting between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili at a German airport in May 2001, and then were only made to Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Given my serious doubts as to her credibility, and because of its inconsistency with Mr. Berezovsky’s case, I do not accept her evidence;  if there had been any conversation as between her and Mr. Berezovsky in relation to Mr. Glushkov in April 2001, I agree with Mr. Abramovich’s submission that the likelihood was that it only related to the negotiations between the Russian state and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili concerning the disposal of a television station owned by them, TV6, in connection with which there was some evidence to suggest that pressure was being put on the two men by the Russian state to sell their interests.</p>

This is particularly significant because, in his asylum statements, Mr. Glushkov went to great lengths to describe how he was used as a “hostage” in connection with the Russian authorities’ “blackmailing” Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to sell their ORT shares.  If similar tactics had been employed in relation to his continued detention in the context of the alleged sale of Mr. Berezovsky’s Sibneft interests, it would have been surprising if that issue had not been deployed in his asylum application.  Perhaps aware of this lacuna, Mr. Glushkov attempted to explain in his trial witness statement that, at the time of his detention, he did not connect President Putin to the Sibneft sale.  But that is hard to reconcile with the assertion in that statement that, after the Sibneft sale, he told Mr. Berezovsky not to sell any further assets to secure his release.  Moreover, by the time of his asylum application, he would have discussed the matter with Mr. Berezovsky.

Further Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that the point ignored the existence of the “Devonia Agreement”, a purported agreement between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili of the first part, Devonia Investments Limited (“Devonia”), a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, of the second part, and Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (“the Sheikh”) of the third part.

We had agreed that if there was to be a sale, it would have to be recorded in writing and subject to English law.  Badri suggested that he would propose on our behalf a price of $2.5 billion.  I didn’t agree with that as I thought that our share in Sibneft was worth much more.  But Badri was sure that we were in no position to negotiate.  I told Badri that undoubtedly he could judge Mr. Abramovich’s mood better than I could, and I would support any decision that Badri took regarding the conduct of the negotiations and the final price.  At the same time, it was then that I decided and told Badri that the time would come when we would prove in a court in the West that Mr. Abramovich had forced us to sell our shares to him for a knockdown price through threats and intimidation, and we would make Mr. Abramovich compensate our losses.  However, at that time we found ourselves locked in a situation where we had no choice as to who the buyer would be and where that buyer in effect held a gun to our heads.</p>

Secondly, we wanted to ensure that the reason for the payments being made to us were clearly identified, so that there would not be any question that we were entitled to receive the sums, and to avoid any money laundering concerns.

By May 2001, both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were political exiles from Russia.  They needed money to fund their lifestyles abroad, at least for the duration of President Putin’s administration, the length of which was uncertain.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s view appears to have been that he and Mr. Berezovsky were not in a strong bargaining position.  Mr. Berezovsky needed the money to fund his political career and, having left Russia, apparently had no other income.  Mr. Berezovsky himself admitted that “definitely I need money”, before suggesting that that was not his reason to accept the $1.3 billion<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="460">

	      </authorialNote>.  Whatever the nature of their arrangements were with Mr. Abramovich, and whatever they thought that their entitlement was under such arrangements, they were entirely undocumented and would have been difficult, if not impossible, to have enforced.  They would have appreciated that, given their political status as exiles, they were hardly in a position, in the near future at least, to provide any <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> or other services to Mr. Abramovich that would have commanded the quantum of remuneration which they had received from him in the past.  They could hardly be certain in their changed circumstances that he would be willing to continue to finance their expenditures.  Even if they believed that they were entitled to Sibneft shares, or some sort of interest in Sibneft, they would have appreciated that the value of Sibneft would have been in jeopardy if they had called for the registration of Sibneft shares in their own names or in that of their nominees.  Mr. Berezovsky was under criminal investigation in relation to alleged embezzlement of Aeroflot funds and was out of favour with the Russian government.  By April 2001, Mr. Patarkatsishvili was also accused of having sought to assist Mr. Glushkov to escape custody.  The $1.3 billion payment had the significant advantage for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili that they were able to receive their money in offshore accounts without tax or exchange control problems, and in Mr. Berezovsky’s case, without running the risk that the assets might be frozen by the Russian authorities on account of the criminal investigations against him.</p>

I conclude that Mr. Abramovich did not make either express or implied threats to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, with the intention of intimidating them to dispose of their alleged interests in Sibneft, as Mr. Berezovsky has alleged.  I also conclude that the sum of $1.3 billion paid by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili did not represent the sale price of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s alleged Sibneft interest, but rather was a final lump sum payment in order to discharge what Mr. Abramovich regarded as his <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> obligations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusions in relation to this issue may be stated as follows.  First, the Devonia Agreement was not a genuine agreement.  It was a sham agreement, entered into for the purposes of generating documentation that would give a false impression that a genuine commercial transaction had been entered into, so as to satisfy the money-laundering requirements of the UK bank, into accounts at which the $1.3 billion paid by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili was, ultimately, going to be paid.  Second, Mr. Abramovich was not involved in, or party to, the Devonia Agreement and was not aware of its terms:  such limited involvement as there was, at a low level, by members of his accounting staff in what might loosely be referred to as the Devonia Agreement transaction was directed at, and limited to, the mechanics for the payment by an Abramovich controlled company of the $1.3 billion to Devonia’s account.  Third, contrary to the terms of the Devonia Agreement, there was never any genuine intention that Devonia would “transfer the beneficial interests in the Shares being [purportedly] purchased” under the agreement to Mr. Abramovich or companies or entities controlled by, or associated with, him.  Fourth, Devonia never did transfer such interests to Mr. Abramovich or any companies associated with him.  Fifth, because it was a sham transaction, the Devonia Agreement did not support Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements or in relation to the Sibneft intimidation issue.  Sixth, on the contrary, the evidence relating to the issue, and the fact that Mr. Berezovsky chose to assert that the Devonia Agreement was a genuine agreement, did not reflect well on Mr. Berezovsky’s credibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Berezovsky’s case, both in closing, as well as in opening, was that the Devonia Agreement was a genuine transaction which supported Mr. Berezovsky’s case as to the existence of the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements.  The terms of the Devonia Agreement, including in particular its recitals, were relied upon as a written or paper record not only of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests in Sibneft, but also as a record of their effective sale or surrender of such interests to Mr. Abramovich (notwithstanding that the direct sale was to Devonia).  It was contended that, although Mr. Abramovich was not a party to the Devonia Agreement, and did not need to see it, he must have known that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were selling their Sibneft interests to a non-Russian entity controlled by the Sheikh under the terms of an English law/jurisdiction agreement.  It was further contended that the involvement of Mr. Abramovich’s staff in the transaction, such as Ms. Khudyk, and her communications with Mr. Jacobson of Curtis &amp; Co underlined the genuine nature of the transaction, as did the due diligence conducted by Curtis &amp; Co, Clydesdale Bank (“Clydesdale”) and Denton Wilde Sapte in relation to it;  in particular it was submitted that it was inconceivable that Mr. Curtis would have acted in the way which he did, if he had known or believed the Devonia transaction to be a sham.  It was also asserted that there was indeed an on-sale by Devonia of the Sibneft interests sold by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to Mr. Abramovich.</p>

But it is no longer Mr. Berezovsky’s case that he had any “beneficial interest” in any shares in Sibneft.  His claim to have a beneficial interest in such shares was deleted from his particulars of claim by amendment in 2009.  As I have already described, his case is that what he acquired under the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements were personal and contractual rights against Mr. Abramovich in relation to Sibneft, including profits generated by Mr. Abramovich’s trading companies, as a result of Mr. Abramovich’s acquisition and control of Sibneft, and, as a result, “common” property rights in any property created or acquired by Mr. Abramovich as a result of the “joint activity” between the three men.</p>

In consequence, in Russian law, the “common property” in relation to which any rights of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili arose could not have been the shares in Sibneft.

An agreement which purports to record the sale of rights which Mr. Berezovsky now no longer asserts that he had ever held, must raise even the most indulgent of judicial eyebrows.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground between the parties that by 2000, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were well aware of the potential problems posed by the money-laundering regulations in force in most Western countries, in particular the EU and the United States.  Large cash transfers were likely to provoke enquiries about the source of the funds.  These enquiries would have been difficult to answer satisfactorily, unless it could have been demonstrated that the funds represented the proceeds of an identifiable asset to which the fundholder was entitled, or monies to which they were genuinely entitled under a written commercial contract.  It was clear that this was a serious problem for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, once they left Russia.  A substantial amount of the funds which they had hitherto utilised to fund their living expenses and their other activities had ultimately been derived from undocumented Russian sources.  In the future, the funds which were going to provide for their future livelihood, including the proceeds of the ORT sale and the $1.3 billion which Mr. Abramovich was going to pay, had to be available to the two men outside Russia, and at least, so far as Mr. Berezovsky was concerned, had to be available in a Western bank, in a country where he could safely live as a political refugee, free from the risk of extradition.  As the evidence showed, in 2000 and 2001 the anti money-laundering procedures adopted by Western banks were becoming ever more rigorous, especially where the funds concerned derived from Russia.  Satisfying, or circumventing, these procedures was an important and necessary feature of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s business arrangements.  It necessarily affected Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s dealings with banks and professional intermediaries.  This was common ground on the evidence between the parties.  It was also clear from the evidence that Mr. Abramovich appreciated Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s concerns in this respect and, so far as he was able, was prepared to assist them in their efforts to ensure that any payments made by him or his companies would be accepted on a “legalised” basis by the relevant payee bank outside Russia;  in other words, that the receipt by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili of such payments would be in a manner that was regarded as compliant by such bank with its anti-money-laundering enquiries and requirements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There had been a previous transaction, referred to as the Spectrum transaction, which had many similar features to the Devonia transaction.  The Spectrum transaction had been used by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to generate documentation to meet the money-laundering enquiries of Western banks in relation to the receipt, outside Russia, by the two men of $140 million in relation to the sale of their interests in ORT to companies controlled by Mr. Abramovich.  As already described, the true sale price was $150 million, but the price expressly recorded in the formal sale agreements was merely $10 million, the balance of $140 million being paid offshore, not merely because Mr. Berezovsky was by this time an exile, and had concerns about the Russian State freezing the proceeds, but also because he was concerned about whether he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would get exchange control from the Russian Central Bank to export the funds from Russia.  For this reason, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili wanted the amount paid in Russia for the ORT shares to be an absolute minimum.  The structure of the transaction was a matter that was discussed at the Le Bourget meeting.  It was apparently Mr. Andrei Gorodilov who suggested a proposal whereby Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky would sell a call option to one of Mr. Abramovich’s offshore companies to satisfy the foreign banks’ money laundering requirements.  Another simpler proposal was discussed, whereby Mr. Abramovich’s companies would simply make a straight payment to offshore accounts designated by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili;  the latter would make the necessary arrangements for what was euphemistically referred to at trial as “legalising” the funds (i.e. to represent them as deriving from a legitimate source so as to satisfy the legal money-laundering requirements of the ultimate recipient bank into which the monies were paid);  and Mr. Abramovich would agree to pay all or some part of the costs and commission which Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have to pay in order to “legalise” the funds.  In the end, as I find, the latter, more simple, course was adopted so far as Mr. Abramovich was concerned.  Mr. Abramovich was told that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have to pay 20% “commission” in order to “legalise” the $140 million which was going to be paid abroad;  and Mr. Abramovich agreed to pay 10% of this sum, amounting to some $14 million.  Therefore a total of $154 million was going to be paid abroad.</p>

These contracts were dated 25 December 2000 but were executed by LogoVAZ on 28 December 2000 and by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on 29 December 2000.  The shares were registered in the names of Akmos and Betas at the Moscow Companies Registry on 29 December 2000.  Betas paid LogoVAZ a nominal price for its holding, while the price recorded in the sale agreements with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili was $10 million ($5 million each).  However, as described above, the true price was $150 million, and therefore the rationale for the receipt into a Western bank account of $140 million by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili required to be documented.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili executed the call option agreement sometime after 9 February 2001, when Mr. Curtis wrote to Mr. Ivlev, who was acting on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in relation to the transaction, to remind him that it was necessary for their clients to execute the option agreement.  Spectrum executed both the call option agreement and the deed of assignment on about 11 June 2001, when signed copies of both instruments were faxed to Curtis &amp; Co’s office.  At some stage after this date and before August 2002, a signature was purportedly added to the deed of assignment on behalf of Akmos.  As at June 2001, Curtis &amp; Co only had a copy of the assignment agreement signed by the Sheikh.  On 6 August 2002 a deed of assignment signed by the Sheikh and purportedly signed by Akmos was sent by Mr. Jacobson to Mr. Kay’s office, Mr. Kay being at that time aide and advisor to Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Mr. Jacobson said in cross-examination that he had “no idea” how the signature came to be on the copy of the document which Curtis &amp; Co had held since June 2001.  He agreed that the document which he had sent to Mr. Kay had been in the files of Curtis &amp; Co since June without Akmos’ signature on it.  Mr. Jacobson confirmed that there was no other documentary record in the Curtis &amp; Co file of any other agreement as executed by the Sheikh, apart from the copy faxed on 11 June, nor any record of the firm itself having arranged for an Akmos signature to be appended to the assignment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As submitted on behalf of Mr. Abramovich, I conclude that the Spectrum agreements were a sham.  They were not seen by Mr. Abramovich at the time, nor by anybody acting on his behalf in relation to the ORT transaction, including, in particular, Mr. Gorodilov, Ms. Panchenko and Ms. Popenkova.  Mr. Gorodilov and Ms. Panchenko gave evidence to the effect that the purported execution of the assignment on behalf of Akmos was a forgery, which I accept and which, in any event, was not challenged.  The arrangements could never have been intended, or effective, to confer call options on Spectrum, because the ORT-KB shares had already been transferred to Akmos by 29 December 2000 and indeed it had been registered as an ORT-KB shareholder by that date.  Therefore, by the time that the call option agreement was drafted, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had no shares over which they could grant a call option, and Akmos was already the owner of the shares which were the subject of the deed of assignment.  Mr. Curtis was well aware of the date of registration of the transfer, at any rate by 5 February 2001 when he was told about it by Mr. Ivlev.  Further, the $140 million had been paid into Spectrum’s account by Mr. Abramovich’s companies by 25 January 2001, and by Spectrum to the Clydesdale accounts of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on 13 February 2001, in each case before the call option agreement or assignment were executed by all parties.  Mr. Curtis was likely to have been aware of the date of the payments into the Clydesdale accounts on about 13 February 2001, since Curtis &amp; Co had access to the Clydesdale statements.  Perhaps not surprisingly, there was no evidence of the option ever having been exercised or of the agreements having been used for any other purpose.</p>

Thus the Spectrum documentation purported to show that money had been received from an “acceptable” person or source, so far as the bank’s anti-money laundering requirements were concerned (i.e. the Sheikh), and represented payment by his company, Spectrum, of the price for the grant of a call option to Spectrum, under the terms of an English law option agreement, rather than the funds representing the sale price of shares in a Russian registered company, paid by an unknown vendor in circumstances where the bank would have had difficulty in checking whether, for example, Russian exchange control or other legal requirements had been complied with in relation to the sale of such shares.</p>

The Devonia Agreement did not purport to be made with Mr. Abramovich, and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would not have been able to have ensured Mr. Abramovich’s compliance with his outstanding instalment obligations, simply by recourse to the Devonia Agreement.  </p>

It was common ground between the parties that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a real need to document transactions in relation to their receipt of funds outside Russia, so that the anti- money-laundering requirements and procedures of Western banks could be satisfied and that that Mr. Abramovich knew of the importance to the two men of this requirement.  To that extent, I accept that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a real need to produce documentation justifying their receipt of funds outside Russia, so as to ensure that they were in a position to comply with any anti-money-laundering requirements or procedures of Western banks;  but I do not accept that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had any wish that the genuine reason for such payments should be specified in the documents.  </p>

She was asked by Ms. Panchenko to liaise with Mr. Fomichev, who was identified to her as Mr. Berezovsky’s representative, in relation to the administrative steps and documentation required to set up the arrangements for a payment of approximately $1 billion, subject to the supervision of Ms. Panchenko.  Various options for doing so were considered, which were reflected in a document created by Ms. Khudyk called “Payment Schemes”.  At some point in May 2001, Ms. Panchenko suggested that the Latvian Trade Bank (“LTB”) should be used to receive the funds on Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s behalf, as it was a bank used by a number of Mr. Abramovich’s companies and they had a good relationship with it.  Ms. Khudyk was thus also instructed to assist Mr. Fomichev to open an account with LTB.  One proposal, put forward by Mr. Fomichev to Ms. Khudyk, was that the transfer of the agreed sum to Mr. Berezovsky and/or Mr. Patarkatsishvili should be effected by means of a transfer of securities to the two men;  the proposal was that one of Mr. Abramovich’s companies would declare advance distribution of profit to an entity, or entities, specified by Mr. Fomichev;  at the same time the entity/entities specified by Mr. Fomichev would instruct Mr. Abramovich’s company to pay the dividends in the form of securities specified by Mr. Fomichev, which Mr. Abramovich’s company would then acquire in the market through its broker and take them to a custodian where the entity/entities specified by Mr. Fomichev had accounts.  Ms. Khudyk described how during a certain period it was unclear which of the two possible options (securities or cash) was going to be utilised to make the payment and therefore the two options were developed concurrently, although it appeared that the dividend mechanism was going to be utilised in any event, irrespective of whether the dividend was paid in cash or in specie (i.e. by transfer of securities).</p>

As recorded in the note, Mr. Curtis said that Sibneft was owned 50% by Mr. Abramovich and 50% by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili jointly, but that, notwithstanding, the company’s shares were registered 100% in the name of Mr. Abramovich.

Mr. Jacobson faxed to the meeting a preliminary discussion draft of a share sale and purchase agreement between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on the one hand and Mr. Abramovich on the other hand.  There appeared to be various long form and short form drafts in contemplation.

In addition to the draft form of sale agreement, a draft form of release under which Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili released any claim which they might have against Mr. Abramovich in relation to the shares, once they had been paid the sums due to them for transferring their beneficial interest in the shares,  was also considered.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision was taken that the direct agreement should be in the shorter version, and Mr. Jacobson, who was tasked with the drafting, was instructed by notes from Mr. Curtis that the clients “… want new short form with confirmation of trust arrangements please” and that it was important to “particularly ensure that the trust clause is inserted”.  A draft of a direct agreement was faxed to Mr. Fomichev on 19 May 2001.  This referred to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili (confusingly defined as “the Transferees”) as the beneficial owners of approximately 44% of the issued and allotted share capital of Sibneft (defined as “the Shares”) and contained confirmation by Mr. Abramovich that “at the Transferees’ request” he had procured that “the registered holders of the Shares were legal entities directly or indirectly wholly owned and/or controlled by him”;  and that he held the shares and/or controlled the registered holders “and through them the Shares as nominee in trust for and on behalf of the Transferees absolutely”.  The draft form of release was “abandoned” on 18 May 2001, the day after it had been drafted.  Mr. Jacobson could not assist in his oral evidence as to why the release was abandoned.  The clear inference which I draw is that the release, like the proposal to have a direct sale agreement as between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and Mr. Abramovich of their alleged beneficial interests, was abandoned because Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili knew well that Mr. Abramovich would not have been prepared, even in order to assist them with their money-laundering objectives, to have signed an agreement purporting to purchase interests which they did not own.</p>

These would be designed to explain to the Russian authorities why such a large payment was being made by Mr. Abramovich to the Sheikh.  The idea appears to have been that the Sheikh would grant Sibneft an oil concession on land known to have no oil under it, to which the payment could be related.  To this end, Curtis &amp; Co drafted two licence agreements each recording the grant of an oil concession to Sibneft for $550 million.  These documents were discussed by Curtis &amp; Co with Dr. Jumean of the Sheikh’s Private Management Office, and e-mailed by Curtis &amp; Co to Mr. Fomichev on 20 May 2001.  In fact the proposal was abandoned shortly thereafter;  as Mr. Jacobson observed in his witness statement, the suggestion that the Sheikh should grant an oil licence for land with no oil would have raised some eyebrows.  There was no evidence that they were ever discussed with anyone on Mr. Abramovich’s side, which clearly they would have had to have been, if Sibneft was to be granted an “oil concession”.</p>

The effect of the agreement would be that Sheikh Sultan would purchase BB/AP interest at a discount and then sell on the shares to RA while retaining a minor interest.  The reason behind the Sheikh being involved with the transaction was quite obviously his interest in the oil business and it would also benefit him to have a stake in that particular Russian oil company as he was expanding his oil business assets worldwide.

It was also agreed that the Sheikh would provide his own cash to pay for the shares.  SLC expected to receive a substantial amount of money in relation to this transaction as it related to the original introduction.  As he was not involved on the sale on to RA, he would have no way of calculating the fee but was happy for the Sheikh to designate a figure.  RA was expected to use profits from one of his aluminium operations in Russia to pay for the shares.  SLC confirmed that RA was in control of 90% of the Russian aluminium industry.  SLC explained that the reason why it had been structured this way was that RA was the 100% registered owner and had made representations in Russia that he was the beneficial owner.  Therefore, it was difficult to justify any payment by RA for purchasing these shares.  RA was also not prepared to acknowledge the trust arrangement.”</p>

Mr. Jacobson, as I have already said, confirmed that there was no evidence of any contact between Mr. Abramovich’s staff and Curtis &amp; Co (other than the limited contact with Ms. Khudyk in respect of the payment arrangements and setting up the bank account for Devonia) and could not assist on when or why there had been a change in plan resulting in the proposal for a direct contract between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili being dropped and replaced by a proposal for a purported sale of such interests to Devonia.  Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence in his witness statement was to the effect that he knew from Mr. Patarkatsishvili that Mr. Abramovich was refusing to make payment directly to them because Mr. Abramovich was concerned that he should not be seen to be paying money to Mr. Berezovsky as this would be harmful to him;  he suggested in effect that it was because of Mr. Abramovich’s insistence that there should be no direct payment that it was necessary to effect payment via the Sheikh.  In cross-examination, however, he said that he did not remember discussing any document and did not know whether there had ever been a request for a direct contract.  I hold that no proposal was ever made to Mr. Abramovich, whether by Mr. Patarkatsishvili or anyone else, for a direct contract of sale between himself and the two men of the latter’s alleged beneficial interest in Sibneft shares, and that there was no rejection on Mr. Abramovich’s part of any such proposal.  I conclude that the overwhelming likelihood is that, whatever Mr. Curtis’s advice, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili appreciated that there was no way in which they would ever persuade Mr. Abramovich, even solely for the purpose of helping them with the “legalisation” of their receipt of funds, to sign up to an agreement reflecting the purported sale of non-existent ownership interests in Sibneft shares, which they must have known that at least he did not consider that they owned.  </p>

Mr. Curtis’ revised proposal was that, instead of a direct contract with Mr. Abramovich, the documents would now record an agreement by which Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili sold their alleged beneficial interests in Sibneft shares to Devonia, purportedly on the basis that Devonia would sell those interests on to Mr. Abramovich, with the Sheikh taking a turn on the transaction.  The structure of the sale was to be an outright sale of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s alleged interest in one thirteenth of their holding, and the grant of a series of twelve options, exercisable over a period of eight months, to purchase further thirteenths.  Each of the thirteen tranches would be sold for $100 million.  </p>

Mr. Curtis copied both drafts to Ms. Hilton at Clydesdale.  The draft letter to Dr. Jumean set out the new proposal to sell the stake to the Sheikh, and described the stages in which payment would be made, starting with the initial payment of $500 million.  Mr. Curtis explained in the draft that Mr. Abramovich would not enter into a direct agreement with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili because he would not be willing to recognise that they had any interest in Sibneft.  He referred to the “nebulous” character of the interest which in these circumstances the Sheikh would be buying, but observed that this was likely to be a “sticking point” for Mr. Abramovich.  As Mr. Jacobson said in his oral evidence, the interest was nebulous because it was undocumented and unacknowledged.  He confirmed that Mr. Curtis knew, probably (Mr. Jacobson guessed) from Mr. Fomichev, that at this time Mr. Abramovich would not acknowledge any interest.  </p>

He also explained that the new arrangements meant that, owing to his pre-existing relationship with the Sheikh, his firm could no longer act for Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili but would henceforth act only for the Sheikh.  All of this was said to reflect “ongoing discussions” with Dr. Jumean.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first draft of what became the Devonia Agreement between Devonia and Messrs Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili was prepared on the following day, 30 May 2001.  The bank responded to Mr. Curtis’s oral and written report of the change of plan by expressing concern that the Sheikh appeared to be exposing himself to a remarkable risk.  The bank was concerned that the Sheikh might simply be passing money received from Mr. Abramovich through to the trusts of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and the bank asked for assurances on this point.  Apparently the bank was not prepared to receive Mr. Abramovich’s funds.  As Mr. Jacobson agreed in cross-examination, on its face, this was an extraordinary transaction in which the Sheikh was going to buy for $1.3 billion an undocumented equitable interest in a Russian oil company in circumstances in which the registered owner of the shares was not prepared to acknowledge the existence of the interest.  Mr. Curtis wrote to them on 31 May 2001 assuring them that there was no intention simply to recycle Mr. Abramovich’s funds;  Mr. Abramovich would be depositing funds with the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in advance in order to secure the payment of the price which would become due from him if, and when, the Sheikh acquired Messrs Berezovsky’s and Patarkatsishvili’s interest in each successive tranche of shares and sold it on to Mr. Abramovich.  But, he said, the Sheikh would not be drawing on these deposits to pay Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili;  he would be using his personal funds.  He told Clydesdale that the Sheikh would be writing to them directly to confirm this, which the Sheikh duly did on 5 June 2001.  However the evidence showed that not only did Mr. Abramovich never make any such deposits with the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, but also that Mr. Curtis had no basis upon which to give the assurance to the Clydesdale that Mr. Abramovich was going to do so;  the Curtis &amp; Co files and Mr. Jacobson’s evidence confirmed that there was no communication with anyone on Mr. Abramovich’s side that would justify any such assertion;  nor was there even any confirmation from the Sheikh that such deposits were going to be, or had been, made.</p>

Mr. Moss travelled with Mr. Kay to Baden-Baden in order to obtain Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s signature to the Devonia Agreement.  The attendance note records a discussion between Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Anisimov, who was also in Baden-Baden at the time (and who was inaccurately referred to in the note “as Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s oldest friend and adviser”), and Mr. Kay in relation to the terms of the Devonia Agreement.

He was not Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s “adviser”.  I make this comment merely to demonstrate that Mr. Moss’s note, not surprisingly, given the circumstances, cannot be regarded as entirely accurate.  Mr. Anisimov did not speak English.  He was cross-examined about this note by Mr. Rabinowitz.  As he said, and as I accept, he was certainly not Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s adviser.  In these two respects Mr. Moss’ note was clearly inaccurate.  Mr. Anisimov was on holiday in Baden-Baden at the time.  He did not deny that was present at such meeting, although he had no recollection of it whatsoever.  He said that even if he had participated in the conversation, he would not have been involved in any formal negotiations about such a matter, which was nothing to do with him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the note cannot be regarded as in any way supporting the alleged authenticity of the Devonia Agreement.  The fact that Mr. Moss may have been keen to take Mr. Patarkatsishvili through its provisions and pointed out some of the potential consequences in relation to the giving of warranties, simply does not address the issue as to whether the transaction was genuine.  Moreover, as the evidence showed, Mr. Moss and Reid Minty itself clearly had extremely limited knowledge about the transaction.  Nor did the note, or the evidence given by Mr. Anisimov in cross-examination, support the proposition that Mr. Anisimov knew that Mr. Berezovsky had a stake in Sibneft in 2001, or the proposition that Mr. Berezovsky did in fact have such a stake.  Mr. Anisimov said both in evidence and his witness statement that he did not know, and had never known, what arrangements Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky had had regarding Sibneft.  I accept that evidence.  Even if Mr. Moss’ note is taken as substantially correct (and he was not called as a witness), there is no reason why Mr. Anisimov should have bothered to concentrate on the detailed terms of the Devonia Agreement, apparently conveyed in translation by Mr. Kay, or should be taken to have concurred with the statements made in it.</p>

Mr. Jacobson was not able to assist the Court in cross-examination as to why Mr. Curtis did not want to act in relation to the on-sale.

I infer that the reason why Mr. Curtis expressly stated that he would not be retained in relation to the on-sale, was to ensure that he would not be put in a position where he was expected to answer any questions which Clydesdale might have raised about the on-sale, save in very general terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, under the transaction the Sheikh was apparently proposing to purchase an undocumented equitable interest in a substantial part of the shares of a Russian company, in circumstances where the holder of the legal interest was said to be unwilling to acknowledge that the equitable interest existed.  That exposed the Sheikh to substantial risk given that he was apparently acquiring, in Mr. Curtis’ words:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, whether the transaction was a genuine one, and accepted by Clydesdale as such, depended critically on whether there were indeed genuine arrangements between Devonia and Mr. Abramovich for the on-sale to Mr. Abramovich, and for the provision to the Sheikh of security in the form of advance deposits from Mr. Abramovich in with the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.  But Mr. Curtis’ statement that he was not being instructed in relation to the on-sale, effectively prevented Clydesdale from making any further enquiries.  In fact, there was no on sale to Mr. Abramovich and no security advance deposits.  I address this aspect in further detail below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the next surprising feature was that the scheme of successive call options, which was proposed for all but the first thirteenth tranche of Messrs Berezovsky’s and Patarkatsishvili’s alleged beneficial interests in Sibneft shares, did not provide any guarantee that they would actually get the full $1.3 billion.  This was because they were only call options, which did not impose any obligation on Devonia to exercise them.  Under the terms of the proposed Devonia Agreement, the only sum that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were assured of receiving was $100 million for the first tranche of their alleged beneficial interests, which was unconditionally “sold” to Devonia.  This would have been a serious risk for them if the Devonia Agreement had indeed been a genuine transaction.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.50in">That explanation struck me as wholly unreal.  On Mr. Berezovsky’s own case, he had been intimidated into selling his alleged “interests” in Sibneft shares, because of threats about Mr. Glushkov and expropriation;  one might have thought that, if that had been so, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have been extremely anxious that the sale of the entirety of their interests should be implemented as quickly as possible, and that they were paid the entirety of the price for their sale or surrender of such interests.  Moreover one of Mr. Berezovsky’s asserted reasons for wanting to document the transaction was to ensure that he got paid by Mr. Abramovich.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, another surprising feature of the arrangement, if indeed it had been a genuine one, was that, as in the case of the Spectrum transaction which was used to window-dress the ORT receipts, Mr. Curtis received a substantial personal “introduction” commission on the deal, in an amount of at least $13.8 million, in addition to his firm’s professional fees of £481,068.  The commission was agreed between Mr. Curtis and the Sheikh, but, although this was not clear from the evidence, it appears to have been paid by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, since it came out of the funds received by Devonia from Mr. Abramovich.  I find, despite the denial which he gave in evidence, that Mr. Berezovsky was aware of the commission and its payment;  the documents show that he expressly consented to it.  Mr. Curtis was recorded (by Mr. Keeling in an attendance note dated 5 December 2002) as making the point:  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… that the fees due to him over which the US$13.8 million form part, are part of the fee of 0.66% of the ‘turn’ between the price at which Sheikh Sultan purchased the Sibneft beneficial interests Sibneft from [Messrs Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili] and the price at which he has sold those beneficial interests to Abramovich.  Originally the Sheikh was going to pay those fees but it had been agreed that it would be taken from BB’s share (i.e. Itchen Trust) and credit would therefore be given for that amount in the context of the Sibneft shares (beneficial interests) transaction.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="464">

The alternative is that it is a reference to the Sheikh being debited with the amount in the accounting as between him and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  For the purposes of the point presently under consideration, it is irrelevant whether the Sheikh or Mr. Berezovsky/Mr. Patarkatsishvili actually paid Mr. Curtis’s commission. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In May 2003, Mr. Curtis also received an additional $4.5 million as a result of the transaction “for services rendered to Itchen Trust” (the Itchen Trust being the Berezovsky trust set up to receive the proceeds of the Devonia transaction).  This sum was also paid to Mr. Curtis directly by Devonia, in effect at the expense of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Similar, but smaller, commissions were received by the other advisers and intermediaries involved:  Dr. Jumean, Mr. Fomichev and Mr. Kay.  The fact that a substantial “cut” was paid to Mr. Curtis, by Mr. Berezovsky, whether in addition to the Sheikh’s approximate 15% “turn” on the deal of approximately $200,000,000, or carved out of the Sheikh’s commission, strongly suggests that this was not a genuine transaction but rather a money-laundering scheme.  On no basis could such a fee be justified as a legitimate professional fee for the legal services provided by Curtis &amp; Co, either to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili or to the Sheikh.  The overwhelming inference is that this fee was paid to Mr. Curtis for his role in enabling Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to receive the funds in the UK in a manner that appeared at least to be compliant with anti-money laundering requirements.  </p>

Not only was Mr. Curtis’ fee in connection with the transaction exceptionally large but it was also, as the evidence showed, subsequently disguised, probably for tax avoidance, if not evasion, reasons, as fees for services supposedly provided to various trusts and funds owned by Mr. Berezovsky.  The quantum of the fee was a clear pointer to the true nature of the Devonia transaction.  Moreover as I have already described, there was no evidence at all that Mr. Curtis “brokered” any deal with Mr. Abramovich, that he advised Mr. Abramovich in any way, or that he had had any meaningful “historic dealings” with him.</p>

But there was no such correlation.  Again I address this issue below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was clear from the evidence that Mr. Berezovsky knew that the reason for the interposition of Devonia and the Sheikh into the transaction was to enable Clydesdale to be satisfied that its anti-money laundering requirements had been complied with and thereby enable Mr. Berezovsky and his trusts to receive the $1.3 billion in the U.K.  He knew that the deal to make a payment of $1.3 billion had been directly agreed as between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  He had alleged in his witness statement that one possibility which he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had discussed “was a direct sale to Mr. Abramovich”;  however there was no evidence that such a proposal was ever discussed with Mr. Abramovich;  the reason put forward by Mr. Berezovsky for this was that Mr. Abramovich had told Mr. Patarkatsishvili that he “did not want his dealings with me to be too visible”.  Yet Mr. Berezovsky was not aware of any attempt by Mr. Patarkatsishvili to obtain a written document from Mr. Abramovich to that effect.  Mr. Curtis consulted him and Mr. Patarkatsishvili personally about Mr. Curtis’ original proposals for documenting the transaction on 17 May 2001.  He admitted that the purpose of the Devonia structure was to protect his interests, and was well aware that it was designed to satisfy the bank.  In an earlier witness statement used in connection with the summary judgment proceedings, Mr. Marino, Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitor, had explained that the original plan to have a sale directly to Mr. Abramovich was unattractive to Clydesdale because of problems of identifying the source of funds coming from Latvia;  but, unlike  Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence that Mr. Abramovich refused to engage in a direct transaction, and that was the reason for abandoning the direct sale, Mr. Marino said that the reason why there was no direct sale was because that would not have satisfied Clydesdale.  Mr. Berezovsky also accepted in evidence that he knew that it “… would be done in the same way like ORT, through Sheikh Sultan”.  He signed the Devonia Agreement on 5 June 2001, having been taken through it in detail by Ms. Minty with the assistance of Mr. Fomichev.  He was the beneficiary of the Itchen trust and the owner of Pennand Inc, to which the Devonia moneys were successively paid.  He knew that he was paying the Sheikh a large commission.  He specifically consented to $18.3 million in commissions being paid to Mr. Curtis out of the Devonia money.  He knew that commissions were also being taken by Dr. Jumean, Mr. Fomichev and Mr. Kay.  He also deliberately generated newspaper reports of his alleged “interest” in Sibneft, so that they could be provided to Clydesdale.  Mr. Curtis wrote to Mr. Fomichev and Mr. Kay on 1 June 2001 specifically asking them to pass on the letter to Messrs.  Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili.  The letter advised:  </p>

In this regard I have already explained to  Lee Hilton the verbal trust arrangement that exists between [Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Patarkatsishvili] and Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Abramovich’s reluctance to reflect this trustee arrangement in writing given representations that he has made in Russia.  Lee has been incredibly helpful in trying to find a way round this.  It is possible that we will require additional comfort in this matter and I know that Ruslan is endeavouring to provide back up documentary evidence in the form of newspaper articles”.  </p>

The evidence was that, by letter dated 25 August 2009 the Sheikh expressly authorised Mr. Jacobson to provide to Mr. Berezovsky copies of all documents owned by Devonia or the Sheikh concerning the alleged transaction, from the Curtis &amp; Co files, subject to the condition that Dr. Jumean should have first reviewed them.  Copies of the files were handed over and there was no evidence that Dr. Jumean had held any back.  If there had been any communications between Ms. Khudyk and Dr. Jumean, it must be assumed that Mr. Berezovsky would have disclosed them.  There was no document in such files that recorded exchanges or agreements between Devonia or the Sheikh and Mr. Abramovich’s representatives, whether relating to the alleged on-sale or otherwise in connection with the Devonia transaction, save those limited communications with Ms. Khudyk to which I have already referred.  The parties jointly wrote to the Sheikh on 21 April 2011 and 2 August 2011 requesting disclosure of documents which might exist to evidence an on-sale.  They received no response, either from him or from Dr. Jumean.</p>

Given the extraordinary features about the whole transaction which I have described, the evidential burden clearly lay on Mr. Berezovsky to establish that the transaction was a genuine one.  In Mr. Berezovsky’s written closing, reliance was placed on the fact that the parties allegedly used complex written instructions to achieve payment, following a simple oral agreement.  But that took the matter no further at all in terms of establishing that Mr. Abramovich was party to an alleged on-sale.  The closing submissions also relied upon what was said to be “more reliable” than Ms. Khudyk’s evidence, namely “the evidence of the Sheikh…..  that there had indeed been commercial arrangements concluded to sell on the relevant interest.” Reference was made to six letters written to or by the Sheikh or Dr. Jumean.

Thus the assurance given to Clydesdale that the Sheikh would be secured by a prior deposit by Mr. Abramovich under the corresponding transaction with him, was not correct on any basis.  The Sheikh purported to bind himself to at least the first tranche payment at a time when, by his own admission, there was no corresponding arrangement with Mr. Abramovich.</p>

Three were prepared at the time of the discussions with Clydesdale, with a view to addressing the Bank’s money laundering enquiries.  The fourth was written in February 2002, and was designed to create a document trail, at a time when it had become clear that there was no relation between the terms of the Devonia Agreement and its performance;  a topic which I address below.</p>

The first payment by Devonia to the Itchen and Test Trust accounts at Clydesdale was a payment of $200 million made on 12 June 2001, i.e. twice the initial payment of $100 million which the Devonia Agreement required to be paid on completion.  Seven payments (including the first one), amounting to $500 million in total, had been paid to the Itchen and Test Trust accounts at Clydesdale by 28 August 2001.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili appear to have signed all the necessary certificates of transfer in one go on 5 June 2001 at about the same time as they executed the agreement.  Mr. Jacobson’s evidence was that no evidence reached Curtis &amp; Co of the exercise of any of the options.  Instead, the practice was that after each payment, a corresponding certificate would be issued.  Even this appears to have happened much later.  No certificates of transfer were supplied to Devonia until October 2002 at the earliest, when the Sheikh’s private office called for their delivery well after most of the money had been paid.  It seems that they had not been provided by 27 March 2003, for by his letter of that date, Mr. Fomichev stated that “upon” receipt of the transfer certificates he would “pass all of the said certificates to either Mr. Abramovich or a company or nominee pursuant to his direction”.</p>

He told them that all parties had agreed to vary the Devonia Agreement to provide for payment in multiples of $20 million, which was closer to the rhythm of the actual payments.  There was no evidence that they had agreed any such thing, and no such agreement was ever formalised.  Mr. Jacobson was unable to remember any such agreement and Mr. Berezovsky was unable to assist in any meaningful way in his evidence about this alleged agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After August 2001, the schedule of payments was disrupted by the refusal of Clydesdale to accept further transfers from September 2001 to August 2002.  Eighteen payments were made at irregular intervals thereafter by Devonia into other accounts connected with Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, namely those of Pennand Inc and Tiberius Ltd., companies that were used as conduits by Valmet/MTM in order to transfer funds on to other trusts of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, respectively the Hotspur and Octopus settlements.  But the payments to Pennand and Tiberius bore no relation to the $100 million tranches provided for by the Devonia Agreement.  In February 2002, Mr. Curtis discovered from the administrators of Pennand and Tiberius that payments had been made at times other than those envisaged in the agreement and to accounts other than those provided for.  The administrators of these companies were concerned because the Devonia Agreement no longer served as an explanation of the payments which they could rely upon as compliance with the money-laundering regulations.  Mr. Curtis proposed to rectify the anomaly by preparing an amendment to the Devonia Agreement, retrospectively modifying the parties’ obligations so as to accord with what had actually happened.  An Amending Agreement was ultimately executed on 25 December 2002.  It was clear that its purpose was to create a document trail to satisfy the bank as to the sums of moneys which were actually being received.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, although the Sheikh had expressly assured Clydesdale that he would be making payments from his own funds, which would not be intermingled with any funds received from Mr. Abramovich, the timing of the payments indicated the contrary and that no separate funds of the Sheikh’s were in fact utilised.  As I have already described, the route used to transfer the funds, indicated that all that was happening was that the funds emanating from Mr. Abramovich’s company, Pex, simply washed through two of Devonia’s bank accounts before being paid to Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s trusts.  Thus, the payments from Pex were made following Mr. Fomichev’s direction to Devonia’s account with LTB.  LTB had a standing instruction automatically to transfer the full balance on that account at the end of each day to an account of Devonia’s, No 0244849577, with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.  The payments to the Itchen and Test trust accounts with Clydesdale were made from a Devonia account with the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank;  one can infer that the payments were made from the same account since the documents identify no other.  The payments subsequently made by Devonia to Pennand and Tiberius, and to the Rainbow Fund, ostensibly pursuant to the Devonia transaction, were sourced from the same Abu Dhabi account.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly I find that the Devonia Agreement was not a genuine agreement.  It was a sham agreement, entered into for the purposes of generating documentation that would give a false impression that a genuine commercial transaction had been entered into, so as to satisfy the money-laundering requirements of Clydesdale, and so as to enable Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to receive the $1.3 billion in a “legalised” fashion in the UK.  Second, Mr. Abramovich was not involved in, or party to, the Devonia Agreement and knew nothing about its terms.  Such limited involvement as there was, at a low level, by members of his accounting staff in what might loosely be referred to as the Devonia Agreement transaction was directed at, and limited to, the mechanics for the payment by Abramovich controlled companies of the $1.3 billion to Devonia’s account with LTB in Latvia - which had been agreed as between the Abramovich side and the Berezovsky side would be the account to which the funds would be remitted.  Third, contrary to the terms of the Devonia Agreement, there was never any genuine intention that Devonia would “transfer the beneficial interests in the Shares being [purportedly] purchased” under the agreement to Mr. Abramovich or companies or entities controlled by, or associated with, him.  Fourth, Devonia never did transfer such interests to Mr. Abramovich or any companies associated with him.  Fifth, because it was a sham transaction, neither the recitals, nor the other terms, of the Devonia Agreement, supported Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements or in relation to the Sibneft intimidation issue.  Sixth, on the contrary, the evidence relating to the issue, and the fact that he chose to assert that the Devonia Agreement was a genuine agreement, did not reflect well on Mr. Berezovsky’s credibility.</p>

One could have regarded it simply as a dubious and expensive mechanism for routing the $1.3 billion to Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s UK bank accounts.  But it was Mr. Berezovsky’s attempts to suggest that the Devonia Agreement was genuine, reflecting an actual sale to the Sheikh and an actual on-sale to Mr. Abramovich, and to implicate Mr. Abramovich in the transaction, that has had such serious implications for the rest of Mr. Berezovsky’s case.</p>

However, by the time of his closing submissions, his primary case was that the applicable law, pursuant to section 11(2)(c) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”), was France, as being “… the country in which the most significant element or elements of the events [constituting the tort] occurred”.

In the alternative Mr. Abramovich submitted that, even if English or French law were held to be the proper law of the tort on the basis of the “general rule” contained in section 11(2)(c) of the 1995 Act, Russian law would still apply by virtue of the “rule of displacement” contained in section 12 of the Act, because it was substantially more appropriate for the applicable law determining the relevant issues to be Russian law.  </p>

With some reluctance therefore, as the issue raises interesting, and undecided, points of law, I decline to engage with it, as necessarily it can have no impact on the outcome of my decision.  But my provisional view is that Russian law would have been the applicable law governing the alleged tort or delict of intimidation, either by virtue of the application of section 11 or section 12 of the 1995 Act.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, the evidence relating to RusAl had a wider resonance than simply a determination of the RusAl issues.  That was because it was necessary to look at the business relationship between Mr. Abramovich, on the one hand, and Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili on the other, as one continuum.  It was common ground that it was legitimate to look at the subsequent conduct of the parties for the purposes of determining whether the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements had been concluded, whether in the terms alleged by Mr. Berezovsky, or at all.  For that reason, I have taken into account the evidence relating to the RusAl issues and, in particular, the conduct of the respective parties before, at the time of, and after the RusAl merger, and Mr. Abramovich’s payment of $585 million to Mr. Patarkatsishvili, in coming to the logically prior conclusion as to whether the relationship between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky was the contractual relationship alleged by Mr. Berezovsky or the <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> relationship alleged by Mr. Abramovich.</p>

Mr. Berezovsky did not have, or acquire, any interest in any pre-merger aluminium assets prior to the meeting at the Dorchester Hotel in March 2000, as a result of any agreement with Mr. Abramovich.  I make no determination in relation to any claim by Mr. Berezovsky that he acquired such an interest as a result of the alleged joint venture agreement asserted by him in the main Chancery action which is not for determination in these proceedings.  There was no agreement that any interest in the pre-merger aluminium assets should be paid for out of Mr. Berezovsky’s entitlement to Sibneft or Sibneft related profits, and no contribution was in fact made by Mr. Berezovsky to the cost of the acquisition.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s evidence that he alone purchased the aluminium assets (through companies owned or controlled by him) pursuant to the terms of an agreement purportedly dated 10 February 2000 (“the Master Agreement”) and specifically pursuant to ten individual sale and purchase contracts also purportedly dated 10 February 2000.  I conclude that the other two individuals named in the Master Agreement as purchasers, namely Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Shvidler, assisted him to close the transaction but did not thereby acquire any interest in such assets.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s case that Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s role in the transaction was as intermediary and facilitator, and for those services Mr. Abramovich agreed to pay him a fee, not only for his services as an intermediary, but also for providing <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> in a difficult environment, where his association with the purchase of the aluminium assets was essential.

As I have already described, that formulation was modified in Mr. Berezovsky’s fourth witness statement, in which he asserted for the first time that the agreement in 1995 was merely that each of them would have a right of first refusal in relation to the others’ future business ventures.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground between the experts on Russian law that the alleged term of the 1995 Agreement relating to future business (even if construed as a right of first refusal) lacked the certainty in definition which such an obligation would require, in order to be effective in Russian law.  But even leaving that point to one side (on the basis that, as Mr. Rabinowitz suggested, the parties might have acted on an agreement they had supposed to be legally effective, despite the fact that it actually was not) the evidence which I have already analysed above demonstrated that there was no such agreement in 1995 in relation to future business as alleged.  In summary, it was wholly implausible that Mr. Berezovsky would have agreed in 1995 that Mr. Abramovich, who at that time Mr. Berezovsky hardly knew and whose track record in his business hardly rated, was going to have a right of first refusal in relation to 50% of any future business venture of Mr. Berezovsky’s, even if that venture was entirely conceived and managed by someone else, for example, Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  I conclude that there is nothing in the evidence relating to the RusAl issues, which I summarise below, which provides me with any reason to change my view in this respect.</p>

It appears that this argument first surfaced as a result of the view taken by Dr. Rachkov, Mr. Berezovsky’s Russian law expert, that it was implicit in paragraphs 250-263 of Mr. Berezovsky’s fourth witness statement that such an agreement had been made.

As I have set out above, by this point I had already come under attack from Prime Minister Primakov, there had been raids on my businesses and I had been indicted on baseless charges (which were later dropped) relating to what was alleged to be an unlawful business activity in connection with Aeroflot.  For this reason, we agreed at Mr. Abramovich’s request that Badri’s and my interest in the aluminium assets subsequently acquired on behalf of the three of us would not be made visible and would instead be held by Mr. Abramovich through offshore corporate vehicles.</p>

ORT was the priority for me at the time, particularly in view of the forthcoming Presidential elections in Russia in 2000.

Although I was not a signatory to the agreement, I consider that I acquired interests under it as a result of the agreements with Badri and with Mr. Abramovich that I have discussed above.  Another formal reason for not signing this personally was that I was a member of the Duma at this time, and I was aware that under Russian law I was not allowed to be directly involved in business and could not put my signature on this agreement.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, notwithstanding the court’s approach, Mr. Berezovsky’s own direct evidence, both in his written evidence, and in cross-examination, was extremely weak when it came to attempting to establish the existence of a new oral agreement in 1999 whereby he, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Abramovich agreed that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were to have a 50% interest in the relevant aluminium assets.  The evidence in Mr. Berezovsky’s fourth witness statement, quoted above, hardly supported such an agreement.  It did not refer to any new agreement with Mr. Abramovich.  The only express reference to the alleged 1995 Agreement was in paragraph 256, which itself only alleged that, when Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili approached Mr. Abramovich with Mr. Bosov’s proposal, they thought that they were obliged to do so under the term of the alleged 1995 Agreement relating to future business.  Mr. Berezovsky did not say in those paragraphs that the 1995 agreement was ever mentioned to Mr. Abramovich, in connection with the proposal;  nor did he say that any new agreement was made by reference to what was supposed to have been agreed in 1995;  nor did he suggest that, irrespective of any reference to the alleged 1995 Agreement, the three men agreed that the new aluminium interests would be held as to 50% by Mr. Abramovich and as to 50% by Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky.  </p>

However that paragraph, apart from the statement that “We agreed that the purchase price of the aluminium assets would be paid for from our entitlement of Sibneft profits” did not deal with any new agreement with Mr. Abramovich;  the reference to the interests in the aluminium assets being subject to a 50:50 split between Mr. Abramovich on the one hand, and Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky on the other, “in accordance with the agreement made regarding future business interests and in accordance with the use of Sibneft profits to acquire the assets [i.e. the alleged 1995 Agreement]”, again did not refer to any new agreement, or suggest that Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili had mentioned the alleged 1995 agreement, or its terms, when negotiating with Mr. Abramovich in 1999 or had expressly agreed, even without any reference to any earlier agreement, that their respective interests in the relevant aluminium assets were to be held 50:50.  Moreover I reject the suggestion that Mr. Berezovsky was not cross-examined on paragraph 260 of his fourth witness statement.  Although the specific paragraph was not put to him expressly, he was challenged on his evidence in relation to the alleged 1999 Agreement, at Day 9, pages 6-12, and was given every opportunity to explain what he said had been agreed with Mr. Abramovich.  All he in fact claimed in cross-examination was that Mr. Bosov had proposed to him that Mr. Berezovsky should acquire assets in the aluminium sector, which Mr. Bosov did not actually identify at the time, but which turned out later to be the four businesses constituting the pre-merger aluminium assets<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="474">

In Mr. Berezovsky’s version, initially I had said that I would have to discuss the proposal with Mr. Shvidler.  In the end, I allegedly agreed to the proposal, provided however that Mr. Berezovsky would not be mentioned as an interested party.  Then we allegedly agreed that the acquisition of the aluminium assets would be carried out through offshore entities pursuant to Western law and we also agreed that the purchase price was to be paid from the proceeds of Sibneft (Berezovsky 4, paragraphs 256-262).  None of this is true.  Мr. Berezovsky had nothing to do with the deal for acquisition of aluminium assets and so all of the matters we allegedly discussed are а fiction.  I do not recall any such discussions about or with Mr. Bosov before the negotiations on acquiring the aluminium assets at the beginning of 2000.  So far as my role was concerned, the introduction to buy the assets came only from Mr. Patarkatsishvili.

As I already stated, Mr. Berezovsky had no involvement in the management of the aluminium assets and for this reason he simply could not have expressed аny such wishes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from his own direct evidence of the alleged 1999 Agreement, Mr. Berezovsky relied upon a number of evidential matters to support his case that he had acquired an interest in the pre-merger aluminium assets pursuant to the alleged 1999 Agreement and consistently with what he alleged had been agreed in 1995 and 1996.  Basically his thesis was that the evidence demonstrated the critical role which he had played in the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets and in putting the deal together.  This, he contended, not merely supported his account of the alleged 1999 Agreement, but more than amply justified his claimed entitlement thereunder.  First of all he sought to suggest that he was the recipient of the initial proposal from Mr. Bosov in late 1999 and that this proposal had originated as a result of the key contacts which he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had cultivated in the aluminium industry in 1998-1999.  In particular, he suggested that his close links with General Lebed had been critical to the successful acquisition of the Krasnoyarsk assets.  Second, he sought to suggest that it was not only Mr. Patarkatsishvili, but he, Mr. Berezovsky, as well, who was involved in bringing Mr. Bosov’s proposal to Mr. Abramovich and persuading Mr. Abramovich to proceed with the transaction.  Third, Mr. Berezovsky claimed that he had been “the key person who had made this deal happen” and suggested that he had had many meetings with the sellers, in particular Mr. Lev Cherney, Mr. Reuben and Mr. Anisimov, at which key aspects of the acquisition had been discussed.  Fourth, Mr. Berezovsky suggested that the terms of the Master Agreement showed that he was, although not expressly identified as a purchaser under the Master Agreement, in fact such a purchaser.  Fifth, he said that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili also agreed to Mr. Abramovich’s request that their interests in the aluminium assets subsequently acquired would not be made visible and would instead be held by Mr. Abramovich, because of the danger of politically motivated attacks.  Sixth, he relied upon what he said were the views of the sellers and purchasers under the Master Agreement which he said demonstrated that they thought he was indeed a purchaser of the pre-merger aluminium assets.  Seventh, he relied upon certain press reports to support his assertion that he was, and that everybody thought he was, a purchaser, of the assets.  Eighth, he relied upon comments made by Mr. Patarkatsishvili prior to his death which he said “consistently acknowledged to third parties that both himself and Mr. Berezovsky had acquired an interest in the aluminium assets in February 2000”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="477">

Mr. Anisimov (who was one of the sellers of the KrAZ aluminium assets) gave a vivid description in his oral evidence as to what he referred to as “the aluminium wars”, during which “unbridled criminality reigned from 1994 to 1997”.  He described how these difficult conditions meant that those involved in the aluminium business were subject to threats to their personal safety and how there was routine and unwarranted interference with their commercial interests by various regional authorities.  Mr. Anisimov gave two examples of the problems which he and his staff at plants in the Krasnoyarsk region faced at the time.  The first example he gave was the threats experienced by his staff, who were, on one occasion, met at the airport by a criminal gang and driven to a cemetery;  there the staff were shown graves and told that, if they continued working in Krasnoyarsk, the same fate would await them.  The second example related to the involvement of law enforcement agencies, who raided the plants and intercepted supplies of raw materials.  Mr. Anisimov referred to the fact that 70 people had been murdered in Krasnoyarsk and how no one trusted anyone else at the time.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="478">

Thereafter, however (and even though Mr. Anisimov understood that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was trying to assist him), the situation did not improve.  By the end of 1999 the aluminium plant at Krasnoyarsk was in a desperate situation, and coupled with concerns about his personal safety, and that of his employees, Mr. Anisimov was effectively forced out of business and decided to sell his share of the aluminium assets as quickly as possible.</p>

Notwithstanding that I could see the potential for bringing the businesses together, I still was not keen to get involved in the industry, given its violent and unstable history.  Criminal groups were fighting fierce battles for control of the profits generated by the aluminium industry and dozens of business men (most famously, Mr. Vadis Yafyasov, Mr. Oleg Kantor and Mr. Felix Lvov) had been killed in this struggle for control.  Whilst the level of violence in the industry had diminished somewhat by the late 1990s, it was still a potentially </span>

For example the workers at the Krasnoyarsk plant had not <span style="font-family:Arial">been </span>paid for some time and the plant could easily have come to a permanent halt.  There were many risks <span style="font-family:Arial">and </span>uncertainties at this stage.

I do not need to make findings about these matters, but Mr. Deripaska’s dislike of both Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, and Mr. Abramovich’s appreciation of that dislike, becomes relevant at the time of the Dorchester Hotel meeting.</p>

His statement was served in order to deal with a specific disclosure issue raised by Mr. Berezovsky which, as matters transpired, did not arise for consideration at trial.  In paragraph 8 of that statement, Mr. Bosov said that, at a meeting with Mr. Abramovich in March 2011, he told Mr. Abramovich that he was going to file a claim against Mr. Berezovsky in relation to the commission due to him, as a result of an agreement which he had reached with Mr. Patarkatsishvili in respect of his (Mr. Bosov’s) involvement in the negotiations for the sale of TWG’s, Mr. Anisimov’s and other shareholders’ KrAZ and Bratsk aluminium assets.  Mr. Berezovsky contended that the fact that Mr. Bosov claimed to be entitled to the payment of the commission from Mr. Berezovsky showed that Mr. Bosov at least understood Mr. Berezovsky to be involved as a principal in the aluminium acquisition deal.  </p>

The reference in paragraph 13 of Mr. Bosov’s statement to a meeting with Mr. Berezovsky in April 2011, where Mr. Bosov apparently reminded Mr. Berezovsky that the promise that he would receive money for his role in setting up the aluminium deal had been confirmed at a meeting at Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s office, likewise took the matter no further.  Thus the statement did not suggest that Mr. Bosov’s agreement was with Mr. Berezovsky;  the most that it suggested was that Mr. Bosov may have thought that Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky were partners in the venture.</p>

It resembled an organised crime racket, with in-fighting and interventions by local officials.  The management of the aluminium assets was concentrated locally which meant that the managers in the plants and factories had control of cash but were in turn vulnerable to having that cash taken from them by force.  The conditions were favourable for gangster style crime to flourish.  It is reported that the so-called “Aluminium Wars” of the late 1990s claimed over 100 lives.  This might sound like journalist exaggeration but there genuinely was a lot of danger associated with this industry.  The amounts of money involved were substantial.  Eventually the killing spread to the streets of Moscow and therefore became a matter of greater public awareness.  </p>

I then heard from Mr. Abramovich that Mr. Cherney had also approached Mr. Patarkatsishvili wanting to make some kind of a deal with respect to several aluminium entities located in Russia because of a squeeze by other competitors in the market.  The plants Mr. Cherney had an interest in were being starved of raw materials.  There was a particular problem at Krasnoyarsk in the latter part of 1999;  the company was on the verge of bankruptcy and about to stop production.  I believe that Mr. Vasiliy Anisimov also approached Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  It seemed that they all felt that they were in danger of losing their assets altogether and wanted someone to buy them first, while they still had something of value to sell.</p>

We thought that, as we had directly experienced in the oil industry, there was scope in the aluminium industry for vertical integration in order to achieve greater efficiency and thereby extract the full value from the enterprises.

Although both Mr. Anisimov and Mr. Buzuk confirmed in cross-examination that they did not attend all meetings, and, in particular that they were not present at the meetings relating to the negotiations for the sale of the Bratsk assets, there was no evidence (apart from Mr. Berezovsky’s vague assertions that he had had meetings with the sellers) to show that Mr. Berezovsky had attended any meetings with the sellers of the Bratsk assets, such as Mr. Lev Chernoy.  Mr. Streshinsky, who also worked for Mr. Anisimov and acted on his behalf in the negotiations, likewise said that, so far as he was aware, neither Mr. Berezovsky, nor any person claiming to represent Mr. Berezovsky, was involved in the purchase of the KrAZ assets.  It was suggested on Mr. Berezovsky’s behalf that several of these witnesses had a motive for concealing his true involvement in the deal.  However, irrespective of the position of Mr. Abramovich, his staff and Mr. Anisimov, it is difficult to see why Mr. Streshinksy or Mr. Buzuk would have had the slightest interest in telling lies on the point;  Mr. Buzuk ceased to be employed by Mr. Anisimov’s companies in 2002;  Mr. Streshinsky stopped working for Mr. Anisimov in 2009 and ceased to be a director of any of his companies earlier this year.</p>

As was pointed out in Mr. Berezovsky’s written closing submissions, Mr. David Reuben is a billionaire in his own right and had no obvious axe to grind against any participant in the present litigation.  Mr. Reuben explained that it was the other sellers (Mr. Lev Cherney, Mr. Bosov and Mr. Anisimov), and not he, who had carried out the principal discussions and negotiations with Mr. Patarkatsishvili in relation to the sale of the pre-merger aluminium assets;  Mr. Reuben had been in discussions with another group of potential purchasers.  However he had met Mr. Patarkatsishvili on a flight to Moscow, a few months before the Master Agreement was concluded;  Mr. Anisimov was also on the flight and he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were discussing the proposed sale.  From time to time Mr. Patarkatsishvili would translate for Mr. Reuben.  In the course of this conversation, Mr. Reuben asked whether Mr. Deripaska was behind Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the transaction;  Mr. Patarkatsishvili  denied  this suggestion, and said effectively that he was going to do the deal with Mr. Abramovich, and, if Mr. Abramovich was not involved, “they” were  not going to do the deal at all.  When specifically asked the question by Mr. Gillis QC, counsel on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky, whether, in his conversations with Mr. Patarkatsishvili about who the purchasers were,  any mention had been made of Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Reuben replied “no, just -- and even if it is, I can’t remember.”  Mr. Reuben made no mention in his evidence of any meetings with Mr. Berezovsky prior to the signing of the Master Agreement, at which the proposed sale of the aluminium assets was referred to or discussed.  Mr. Reuben had apparently met Mr. Berezovsky before the contract was concluded, but he did not suggest that this had been in connection with the transaction.  He had met Mr. Berezovsky once, on a subsequent occasion, after the deal had been concluded, and Mr. Berezovsky had been quoted in the press as involved in the deal.  Mr. Reuben congratulated Mr. Berezovsky on “a good buy”.  But Mr. Reuben could not recall whether the meeting had been in London or in Moscow, saying:</p>

He was unable to recall what was discussed at the meetings which he claimed to have had with Mr. Anisimov or Mr. Reuben or any one else, and, as he accepted, was not involved in the negotiation of the documents.  He had no idea what company or entity had owned the KraZ assets.  He only the vaguest idea of the terms of the deal and could not remember key details, such as the price paid for the assets.

The transfer itself was effected by the underlying share purchase agreements between the selling and purchasing companies.

Mr. Shvidler rejected that suggestion and explained that his name was there because he was a “representative” of the side that purchased the assets and had been the principal negotiator of the deal, and that Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Shvidler all “represented the purchasing side”.

The Commission Agreements were backdated and thus purported to speak prospectively about a transaction, namely the acquisition, which had in fact already happened at the time the documents were drafted - a point that had always been accepted on behalf of Mr. Abramovich.  They also contained provisions, such as clause 5<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="492">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>This purported to provide “The Buyer [ie Galinton/Palmtex/Dilcor/Runciom Fort] and the Intermediary have agreed that, in case the share sellers propose worse terms and conditions than those indicated in paragraph 4.2, the Intermediary shall be obliged to indemnify the Buyer for any negative differential out of its own funds”.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, which were clearly fictitious in the sense that, at the time the agreement was drawn up, the final share price had been fixed and the Intermediary was therefore never at any risk of having to make an indemnifying payment.  Mr. Abramovich explained that, after the Master Agreement had been signed, probably on 15 February, 2000, Mr. Patarkatsishvili had made it clear that he wanted formally to document his entitlement to a fee;  he and Mr. Abramovich had a meeting in the latter’s office at which they agreed the figure;  and Mr. Abramovich called Ms. Panchenko in and asked her to draft and process the relevant documents.  The Commission Agreements were then prepared by Ms. Panchenko, who satisfactorily explained how she had been able to reconstruct the date on which she had prepared them - 15 February  2000.  She also explained that there was a need, so as to “justify a bank transfer on that commission agreement” for the Commission Agreements to demonstrate what was a genuine commercial transaction, which is why she and her subordinate, Ms. Khudyk, drafted the agreements in a way which they did, so as to achieve the objective that Mr. Patarkatsishvili could indeed be paid, into a Western bank account, the commission which was due to him.  However, the fact that the Commission Agreements contained certain bogus provisions to convey to a bank that they genuinely reflected commercial transactions, did not mean that they did not do so, even if they were backdated.  In my judgment, on a full analysis of the evidence, the Commission  Agreements accurately recorded the nature of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s role as an intermediary and the bogus features did not establish, as Mr. Berezovsky suggested that they did, that the Commission Agreements were mis-stating the position when they provided that Mr. Patarkatsishvili (or his service companies) were entitled to be paid $115 million by way of commission in respect of his services in connection with the acquisition.</p>

Mr. Abramovich’s evidence was that he believed that Mr. Patarkatsishvili may have had the protocols notarised shortly after the meeting at the Dorchester Hotel on 13 March 2000, because Mr. Patarkatsishvili distrusted Mr. Deripaska and was concerned that, as and when Mr. Deripaska became a co-controller of the Offshore Companies, as a result of the proposed RusAl merger, Mr. Abramovich might be squeezed out.  It was clear from Mr. Deripaska’s own evidence and that of Mr. Abramovich that there was no love lost as between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Mr. Deripaska had, apparently, taken a dim view of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s conduct in the so-called aluminium wars, because of the latter’s support of the TWG group.  It is also likely that Mr. Patarkatsishvili would have wanted to ensure that, if payment of his commission was indeed going to be deferred, as he had agreed with Mr. Abramovich, there was nonetheless an unimpeachable record of what had been agreed under the terms of the Commission Agreements, so that, if, and when, he returned to Mr. Abramovich to renegotiate the $115 million, there was no question but that Mr. Patarkatsishvili would receive that minimum sum.  But if Mr. Patarkatsishvili in such circumstances had genuinely believed that he, or he and Mr. Berezovsky, were contractually entitled to a 50% share in the pre-merger aluminium assets, or, more to the point, a 50% participation interest in the shares of the Offshore Companies, which by then had acquired the assets, it appears highly unlikely that he would have taken steps formally to notarise a document which did not correctly record his actual (and, by 16 March 2000, because of the merger with Mr. Deripaska’s interests, potentially far more valuable) share participation entitlement, but which, on the contrary, incorrectly recorded a capped fee entitlement.  Moreover, Mr. Patarkatsishvili was on good terms with Mr. Abramovich at the time, and it is likewise difficult to see why, if indeed Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a share participation entitlement, he would have not asked Mr. Abramovich for some document recording that interest, however informal such a document had to be.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Berezovsky’s explanation for the Commission Agreements, as it emerged during the course of the trial, was to suggest that they were shams, produced for the purposes of being shown to a Western bank, Kathrein &amp; Co, so that Mr. Patarkatsishvili could open an account into which Mr. Abramovich would be making payments for the acquisition of an aircraft which, at the Dorchester Hotel meeting in March 2000, Mr. Abramovich had agreed that Mr. Patarkatsishvili should receive by way of commission;  therefore, it was said, the Commission Agreements could not be prayed in aid by Mr. Abramovich to support the role played by Mr. Patarkatsishvili in connection with the position of the pre-merger aluminium assets as merely an intermediary, as opposed to someone, who together with Mr. Berezovsky, had a 50% participation interest in the shares in the Offshore Companies.  Thus Mr. Rabinowitz suggested to Mr. Abramovich in cross-examination that the Commission Agreements were produced:</p>

	      </authorialNote> of the evidence in an attempt to support his contention, which I have fully considered, although I do not rehearse it here.  The documents that have survived in relation to the aircraft purchase show that Mr. Abramovich contributed $25 million to the cost of the purchase of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s plane, which was eventually bought in June/July 2000 for $23.5 million and also contributed substantial sums to the cost of its maintenance and operating costs.   As Mr. Abramovich explained “$115 million could buy you four planes, I think”.  He also explained that the deal in relation to the aeroplane was in addition to the commission which he had agreed to pay Mr. Patarkatsishvili of $115 million.   Having reviewed the evidence relied upon by Mr. Berezovsky, I reject his assertion that the Commission Agreements did not accurately reflect Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s entitlement to commission in respect of his services in connection with the  pre-merger aluminium assets.  The evidence upon which he relied to support the suggestion that the Commission Agreements were drawn up “simply in order to allow Mr. Patarkatsishvili to open an Austrian bank account with Kathrein &amp; Co and to receive money then used to purchase, fit out and maintain his aeroplane” and that, accordingly, the Commission Agreements were shams, was tenuous in the extreme.  As Mr. Adkin, counsel for the Family defendants, realistically pointed out in the Family defendants’ written closing submissions, if, as Mr. Berezovsky suggested, Mr. Patarkatsishvili required some form of documented basis for receiving money into the West, the simplest solution would have been to document his alleged interest in the aluminium business, which Mr. Berezovsky said Mr. Patarkatsishvili acquired;  that could have been easily achieved, for example, by granting and documenting a participation interest, whether directly or under a trust, in 50% of the shares in the four Offshore Companies.  No reason was put forward as to why such a simple course was not adopted, if indeed Mr. Berezovsky’s case were correct;  even if “visibility” had been a concern, which I doubt, offshore structures could easily have concealed Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s and Mr. Berezovsky’s interest in shares in the Offshore Companies.</p>

There was no evidence to support such a conclusion.  Again, I make it clear that I am not deciding whether Mr. Berezovsky had a bilateral partnership agreement with Mr. Patarkatsishvili that would have justified such a claim, had I found that Mr. Patarkatsishvili indeed acquired an ownership interest in the Bratsk and KrAZ assets pursuant to the Master Agreement.

His claim as formulated in Answer 27, quoted above, was inherently circular and vague.

For example, it was not suggested to either of them that Mr. Abramovich had told them, or that there was any other basis upon which they should have known, that Mr. Berezovsky had some sort of beneficial interest in the shares in the Offshore Companies.  Mr. Abramovich was cross-examined on the basis that the Offshore Companies (for example, Palmtex) were his companies, but it was not suggested to him either that he had ever told Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili that he, or anyone else, was holding 50% of shares in the Offshore Companies for their benefit, or that he had any obligation to do so.  Mr. Tenenbaum gave evidence that the shares in the Offshore Companies were bearer shares, and, although he was cross-examined about the terms of the subsequent Share Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 15 March 2000, and the Amended and Restated Share Purchase and Sale Agreement of 15 May 2000, it was not suggested to him that any of those bearer shares were held, or should have been held, by, or on trust for, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili or that he knew that they were, or should have been, so held.

Thus the claim by Mr. Berezovsky to be the beneficial owner of the shares in the Offshore Companies, apart from being inconsistent with his pleaded case at paragraphs C59 - C59B (in which he claimed that “… the aluminium assets [were] beneficially owned by Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Abramovich”), provided him with no additional route to becoming a party to the Master Agreement.

The principal reason proffered by Mr. Berezovsky as to why his interest in the aluminium assets needed to be concealed, and why he was not to be named a <span style="color:#000000">party to the Master Agreement, was an asserted concern about the risk of politically motivated attacks on his assets having regard, in particular, to the problems he is said to have experienced with Prime Minister Primakov.  But, as Mr. Berezovsky accepted in evidence, by late 1999 his dispute with Mr. Primakov was long since over, Mr. Berezovsky had won that battle and was at the height of his powers.  Mr. Primakov had been dismissed from his office as Prime Minister in May 1999.  Mr. Berezovsky also suggested he did not sign the Master Agreement because </span>he was a member of the Duma.  No evidence was adduced to suggest that <span style="color:#000000">there was any legal difficulty in Mr. Berezovsky’s participating in the ownership of assets because of his elected position, as opposed to the management of assets, and the suggestion was contradicted by his own evidence elsewhere and by the fact that Mr. Abramovich (also a member of the Duma at the time) signed the Master Agreement.  But even if one were to accept Mr. Berezovsky’s explanations as to the reason why he was not expressly referred to in the Master Agreement, they simply do not shed any light on why no steps were taken to document his claimed ultimate ownership interest in a confidential agreement with Mr. Abramovich, or to structure the ownership of his interests through a confidential shareholding or other vehicle structure outside Russia.

As Mr. Abramovich accepted, the Russian press associated Mr. Berezovsky with Sibneft - something which, certainly before Mr. Berezovsky’s departure from Russia, Mr. Abramovich found useful.  But that association, as I have already explained, was also consistent with a relationship of <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span>.  And both Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Shvidler gave entirely credible explanations as to why, in the media at least, Sibneft deployed a deliberate policy of not referring to Mr. Abramovich as the sole ultimate beneficial owner of Sibneft, but rather presenting the profile of the Sibneft shareholding structure as being 40% controlled by “Sibneft management”.  The reality, as Mr. Shvidler, Mr. Tenenbaum and Ms. Panchenko described, was that there was a trust structure above the registered holders of the Sibneft shares which were controlled by management, and Mr. Abramovich, or Mr. Abramovich and his family, were the sole beneficiaries of those trusts and therefore effectively in control of 80% of Sibneft.  I found Mr. Abramovich’s and Mr. Shvidler’s explanation as to why, in the circumstances prevailing in Russia at the time, one would not wish to portray oneself as the sole owner of a majority interest in Sibneft, because of assassination or kidnap risks, entirely credible.  The practice of distancing oneself from controlling ownership was one which was supported by Mr. Anisimov in his evidence.</p>

But the weight which I attach to this evidence is not great.  The comments which the solicitors have noted are brief and vague and do not descend into detail.  As Mr. Sumption suggested, Mr. Patarkatsishvili may have wrongly believed by this date that he had acquired such an interest, or, in my view more likely, his statements may have been simply self-serving so as to assist Mr. Berezovsky in the prosecution of his case against Mr. Abramovich.  In the absence of cross-examination of Mr. Patarkatsishvili, I am not prepared to find that these statements outweigh the other evidence and, in particular, the documentary evidence.  Moreover, the notes appeared to suggest that the money used to acquire the pre-merger aluminium assets were Sibneft resources;  that was clearly incorrect and raised a fundamental question as to the reliability of what Mr. Patarkatsishvili was telling Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors.</p>

Mr. Shvidler, in his sixth witness statement, set out full details of the payments required and how they were financed;  in summary, $100 million was funded by a loan from MDM Bank, which contributed to the March and April instalments, and the balance was funded from Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies and, subsequently, from Mr. Deripaska’s equalisation payments.

In paragraph 260 of his fourth witness statement, he said that he had agreed with Mr. Abramovich (presumably in early 2000) that the purchase price of the pre-merger aluminium assets would be paid for from his and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s entitlement to Sibneft profits.

Moreover, … the contemporaneous contracts make it clear that this sum was due to be apportioned between the “<span style="font-style:italic">Other Selling Shareholders</span>” and the “<span style="font-style:italic">Other P1 Shareholders</span>”, rather than being payable solely to Mr. Abramovich which is what one would, on his case, have expected.”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="501">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I deal with those three arguments in turn.  First, Mr. Berezovsky’s assertion in his witness statement that he had agreed with Mr. Abramovich that the funding for the acquisition would come out of his and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s share of “Sibneft profits” was undermined in cross-examination<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="502">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>See in particular Day 9, pages 33-38.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  His repeated restatement of the alleged agreement was not convincing;  he had only the vaguest idea of what the cost of acquiring the Bratsk and KrAZ assets was;  and he had no idea as to the quantum of Sibneft profits to which he was, or was prospectively, entitled in that year.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the evidence relating to the available “Sibneft profits” did not support Mr. Berezovsky’s allegation that he had agreed with Mr. Abramovich that his and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s contribution would be funded from this source.  Sibneft’s own profits in 2000 could not possibly have supported such a burden;  they were ultimately shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements, signed off by Arthur Andersen ZAO on 30 April 2001, at a figure of $674.845 million, of which only $50.683 million was distributed by way of dividend.  Even approaching the matter on Mr. Berezovsky’s case that “Sibneft profits” should be widely defined as extending to any profits made by Mr. Abramovich’s Trading Companies as a result of the acquisition of Sibneft, his case was not made out.  Whilst it was true that the payments received by Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili from Mr. Abramovich’s companies during the course of 2000 totalled some $490.2 million, which would, theoretically, have been sufficient to have paid for  their alleged 50% share of the cost of acquiring the pre-merger aluminium assets, namely a figure of $287.5 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="503">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>It was not disputed that this would have been the correct figure for their alleged half share.  </p>
	      </authorialNote>, the evidence did not support the proposition that any part of the payments actually made to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were ever applied, or intended to be applied, in such a way or that they had otherwise contributed to the cost.  The year 2000 was the one year in which a comprehensive spreadsheet (the FOM spreadsheet) recording payments to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili survived.  This spreadsheet recorded no entry representing payment of their share of the cost of acquiring the pre-merger aluminium assets, or setting off their liability to contribute to the cost of such acquisition against payments that would have otherwise been due to them, or applying payments made to them for such purpose.   Moreover, on the footing of Mr. Berezovsky’s own case that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a 50% interest in the acquisitions, $87.5 million of their contribution to the cost would have been due almost immediately, in February and March 2000, and, so far as the February instalment was concerned, prior to the receipt of any funds from Mr. Deripaska.  There was no evidence to suggest that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had ever paid anything, or had asked, or been asked, to pay anything.  Nor (apart from Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence about the original agreement with Mr. Abramovich) was there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili had ever raised the question as to how or when their contribution to the acquisition costs had been, or was going to be, funded out of “Sibneft profits”;  or that that point had ever been the subject matter of discussion with Mr. Abramovich.  Nor was there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had been told that they need not worry about making any contribution because, in the event, the equalisation payment from Mr. Deripaska was going to fund the transaction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, the argument that one needed to look at who was entitled to the $575 million sum that was due to be paid by Mr. Deripaska, to ascertain who actually contributed to the financial cost of the aluminium acquisition did not logically advance the argument that the evidence supported Mr. Berezovsky’s case as to his agreement with Mr. Abramovich.

However, because Mr. Rabinowitz relied upon much of the evidence relating to Issue B2 as supporting Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to Issue B1, I have approached the evidence relating to this issue on a notionally freestanding basis, and have, during the course of my evaluation of it, considered whether such evidence indeed supported Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to Issue B1.  I have also considered such evidence in the wider spectrum as to whether any aspect of it could be relied upon to support Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to Sibneft and the alleged 1995 and 1996 Agreements.</p>

It did not reflect the evidence and also was inconsistent with Mr. Berezovsky’s own case and evidence that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss and finalise the terms of the merger as opposed to agreeing a deal that had already been concluded.  Furthermore, if, as Mr. Rabinowitz suggested, the true purpose of the Dorchester Hotel meeting was to obtain Mr. Berezovsky’s consent to the Preliminary Agreement, it was surprising that Mr. Berezovsky had no knowledge of the Preliminary Agreement and no recollection of it being produced at the Dorchester Hotel meeting, as he admitted in his evidence.

Mr. Sumption, on the other hand, whilst accepting that it had never been entirely clear what Mr. Berezovsky expected out of the meeting, suggested that:</p>

Thus whilst, perhaps, as Mr. Sumption suggested, Mr. Berezovsky wanted to figure as the great man involved in one of the important events of the Russian business world, and to highlight his own importance, he would also have seen the RusAl merger, and the profits it might generate, as an opportunity for increasing the quantum of his financial demands on Mr. Abramovich.  Mr. Berezovsky’s perception, and possibly also that of Mr. Patarkatsishvili, as I have already held, was that they considered themselves entitled, under their <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> relationship, to a “slice” of Mr. Abramovich’s “action”.  In those circumstances, I do not find it at all surprising that Mr. Berezovsky would have wished to have demonstrated his hold over Mr. Abramovich and required his presence at the meeting;  nor do I find it surprising that Mr. Abramovich felt it necessary to comply with the wishes of his protector.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In March 2000, Mr. Abramovich asked me to accompany him to London to meet Mr. Berezovsky.  I was keen to build a good relationship with Mr. Abramovich as my new business partner.  In addition, Mr. Berezovsky still owed me the abovementioned money and Mr. Shvidler assured me that the repayment of this long-standing debt would be resolved at the meeting.  As a favour to Mr. Abramovich and in the hope of recovering the money Mr. Berezovsky owed me, I agreed to travel to London to meet him.  The three or four hour plane journey was nothing out of the ordinary for me since I often had to travel long distances for business - the aluminium plants which I controlled were located in Eastern Siberia, over 3,000 kilometres from Moscow.  I recall thinking that the flight would be a good opportunity to get to know Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Shvidler better.  Whilst all the key terms of the combining of various of our businesses had already been agreed and documented in the Preliminary Agreement, there were a number of ongoing issues to discuss in relation to the new business.”</p>

Mr. Deripaska’s explanation that he also saw the meeting as an opportunity for him to confront Mr. Berezovsky about his unpaid and long overdue loan was also entirely credible.  It was clear from his oral evidence that he had been genuinely irritated by Mr. Berezovsky’s failure to repay the loan of $16 million which Mr. Deripaska had made to him.

Taken individually, in an evidential vacuum, some of the arguments might have had some force.  But against a background where Mr. Berezovsky was asserting that the meeting had been agreed in advance - an allegation which had no evidential foundation, and which, from a practical point of view, was highly unlikely<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="525">

	      </authorialNote> - and where he had had no other involvement whatsoever in the negotiations, I had little hesitation in preferring the evidence of Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Shvidler and Mr. Deripaska on this point.  In this context I should say that I have taken into account Mr. Rabinowitz’s argument that clause 4.2 of the Preliminary Agreement was consistent with, and explained the need for, the Dorchester Hotel meeting, and that “because of his warranty, Mr. Abramovich had to ensure that his partners really did consent to the merger with Mr. Deripaska”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="526">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>See for example paragraph 1175 of Mr. Berezovsky’s written closing submissions.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  The argument provided little assistance to me in deciding whose evidence to accept.  That clause was merely a warranty of Mr. Abramovich’s “partners’ concerted will to sign” what, in the event, was the 15 March SPSA.  There was no practical or legal requirement, under that clause, to wheel Mr. Deripaska in to meet Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili to demonstrate their consent.  Moreover, if, on Mr. Berezovsky’s hypothesis, Mr. Abramovich had needed to ensure that he had, in truth, obtained Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s consent or “will to sign” the 15 March SPSA, it was surprising, to say the least, that they were not provided, in advance, with a draft of the SPSA for their approval, and were not required to sign it.  Still more surprising is that Mr. Berezovsky was not provided with, and did not see a copy of, either the Preliminary Agreement or the 15 March SPSA until they were disclosed during the course of this litigation.</p>

Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Shvidler turned up about 1pm at the Dorchester Hotel and went to the sitting room in Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s suite.  Mr. Deripaska had not been warned to expect Mr. Patarkatsishvili and was clearly irritated by his presence.  There was an uncomfortable hour or so during which the four men hung around waiting for Mr. Berezovsky.  Mr. Berezovsky, who had been at the House of Lords all morning in connection with the <span style="font-style:italic">Forbes</span> litigation, finally turned up sometime after 2pm.

So far as the last provision was concerned, I find it was never raised or agreed at all, whether with Mr. Deripaska, or simply as between Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  If such a term had indeed been agreed with Mr. Deripaska, as Mr. Berezovsky alleged, it is inconceivable, given its critical importance, that it would not have found its way into the 15 March SPSA or the later 15 May Restated SPSA.  Apart from the high degree of commercial improbability that Mr. Deripaska would ever have agreed to such a term, given his dislike of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence in cross-examination on this aspect was particularly unconvincing.</p>

This assertion had appeared in his witness statement at paragraph 278.  He repeated it in cross-examination before being taken to the terms of the Preliminary Agreement and the 15 March SPSA which referred to a figure of only $400 million, when he attempted to backtrack.  However the figure of $575 million clearly could not have been agreed on that occasion.  As I have described above, the equalisation payment fixed in the Preliminary Agreement and referred to again in the 15 March SPSA was $400 million:  the $575 million figure was not introduced until the 15 May Restated SPSA, when the Bratsk assets and the Sayansky plant were introduced into the merger for the first time.  I infer that Mr. Berezovsky (or more probably someone on his behalf) had picked up this figure when looking at the 15 May Restated SPSA in the course of the litigation and Mr. Berezovsky had crafted his evidence accordingly.</p>

The suggestion that it had been discussed was put forward in argument as a reason why Mr. Berezovsky would have remembered the figure of $575 million;  it was also suggested that the reason why the provision was omitted from the 15 March SPSA was lack of time.  But there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the additional contribution of the Bratsk assets on Mr. Abramovich’s side, and of the Sayansky plant on Mr. Deripaska’s side had been agreed at the time of the 15 March SPSA, with a resultant increase in the equalisation payment to $575 million.  Nor did Mr. Berezovsky suggest in cross-examination that there had been any agreement at the Dorchester Hotel meeting about the value at which the Bratsk assets and the Sayansky plant would be contributed to the deal, with a consequent increase in equalisation payment.  </p>

But the discussion would have been superficial.  The rest of the talk was about the aluminium wars, the current state of Russian politics, the repayment of a debt which Mr. Berezovsky owed to Mr. Deripaska, but which had not been paid back for several years and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s request to be provided with an aircraft.  It was agreed that an aircraft would be purchased for Mr. Patarkatsishvili as part of his fee for the assistance which he had provided Mr. Abramovich in connection with the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets.  It was also agreed that Mr. Abramovich would discharge Mr. Berezovsky’s debt to Mr. Deripaska by means of a set-off against the sums owed by Mr. Deripaska to Mr. Abramovich under the terms of the Preliminary Agreement.

He further submitted that, if it had been the case that Mr. Abramovich really had had no partners, as the latter contended, then the obvious warranty for Mr. Abramovich to have given to address Mr. Deripaska’s concerns would have been a warranty that Mr. Abramovich had no partners and was acting solely on his own behalf.

The evidence showed that there were a number of underlying concerns which resulted in the use of the term “partners”:  first, there was a concern on the Deripaska side, that no part of TWG should be included in the deal;  second, not all of the aluminium assets which Mr. Abramovich was bringing to the merger were at that time within his control;  it was therefore necessary to provide that he had responsibility for ensuring that the third parties who controlled those assets did what was necessary to enable the merger to take place.</p>

The reference to partners in Clause 4.1 expressly excludes anyone from TWG.  This was significant.  At the beginning of the discussions, neither Mr. Deripaska nor I believed that Mr. Abramovich could have purchased the Aluminium Assets and that he had paid such a large sum.  The TWG shareholders had spent so long aggressively acquiring and building up the Aluminium Assets that we could not quite believe that they had relinquished them to Mr. Abramovich or that they were now out of the industry.  We suspected that Mr. Abramovich could be a nominal owner only and that we might find ourselves having to deal with our rivals again.  Mr. Abramovich convinced us, however, that he really had purchased the Aluminium Assets and that he intended to retain them.  I believe there was the same suspicion on the other side about TWG, so the parties included a mutual warranty by which each side expressly disclaimed that anyone from TWG was a partner.  Given the focus of the discussion about TWG, I do not recall any discussion about who, if anyone was a partner of each principal.  For my part I assumed that Mr. Shvidler was Mr. Abramovich’s partner.  I am certain that there was no discussion by telephone with, or mention of, either Mr. Patarkatsishvili or Mr. Berezovsky throughout the entire meeting.</p>

He said that the contract was written precisely to make sure that neither side needed other people’s warranties and referred to the fact that Mr. Deripaska had other partners in relation to various plants that Mr. Deripaska was contributing to the merger.  His evidence was that, by the time that the Preliminary Agreement was signed, at his home later the next day, he was so exhausted that he did not read the document and left it to Mr. Shvidler to read through.  In cross-examination, he said that he believed that it reflected Mr. Deripaska’s concern to ensure that TWG did not feature in the transaction as undisclosed parties.  He explained that some of the assets which he was contributing to the merger did not belong to him, but to others, and therefore it was necessary for there to be a provision that he was responsible that they would deliver;  in the eyes of Mr. Deripaska, such people were indeed Mr. Abramovich’s partners.  He explained that Mr. Deripaska’s concern about the silent involvement of TWG was underlined by the fact that Mr. Abramovich had not yet fully consolidated ownership of the assets which he was contributing to the merger.  The fact that Mr. Abramovich had agreed to sell aluminium assets, to which he yet had to obtain title, was borne out by the evidence.  </p>

He was cross-examined on the basis that the reference to “partners” included him, as well as Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili;  he denied such suggestion and explained that he was not a partner of Mr. Abramovich or his companies;  he said that he had understood the reference to partners was simply a reference to third parties (such as owners of other aluminium plants, which Mr. Abramovich had agreed to contribute to the merger) upon whose conduct the practical fulfilment of the merger was dependent.  The reference to the “partners” of the parties (i.e. Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska) was intended as an indication that the parties would take responsibility for ensuring that those stakeholders did what was necessary to ensure that the merger was effective.  Mr. Rabinowitz sought to make capital out of the fact that clause 4.2 envisaged such parties actually signing the agreement, and the sellers of the various aluminium plants would not be actually signing up to the merger agreement.  But I did not find that argument persuasive;  apart from the fact that the agreement was a hastily drawn one, the logic would demand that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili were intended to sign the agreement - something which was never suggested.</p>

In summary, these were:  first, to cater for the possibility that certain of the companies in which Mr. Deripaska was acquiring an interest were held by Abramovich entities other than Runicom;  second, because it was unclear whether Mr. Abramovich’s companies had completed the acquisition of all of the shares in the underlying companies which were to be sold to Mr. Deripaska;  third, because of a suspicion on Mr. Deripaska’s side that TWG still had some kind of an interest in the assets that were being sold, and Mr. Hauser was concerned to ensure that the agreement was enforceable even if it transpired that TWG did still have such an interest;  fourth, there was a possibility that Mr. Abramovich had partners himself – although the person that Mr. Hauser and Mr. Schneider focused on in this regard was Mr. Shvidler (who was running the deal negotiations), and no other names were mentioned in this connection.  More generally, Mr. Hauser said that there was no mention of either Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the negotiations for this agreement<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="532">

Mr. Hauser’s recollection was that in the course of the negotiations there was no sensitivity or issue raised on either side regarding naming other partners and that formed no part of the motivation for the inclusion of the somewhat ambiguous phrase “Other Selling Shareholders”.  He also referred to the fact that the companies owning the underlying assets were bearer share companies, which meant that the language had to ensure that what they understood to be the position remained the position<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="533">

This section of the transcript quoted above followed immediately upon a passage in which the three men were discussing the means by which Mr. Abramovich could continue to pay Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in the light of the re-organisation of his trading companies.  As I have already described, the subject of the discussion at the Le Bourget meeting was what should be done to “legalise” Mr. Berezovsky’s receipts, i.e. to ensure that the money that was paid to him would be received in a way that would satisfy Western banks’ money laundering rules.  Again as I have already described, up to this date, whenever Mr. Berezovsky had wanted money, Mr. Abramovich had simply been able to draw on funds from his trading companies.  However, from the end of 2000, the trading operations of those companies were being integrated into Sibneft, with the result that Mr. Abramovich’s main source of cash would become Sibneft dividends, which were only payable on a six monthly basis.  One proposal (which I have already referred to above) was that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili might become registered shareholders in Sibneft for the purpose of receiving their payments from Mr. Abramovich from an apparently legitimate source (Boxes 451 to 496).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At Box 497, Mr. Berezovsky started the discussion about aluminium by saying that “the same will have to be done with Aluminium”.  In his written commentary on the transcript, Mr. Abramovich said that this appeared to be a suggestion that he (Mr. Berezovsky) should become a registered shareholder in RusAl.  Mr. Berezovsky’s argument was based on the use of the word “we” in the response “We only hold 50 per cent there” in Box 502.  In context, and given the evidence which I heard from both men in relation to the Le Bourget meeting, and RusAl generally, I do not consider that the word “we” has got to be read in the way contended for by Mr. Berezovsky, i.e. as referring to Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili as, effectively, a partnership unit.  I accept Mr. Abramovich’s evidence that he used the word “we” to mean his side as opposed to Mr. Deripaska’s side.  As was submitted in Mr. Abramovich’s written closing submissions<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="535">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Paragraph 431.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, not only were there other places in the recording where Mr. Abramovich commonly used “we” to refer to things which he or his businesses had done, but Mr. Abramovich also emphasised that he generally used the term “we” rather than “I” when referring to his companies.  Had I been more impressed by Mr. Berezovsky’s evidence in relation to the RusAl and other issues, I might have been able to place some weight on this passage in the transcript as supporting his case;  as it was, it was no more than a lightweight semantic point.  Mr. Berezovsky also sought to rely on Mr. Abramovich’s statement that “you will have to wait in line to receive dividends” at Box 504.  Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that there was no reason why Mr. Berezovsky would have had any interest in dividends from RusAl, if, as Mr. Abramovich contended, Mr. Berezovsky had nothing whatever to do with the aluminium interests;  there would had been no basis for Mr. Berezovsky to have waited in line at all.  But, taken in context, one can see, that Mr. Abramovich’s comment was a response to Mr. Berezovsky’s suggestion that he should become a shareholder in RusAl in order to receive payments in the future, rather than any recognition of an existing interest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the RusAl context, Mr. Rabinowitz relied on the fact that some of these documents appeared to have been based on the premise, or assumption, that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had an interest in the merged aluminium business, i.e. RusAl.  Mr. Berezovsky did not call any witnesses to explain the circumstances in which these documents were drafted, by whom, or for what purpose or otherwise to explain their content.  He himself was not able to give any such evidence, as, by his own admission, he had not been involved, and indeed was never involved, in the detailed arrangements of his own financial affairs.  However, what was clear from the evidence, and as I find, was that they were produced without any input from, or knowledge on the part of, Mr. Abramovich or any of his staff or advisers.  Moreover, by this time (2000 and thereafter), as I have already explained when dealing with these documents earlier, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili recognised the need appropriately to document the provenance of their funds in order to comply with Western anti-money-laundering procedures.  Many of the documents appear to have been designed for the purpose of showing Western bankers or professional advisers or trustees (such as Mr. Samuelson) so as to enable arrangements to be made for the receipt of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s funds in the West, in what might be referred to as a “legitimate” way.  It is against that background that the weight of such evidence falls to be evaluated.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, it was submitted on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky that Mr. Abramovich should have called Mr. Fomichev as a witness and indeed that it was an “oddity” that he had not done so.  Furthermore Mr. Rabinowitz invited the court to draw various adverse inferences from what was characterised as Mr. Abramovich’s “failure” to call Mr. Fomichev.  I address this particular issue below in the context of the Curtis notes, where I explain why I disagree with the submission.  For present purposes it is enough to say that, if Mr. Berezovsky chose to rely on various internal financial memoranda as supporting his case on this issue, but did not want to call Mr. Fomichev, or Mr. Kay, that was a matter for him;  but, in those circumstances, he had to bear the consequence that, necessarily, the court would attach limited weight to such material.</p>

The memorandum, which was undated and anonymous, spoke of a stage in an envisaged process whereby “the assets belonging to the partners [i.e. Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili] in the main business projects” would be distributed;  the listed assets included interests in LogoVAZ, “the aluminium complex”, Sibneft, ORT and Aeroflot.  It appeared that the Explanatory Note had been prepared for the purposes of presentation to Valmet, or Mr. Jenni, or other professional advisers of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, probably sometime in or about April 2000.  It, together with the second, third and fourth documents mentioned above, appeared to have been part of a package of documents which was intended to be sent, but which was never in fact sent, to Mr. Jenni, who denied in his evidence receiving it.  The overwhelming likelihood is that the Explanatory Note was prepared in connection with the “legalisation” of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s funds outside Russia - in other words to present the picture that the two men had ownership in various assets that would explain their income streams.</p>

These submissions were amplified in Mr. Berezovsky’s Second Schedule at pages 256-257 by a new linguistic analysis of the Russian text, to the effect that Mr. Streshinsky’s authorship of the Explanatory Note was apparent from a comparison of the language, syntax and layout of the Note with three other Russian language documents that Mr. Berezovsky alleged were authored by Mr. Streshinsky.  This in turn gave rise to supplementary written closing submissions from the Anisimov defendants served on 6 March 2012 and yet further written response submissions served by Mr. Berezovsky on 13 March 2012.  This linguistic analysis was not put to Mr. Streshinsky in cross-examination, although he was cross examined on the Explanatory Note at length.  Nor was it supported by the evidence of a Russian linguistic expert.  In those circumstances I am not prepared to attach any weight to the new linguistic analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject the three contentions put forward by Mr. Berezovsky to the effect that the Explanatory Note was authored by Mr. Streshinsky, that Mr. Anisimov advised Mr. Patarkatsishvili and/or Mr. Berezovsky about structuring his arrangements in relation to RusAl subject to “British law”, and that Mr. Anisimov had knowledge of its contents;  the evidence did not support these contentions.  Mr. Streshinsky convincingly denied authorship of the memorandum in cross-examination and there was no sensible reason why he should have prepared it;  in particular, it is highly unlikely that he would have referred to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili as “the clients”.  I also accept Mr. Anisimov’s evidence that he gave no such advice to Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Thus I accept the analysis put forward by Mr. Malek in his oral closing and supplemental submissions in relation to these four documents, as well as that put forward on behalf of Mr. Abramovich in his written and oral closing submissions.  I conclude that the most likely author of the document was Mr. Kay, although that point is immaterial to my conclusion that neither Mr. Streshinsky nor Mr. Anisimov had any knowledge of its contents.  The document wrongly asserts that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had ownership interests in Aeroflot.  Moreover, contrary to the submissions put forward on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky, the detailed information relating, for example, to the vendors of the pre-merger aluminium assets contained in the structure chart, that was apparently intended to be part of the package of documents, and the other three documents referred to above, would all have been available to Mr. Patarkatsishvili as a party to the Preliminary Agreement, and the commission agreements, and as somebody involved, in his capacity as intermediary, in the facilitation of the ten individual sale and purchase contracts referred to above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Likewise, for similar reasons little reliance can be placed on the Samuelson material, namely his Inter-Office memorandum and the e-mail attaching structure charts for the Hotspur and Octopus trusts.  I have already addressed these documents in the context of the Sibneft issues.  The information contained therein would have been derived from Mr. Berezovsky, Mr. Fomichev, Mr. Patarkatsishvili and/or Mr. Kay.  Moreover none of the steps which the Samuelson material contemplated being taken - namely the placing of Mr. Berezovsky’s and Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s interests in Sibneft or RusAl into trusts - was ever put into effect.  Thus whilst Mr. Samuelson may have been told that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili owned such assets in order to reassure him as to the source of the funds which he was going to receive (which were said to be derived from their assets), such assets were in fact never placed, or purportedly placed, into any structures set up by him.</p>

Once again, if I had been more convinced by Mr. Berezovsky’s own direct evidence about the RusAl issues, I might have considered attaching some weight to what professional advisers such as Valmet were being told;  but even on that hypothesis, such materials would have carried very little weight, given what little evidence there was about the circumstances in which they were generated and the fact that, certainly in relation to Aeroflot, they misrepresented the position.  </p>

She noted this fact on a post-it sticker which she placed on the notes when she copied them.  She could not recall when she was handed the notes by Mr. Curtis and the notes themselves are undated.

The relevance of the notes, if they were indeed a true record of what was discussed, was that they purport to record discussions, to which Mr. Tenenbaum was said to have been a party, which assumed that Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had been shareholders in Sibneft along with Mr. Abramovich;  that they had sold those interests via a structure which had been complicated and costly;  and that at the time of the meeting Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had a 25% interest in RusAl, as did Mr. Abramovich.

It is not necessary for me to decide whether Mr. Patarkatsishvili alone was dishonest in possibly suggesting to Mr. Curtis, that Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Fomichev and Mr. Tenenbaum had indeed had the discussions in Russian, which the notes purport to record (Mr. Curtis not being able to speak or understand Russian);  or whether Mr. Curtis, either alone, or together with, Mr. Patarkatsishvili, was dishonest in purporting to record that such discussions had taken place in English in Mr. Tenenbaum’s presence, as the notes appear to suggest;  although I consider that the hypothesis that both men were dishonest is the more likely.  If it were necessary to do so, I would not have difficulty in holding that Mr. Curtis was indeed dishonest in this respect, despite the fact that he was, to use Mr. Rabinowitz’s words, “an English solicitor”.

Obviously, he was loyal to Mr. Abramovich.  But, although that factor necessarily had to be taken into account in my evaluation, it did not detract from what I regarded as the underlying veracity of his evidence.  In 2003 Mr. Tenenbaum was the managing director of the company now known as MHC (Services) Limited (“MHC”), based in London, a consultancy service company which provided consulting and administrative support to Mr. Abramovich.  He had previously been the head of corporate finance at Sibneft and had been part of the working group responsible for the implementation of agreements between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska to merge their respective aluminium interests into RusAl.  However, his involvement with RusAl had been limited to certain aspects of the shareholders’ agreement between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska, as such agreements typically involved concepts with which he was more familiar, given his background in corporate finance and international mergers and acquisitions, when at Salomon Brothers.  He had just been involved in Mr. Abramovich’s acquisition of Chelsea Football Club, which had completed in July 2003, and it was largely to discuss football that he went to see Mr. Patarkatsishvili.</p>

Mr. Abramovich had told me that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had invited him to his seaside home to see the house, which had recently been completed, and to discuss with him the possibility of an investment in a football club.  Because of a Russian arrest warrant issued against Mr. Patarkatsishvili, he was not able to travel outside Georgia.  Mr. Abramovich asked me if I could attend in his place as a sign of respect to Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  I was in Moscow at the time and had no desire to go but, given my involvement with Chelsea Football Club, I reluctantly agreed.  I travelled to Batumi, Georgia, in a chartered aircraft, and was then transported by Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s helicopter to his house.</p>

As I recall, he was hoping that this would enable him to travel to Brazil, despite the arrest warrant.  He felt that he had acquired a negative image and said that he was hoping to get the same kind of positive publicity in Brazil as he saw Mr. Abramovich as having obtained in England.  He was very excited about this idea.  I assured him that I would speak to Mr. Abramovich about the proposal.  I have a recollection that Mr. Patarkatsishvili also mentioned that he had contacts in Georgian football circles and, I believe, he said that he had made an investment in Dynamo Tbilisi (a prominent Georgian football club).

It was common ground that around a year later, Mr. Patarkatsishvili was indeed engaged in negotiations for the purchase of a Brazilian football club.  I reject the assertion, made by Mr. Rabinowitz in cross-examination, that, because Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s negotiations in relation to Brazilian football did not take place until August 2004, the topic of football was unlikely to have been the subject matter of conversation at the meeting in Batumi in 2003.

It is not necessary for me to engage in any detailed analysis of this evidence.  Suffice it to say that a considerable amount of information about the structure of Mr. Abramovich’s ownership interest in RusAl, and, in particular, the use of bearer share companies in the BVI, would have been available to Mr. Fomichev, Mr. Berezovsky’s other representatives and Mr. Patarkatsishvili as a result of the $1.3 billion payment to Devonia, which had been structured through dividend payments from Mr. Abramovich’s aluminium interests;  likewise, various details of his ownership interest in RusAl,  the aluminium trading company, had been made available to Mr. Berezovsky’s representatives in connection with other payments.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili himself would, as I have already mentioned, have had knowledge of certain of the offshore companies used in the context of his role as an intermediary in the conclusion of the Preliminary Agreement and the ten individual sale and purchase contracts.  Moreover, as Mr. Berezovsky’s own Particulars of Claim expressly recognised, the 50-50 split of ownership between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska in respect of RusAl had been publicly announced by as early as 4 April 2001 and had been expressly confirmed in correspondence prior to Mr. Tenenbaum’s visit to Georgia in the context of certain commission payments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was, as I find, every reason why, by the time of the Patarkatsishvili lunch in August 2003, Mr. Curtis might have been keen to have “created evidence” of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s and Mr. Berezovsky’s asserted interests in aluminium assets.  In February 2003 Mr. Abramovich had told Mr. Patarkatsishvili that he was considering ending his joint venture with Mr. Deripaska in relation to aluminium;  Mr. Abramovich explained that this would have involved settlement of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s outstanding commission.  This would have raised in Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s mind the problem of “legalising” any funds received in a manner that would have satisfied the anti-money-laundering compliance procedures of Western banks.  Mr. Fomichev had previously suggested in late 2000 that future payments by Mr. Abramovich to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili could be “legalised” by transferring shares in Sibneft to them so that they could receive payment of dividends and justify their receipts in that manner.  That, as I have already described, was a topic discussed at the Le Bourget meeting.  The evidence suggested that a similar scheme was being considered by Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Curtis, shortly after the former’s meeting with Mr. Abramovich in February 2003, when Mr. Patarkatsishvili instructed Mr. Curtis to prepare a draft memorandum of understanding between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili, which would, if executed, have provided for the transfer of the shares in a company owning 25% of RusAl to Mr. Patarkatsishvili (but not to Mr. Berezovsky) for a nominal amount, following which the shares were to be sold back to Mr. Abramovich.  But the problem which Mr. Curtis faced, as Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s legal adviser, as he had pointed out in 2000 in relation to the alleged interest in Sibneft, was the absence of any written record that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had ever had an interest in RusAl.  I conclude that the likelihood is that Mr. Curtis wrote the Curtis notes in order to generate evidence of such an interest.  As was recorded in the notes themselves, it was important “to create proof of ownership to show where/why proceeds of his own sales are derived”.  Whilst I do not need to make any particular finding in this respect, I am unable to attach any evidential weight to these notes as supporting Mr. Berezovsky’s case in relation to an interest in RusAl.</p>

Mr. Patarkatsishvili appears to have told them that he first heard about Mr. Abramovich’s sale to Mr. Deripaska “through the market”, and indicated that he was unhappy to learn of it.  If he had met with a representative of Mr. Abramovich a matter of months before the sale and discussed RusAl, it is almost inconceivable that he would not have mentioned it.  Similarly, whereas Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s draft proof indicated that Mr. Patarkatsishvili wanted to stay in the aluminium industry, and in particular wanted to stay in business with Mr. Abramovich, the Curtis notes record a suggestion that Mr. Patarkatsishvili wanted to sell to Mr. Abramovich.</p>

That evidence had not appeared in any of Mr. Tenenbaum’s or Mr. Shvidler’s previous witness statements.  In further cross-examination by Mr. Rabinowitz on this issue, Mr. Tenenbaum gave evidence that, in the context of a discussion as to whether to call Mr. Fomichev as a witness, Mr. Fomichev forwarded to Mr. Shvidler a text message said to be from Mr. Berezovsky which Mr. Fomichev read as a threat from Mr. Berezovsky, which Mr. Fomichev said gave rise to concerns for his safety.

Nor have I relied upon such evidence in any other way, whether as casting light upon the reasons why Mr. Fomichev was not called as a witness, or as adversely reflecting upon Mr. Berezovsky’s or Mr. Abramovich’s case, their respective credibility, or otherwise.  However, contrary to Mr. Rabinowitz’s submissions, and consistent with my approach of disregarding this evidence in its entirety, I am not prepared to accept that the evidence was untrue in the sense of having been dishonestly fabricated by Mr. Shvidler and/or by Mr. Tenenbaum.  As Mr. Sumption submitted, there was no evidence to support such an allegation.  Whilst not tested by cross-examination, or supported by forensic evidence at trial, the explanation given in correspondence by Skadden as to why the message had been deleted, and why it could not be retrieved was, on its face, reasonable.

Apart from the fact that Mr. Fomichev had been Mr. Berezovsky’s financial adviser, confidant and agent in all the relevant matters in relation to which he would have been called to give evidence, as Mr. Sumption submitted, it was Mr. Abramovich’s case that Mr. Fomichev had been involved in the generation of sham documents for the purposes of laundering Mr. Berezovsky’s funds.  I see no basis upon which Mr. Abramovich could have “realistically” called Mr. Fomichev as a witness, only for Mr. Sumption to have attempted to suggest to him in chief, in effect, that he was a dishonest liar.  Notwithstanding Mr. Rabinowitz’s attempt to formulate the matters in respect of which he submitted that adverse inferences should be drawn against Mr. Abramovich, as ostensibly matters which Mr. Abramovich had to prove, the reality was that burden of proof, and the evidential onus, in relation to the critical issues in respect of which Mr. Fomichev’s evidence was relevant (e.g. that, under the terms of the Devonia Agreement, Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili sold their interests in Sibneft;  that the Curtis notes demonstrated that the two men had an interest in RusAl), lay fairly and squarely on Mr. Berezovsky.  I therefore reject the submission that any adverse inferences should be drawn against Mr. Abramovich because, understandably, he chose not to call Mr. Fomichev.  </p>

As was submitted on behalf of Mr. Abramovich, the reality was that Mr. Abramovich made his payments to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili from whatever cash funds within his businesses were conveniently available at the time.  The fact that dividend distributions from Rual were the <span style="text-decoration:underline">mechanism</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>of payment did not reflect the reason for the payment;  such payments from Rual were not equivalent to dividend payments from <span style="font-style:italic">RusAl</span> in respect of any alleged ownership interest.</p>

Mr. Keeling was concerned to receive a letter from Mr. Abramovich’s companies confirming that the funds which were being paid to Blue Water and Rich Brown were derived from legitimate income, and did not represent the proceeds of crime.  For that purpose, Mr. De Cort provided to Curtis &amp; Co a source of funds letter relating to the various dividends which were being paid through the chains of various companies, and ultimately to Blue Water and Rich Brown.  He confirmed that:</p>

But none of this documentation suggested, and certainly did not unequivocally suggest, that, whatever the source of the payments, the character in which either Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili were receiving the funds was as ultimate beneficial shareholders of shareholdings in RusAl.  The letter was directed at demonstrating the legitimate source of the monies paid, not at the capacity in which the ultimate recipients were receiving the funds.  </p>

I address this topic further below.  The letter was not copied to Mr. Abramovich (or any of his representatives), and appeared to have been designed to legitimise the funds for the purpose of money-laundering regulations.

In the event that a third party made an offer, Mr. Deripaska could elect either to match that offer, or propose different terms.  If Mr. Deripaska’s alternative terms were not acceptable, then he either had to match the third-party offer or let the shares go to the third-party.

Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that Mr. Abramovich’s story about 2003 was bogus, and the far more credible explanation was that the remaining 25% tranche was not Mr. Abramovich’s to sell, because it belonged to Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  That, said Mr. Rabinowitz, was consistent with the evidence Mr. Deripaska had previously given in his litigation with Mr. Michael Cherney as to why it was that the RusAl sales were conducted in two stages, and what had been publicly said in the media “by Mr. Abramovich’s own spokesman”;  moreover, Mr. Abramovich’s evidence could not be squared with the contemporaneous contractual documentation, suggesting, as it does, that there had been no agreement reached between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska in the summer of 2003, regarding either a sale of the second tranche, or an overall sale price for the entire 50% stake in RusAl.</p>

These included not merely RusAl but also joint ventures in a car manufacturing business and an energy business.  Although Mr. Abramovich had not made up his mind at this time as to whether he would actually sell out to Mr. Deripaska, their respective management teams were clearly finding it difficult to work together.  Mr. Abramovich’s reasons for this decision had nothing to do with either Mr. Berezovsky or Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  Apart from the fact that his team was finding it difficult to work with Mr. Deripaska’s team, Mr. Abramovich took the view that his investment in the aluminium business had paid off sufficiently and he was committed to a new project in the oil industry, upon which he wanted to focus.  Mr. Abramovich told Mr. Patarkatsishvili that Mr. Deripaska and he had different understandings about the future development of the business, that he had formed the impression that Mr. Deripaska was “trying to squeeze us out” and that Mr. Deripaska preferred to work “solo” in the sense of wanting to make all the decisions on his own.  Mr. Abramovich appreciated that he would have to settle the outstanding question of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s commission, as he had played а significant role in the original acquisition of aluminium as well as providing <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> assistance in relation to the problems in the aluminium industry.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili was not happy about Mr. Abramovich’s intention to leave the aluminium industry as, so Mr. Abramovich explained, Mr. Patarkatsishvili had various ongoing projects in relation to which he hoped to enter further commission.  But no suggestion was made by Mr. Patarkatsishvili at the meeting that he, or Mr. Berezovsky had any interest in RusAl shares.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">That the settlement of Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s outstanding commission was the subject of discussion at this meeting was supported by the fact that in April 2003, Mr. Patarkatsishvili appears to have instructed Mr. Curtis to draft a “subject to contract” “Memorandum of Understanding”, as between Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili providing for the transfer of the shares in a company owning 25% of RusAl to Mr. Patarkatsishvili, for nil consideration.  The prospect of the payment of commission would have been likely to have raised in Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s mind the usual problem of “legalisation” in the face of Western money-laundering regulations, and it is probable that the Memorandum was produced with that aim in mind.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first point, I accept, based on the evidence of Mr. Hauser, the solicitor acting for Mr. Deripaska who drafted the Deed of Pre-Emption, that neither Mr. Abramovich’s nor Mr. Deripaska’s business representatives conveyed to the lawyers, who documented the arrangement, the essential commercial terms of the deal, namely that Mr. Deripaska had a right to purchase a second 25% tranche at a fixed price of $450 million;  and that if they had done so, the Deed of Pre-Emption would have been drafted very differently.  However, although the point clearly raised serious questions about whether Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska were indeed telling the truth about their agreement, I am satisfied, having heard both men in the witness box, and notwithstanding the slight inconsistencies in their evidence, and the absence of any written record, that they did indeed reach the commercial deal to which both men referred.  Moreover, as Mr. Malek pointed out in his closing submissions, to a certain extent, at least, the documentation reflected the agreed but, staged, sale structure;  it was Mr. Abramovich who wanted to exit his partnership with Mr. Deripaska, not Mr. Deripaska who wanted to purchase the shares from Mr. Abramovich.  A right of pre-emption given to Mr. Deripaska in the event that Mr. Abramovich found an alternative purchaser (rather than a right to Mr. Deripaska to control the timing of the sale) was consistent with that.  Moreover Mr. Deripaska was protected by the fact that he had 75% control of RusAl, with no minority blocking rights in the various holding companies.  Mr. Abramovich had been compensated by the substantial control premium paid for the first 25% tranche.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I find there to have been nothing surprising or questionable in the fact that Mr. Abramovich agreed to the alterations to the relevant provisions relating to the exercise of minority rights in the companies owning RusAl shares, once the sale of the first 25% tranche had been agreed.  It was clear from evidence that effective control of RusAl’s management and business had passed to Mr. Deripaska at this stage.  As Mr. Abramovich himself described, the two men agreed to terminate a previously existing shareholders’ agreement governing their activities as shareholders in RusAl, at the first stage of the transaction so that Mr. Deripaska would essentially <span style="color:#151515">acquire all management rights for RusAl immediately upon the sale of the first 25% tranche.  It was not surprising, in those circumstances, that a substantial control premium was paid by Mr. Deripaska for the first 25% tranche.  Indeed, t</span>hat appeared to me to have been consistent with the commercial deal arrived at between the two principals rather than inconsistent with it.

As Mr. Deripaska explained, the remaining 25% was not available at that stage, because Mr. Abramovich was not prepared to sell it on terms that the purchase price was left outstanding, and Mr. Deripaska did not have the funds to purchase it.  Accordingly I do not consider that this witness statement undermines Mr. Abramovich’s and Mr. Deripaska’s account.</p>

However, in order to get the deal done (and as already had been suggested by Mr. Curtis, as recorded in the Curtis Notes of 23 August 2003), they were prepared to structure the transaction so that it appeared that only Mr. Patarkatsishvili was the beneficial owner if that made it easier for the other parties.  They therefore went along with the proposal from Mr. Abramovich’s representatives (i.e. the acknowledgement and the warranty referred to above).  Because there were clear risks attached to this, however, prior to closing, Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s team required Mr. Patarkatsishvili to sign off on an official release to them, in which Mr. Patarkatsishvili indicated that he fully understood the risks that he was undertaking in the event that the warranty he was giving (about Mr. Berezovsky not being involved) was untrue.” </p>

What was effectively a conspiracy allegation was not proceeded with in Mr. Berezovsky’s closing submissions, where the argument was presented in the somewhat modified form.  This was to the effect that, rather than admit the truth that he was not the beneficial owner of a 25% stake in RusAl, but that Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky were the true owners of that stake, Mr. Abramovich was forced to argue that he was prepared to execute false documents in order to deceive Western banks as part of a money-laundering conspiracy to enable Mr. Patarkatsishvili to transfer funds into the West<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="552">

Before I do so, I make two points.  First, it is important to bear in mind, when considering whether the events relating to the sale of the second tranche indeed supported Mr. Berezovsky’s case that he had an interest in RusAl shares, that in these proceedings such an interest could only be demonstrated on the basis of the alleged 1995 Agreement, the alleged 1999 RusAl Agreement, the contribution of his alleged Sibneft profits to the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets, and/or what Mr. Berezovsky alleged was agreed at the Dorchester Hotel meeting.  The court in these proceedings is not addressing the issue whether Mr. Berezovsky had some interest as a result of, or under, a bilateral partnership agreement or other private arrangements with Mr. Patarkatsishvili extending to all or some of their business assets.  Second, it is not necessary for me to rehearse every single evidential point raised on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky and I do not do so;  however, I have taken them into account in reaching my conclusions as set out below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following their discussion in February 2003, Mr. Abramovich visited Mr. Patarkatsishvili in Georgia in October 2003.  He told Mr. Patarkatsishvili about the sale of the first 25% tranche of RusAl to Mr. Deripaska, which had taken place in September 2003.  Mr. Abramovich explained that, although he had officially sold only 25% of his RusAl shares, he had in reality agreed to sell out everything to Mr. Deripaska and had essentially now exited the aluminium business.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili was upset about this, because he had wanted Mr. Abramovich to stay involved in the aluminium business as Mr. Patarkatsishvili had hoped to act as an “enabler” on a number of other deals, so he saw it as a lost opportunity for future business.  As in February 2003, there was no mention or assertion by Mr. Patarkatsishvili that he owned interests in RusAl or the pre-merger aluminium assets.  There was no issue as between the two men that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had indeed <span style="color:#161616">earned his fee for helping Mr. Abramovich acquire the pre-merger aluminium assets and that it would be considerably more than the “floor” price of $115 million which they had previously agreed.  As an opening move in the negotiations, Mr. Patarkatsishvili asked Mr. Abramovich for $700 million</span><span style="color:#303030">;  Mr. Abramovich counter-offered with a figure of </span><span style="color:#151515">$400 million</span><span style="color:#2F2F2F">, and ultimately, either at the meeting or thereafter, </span><span style="color:#151515">they compromised on a figure of $540 million for what Mr. Abramovich referred to as Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s “cut”.  That figure was subsequently increased to $585 million for reasons which Mr. Abramovich was not able to recall.  He explained that</span><span style="color:#2F2F2F"> it was typical of Mr. Patarkatsishvili that, even in their last transaction, Mr. Patarkatsishvili managed to get the deal renegotiated so that he ended up receiving more than they had originally agreed.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The reason why Mr. Abramovich agreed to pay such a substantial sum to Mr. Patarkatsishvili reflected the fact that the aluminium holdings had been an extremely successful deal for Mr. Abramovich, and that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had made that possible;  first by bringing about the original acquisition of the assets, and secondly because of the valuable assistance which Mr. Patarkatsishvili had in fact provided in connection with the aluminium business.  Mr. Abramovich also explained that there was his own reputation to maintain, as a person who kept his end of the bargain and that, given the history of their relationship and the services Mr. Patarkatsishvili had provided, he wanted to end his <span style="font-style:italic">krysha</span> relationship with Mr. Patarkatsishvili on a friendly footing.  No mention was made during the course of this discussion about Mr. Berezovsky expecting to receive any money for alleged services in relation to RusAl or in relation to the aluminium business in general.  </p>

Mr. Abramovich was well aware that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was particularly keen to receive the money into Western bank accounts and that, in order to do so, he had to satisfy the anti-money-laundering and other requirements of Western banks<span style="color:#2F2F2F">.  It is probable that Mr. Patarkatsishvili suggested the proposal whereby RusAl shares would be transferred into his name.  Mr. Abramovich appreciated that Mr. Patarkatsishvili</span> could not just receive such a large amount of cash with no lawful explanation for its receipt;  but, although Mr. Abramovich was not certain when it would be possible to close the deal with Mr. Deripaska, he thought that the transaction would present an opportunity to make a large payment to Mr. Patarkatsishvili in a way that would avoid the need to use an intermediary to transfer the funds<span style="color:#2F2F2F">.  </span>Mr. Abramovich told Mr. Patarkatsishvili that <span style="color:#2F2F2F">it would be necessary to discuss the proposal with Mr. Deripaska, who, he anticipated, because of his distrust of Mr. Patarkatsishvili, would not necessarily be keen on participating in such an arrangement.</span></p>

In addition, he did not have a sufficiently good relationship with Mr. Deripaska to negotiate directly with him.  For these reasons, in early 2004, he asked one of his closest friends, Mr. Anisimov, to participate in the negotiation process with Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Abramovich on his behalf.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili explained to Mr. Anisimov that he was owed substantial sums by Mr. Abramovich and that this debt was to be settled from the sale proceeds of the second 25% tranche of RusAl shares, which was to be sold to Mr. Deripaska.  Mr. Anisimov had a good relationship with both Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Patarkatsishvili trusted him.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili agreed to remunerate Mr. Anisimov for his services and, at the same time, to fulfil what apparently was an outstanding promise on Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s part to compensate Mr. Anisimov for the low sale price which the latter had received for the transfer of his interests in the pre-merger aluminium assets.  </span>

However, he was prepared to go along with Mr. Abramovich’s proposals for commercial reasons, since, according to Mr. Abramovich, it was important for Mr. Deripaska to acquire the RusAl shares for $450 million.  On the face of the contractual documents, of course, there might have been an opportunity for Mr. Abramovich to increase the price.  Unknown to Mr. Abramovich at the time, Mr. Patarkatsishvili apparently was paid an extra $15 million by Mr. Deripaska.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the following year, a working group was formed on Mr. Abramovich’s side to negotiate the terms of the sale to Mr. Deripaska of the second 25% tranche.  It included Mr. Tenenbaum, Ms. Panchenko, Ms. Khudyk and (from 8 June 2004) Mr. De Cort.  Mr. Deripaska was represented by a Mr. Mishakov and Mr. Hauser, a solicitor at Bryan Cave.  Mr. Anisimov, acting on behalf of Mr. Patarkatsishvili, instructed his then senior adviser, Mr. Streshinsky, to oversee the structural and legal aspects of the deal.  At an early stage, Mr. Streshinsky instructed a corporate lawyer at Akin Gump, a Mr. Faekov, to assist him.  Contrary to the assertion made in Mr. Berezovsky’s written opening submissions, Mr. Anisimov was not also acting on Mr. Berezovsky’s behalf in the transaction.  I accept Mr. Anisimov’s and Mr. Streshinsky’s evidence, supported in the event by that of Mr. Berezovsky, that Mr. Anisimov and Mr. Streshinsky were only acting on behalf of Mr. Patarkatsishvili.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The detailed negotiations took place mainly between 9 June 2004 and 20 July 2004.  A number of draft agreements and memoranda were circulated.  Mr. Berezovsky, as he accepted in evidence, played no direct part in the negotiations.  He was not shown the transaction documents either in draft or as executed.  Mr. Anisimov and his team took their instructions from Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Patarkatsishvili alone.  Mr. Berezovsky gave no instructions to Mr. Anisimov or his team and had no contact with them.  I accept Mr. Anisimov’s evidence that he understood that he was acting solely on behalf of Mr. Patarkatsishvili and that Mr. Berezovsky was not involved and did not have any interest in the 25% RusAl stake, or in the proceeds of its sale.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Mr. Berezovsky heard about the proposed sale.  He told <span style="font-style:italic">Vedomosti</span>, in an interview on or about 2 June 2004 that he was the beneficial owner of the 25% RusAl stake still held by Mr. Abramovich’s companies, that he disapproved of the sale and would go to court if necessary.  A similar article also appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic">Moscow Times</span> on 3 June 2004.  This public assertion by Mr. Berezovsky disrupted the negotiations.  It gave rise to the potential problem, so far as Mr. Deripaska’s advisers were concerned, that, after the sale had taken place, there might be a challenge to the transaction by Mr. Berezovsky.  That had a significant influence on the form of the contractual documents ultimately agreed.  However, I find, contrary to Mr. Berezovsky’s assertions, that the form of the contractual documentation was not the result of the lawyers airbrushing Mr. Berezovsky out of the picture;  rather it was the result of the lawyers, having received instructions from both Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Patarkatsishvili that Mr. Berezovsky had never been in the picture in the first place, needing to address the problem of his public assertion of interest in the 25% RusAl stake.  This they did by including express warranties, representations and indemnities in the sale documentation to protect Mr. Deripaska.  </p>

Whilst these warranties or representations were clearly inconsistent with Mr. Berezovsky having had any beneficial interest in the RusAl shares, they were clearly inconsistent on their face with Mr. Abramovich’s case that Mr. Patarkatsishvili had had no interest in the RusAl Holding shares, or the previous RusAl shares, other than that interest which was specifically created under the Deed Of Settlement as between Madison and Cliren, under which Madison transferred the 12,500 shares in RusAl holding to Cliren.  The warranties were also on their face inconsistent with the evidence given by Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Shvidler and Mr. Deripaska about the Dorchester Hotel meeting and the arrangements that led to the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets. </p>

Mr. Rabinowitz submitted that the reality was consistent with the warranties, namely that Mr. Abramovich never was the sole beneficial owner of the 25% stake in RusAl, but rather that he held the stake for and on behalf of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili.  </p>

The reason why the warranty was drafted in that way was extensively explored in the evidence of Mr. Hauser, a witness who was called on subpoena on behalf of Mr. Abramovich.  He gave a clear explanation as to why he believed, whether rightly or wrongly matters not, that he needed an historic representation and warranty from Mr. Patarkatsishvili as to beneficial ownership going back to 15 March 2000, so as to remove the possibility that some third party:</p>

Further, Mr. De Cort explained that these matters were documented in separate agreements between principals solely for the purpose of risk allocation, given the claims had been made publicly by Mr. Berezovsky;  and it was not anticipated that the Deed of Acknowledgement or the Beneficial Owner Deed of Release would need to be shown to third parties such as banks.  What was required for the purposes of anti-money-laundering compliance requirements would have been the documents showing Cliren’s entitlement to, and sale of, the RusAl shares.</p>

As I have already quoted above, his case was also that “Mr. Abramovich’s team were of the view that Mr. Berezovsky was also beneficial owner” of a 25% RusAl stake;  and that Mr. Anisimov and Mr. Streshinsky knew that Mr. Berezovsky had a beneficial interest in RusAl.  In particular, in relation to the negotiations for sale of the second 25% tranche, it was asserted that, given Mr. Streshinsky’s alleged knowledge of Mr. Berezovsky’s beneficial interest, “… it would have been astonishing if Mr. Anisimov was not aware of the position”.  In those circumstances, where Mr. Berezovsky has relied upon his allegations about Mr. Anisimov’s alleged knowledge as part of his case, and where Mr. Streshinsky was cross-examined on the topic, it is appropriate, as Mr. Malek submitted, that I should make findings as to Mr. Anisimov’s knowledge, notwithstanding Mr. Rabinowitz’s submissions to the contrary.  It will then be a matter of argument in the Chancery proceedings as to whether, and if so to what extent, possibly based on different evidence, Mr. Berezovsky can pursue the point.</p>

During this visit, Mr. Streshinsky explained the overall structure of the transaction and took Mr. Patarkatsishvili through the key draft transaction documents.  He specifically highlighted the representations and warranties that Mr. Patarkatsishvili was being asked to give, and explained to him that he could have a potential liability if Mr. Berezovsky brought a claim asserting that the sale of the second RusAl tranche infringed his rights.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili confirmed to Mr. Streshinsky that he understood that he was acting alone.  The suggestion was put to Mr. Streshinsky in cross-examination that Mr. Patarkatsishvili told Mr. Streshinsky that the representation was false, but that he would agree to it if that was what it would take to get the RusAl sale transaction done.  It was asserted that Mr. Faekov was not a party to the conversation and Mr. Streshinsky was challenged that he had not recorded it.  Mr. Streshinsky firmly rejected the suggestion that Mr. Patarkatsishvili told him that the representation was incorrect.  I accept Mr. Streshinsky’s evidence on this aspect.  The fact that he did not document his conversations with Mr. Patarkatsishvili was unsurprising;  he was not a lawyer and it was not his usual practice to draw up attendance notes.  Moreover, he followed up his conversation with Mr. Patarkatsishvili with a “deal approval document” which was drafted by Mr. Faekov and set out the final structure of the transaction including a list of all the potential risks involved.  These risks included the possibility that Mr. Berezovsky might make a claim, but Mr. Faekov noted that “we are unaware of facts upon which [Mr. Berezovsky] could rely”.  Mr. Patarkatsishvili signed the document.  </p>

The notes of interviews with Mr. Patarkatsishvili recorded that he told Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors in 2005 and 2007 that he and Mr. Berezovsky each had a 50/50 interest in RusAl (as well as in Sibneft, a topic which I have already addressed).  By the date of their first visit to Mr. Patarkatsishvili, Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors had been told by Mr. Berezovsky that he alleged that he and Mr. Patarkatsishvili had once held a joint interest in Sibneft and RusAl;  and they had already been instructed by Mr. Berezovsky to investigate potential claims against Mr. Abramovich in relation to, amongst other matters, RusAl  and Sibneft.  I have described, in an earlier section of this judgment, the circumstances in which the proofing materials were compiled, and that by the time of the interviews, both Mr. Patarkatsishvili and Mr. Berezovsky had made numerous representations to Western professionals which had allowed funds to be received by them in the West and which would have been wholly undermined, if Mr. Patarkatsishvili had departed from them.  These representations had been supported by documents produced for the purpose;  for example the fleeting interest of Mr. Patarkatsishvili in RusAl had been “documented” in the form of the agreements with Madison, Cliren and Eagle;  and the alleged interest of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Patarkatsishvili in Sibneft had been “documented” in the form of the Devonia Agreement.  In those circumstances it would have been embarrassing and difficult for Mr. Patarkatsishvili to have given a different story to Mr. Berezovsky’s solicitors as to the source of the funds;  it would, or could, have harmed both their interests.  It would not have been at all surprising if he had not chosen to explain the true reason for the receipt of such substantial funds from Mr. Abramovich.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The commercial rationale for the $585 million received by Cliren following the sale of the second 25% tranche of RusAl shares was to discharge Mr. Abramovich’s obligation to pay an agreed commission to Mr. Patarkatsishvili for assistance provided by Mr. Patarkatsishvili to Mr. Abramovich in relation to the acquisition of the pre-merger aluminium assets and more generally in connection with the aluminium business.  As a mechanism to effect this payment, Mr. Patarkatsishvili’s company, Cliren, became for a very short period of time a shareholder in RusAl Holding and immediately sold those shares on to Eagle, a company owned by Mr. Deripaska.  In that limited sense only, $450 million of the $585 million received by Cliren following the sale of the second 25% tranche of RusAl shares represented proceeds of sale.  The balance of $135 million was paid as a purported dividend under the Deed of Accounting and Release but, although that was the method of payment, in fact none of the money paid to Cliren represented dividends to which Mr. Patarkatsishvili was entitled by virtue of any shareholding acquired prior to July 2004.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of my conclusions in relations to Issues B1 and B2, Issue B10 is, for all practical purposes, academic, since I have decided that Mr. Berezovsky did not have any entitlement to make any claims, or potential claims, against Mr. Abramovich, or Madison, in relation to RusAl.  In other words, the question whether such claims as Mr. Berezovsky has brought against Mr. Abramovich  (which I have held to be unfounded), were in fact released by the Deed of Settlement as between Madison and Cliren is moot.  It was not suggested, for example, that the court’s determination on this issue is required to prevent any further or future claim by Mr. Berezovsky against Mr. Abramovich in relation to RusAl.  Unless I am persuaded that there is a specific and necessary reason for my decision on this issue, I am reluctant to decide it.  There would appear to be no utility in my doing so.  If I am mistaken in this regard, and there is a need for me to do so, I will.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear from the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">BCCI v Ali </span>[2002] 1 AC 251 at paragraph 8, that there are no special rules of interpretation applicable to a release:  it is to be construed in the same way as every other contract, the question being the intention of the parties ascertained objectively in the context of the circumstances in which the release was entered into.  Whether a particular claim or potential claim is caught by the express terms of the particular release can be heavily dependent on the factual matrix, as the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Ali </span>itself demonstrates.  A slight change in the facts as I have found them to be (for example, if it had been the case that Mr. Abramovich believed that Mr. Berezovsky had a genuine claim to an interest in RusAl and knew that he was not prepared to sign the release) might have produced a different conclusion in relation to the issue raised.  I would not therefore be prepared to decide the issue on a hypothetical basis, for example that Mr. Berezovsky’s claim to an interest in RusAl was well-founded, without an agreed factual basis for the hypothesis upon which I was to decide the issue.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is appropriate that I should pay tribute to the highly professional and efficient way in which this case was conducted, in the best Commercial Court traditions, not only by the respective teams of counsel and solicitors, but also by the respective participants and their service providers.  Of course, the judge sees only the public panoply of the courtroom, but, whatever tensions or undercurrents there may have been between the parties, or indeed the lawyers, in what were, heavily fought, acrimonious disputes involving serious allegations of dishonesty and blackmail, the case was battled out in a courteous, disciplined and restrained manner.  That necessarily contributed to an efficient and effective trial process.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were also a number of other features which significantly contributed to the smooth running of the trial.  Perhaps most importantly, the extensive documentation and daily transcripts were presented in a highly organised and easily accessible web-based electronic format, with the result that, apart from reliance on hardcopy versions of the written arguments, and, to a limited extent, the expert statements, I was able to conduct what, at least so far as I was concerned, was a paperless trial.  There can be no doubt that this enabled the trial to be concluded within the allotted timetable, and with the maximum efficiency.  It also provided the inestimable advantage, from my perspective, of being able to access my notes made during trial, and the full galaxy of the trial bundles, from wherever I was and at whatever time of day (or night).  I am extremely grateful, as, I am sure, are the other lawyers in the case, for all the technical assistance which I and they received in this respect.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another significant contributor to the trial process was the skill, efficiency and understanding cooperation of the simultaneous translators.  Their industry enabled evidence given in Russian to be delivered, and understood, in English in a virtually seamless fashion.  Absent their contribution, I have no doubt that the trial would have taken considerably longer.  </p>

They have been an invaluable aid to the completion of this judgement.  The fact that all the evidential and legal points, minutely and comprehensively analysed in lengthy footnotes, have not necessarily featured in this judgement, does not mean that they have not been pored over, and taken into account, in reaching my conclusions.  The specific references in footnotes to trial materials were of particular assistance;  I especially thank those who were tasked with the unenviable job of checking their accuracy.</p>
