The claimants used Borecene as the raw material with which to rotomould static tanks to hold bulk liquids, in particular kerosene. The tanks come in five basic styles - Bunded, Horizontal, Rectangular (Slimline), Low Profile and Vertical - with different designs in each style. A bunded tank is a single skin tank housed in an outer tank to prevent leakage into the ground. </p>

In essence they say that the Borecene supplied was not fit for the purpose of making static oil tanks because it had inadequate resistance to ultra violet light (“UV”) either because of its intrinsic characteristics or its inadequate stabilisation package or a combination of the two. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">The defendants say that Borecene is neither unsuitable nor unfit for purpose and has certainly not been shown to be so. The tank failures arose from the claimants’ inability or failure properly to use Borecene and to ensure that it could make satisfactory tanks taking account of Borecene’s different rotomoulding properties of which they were aware. They also contend that the issues in this case are to be determined by the law of Denmark and that any liability they may have is severely limited by the terms of the relevant contracts. </p>

The claim in those proceedings was that Borecene had inadequate environmental stress cracking resistance (“ESCR”). Environmental Stress Cracking is the cracking of a polyethylene part under stress when in contact with a medium, e.g. kerosene, in the absence of which fracture does not occur under the same conditions of stress. No claim was made in that case in respect of inadequate UV resistance. Nor has any other claim been made against Borealis on that basis. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Rotational moulding works in this way. A quantity of polyethylene in powdered form (the charge) is placed into one of the two halves of a steel mould, which are then clamped together. The mould, which is mounted on the arm of a machine, is introduced into an oven and continuously rotated on two axes at a low speed (typically 4- 8 revs/min), so that all parts of the interior surface of the mould pass through the pool. The charge becomes tacky and then melts in the heat (of up to around 300° C), forming a molten pool. As the powder becomes tacky it starts to stick to the mould. More powder sticks to particles that have become tacky before. As a result a layer of viscous, largely immobile, liquid forms over the entirety of the mould. The wall thickness distribution of the melt is largely determined at this stage. The product has, however, to remain in the oven in order to eliminate the bubbles (trapped pockets of gas) in the melt. After about 20 minutes the mould is removed from the oven and cooled. At this stage crystallization of the melt will occur. The crystallizing melt will shrink away from the mould, the rate of crystallization being dependent, in part, on the rate of cooling. When the polyethylene is sufficiently cool, the tank, as it has now become, is removed from the mould. A very high proportion of rotomoulding production is of tanks of one form or another. </span>

The exposure of an organic material such as polyethylene to heat or light in the presence of atmospheric oxygen causes the formation of free radicals which initiate and sustain the process of oxidation (light induced oxidation being faster because of the higher energy of UV light versus heat). This chemical process, unless arrested, produces changes in the polymer structure which can produce, over time, discolouration, deterioration of mechanical properties (tensile, flexural or impact strength) and the formation of visible defects such as cracks. The fact that a tank is heavily oxidised does not necessarily mean that it will fail. Nor does the fact that a crack develops necessarily mean that it will propagate through the material. Stress concentration, which may result from thin walls, thin/thickness transition (particularly at abrupt changes in section), sharp radii or pigment particles, accentuates the formation and propagation of cracks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Degradation initiates at the weakest chemical bond. As a number of references in the technical literature record, it starts and progresses in the amorphous phase. In polyethylenes the C-H bond will, if a sufficient energy threshold is reached, undergo cleavage. UV and heat in solar light provide energy and that energy may be supplemented by stresses arising at areas of stress concentration. Once bond cleavage has occurred a sequence of reactions causes a fragmentation of the polymer chains (known as chain scission) into shorter oxidised compounds with a worsening of the polymer’s mechanical properties. Scission of the tie molecules makes separation of the crystalline lamellae easier. Fragmentation results in the polymer becoming embrittled. This leads to a reduction of the impact resistance and elongation properties of the plastic. The damaged sites may also establish a new chemical bond between themselves and create a new network of polymer chains, a phenomenon known as cross linking. Research suggests that Polymers in general experience significantly more chain scission than cross linking – something like 8 to 10 times. </p>

The additives react with the chemical intermediates in the process of oxidation (i.e. free radicals and peroxides) and convert them into less harmful products. Antioxidants divide into primary and secondary antioxidants. <span style="font-style:italic">Primary antioxidants</span> decompose free radicals<span style="font-style:italic">; secondary antioxidants</span> reduce peroxides. Combinations of the two are widely used in the stabilisation of polyethylene and generally provide better performance than either type alone. Antioxidants are, however, chemically unstable when exposed to ultra violet light. Other products must therefore be used to prevent the oxidative degradation of polymers resulting from exposure to light and oxygen. </p>

It provided much better performance as a stabilisation system than one based on UV absorbers alone. Further improvements took place and new HALS were promoted for applications requiring longer term weathering resistance than could be achieved with Tinuvin 622. At some stage Ciba-Geigy introduced Tinuvin 783. This was a blended product consisting of 50% Tinuvin 622 and 50% Chimassorb 944, which was intended to provide a UV stabilisation performance comparable to Chimassorb 944 with less of the discolouring that the latter product had displayed. A CIBA brochure included graphs which showed Tinuvin 783 performing better than both of its constituent parts used separately. </p>

They have different effects on the weather resistance characteristics of the final part. Generally speaking pigments provide some protection to the polyethylene substrate by blocking the permeation of harmful ultraviolet light. Carbon black pigment, which blocks light across the whole 300-3,000 nm spectrum, is well known to have a beneficial effect in this respect. But some pigments have a negative effect on the weathering performance of polymers. Thus, some yellow and red organic pigments are unstable to ultra violet light and may actually accelerate degradation during weathering. Some phthalocyanine green pigments contain copper ions which are, to use Mr Halvorsen of Borealis’ phrase, “poisonous” to polyethylene. The effect of any given pigment (i) differs not merely from colour to colour but also from particular pigment to particular pigment; (ii) may be either positive or negative; (iii) and is dependent on the concentration of the pigment and the type and concentration of the light stabiliser (s) employed. </p>

For one thing, the exposure in the WOM is constant; whereas 80 Klys of exposure over the course of a year will be made up of extremely varied degrees of irradiance from moment to moment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">There are other relevant features of the test. It mainly measures the extent to which the polymer breaks down at the surface as it degrades. This is relevant for present purposes because the tanks are said to have failed because of degradation which began on the surface as a result of UV. But the test is very sensitive to defects in the sample which may cause the sample to fail earlier for reasons other than UV degradation e.g. because of bubbles or other deformities as a result of which the sample will be stretched to break more easily than it would otherwise. FTIR testing (see para 759) may be a better method of determining whether there is UV degradation. The standard deviation on the tests is very high. Further, Borecene, as Borealis regularly pointed out, is at a disadvantage compared with other material when the EaB test is used. Its elongation to break before exposure is often much more than that of other materials; it reduces more markedly upon exposure; but, after any given exposure, the EaB which represents 50% of the original EaB figure for Borecene may still be greater than, or at least comparable to, the EaB for other materials. I call this “the EaB test disadvantage point”. </p>

This is a North American system (first devised by Exxon Mobil in the USA). The number in the UV-X rating refers to the number of hours (in thousands) in which the product can last in a WOM operating to US standard ASTM D 2565 -99 before its </p>

This US standard has a radiance level of <span style="font-weight:bold">0.35 W/m2</span> at 340 nm. Thus UV-8 corresponds to 8,000 hours in such a WOM. UV8 is equivalent to irradiation of about 20 GJ/m² or approximately 6 years outside in UK and Eire. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">The OFTEC and CEN standards committees required performance to be measured by reference to exposure to total irradiance measured in GJ/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>. It is possible to convert irradiance in the WOM to an estimated solar irradiance. In this respect the calculations of Kingspan’s expert (Dr Botkin) are done on the basis that irradiance in the 300 – 400 nm range constitutes 6.8% of the global spectral irradiance using the <span style="font-weight:bold">300-2,450</span> nm range of wavelengths, as specified in Table 1 of ISO 4892-1. Accordingly an irradiance of 60 W/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> over the 300 - 400 nm range corresponds to a global solar irradiance of 880 W/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> (60 divided by 6.8%). In order to determine the radiant energy represented by a given exposure in a WOM the global solar irradiance is multiplied by the exposure time in seconds (1 hour being 3,600 seconds). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">The interrelationship between the standards and the concepts they employ is somewhat confusing. The OFTEC Standard, which was in force as a Code to which OFTEC members agreed to subscribe, specified until at least November 2002 that sections from the moulded tank should have an EaB of more than 50% of the initial EaB after exposure to <span style="font-style:italic">“22 GJ/m² (900 Klys)”.</span> It said nothing about 10 years. 900 Klys would represent 10 years of exposure in Northern Europe on a basis of 90 Klys per year. The OFTEC Standard prescribed a test in a WOM of 0.35 W/m² for 10,000 hours. This would not amount to 900 Klys although it would amount to about 22 GJ/m². So the test procedure married up with the 22 GJ/m² figure (about 6 years). Had a WOM of 0.51 W/m² been prescribed it would have been equivalent to 800-900 Klys. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Impact tests are often used to measure the resistance of polyethylenes to impact and may provide useful information and enable a ranking of materials. It was Dr Botkin’s view that such tests are a much less sensitive means of assessing surface degradation resulting from weathering than EaB tests because, in his experience, the tensile impact strength of a polyethylene decreases much more slowly during weathering than does its elongation at break. By contrast both Mr Jamtvedt and Ms Fatnes, and Professor Marshall, regarded tensile impact tests as more reliable because of the sensitivity of EaB tests to sample selection and the high degree of variation. In addition they did not discriminate against Borecene in the manner described in para 70 above. Tensile impact testing was the testing method used by CIBA and preferred by KIWA (the Dutch certification body). </p>

A load measuring instrument can be incorporated in the striker head to measure the loads and deflections at the moment when the striker is in contact with the specimen. This test is commonly carried out when the PE has been held at very low temperatures, e.g. - 40°C (to encourage embrittlement). Kingspan and their experts have not carried out any such tests. A series of tests carried out before 2002 showed that Borecene had superior impact characteristics to non Borecene resins as its increased crystallinity would lead you to expect: see the first </p>

The second paragraph of the section requires the construction tests specified in section 5.2 to be carried out and the first requires a letter of conformity to the material tests from the material supplier. One of the requirements of the material tests (Density) calls for a test on the raw material only. Another (Melt Flow Rate) calls for tests both on the material and the moulded tank. The remaining three require tests to be carried out only on the moulded tank. Since the material supplier will not be the manufacturer of the moulded tank being tested, the question arises as to what the letter of conformity is required to say in respect of tests on a section from the moulded tank. Is it to state (i) that the material supplier expects the material to satisfy the moulded tank tests; (ii) that the supplier warrants that it will; or (iii) that the supplier has carried out the moulded tank tests on a tank of the type under test or, at any rate, some form of moulded tank; or (iv) something else? </p>

In the ordinary course of things the material supplier may, as Borealis did, have the means of manufacturing some form of product – in Borealis’ case a small production machine on which they used, mainly, a square box mould but for which they had moulds with more complex shapes. But it will not know, unless told, the pigment to be used by the manufacturer, the details of the design of the tank or the intended processing conditions and is unlikely to be able to replicate them. It cannot, therefore, testify to compliance (as opposed to an expectation of compliance) unless it has been provided (as Borealis never was) with a section of the moulded tank and has carried out the relevant tests. </p>

The Polymer Development Centre at Athlone (hereafter “Athlone” to avoid confusion with PDC), which was the OFTEC approved Test House, did not at the relevant time have the capability to carry out UV weathering tests. In early 1999 it was thought that a WOM would be available by July. In the event it was not available until after 2003. (Mr Gregg’s evidence was that the test equipment had to be certified by a body called NAMAS<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.00in"> National Measurement Accreditation Service. </p>
	      </authorialNote> to ensure that the correct levels of radiation were delivered by the machine and that there was some problem with the equipment as a result of which Athlone concluded that they could not test in accordance with the European standard). The problem could not be solved by the use of another Test House because there was no OFTEC approved Test House capable of performing the UV weather resistance test.

It was entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">Approved Material Grades and New or Alternative Material Grades</span>”. Its terms are set out in para 114 above. It deals with the situation where a tank type has already been approved by the manufacturer who wishes to make that tank from a new material. In such a case Section 10 required the section 4.2/5.2 tank construction tests to be carried out at Athlone on up to 3 models of tanks. An OFTEC certificate could then be issued once the material supplier provided the manufacturer with a Letter of Conformity in respect of the Raw Material (and the site had an ISO Approved Quality System) This was how Dr McDaid understood the system to work. </p>

Borealis draws attention to the reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">the Raw Material</span>” i.e. the virgin polymer and submits that that means that only the characteristics of the raw material specified in section 5, which do not include the weathering requirement, need be the subject of the letter. I do not regard this as correct. It seems to me that the Standard intended that, in the event of a new material, the same sort of letter of conformity should be given as under section 6 i.e. a letter of conformity to sections 5.1.1. to 5.1.5. In any event it was such a letter which Borealis gave. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">This was an unsatisfactory state of affairs in relation to tanks intended to hold inflammable liquids capable of causing great environmental damage. A material, which the Standard required to be tested on rotomoulded tanks, would, from Oftec’s perspective be approved as an alternative material grade, and a tank made from that material would pass the OFTEC tank type test, even though the material and any tank made with that material had not been tested as the Standard required. This state of affairs resulted in part from the fact that testing for UV resistance is a time consuming and expensive exercise (about £ 3 per hour in 1998 for what might take over a year if the WOM was to replicate 900 Klys) which Kingspan and other tank manufacturers wished to avoid if they could. Moreover the need to carry out such testing could be a significant disincentive to any rotomoulder who contemplated changing material, and thus a problem for anyone who might seek to persuade them to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">I recognise that WOM trials carried out on natural Borecene (or any other new material) will enable some assessment to be made as to how long tanks made from it could be expected to last. The value of any such assessment depends on the nature of the tests and the results. These might well be an inadequate substitute for tests on the tanks as made by the manufacturer in question, which is what the Standard requires, particularly when the pigment and process adopted could make a very substantial difference (in either direction) to the weather resistance of the end product. If a manufacturer wants to know how well his tank will weather he needs to perform weathering tests on pieces cut from a tank made by his process, with his pigment and to his designs. That is what Dr Botkin, Kingspan’s expert, would emphatically have encouraged; and he would have cautioned against selling tanks without testing of those tanks against the OFTEC Standard. </p>

The practice, which had begun before then, of OFTEC treating a letter of conformity as satisfying the test simply continued, in part, no doubt, because WOM testing at Athlone did not become available in July 1999 as expected, although it did at some later date.

He showed them the specification sheet for it and said that the new material must have at least the equivalent properties, a reasonable processing window, an OFTEC letter of conformity and a UV package that would provide a 10 year life span for the oil tanks. He made it clear that the powder would be dry blended and that the tanks were supplied with a 10 year guarantee.

He accepted that he or Mr Shorter said that Borealis’ grades were UV stabilised; and that, had he been asked, he would have indicated that Borecene had the same or better characteristics by comparison with Du Pont 8504.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">What I find likely to have happened is the following. The Borealis representatives said that Borecene was at least as good as the DuPont material, the specification sheet for which Mr Gregg produced, and would give Kingspan a better tank. There was no reference to UV 8 or UV stability beyond the fact that the full title of the material - DuPont 8504 UV8D - is on the sheet. The sheet contains no reference in the specification to the UV properties of the grade. I regard it as unlikely that, when referring to DuPont’s material, reference was made to its full title. Mr Wood, who knew the Du Pont material as DuPont 8504, would not have done so. Mr Gregg did not say that the material had to be UV8, or that he wanted a UV package to provide a 10 year life span; nor was there any discussion about the significance of UV 8 or about UV resistance or stability. Mr Gregg’s evidence was that at this time he did not know what the UV 8 designation meant although at some later stage he came to understand that it referred to 8,000 hours in, he assumed, a WOM of some sort. Nor did he know that tanks could degrade on account of UV light. Even in October 2002 the UV-X rating system was very new to Dr McDaid, whose evidence was that Borealis never mentioned to her that Borecene contained a UV 8 package. Borealis did not use the UV system in its literature or that nomenclature in relation to their UV packages. </p>

Kingspan points out that CIBA’s recommendation expressly extended to LLDPE (i.e. linear low density polyethylene products). Since Ziegler Natta was an LLDPE, and Borealis treated the stabiliser test results for Ziegler Natta products as relevant to Borecene grades (see, for example, Borealis treatment of the Series E Cytec results – paras 2545 below), the recommendation was relevant to Borecene. I agree. Professor Malatesta said that, in his experience, stabiliser suppliers would exaggerate the stabiliser needed because it was in their commercial interests to do so. Kingspan invite me to treat this as pure speculation. I do not doubt that such suppliers have no incentive to minimise the amount of stabiliser necessary and an incentive to err on the higher side of caution. Whether any particular recommendation is more than necessary can only be determined by some empirical testing. </p>

On 27 August 1996 Mr Shorter, then of Borealis, visited Portadown where Mr Gregg told him that some improvement, predominantly in reduced shot weight, had been witnessed. No UV testing was involved. Kingspan did not have the facilities for such testing. Mr Gregg said at the visit that “<span style="font-style:italic">the yes/no criteria [sic] is the passing of the OFTEC standard</span>”.

The fact that UV stabiliser was an expensive additive was a recurring theme as was a concern that the price of Borecene was making Borecene uncompetitive. It is also clear that Borealis was looking for a stabiliser package which would deliver 10 years of UV stability. Ms Fatnes’ evidence was that the reference to 10 years lifetime was a general statement not directed at oil tanks. But, even if general, it must surely have included them, not least because of the 10 year reference in the prEN standard and what appears in the next paragraph. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">The Borecene tested had Tinuvin 622 at a concentration of 2,500 ppm. As can be seen, both unpigmented Borecenes failed the test after 2,000 hours by which time their EaB was &lt;50%. ME 8167 and 8169 were general purpose grades, not intended for a market with a high UV requirement. Since there was no result at 2,000 hours for the ZN ME 8152 it is not possible to tell whether it had failed by then; although taking the figures on a linear basis it probably had not. At 3,000 hours Borecene performed worse in terms of the percentage of the original EaB percentage than ME 8152, but there was no great difference in terms of the EaB percentages at 3,000 hours. These figures illustrate the EaB test disadvantage point. No tests were carried out on ME 8160/1 – which was to become RM 8402/3. At 3,000 hours the black pigmented Borecenes retained their original EaB and the black pigmented ZN retained 79% of the original. Black pigment (usually compounded) has always been recognised as giving a high degree of UV protection. </p>

They showed that the green pigment provided much greater protection than natural polymer for both Borecene and ZN; but also that green pigmented Borecene ME 8169 with Tinuvin 622 at 2,500 ppm was likely to be insufficient to satisfy the EaB test after 10,000 hours in a WOM of 0.35 W/m². Despite this result, a further IPS for ME8160 was issued in 1998, again showing a target concentration of Tinuvin 622 of 1,500ppm. </p>

The conclusion of the tests, on specimens with the same characteristics as those used in the artificial weathering tests (i.e. as in Specimens, B, E, H, I, K and L) was that after 1 year of Florida exposure no differentiation could be made between the different stabiliser systems and both metallocene and traditional polymers were still doing well. </p>

But in cross examination, when presented with Dr McDaid’s notes of the meeting, which make no mention of UV or UV8 or DuPont 8504, he accepted that the likelihood was that he had not said this. Cost was also raised, Mr Wood saying that Kingspan should be paying a premium for Borecene as it was a premium material and would lead to savings in processing time and shot weights. </p>

He had learnt this from Ms Fatnes, who had told him that Borecene was as good as, if not better than, the Ziegler Natta grades. There was however no discussion about UV or about Borecene having a UV 8 capability.

This is because the reference numbers for the Borecene are the “old” numbers (ME 8169 became RM 8343, ME 8161 became RM 8403) and because in an e-mail of 6 November 2000 (which Kingspan suggests is likely to have been in reply to Ms Fatnes’ email of 30 October 2000) Mr Didrichsen confirmed that the samples for ME 8161 and 8169 were placed in the WOM on 6 July 1999 i.e. before the change which was due to take place on 1.9.99, if possible but which appears to have taken place, so far as production was concerned, from 1 November 1999: see Ms Fatnes email of 17.11.99. If so the ME 8152 ZN would have been stabilised with Tinuvin 622 at 2,500 ppm as would the ME 8169 with the ME 8161 having 1,500 ppm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">I think this is unlikely. The evidence is confusing (and Ms Fatnes was confused at the time – see her email of 3 November 2000). But Mr Didrichsen’s email of 6 November 2000 (and an earlier one of 19 October 2000) indicates that in October 2000 there was more than one set of tests going on. The 6 November 2000 email refers to ME 8167, 8161 and 8169 as having been placed in the WOM on 5 July 1999. The email of 19 October 2000 refers to ME 8169, 8161, and 8167 having been exposed for 7,500 hours (far less than exposure from 5 July 1999) and the results so far as showing no significant reduction in EaB. Whatever these emails are referring to, it cannot, in the case of ME 8161 (=RM 8403), be the tests whose results appear as Series G for two reasons: (a) the Series G results only went to 3,000 hours; and (b) the results showed at 3,000 hours a significant reduction in EaB. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Both emails also refer to the exposure of ME 8169/RM 8343 with a new UV package. The email of 6 November refers to that exposure starting on 15 Jan 2000. The email of 19 October 2000 refers to ME 8169 with new UV packages (sic) having spent 5,000 hours in the WOM and adds: “<span style="font-style:italic">I believe we’ll wait until we get to 7,500 hours before we begin tests because there is little testing material</span>.” This cannot be a reference to the Series G tests because they only went to, and were reported as at, 3,000 hours.

The Series H tests on ME 8169, 8161 and 8167 cannot be the tests referred to in the email of 6 November 2000 as having begun in a WOM in 5 July 1999. By October 2000 about 11,000 hours would have elapsed, not 7,500. They are, however, likely to be the tests started on 15 January 2000, including the test on ME 8169 with the new UV package in compression moulded samples referred to in that email, which as at the end of October would recently have completed 7,500 hours. If, in fact, the tests were on Borecene with the “old” package, the new package could be expected to produce even better results. </p>

He indicated that Borealis could consider 5 and 10K MT per annum of Borecene natural pellet, all Kingspan’s needs for compounded black, and possibly oil tank green for the second half of the year. He quoted prices for the first quarter. At some stage in late 2001 Kingspan decided to use RM 8402 across the group. The decision to purchase was a commercial decision made by Mr Rusk, who acted on the recommendation of PDC who, in the person of Mr Gregg, felt able to recommend it because (a) it had been said by Borealis to be suitable for oil storage tanks; (b) Borecene had been passed by Athlone; (c) Borealis had provided a certificate of conformity; and (d) Dr McDaid had carried out trials. It began to be delivered in production volumes in early 2002. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">A number of other things were apparent from this email. Firstly, the recommendation for 10 years was given on the footing that the green pigment selected would double the weatherability and 10 years would be the limit beyond which black was recommended. Second, Borealis expressed themselves as having been struggling with their WOMs and UV testing for a long time with documentation not on the level they would like to see. That was an indication that Borealis did not have a sizeable body of recorded data bearing on the question of weatherability and was given on the basis of limited information. Third, the WOM EaB results on natural Borecene were expressed as giving a lifetime of 4,000 hours representing 250 Kly (erroneously as it happens – the correct figure beings about 300 – 350 Kly). The WOM tensile impact results were expressed as giving a lifetime of 6,000 hours which in a Borealis WOM would be something like 500 Klys. 22 GJ/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> is about 500 Klys. 34 GJ/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> is about 800 Klys. This figures show the effect which the pigment would need to have depending on the figure for natural Borecene from which you start and the Kly figure which you wish to replicate in a WOM.</p>

Borealis was trying to help Kingspan in their discussions/negotiations with KIWA, which was showing signs of wanting to set a national standard of its own, despite the proposed European one. On 6 December 2001 Dr McDaid sent Ms Fatnes the latest draft of prEN13341, which she asked to be kept confidential, together with extracts from the proposed Dutch standard. She pointed out that KIWA wanted to test for UV stability over a shorter period than the European standard i.e. for the equivalent of 5 years exposure in a moderate climate and that KIWA also insisted that tensile impact was a superior test for detecting surface degradation. She also said that moulded samples of pigmented (tank green) RM 8402 and a powder sample would be shipped to Borealis that day. </p>

He is the contact, or one of the contacts, referred to in the 27 August email. In late August 2002 Mr Gregg engaged him to test the materials supplied by different suppliers to Kingspan to determine the UV additives/absorbers used by them. On 2 September 2002 Mr Shorter emailed Mr Gregg to confirm the upshot of a telephone conversation between them that day, namely that Mr Gregg would forward samples to be tested for UV additive package and Mr Shorter would prepare a technical report comparing their performance with that of a typical UV package. Mr Shorter suggested that the timing was right for a company like Kingspan actively to specify to their supplier what performance was required in terms of UV resistance.

I am not convinced that much can be read into this. Mr Borve may simply have been indicating that 1,800ppm was not abnormally low. Stabiliser concentrations have a target and a max/min figure. The range from min to max may be 4-500 ppm. Borealis aimed always to be above the target. In those circumstances 1,800 ppm could be regarded as not abnormal if the target was 1,300 ppm, even though it is 500ppm in excess. It is also not clear what the stabiliser was. </p>

In the event, in October a programme of investigation was worked on between Balmoral (Mr Joyce) and Borealis (Mr Webster and Mr Borve) at an ARM conference in Toronto. Balmoral tanks were failing in substantial numbers after a relatively short time, such that inadequate UV resistance could not be the cause. On that account Borealis decided not to make UV a central feature of their investigation. </p>

He observed that the specimen type defined in prEN13341 (i.e. Sample B) was expected to reach the limiting value of 50% at less than 7,000 hours rather than the 10,000 hours required by that standard<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="47">

Firstly, when Borealis first approached Tyrrel/Plashapes in the early 1990’s with the intention of selling them material they were advised that amongst other properties the minimum UV performance would have to be based on Du Pont 8504 UV8D which we were using at that time, (see attached specification sheet). Secondly, trials were conducted at Tyrrel Tanks in 1996 and 1997 when the subject of the UV package was discussed. On both occasions Borealis confirmed the use of a UV 8 package. Thirdly, in a recent meeting with Fred Rusk at Titan Environmental Bob Wood and John Webster when asked about the UV package in RM8402, claimed it was UV8.” </span></p>

He observed that a UV 8 level would be achieved by a typical formulation based on, e.g., 2,000 ppm of Tinuvin 783 and a UV 4 performance would result from using 800-1,000 ppm. He expressed the view that the level analysed in the Borecene sample indicated a performance below UV 4. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Ms Fatnes replied to Mr Rusk’s letter on <span style="font-weight:bold">14 November</span>. She said that “UV testing” and “UV performance” were not easy and straightforward tests; that a number of factors influenced the results such as the material and its stabilisers, the preparation of the test piece (compression moulding, rotational moulding etc.), the preparation of the dogbone for the test, the WOM used, the temperature and humidity in the test chamber, and the tests used (EaB, tensile strength, tensile impact etc.). As a result of becoming increasingly aware of this Borealis had tried to reduce the variation in the test results and to understand the different factors; and had chosen to rely a lot on advice and test results from additive suppliers. Based on that information the UV package chosen “<span style="font-style:italic">was expected to meet the requirements to UV performance</span>”. Internal tests at Borealis had not been able to fully show this and “<span style="font-style:italic">therefore we have done work to clarify the reasons behind</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">She explained that the letter of conformity had been made “<span style="font-style:italic">to the best of our knowledge and on the following arguments in lack of real data</span>”: ME 8152 (which was the general purpose ZN) had been used earlier and conformed with OFTEC. The UV package in all Borecene grades had been improved. Supplier information indicated that, based on their data, the package would be sufficient to give the necessary UV protection. Further the right type of green pigment would boost UV performance. The DuPont 8504 material was “<span style="font-style:italic">not in detail known to us</span>”. The UV 8 performance indication from DuPont was very probably based on compression moulded samples (which, she said, would tend to give better results than samples which were just rotationally moulded). </p>

Its effect was to withhold the fact that the tests had been carried out using Tinuvin 783 at a concentration of 1,750ppm, rather than the concentration in fact used in RM8402, i.e. 1,300ppm. </p>

Mr Borve was one of the team that decided on this change. He could not say why it was made. He, himself, was not aware of the Series J/KIWA test results that had been carried out on green samples (see para 343 above) and did not become aware until these proceedings. I find this surprising. Mr Borve accepted that, if he had known these results, he would not have felt able to make the statements in the presentation about Borecene, with “normal” amounts of UV stabiliser and a “normal” pigment having no problem lasting 10 years outdoors in central Europe (see para 338) without looking deeper into it. </p>

(It is not clear whether he was taking pigment into account or speaking only of natural polymer). He acknowledged that pigments could have a negative as well as a positive effect on the UV package and felt that the weathering test in the European standard was not good for rotational moulders because it required the samples to be compression moulded from the tank which meant they would undergo further heat degradation. In his view the test should be done on 3 mm rotomoulded plaques. He said that CIBA had carried out numerous short term tests to determine if any could be used to predict results from 10,000 hours weathering test but the results could not be correlated and were unreliab<span style="font-size:10pt">le. </span>An action plan was agreed involving, inter alia, his giving an opinion on each company's pigments and thereafter confirming the suitability of a Tinuvin 783 package for each material. </p>

These results, which were for EaB and Tensile Impact strength, were performed using the Cytec WOM of 0.35 W/m². The results went up to 7,250 hours corresponding to no more than about 5 – 5.5 years of exposure in Northern Europe. Six formulations were tested. Formulation 1 (the reference resin, being the formulation used in RM 7402 incorporating 1,500 ppm Tinuvin 783) had fallen to 61% of its initial EaB value after 7,250 hours. That indicated that <span style="font-style:italic">natural</span> Borecene, even with an increase in concentration from 1,300ppm (the RM8402 formulation) to 1,500ppm (the RM 7402 formulation), was – on the assumption that figures from WOM tests could be directly related to actual performance - unlikely to provide protection against 10 years of weathering in Northern Europe. </p>

Carbon black was added to 8 of the 9 specimens, and tests were done on those specimens with varying concentrations of carbon black and different amounts of Tinuvin 783 stabiliser or none at all. The reference resin (sample 1) was left in its natural form, but stabilised with Tinuvin 783 at a concentration of 1,500 ppm (i.e. as per the RM 7402 supplied to Kingspan). EaB measurements were taken after 2,000 hours and 16,600 hours. The EAB value of sample 1 had fallen by 39% after 2,000 hours. Both Mr Ervik and Mr Halvorsen suggested that this was because the stabiliser was added in an unsophisticated and possibly defective extruder in the laboratory where the stabiliser would be exposed to air rather than in the course of commercial production. The other samples had reductions in EaB of only between 1 and 27% even after 16,600 hours. </p>

In deciding what was being represented it is necessary to take into account a number of matters. First, the statements relate to natural Borecene. They say nothing about the effect of pigment or the moulded tank. Secondly the brochures and specification sheets were for general use, covering a large range of possible uses, rather than relating to any specific requirement of longevity, such as 10 years. Thirdly, the brochures which Kingspan received veered between “<span style="font-style:italic">fully UV stabilised</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">UV stabilised</span>”. A reasonable reader who had received all the brochures, as PDC had, would wonder what the difference was. Fourthly, both expressions are unquantified and imprecise and beg the question, at any rate from an expert rotomoulder, as to what exactly the phrase signified, which such a representee could reasonably be expected to ask. Kingspan never asked what exactly “<span style="font-style:italic">fully UV stabilised</span>”/“<span style="font-style:italic">UV stabilised</span>” meant. What they did was to ask for details of UV weatherability when they sought the letter of conformity in 1999 and when Dr McDaid emailed Ms Fatnes on 13 November 2001. </p>

Borealis did not know what pigment Kingspan used (other than that it was green, of which there are many varieties with different effects on UV resistance which may, in some cases, be prejudicial). Kingspan was reluctant to identify its pigment supplier. Dr McDaid of PDC knew by 2000 at the latest that pigments could improve weatherability, but that some could accelerate the degradation process: as was stated in an article on the Borealis website entitled <span style="font-style:italic">“UV stabilisers</span>”, which Dr McDaid had seen. </p>

Kingspan was entitled to understand from the letter that Borealis had a reasonable basis for it. At the same time the representation had to be understood in light of the facts (a) that it assumed good manufacturing process; (b) that it was not, as Kingspan knew, based on any actual test of Kingspan’s own tanks with whatever pigment, process and designs they had been manufactured; and (c) it was expressed as an expectation not an advice. </p>

I regard it as implicit in that recommendation, that there was a reasonable basis for expecting a 5 year lifetime for tanks made from natural Borecene and 10 for tanks made from green coloured Borecene. That representation was qualified by the observation that it was a recommendation made on the basis of a level of documentation which was less than Borealis would like to see – it would, therefore, need to be considered with some caution. It was not a representation that Borecene would have those lifetimes. Further, in respect of green pigmented Borecene it was an indication as to the potential doubling effect of a pigment, which the moulder would have to select and apply, as opposed to the natural Borecene which was all that Borealis supplied. </p>

Kingspan themselves have manufactured tens of thousands of tanks that have not failed, even allowing for tanks that may have failed but whose failure has not been reported. Borecene has been used to manufacture tanks for use externally in, inter alia, Norway and the Philippines, as well as in other applications such as boats and tractor roofs. It was used successfully by firms such as JFC, a small rotational moulder in Ireland, who used RM 8343 for the manufacture of oil tanks; and by Uponor, a large Swedish firm for pipe systems and also for very large green tanks for those systems. It appears to have been used “successfully” in UV terms by Balmoral in the sense that, whatever caused those tanks to fail, it was not inadequate UV resistance. Professors Marshall and Malatesta and Dr Nugent all regarded it as suitable for rotomoulding oil tanks for external use. Dr Botkin accepted that it was possible to make tanks from Borecene lasting 10 years at any rate if you increased the thickness. </p>

The basis for the figures in the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2001 email appears from the material attached to it. The 4,000 hours figure is based on EaB testing of ME 8169 (RM 8343) from the 30 October 2000 Series G tests, where the EaB test was failed by 3,000 hours, and the Series H Polimoon tests where the samples experienced practically no reduction in EaB even after 7,500 hours. 4,000 hours was, accordingly, fairly low down on the spectrum. The results for ME 8161/RM8403 in the two series also provided support for an expected lifetime of 4,000 hours. </p>

The EaB test is a severe one and, to some extent, biased against Borecene because of the EaB test disadvantage point. A material which fails the EaB test is, as Dr Botkin accepted, likely to have a significant proportion of its mechanical properties intact. Failure of the test is, for the reasons explained in paras 67 - 71 above, not a reliable indicator of when a material will actually fail. In addition the Polimoon Cipax results were indicative of a UV 14 performance rating for RM 8402. This would amount to about 10 years on <span style="font-style:italic">natural </span>Borecene. The use of a 4,000 hours figure involved a substantial reduction from that figure. </p>

Even if failure occurred at 3,500 hours the improvement resulting from green pigment was over double. If at 4,000 hours the improvement was nearly 3 times. </p>

If the 2,760 ppm sample (Ref 70355) is assumed to have had the same starting figure (i.e.1,450%) for EaB as the 1,415 ppm (Ref 70354) the EaB at 2,500 hours was 55% in the former and 62% in the latter.

Taken at face value the results indicate that natural Borecene could easily pass not only the 22 GJ/m² test but also the 37.6 and 34 GJ/m² tests. If, as Kingspan contended, the tests were carried out on the old 8403 package (1,500 ppm of Tinuvin 622, and not 1,300 ppm of Tinuvin 783), the results were even better. </p>

Series C results showed how much Tinuvin 783 was an improvement on Tinuvin 622. The Series D results for ME 8160 (RM 8402) indicated failure in EaB terms at above 10 GJ/m².

An email from Mr Atterbury of Athlone of 5 February 2002 does not list Borecene made tanks as amongst those approved for Tyrell by Athlone. No testing report has been produced and it seems to me unlikely that any such report, which would be readily discoverable, was ever made. The factory witnesses from Rom and GSP had no recollection of tanks being sent to Athlone for testing.

Mr Rusk, who made the decision to purchase Borecene and who was not a technical person, said that he did so on three bases (a) price; (b) availability and (c) the ability of Kingspan to market their tanks as being OFTEC approved. He was not, therefore, concerned with the accuracy or otherwise of the letter of conformity or anything that was said about the performance of Borecene. Moreover both Dr McDaid and Mr Gregg said that they did not communicate with Mr Rusk to tell him of the various properties of Borecene. So the information which is said to amount to a misrepresentation was given to those who did not decide to purchase, and the man who did decide could not and did not rely on information which he was not told about. </p>

If, absent a particular representation, they would have advised against the purchase of Borecene, Kingspan, in the form of all the claimants, may properly be regarded as having relied on the representation, once given. Further the fact that Mr Rusk wished to be satisfied as to the ability of the claimants to market their tanks as being OFTEC approved itself shows that, if no letter of conformity of any kind had been provided when asked, of which he would be likely to have been informed, the purchases would probably not have gone ahead. </p>

Ms Fatnes was also entitled to take into account as supporting that view the fact that Kingspan’s green ZN tanks had survived for more than 10 years without incident so far as weathering was concerned. </p>

It contained important information about the weatherability of Borecene, given in email as opposed to brochure form. If Borealis had said they had no information about 10-25 year weatherability, or were not prepared to give what information they had, that would probably have raised questions about the wisdom of purchasing Borecene. At this stage Kingspan was already minded to purchase Borecene.

A comparison between Specimen E and Specimen I, the former with 2,500 ppm Tinuvin 622, which failed at 4,600 hours and the latter with 2,500 ppm Tinuvin 783 which had not failed at 7,000 hours showed Tinuvin 783 to be at least 52% better: how much better would depend on when Specimen I actually failed. That was a comparison between different stabilisers in the same Borecene. A comparison between Specimen I and Specimen L, the ZN, showed Tinuvin 783 to be at least 45% better. Since the RM 8402 UV package was said to double Borecene lifetime by comparison with ME 8152 that was, prima facie, the appropriate comparison (although the fourth slide made clear that the comparison in it was with RM 8343).</p>

However, as an additional complication, it is probably the case that UV performance is proportional to the square root of the concentration with the result (see paragraph 454 above) that, on the Series C results (Specimens I and E) 1,300 ppm Tinuvin 783 could be expected to give <span style="font-style:italic">equivalent</span> performance to 3,000 ppm of Tinuvin 622. It would not however, on those results, give <span style="font-style:italic">double</span> the performance of 2,500 ppm Tinuvin 622. It might be doubly efficacious as a stabiliser; so that having a lesser amount of stabiliser produced the same or a somewhat better result; but that would not mean that the grade (with a lesser amount) was twice as good.</p>

By contrast two specimens from an earlier test with Tinuvin 622 at 2,500 ppm on ME 8167 and ME 8169 (both Borecenes) had each failed at 2,500 hours at 300% which was 29% of the original.

Prima facie, the accuracy of the statement that the letter of conformity was given on the basis that the RM 8402 package was improved to double the lifetime falls to be determined as at that date. I have come to the conclusion that Borealis did not have reasonable grounds to make that statement. It was put forward on the basis of the Series C results which, once it is appreciated that Specimen B was probably defective, do not support the proposition. The Series D results do provide some support but not enough, in my judgement, to make it reasonable to make the statement. The comparison is between different tests and between stabilisers in different Borecenes.</p>

Further, the import of doubling the lifetime of ME 8152 is unclear without knowing what was taken as the original lifetime and, whatever exactly it signified, and the sentence, which was part of an explanation for how the 1999 Letter of Conformity came to be signed, cannot have been understood as meaning that the expected lifetime for Borecene was other than as stated in the recommendation contained in the earlier and operative part of the email.

They required payment to be made to Borealis Denmark by payment into a bank account in London, with remittance advices to be sent to Borealis Belgium. Clause 8 of the general terms stated that the terms were governed by the law of the country where ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Borealis</span>’ is domiciled. ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Borealis</span>’ is defined in the introductory wording of the general terms as ‘<span style="font-style:italic">the Borealis entity given in the front page</span>.’ Both Borealis UK and Borealis Denmark are referred to on the front page. The references to the place of dispatch being Great Britain, the fact that Borealis’ VAT number is a GB VAT number, and the fact that payment is required to be made to a London bank together indicate that the relevant Borealis entity on the front page is Borealis UK. Further, Borealis’ own position – see Borealis’ “<span style="font-style:italic">Singles Sales Company Project”</span> document - was that it was making “<span style="font-style:italic">domestic sales</span>” and was invoicing the customer “<span style="font-style:italic">under a local domestic VAT regime</span>”. In addition the contact address for Borealis Denmark is given as Borealis House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire. </p>

Since, on his own evidence, he was not someone who addressed himself to the question as to which Borealis entity Kingspan was contracting with, it is possible that he received the letters but paid no attention to them; or that he has forgotten them; or that they were never shown to him (they are addressed “<span style="font-style:italic">Dear Business Partner</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">Dear Sirs</span>”) and went unnoticed by whoever in fact received them.

The letter was drafted by an Italian gentleman and the draft was emailed from Borealis’ then head office in Copenhagen to 14 sales offices in Europe. Each office was then to print out copies and type out envelopes for sending to customers on their computer master data base. Mr Webster thought that despatch would have been by courier. Mr Wood gave evidence that he sent the letters to Kingspan amongst others; but I have some doubts as to his recollection of events well over a decade on; and I note that in his first witness statement he described in some detail his recollection of his involvement at the meeting on 2 and 3 December 2002, which, in fact, he did not attend. Mr Webster, who was then working in Copenhagen, never saw the actual signed letters with their addressees’ names on. At most he ticked names off on a list in his notebook on the basis of information from Mr Wood. No such list has survived. </p>

What is not clear to me is whether and, if so, why Kingspan paid Borealis Belgium (as I assume but do not know that they did). I suspect that they will have done so because the invoices (which do not appear to be in the documentation) for this period directed them to do so. </p>

So far as the effect of the term is concerned, it does not seem to me material that Danish law differs from English law in that (a) it has no tort of misrepresentation and (b) section 36 of the Danish Contracts Act provides significantly lesser opportunity to invalidate limiting provisions. Any non English legal system could reasonably be expected to have different provisions so far as those topics are concerned. The differences between the two systems are not so egregious as to call for special notice. The absence of a tort of misrepresentation is of limited significance given that Danish law could give effect, in appropriate circumstances, to a representation as defining the contractual obligation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Some reliance was placed by Kingspan on the fact that the new terms were commended to those affected by them. Thus the letters of November 1998, sent to customers in several different countries, referred to the terms as “<span style="font-style:italic">even more customer oriented and simplified</span>”. As I have already held, it is not established that Kingspan received this letter and Kingspan says it did not. But, even if it did, this was not a statement about the comparative position under different local laws. It was the evidence of Mr Bierfreund, Borealis’ Danish law expert, which I accept, that, in the case of sophisticated commercial entities, the Danish Court would not disapply a term providing for Danish law which was unambiguous, even if generalised statements were made comparing the new terms, and, in particular the new choice of law, favourably to the old. It would expect the party concerned to make the appropriate investigations. So would I. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">I would add three observations. First, as no one from Kingspan addressed their mind to the content of the invoices other than the amount and the payee, no one addressed his/her mind to the impact of the terms and conditions or the identity of the contracting party. Mr Rusk’s evidence was that he did not have a conscious thought as to whom he was dealing with – “<span style="font-style:italic">it was just Borealis</span>” via Bob Wood; and that “<span style="font-style:italic">never once during my whole time did I ever think that terms and conditions were anything to do with me</span>”. About twice a year Mr Peter Johnston, the financial director of Kingspan was involved in authorising payment to Borealis Denmark in respect of Borecene, if Mr Rusk or Mr McNamee, Titan’s financial controller, was not around. He did not consider the detail of the invoices or the terms and conditions and was not passed any other relevant correspondence. He regarded it as Mr Rusk’s job to bring any issue about terms to the attention of senior managers. </p>

The evidence of Mr Jan Lindh, who was in the late 1990s Vice President of the Group Finance Department and then Director of Financial Shared Services, was that Borealis chose the law and jurisdiction of the single selling party because it was a logical thing to do. I find this neither surprising nor unreasonable. Borealis was changing to a single contracting party supplying customers in different European countries. It made sense to adopt a single law and jurisdiction and to choose that of the seller and parent of the Group. </p>

Even contracts such as those may not come within section 26 (4) (a), if it is given a literal construction. Take the case where there is a string of CIF sales and the last one is made when the vessel is within the territory of the State where the cargo is to be discharged. On one view the goods are not then in the course of carriage from one State to another. Such a view is inappropriate.

It may be that all the goods the subject of the former invoices came via Gainsborough, although the evidence of Mr Wood, Mr Webster and Mr Lindh, to the effect that the preponderance of deliveries were <span style="font-style:italic">direct</span> raises doubt as to whether this was always so. That does not, however, mean that the goods were in Great Britain when the contracts were made and Mr Wood’s evidence, which was not challenged, is directly to the contrary. Mr Lindh explained that, if the place of despatch was recorded as Great Britain, the producing company would have been the importer, the goods would have been taken into the warehouse, and the sale by the producing company to Borealis Demark would occur “<span style="font-style:italic">one theoretical second</span>” before delivery to Kingspan. If the goods went direct, then Borealis Denmark would be the importer, under its VAT number, and property would pass to it before the goods came into the UK. </p>

Although the word “<span style="font-style:italic">unreasonable</span>” is used, and although the section gives the court a wide discretion, in the exercise of which the court can take account of whatever it thinks relevant including the loss suffered by the innocent party and the effect of any limitation of liability, the experts agree that, in the case of a commercial contract, a claimant would in practice be likely to have to show that the clause was grossly unfair. There are very few commercial contract cases in which section 36 has been successfully invoked. The experts were only aware of two examples which were on markedly different facts which appear to amount to gross unfairness. By contrast there are several cases where the section has been unsuccessfully invoked. I note, however, that Danish courts are not bound by the doctrine of precedent and that section 36 was described by Mr Madsen as a “<span style="font-style:italic">dynamic standard</span>” which evolved all the time. </p>

The contracts were commercial agreements made between large commercial concerns with substantial bargaining power. Mr Rusk expected raw material suppliers to supply on their standard terms and conditions as was widespread practice in the industry. The terms on which Borealis was prepared to do business were plain to see and referred to and contained in every invoice. They were never objected to. The limitations on liability contained in the contracts were advantageous to Borealis; but that was not without benefit to Kingspan since an inability to limit would be likely to increase prices. Borealis could reasonably expect the courts to give effect to those terms, subject to any applicable statutory constraint. In fact, since the contracts are international supply contracts, they would not have been subject to the requirements of reasonableness. I note also that GSP itself had terms and conditions which purported to exclude liability for any loss of profit or for consequential or special loss or damage (cl 5) and any express or implied conditions, warranty or statement as to the quality of the goods or their fitness for purpose. </p>

Insofar as any representations were made by Borealis UK, section 2 is inapplicable because Borealis UK was not the contracting party and the claimants could only rely on negligent misstatement if they could establish an assumption of responsibility by Borealis UK which, in my judgement, they cannot. </p>

(The position is or may be different if there is fraud but that is not alleged). But it allows the court to take into account a much wider range of factors than are permissible in English law, in determining whether goods supplied are conforming. These may include, but are not limited to, what English law would characterise as misrepresentations. Such misrepresentations may establish what is required if the goods are to be regarded as conforming to the contract. </p>

The defects, if there were any, arose in Norway but their effect was only significant upon the delivery of the product in Northern Ireland or Eire. The loss and damage may be said to have been suffered in the UK and Eire where the claimants had to make payments by way of reparation and where their loss of profits arose. In my view the most significant element is the reliance on the misrepresentations and the second most significant element is the communication to the representees. These took place in Northern Ireland. Accordingly the general rule would make English the proper law. </p>

The claimants are incorporated in Northern Ireland and Eire. The defendants acted though Borealis UK, an English company. The representations were made and relied on in the UK. They induced the purchase of material which was never made in nor shipped from Denmark. None of the events giving rise to the claim for misrepresentation occurred in Denmark. Clause 8 referred only to the General Terms being governed by the law of Borealis’ domicile, when it could easily have specified that the relationship and/or any pre-contractual representations should be so governed. There is nothing novel in applying different laws in relation to different although related causes of action: <span style="font-weight:bold">Base Metal Trading Ltd v Shamurin</span> [2005] 1 WLR 1157. In that case claims by a company against a director in respect of speculative trading were treated by the Court of Appeal (without enthusiasm and under the law prior to the 1995 Act) as subject to Russian law in respect of the tortious, and Guernsey law in respect of the equitable, claims. </p>

The parties have agreed that the terms are to be governed by that law. The terms themselves, and in particular para 6.4 (which deals with Borealis’ accumulated liability “<span style="font-style:italic">for whatever reason</span>”), display an intention that the entirety of the parties’ relations with regard to the contracts should be governed by the terms. It would be irrational for a contractual claim e.g. for lack of fitness for purpose to be subject to Danish law and governed by the terms when a parallel claim based on a misrepresentation (express or implied) or a negligent misstatement as to fitness was subject to a different law. The appropriate law governing the effect, if any, of any misrepresentation, must be the law of the contract itself. </p>

When it arrived in South Korea it was discharged without production of the bills of lading against a letter of indemnity and later released to Huron. Trafigura received payment under a letter of credit from Kookmin, through a London advising bank, on presentation by Trafigura of documents including the letter of indemnity. Kookmin asked for the original bills. Trafigura’s Singapore office took the original bills, thought to be discrepant, to the Singapore office of the vessel’s managers and obtained new bills which conformed to the Letter of Credit but which were endorsed “<span style="font-style:italic">voyage accomplished null and void</span>”. These were forwarded to Kookmin. Kookmin claimed in Korea that Trafigura’s acts in discharging the cargo to Huron, returning the original bills and clausing the substitute bills were tortious under Korean law because they deprived Kookmin of any security interest and any right to claim against the carrier. Trafigura started proceedings in England against Kookmin for a declaration that it did not undertake or represent that it would provide the original bills of lading to Kookmin. Kookmin challenged the jurisdiction of the court. That challenge failed. A preliminary issue was then ordered as to the law governing Kookmin’s tortious claim against Trafigura. </p>

But he went on to hold that one of the factors “<span style="font-style:italic">relating to the parties</span>” was the law that the parties had expressly or impliedly chosen to govern their pre-existing contractual relationship which was said to give rise to the events constituting the alleged tort. The most important connecting factor in the case was the letter of credit contract which was governed by English law. The second was the fact that all but one of the relevant contractual relationships between the parties were governed by English law. (These were, in addition to the letter of credit contract, the relationship between the issuing bank and the advising bank; the underlying sale contract; the charterparty - but not the first set of Bills; and the Letter of Indemnity).

Each of the policies was 100% reinsured in the London Market. MCB discovered a large scale fraud and claimed in Mauritius under the insurance policies.

In <span style="font-weight:bold">Trafigura</span> the fact that most of the relevant contractual relationships were governed by English law led to the law applicable to the tort claim being that of England. In <span style="font-weight:bold">Dornoch</span> the fact that the only relevant contract was (on an obiter assumption) governed by Mauritian law and that the fraudulent representations were made in order to induce the Reinsurers to enter into it was said to have nothing to do with MCB’s tort. Mr Fenwick submitted that the material difference between the two cases was that, in the former, English law had been chosen to cover most of the contracts and the events said to give rise to liability had arisen out of the matrix of those contractual relationships, whereas in<span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">Dornoch</span>, the representations preceded the contract. I am not convinced that that makes the relevant events materially less connected to the contract. It is, however, important to note that the tort under consideration in <span style="font-weight:bold">Dornoch</span> was the tort of MCB, which had no contractual relationship with the Reinsurers. Accordingly there never was any agreement on its part on the application of Mauritian law for any purpose. </p>

The contracts in question are international supply contracts made between business enterprises of comparable bargaining power. They are not consumer contracts nor were the claimants tricked into entering into them on these terms. When businesses of that character reach agreement they do so as a result of statements and/or assurances made and contractual documentation sent, exchanged or signed. English law distinguishes between (a) factual statements that induce the contracts; (b) contractual terms; and (c) collateral undertakings, and applies different rules to each. Other laws have different classifications. Given that these statements, terms and undertakings are the product of the same process which leads to the eventual contract it is substantially more appropriate, in my judgement, for the law of the contract, chosen by the parties, to apply to all of them. </p>

Misrepresentation, despite its tortious and statutory parentage, is, in a sense, part of, or at least appurtenant to, the law of contract since it may give rise to a right to rescission. Under Rome 1 the existence and validity of a contract is determined by the applicable law (Article 8) as are the various ways of extinguishing obligations (Article 10 (1) (d)). A claim for rescission would be governed by the applicable law i.e., here, the law of the contract chosen by the parties: see <span style="font-style:italic">Briggs, Agreements on Jurisdiction and Choice of Law</span>, 10.31. I accept Borealis’ submission that the position should be no different when the remedy sought – for the same cause of action - is damages rather than rescission, especially when, under section 2 (2) of the 1967 Act the Court can award damages in lieu of rescission. Since contracts are consensual arrangements in which the parties are entitled to choose any municipal law they wish to govern their relationship it makes sense for the law which they have chosen also to govern the consequences (if any) of any misrepresentations which are said to have induced it. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Trident Turboprop</span> the Court of Appeal interpreted the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">liability arising under such a contract</span>” in section 26 (1) of UCTA as extending both to liability for damages for misrepresentation and to the right of the injured party to rescind where that appears possible. </p>

Borealis, as was apparent, was intending there to be a single seller to customers in several different jurisdictions under terms which incorporated Danish law, under which contractual restrictions could not be circumvented by the invocation of closely-related tortious claims. It was on that basis that Borealis’ prices would be fixed. To treat the misrepresentation claim as subject to English, and the contract subject to Danish, law would allow the claimants to effect that circumvention, whilst retaining the benefit of prices fixed on a different assumption. </p>

There two ways of looking at this clause (a) that it is concerned only with claims under the contract of sale; (b) that it relates to contractual claims and extra contractual claims for statements which led to the contract so that a misrepresentation claim, which would otherwise be subject to English law was, by agreement, to be governed by Danish. I am not persuaded that that phrase is sufficient to constitute an agreement that any English law claim for extra contractual liability in misrepresentation, which would not otherwise be governed by Danish law, should be so governed. If the draftsman was thinking in terms of Danish law, he did not need to address the question of extra contractual liability since there is none. If he was thinking in terms of extra contractual liability under some other law, he did not say so in terms and, if such liability was, in effect, to be excluded, some more specific wording was needed. </p>

The recommendation expressed in that email cannot, in my judgement, be converted into some form of contractual promise. If that is too English law a view, and the contracts should be regarded as incorporating an undertaking that Borecene RM 8402 was a polymer which could reasonably be expected by Ms Fatnes to have the characteristics described, there was no breach thereof. Nor can the representation in that email, as part of the description of how the August 1999 letter of conformity came to be written, about doubling the lifetime of the ME 8152 grades, be regarded as a contractual term. </p>

The 10 year period guaranteed by many rotomoulders was originally selected for purely commercial reasons, to meet the competition then presented by steel tank manufacturers. It was not based on any technical assessment. Although three of the claimants gave a 10 year guarantee, one gave only a five year one. That itself had been increased from a previous 1 year, apparently for commercial reasons, although the precise rationale, if there was one, is unclear.

In 1999 Mr Schindler sent Kingspan a document entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">UV stability of Dowlex for Rotational Moulding</span>” which said that careful selection of pigment and thicker walls would improve UV resistance. The 2000 Dowlex letter of conformity expressed the need for testing on pigmented samples. I have little doubt that Mr Schindler advised PDC of the need for tests on rotomoulded products to establish the efficacy of any green pigment used in augmenting performance. In fact no testing was carried out by Kingspan on the effect of pigments, although Kingspan knew that the pigment used could significantly affect the strength of the material. </p>

The evidence of Mr Crowe (the managing director of Kingspan Environmental &amp; Renewables Limited) was that he would have expected PDC to take all reasonable steps to be satisfied that Kingspan could use a material successfully before advising that the material could be bought and to carry out (or see that there had been carried out) whatever tests were necessary to ensure that the raw material could be used satisfactorily with Kingspan’s designs.

But that explanation for the statistics is, it is submitted, implausible in the light of the sheer size of the numbers involved. It would be odd for a general UV resistance deficiency to manifest itself in only 30% of cases. Dr Nugent regarded the fact that so many tanks had not failed as a very strong indicator that Kingspan could make viable tanks from Borecene. Further the tailing off of failure was, in his view and that of Professor Marshall, not what one would expect if failure was attributable to a generalised defect consisting of inadequate UV/weathering resistance, whose effect would increase with increased exposure. </p>

Those rates were markedly less than the other two sites.

Kingspan’s representatives had visited the sites in advance to find where the cracked tanks were. Those who attended some of the inspections on the part of Borealis were only able to look at a minority of the tanks listed for inspection: e.g. on 24-5 January 33 out of 89 houses. On one occasion one of the representatives – Dr Rutherford - spotted a tank in a house not on the list where, as it turned out, the tank – made from Borecene - was not cracked. </p>

They are no more than Mr Roberts’ non expert opinion, unsupported by any cogent data or detailed analysis, of the comparison between ROI and the United Kingdom, including, in particular, Northern Ireland. There are differences between the market in the ROI and in the UK, such as the greater quantity of small independent distributors in ROI. It is possible that there was a greater awareness in the UK of developing problems with Borealis’ tanks because of the problems suffered by Balmoral, the concentration of sales to a smaller number of customers, the network of oil tank installers and the fact that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive was alerted to problems with Borecene made tanks as early as 2004. There may well have been some underreporting in the Republic. But I do not believe that the very marked difference in failure rates as between the Republic and the United Kingdom is likely to have been in large measure attributable to a difference in the quantum of reporting. </p>

Mr Fenwick submitted that the only variable that explains why only some tank fails is exposure to UV; but the data to which I refer indicates variables of factory and design which are independent of weathering and a pattern of failure which suggests some other cause. </p>

It may be (no available data gives any answer) that under reporting is not the sole reason for the difference; but it is likely to account for a substantial proportion of it. Secondly, the inner layers of ZN bunded tanks also failed at significantly lower rates than ZN single skin. Although the difference in absolute numbers is not great, the fact that it exists indicates that, regardless of material, tanks fare worse in an environment exposed to heat and UV which degrade all polyethylenes. Third, it does not follow from a difference in the failure rate of the outer compared with the inner layer of the bunded tank that satisfactory tanks could not be made using Borecene. </p>

That is consistent with the fact that UV plays, as is common ground, a significant part in the incidence of failure since it is an initiator of degradation. Kingspan also draws attention to the fact that where there are bumpers around tanks, stresses are, <span style="font-style:italic">ceteribus paribus</span>, generally higher on the bottom side of the bumper because of the gravitational and outward force of the contents. This is illustrated in Mr McDonald (Borealis’ tank design expert)’s figure 26. The fact that failures have generally been on the topsides of bumpers is, it is suggested, a reason why the cause of failure is likely to be inadequate UV resistance and not any processing failure. </p>

The difference between the various products is illustrated in Table 85 to Nugent 1.

(You also need a rigorous quality control system). In particular, in the present context, it is necessary to see how the new material flows and distributes itself, especially at sharp corners. Only the rotomoulder can do this. Kingspan did trial the material in their moulds before sending tanks off for testing at Athlone – but when Mr Halvorsen asked them to cut up a tank during a trial so that he could look at the corners to see how the polymer had been distributed, he was told that that could not be done because PDC wanted to send the tank to Athlone – something which Dr Nugent described as incomprehensible and Mr Schindler as astonishing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Kingspan contends that these criticisms are misplaced. First, the 4.2 figure was conservative. The FEA analysis was carried out with sharp edged radii which would exaggerate the stress. That latter point seems correct in principle, as Mr McDonald accepted, although, as he observed, the thinning at corners – revealed by the FEA carried out in 2004/5 which led to a redesign of some tanks - eroded any safety margin. Second, Kingspan used a linear FEA software package which exaggerated the peak stresses. In such an analysis the hypothetical load is applied in one step and not incrementally and no account is taken of the redistribution of stress over time as the material displaces. That is true although the extent of such redistribution is unclear. Third, the standard relied on by Mr Beneke has a safety factor of 2 so that when considering when tanks will be likely to fail in fact, rather than what precautions should be taken, the limit should be doubled. This would take the appropriate threshold, on his calculations to 5. That seems to me a fair point. Fourth, the FEA analysis carried out by Sean Gill of Kingspan in 2004/5, which revealed high stresses in the H 1300 tank and led to some redesign of tanks, post-dated the period in issue as did the FEA undertaken by Mr Beneke and the underlying data on which he worked. All that is true but that does not reduce the insight that that data gives as to the effect of Kingspan’s designs. </p>

There was thus a marked variation in wall thickness e.g. at worst a difference between 4.29 and 10.7 mm - in respect of a tank made from RM 8402 on 24 August 2002. The result – a weak part of the tank right next to a very stiff part - causes differential deflection with the application of stress, which, as Mr Schindler accepted, can impose significant and variable dynamic loads on the polyethylene. He confirmed that he would not have allowed tanks out with these characteristics; although observing that, if something works, rotomoulders often allow a tank out even if the thickness difference is not ideal. The average thicknesses for point 47 by material were ZN = 6 mm; RM 7402 = 5.2mm; and RM 8402 = 4.8 mm – a pattern which is consistent with the increasing rate of failure of tanks made from the different materials. </p>

First Professor Marshall accepted that a large majority of the cracks he observed in Borecene products had been on the top or otherwise exposed parts of the tanks. This is indicative of the effect of UV exposure. All PE-type materials will become oxidised as a result of UV exposure, as well as heat and moisture, but different materials do not respond to oxidation in the same way. The oxidation which results from UV degradation, which involves fragmentation of the polymer molecules (chain scission) ultimately leads to the formation of a degraded, brittle surface layer which is generally less resistant to stress cracking. There is a reduction in impact and elongation properties. Professors Marshall and Malatesta (as well as Dr Botkin) are agreed on the significance of UV. The former described it as “<span style="font-style:italic">a probable partial cause</span>” and the latter as a common factor between all tanks that had suffered degradation on exposed surfaces and failed. </p>

Compared to conventional ZN PE, Borecene appears – Dr Botkin suggests - to be both somewhat less oxidatively stable and also more susceptible to the effects of oxidation, specifically to becoming brittle due to its effects. </p>

According to Gerard Kearney, the Factory Manager, 515 of the 1,000 tanks made at Kingspan’s Polish factory using Borecene and supplied for use in Denmark failed. This appears to be the highest failure rate of any country. In his report of 22 October 2004 on 9 tanks located in an area close to his firm’s office 4 of which had failed, he indicated that tanks in Denmark were generally placed inside wooden shelters and were thus sheltered from exposure to UV such that “<span style="font-style:italic">if it is a UV issue our failures could be limited”. </span>In his witness statement he said that of the 4 tank failures out of the 9 tanks listed in his October 2004 report none were under shelter. In his oral evidence he said that he could not say which of them were under shelter. The tanks referred to in the October 2004 report which had failed had failed within a very short period of time – no more than about two years and in some cases significantly less. The very short timescale of these failures is unlikely to have been attributable to UV. Further, in view of the Danish practice to which Mr Kearney referred it seems likely that many of the 515 failures cannot have been associated with UV. It would, in any event, be startlingly odd for over 50% of tanks to fail in the first few years on account of UV exposure; and, if UV exposure was not the cause, it is likely to have been something for which Kingspan is responsible; </p>

Most of the degradation has been found at corners rather than flat areas. The extent of degradation depends on the location from which the sample was taken: i.e. there is no relatively uniform level of degradation as might be expected with a generic defect. Dr Botkin contends that the localisation of degradation can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of UV degradation and is likely to be the result of stress accelerating degradation in certain areas of the tank. He refers to the particular example of a Thai Blue tank, which showed uniform degradation at the top but differential degradation at the side. </p>

FTIR enables the progress of polymer degradation to be followed by identifying (from their infra-red absorption spectra) oxidation products formed by oxidation of the polymer and quantifying the extent of the oxidation by reference to a parameter known as the Carbonyl Index (“CI”). By plotting the CI against the distance from the surface an oxidation depth profile can be obtained. FTIR is thus a direct measure of oxidation. </p>

	      </authorialNote>. So approximately 85% of the thickness of the tank wall was without appreciable oxidation. This implies that the concentration of UV stabilisers was sufficient to protect the bulk of the tank from degradation in both cases and that Borecene had no special susceptibility to UV degradation. The highest level of oxidative degradation for both materials was at or close to areas of stress concentration at corners. There was more extensive oxidation at corner areas than tank tops (which could be expected to be the most exposed to UV). These factors suggest that stress concentration rather than UV exposure was the primary factor causing failure. The oxidation as measured by CI values was markedly greater in the case of the ZN material which was to be expected given its greater exposure: see Malatesta Table 7 (Malatesta 1, para 354).</p>

The increase in crystallinity of the surface layer compared with the bulk was similar for both materials (suggesting that the level of chain scission was similar also) and a GPC study on samples from the non Borecene tank showed similar evidence of chain scission. </p>

Thus, at a given CI level it is possible for one material to become brittle and another remain ductile. A reason why the failed ZN material showed a higher level of oxidation may, therefore, be that it had less of a tendency to become brittle as a result of oxidation so that the level of oxidation that was sustained before failure was greater in the case of the ZN tank: see Dr Botkin’s Supplementary Report: paras 91-5. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Ms Takacs’ evidence may be summarised thus. The rheological data shows a much greater increase in the viscosity and melt elasticity of the outer layers of exposed Borecene as compared to ZN material. These increases are changes in the molecular structure of the polymer in response to environmental influences. They indicate that Borecene tanks have undergone a greater degree of degradation by cross linking than ZN tanks. Cross links are bonds linking one polymer chain to another. Cross linking is the opposite of chain scission which is the breaking of longer into smaller chains. Chain scission would reduce the level of entanglement and produce a reduction in the molecular weight of individual chains. Both cross linking and chain scission are forms of degradation which arise from exposure to UV. (In Professor Malatesta’s view chain scission is by far the dominant mechanism as the literature indicates it is). Uncontrolled cross linking leads to embrittlement and eventual tank failure. </p>

	      </authorialNote>. [This is not disputed: see Marshall 2, para 119] Whereas increased entanglement may be beneficial uncontrolled cross linking, as in the present case, will or can mean that the cross-linking is happening on the weak point of the polymer. Such cross linking can be random and will not necessarily increase evenly the amount of the long chains which can help evade disentanglement. The greater entanglement effected by cross linking may be the linking together of small chains (semble with or without chain scission) rather than the creation of long ones. A very thin layer of cross-linking would be sufficient to act as a crack initiation layer. </p>

Energy is needed to induce degradation in a polymer, and that energy can be supplied or supplemented by stress. By supplying energy, stress accelerates the process of degradation. The significance of this lies in the fact that it is Borealis’ case that as a result of poor tank design, thin tank walls, and wall thickness variation, Borecene tanks were subject to more stress, particularly at critical areas such as corners, than ZN tanks. This, Borealis suggests, is the explanation for the degradation that has occurred; or, at the lowest, the existence of this possibility means that Kingspan cannot show that any differences in the extent of degradation between Borecene and ZN tanks has been caused by a deficiency in the UV stability of Borecene. </p>

He noted that the vast majority of the cracks were on the top parts of the tanks, and there were almost no cracks at the base of the tanks. This pattern surprised him since the top of the tank would be subjected to very small stresses. He noticed that many of the cracks had remained open after failure and that many were close to internal corners suggesting a concentration of strain there. (The inspection by Mr Humphries detailed at Marshall 2 paras 372 - 379 indicates that the number of cracks remaining open to any significant extent was proportionately not large). He postulated that the energy necessary to drive the cracks came from “frozen in strain” as a consequence of cooling during production, and that the ability of the material to withstand these strains was undermined by some environmental factor that affected the tops more severely. </p>

Having taken measurements of the crack length and the crack opening, Professor Williams then sought to calculate the brittleness of the material by assuming a modulus value of 650 MPa producing, on an assumption of average strain of 1 %, a residual stress of 6.5 MPa. This was based only on residual stresses in the material; it did not include mechanical stresses. That assumption produced a figure of 31 J/m² as the energy needed to cause propagation of the crack, which he described as a very low value indicating very brittle behaviour. </p>

They are premised on an assumption that cracks have occurred because of residual stress (which is largely influenced by factors which are in the control of the rotomoulder) without a determination as to whether they have, and, if so, how widespread was the extent of failure on that account. If, as I think likely, residual stress is not the reason for the cracks the calculations will not cast much light on what is responsible for the embrittlement. </p>

In Professor Malatesta’s view there was nothing about the molecular architecture of Borecene (including its lower Mw, narrower MWD and smaller proportion of higher weight chains and lower melt elasticity) that made it more susceptible to UV degradation than ZN grades or prone to quicker change once degradation had started. Further, as Ms Takacs accepted the higher crystallinity of Borecene (and lesser amorphous phase) would be expected to improve UV resistance. Professor Malatesta was of the same view – because it is well documented that oxidative degradation starts and progresses in the amorphous phase. The crystalline domains are not permeable to oxygen.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Professor Spoormaker turned to devising a novel test with a view to establishing a difference between the two types of material. He put test strips of material into a bending apparatus in order to place a strain on them. The tests were carried out in an oven at 80° C and the specimens were scratched with a scalpel to a depth of about 0.3 mm and put under different strains. They were not flame polished. The purpose was to determine the time that it took to develop a crack of 1mm and the critical strain i.e. the strain below which it was likely that no cracks would occur in a period up to 1 month. A lower critical strain is said to indicate greater brittleness. </p>

Specimens of natural, compression moulded NG2432, RM 7402, RM 8402 and RM 8403 were placed under strains of 8% and 9%. The samples were not flame polished. These tests were conducted in response to the criticisms made in the reports of Professors Marshall and Malatesta (see, for example, section 9.1 of Professor Marshall’s supplemental report) about the variable notch depths resulting from the method used by Professors Spoormaker and Williams to create a defect in the materials. Professor Spoormaker found that, when placed under strain, the Borecene resins were more susceptible to cracking than NG2432 and that the method of scratching the specimens discriminated amongst the specimens more acutely than notching the material. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">temperature</span> of 80° C used for almost all the tests was significantly higher than the temperature that the tanks would experience in service and was at the upper end of permissible temperatures for accelerated testing. Although Borealis has used temperatures of 80° C in tests, that was in the context of pipes, where standards are far more vigorous. (The impact of this point is diminished by the fact that the results of subsequent testing at 60°C on specimens taken from the top of single skin tanks showed a similar difference Spoormaker 2:87, although there was not that difference for compression moulded specimens as between RM 8402, RM 7403 and NG2432 - see para 872 below; and 60° C is still high). The <span style="font-style:italic">strains </span>of between 4% and 9% were significantly higher than the 2% to which the tanks were likely to be exposed in real life.

The test discriminates in some respects against Borecene and there are features of the results which do not tally with the thesis that the increased failures, with RM 8402 markedly worse than RM 7402, are the result of inherent deficiency in UV resistance. </p>

There were significant variations in the notch depth (the total depth being the sum of the v—shaped machine cut and the further cut with a scalpel into the notch created by the machine). Professor Williams’ experimenter did not measure his notch depths, assuming them to be 1 mm deep. In fact their average was, according to measurements by MSG carried out for Professor Marshall, 1.43mm. A difference in depths means that there may be different stresses as between one sample and another.

This accelerated testing was designed to discern within a short timescale what made Borecene different from ZN after it had been weathered.

In relation to these tests and the stress regression data resulting therefrom Professor Williams accepted, as is the case, (a) that at longer failure times there was no significant difference in the performance of Borecene and ZN resins when results were extrapolated forward to predict performance after 2 years loading; (b) that the test methodology was sensible; (c) that the conditions were more similar to actual in-service conditions; and (d) that in principle it was preferable to carry out long term tests. (Professor Williams again made plain that he carried out his tests for the purpose of discovering a difference between weathered Borecene and ZN materials).

There are a number of references in the literature to the importance of Mw and molecular entanglement for stress cracking resistance and to the function of tie molecules of tieing the different intercrystalline domains together to prevent or resist disentanglement. In that respect, as it seems to me the properties specified in para 878 above may reduce stress crack resistance, particularly environmental stress crack resistance. That does not, however, indicate that Borecene is inherently more likely to begin to degrade under the effect of UV on account of those properties. Professor Malatesta pointed out that it is well documented that oxidative degradation of a polymer starts and progresses in the amorphous phase and not the crystalline domains, there being a limited permeability to oxygen in the crystalline phase. Borecene has in general a higher crystallinity (although the extent of crystallinity is to some extent dependent on the manufacturing process and, in particular, the cooling process) and thus a <span style="font-style:italic">lower</span> amorphous phase than ZN material. </p>

But in her written report she had suggested that higher crystallinity meant fewer tie molecules and thus poorer stress crack resistance. She did not proffer any measurements of the extent of tie molecules in either Borecene or ZN material. Nor has any academic article been drawn to my attention which shows that higher crystallinity or narrower MWD necessarily means that Borecene will contain fewer such molecules. </p>

To some extent these interrelate. An adequate design may well be insufficient if the manner in which processing takes place means that the tank is not produced in accordance with the design.

Thus a material with a lower viscosity may exacerbate the degree of thinning at internal, and thickening at external, corners, and the degree of undesirable wall thickness variation, characteristics which are themselves the product of an angular design, the effect of which may have been comparatively less when material of a higher viscosity was used<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="107">

Dr Nugent’s evidence was that, if you get material draining away from internal and accumulating at external corners, you could adjust the peak temperature and length of time for which the material was exposed to high temperatures i.e. reduce the PIAT and that the best way to run RM 8402 would be to reduce the PIAT to c 165 - 175° C. But, although that was what Borealis had originally advised, it was not the advice that had been given in early 2002 by Mr Ervik and Mr Halvorsen to the effect that PIAT could be increased to give a much broader processing window. Kingspan could not fairly be criticised for processing at too high a PIAT when Borealis’ literature said that Borecene had a broader processing window, improved flow properties and Borealis employees had represented that it could increase the optimal PIAT. </p>

But higher PIATs would reduce viscosity and that result might be unfavourable in the case of angular designs.

This produced (or contributed) to Kingspan’s difficulty in avoiding thinning of the less viscous material around sharp features of the designs at or close to corners (e.g. at ribs, vertical up stands and filling ports), the build up of material elsewhere and significant wall thickness variations.  Such variations as well as creating areas of weakness, where the tank is at its thinnest, generate excessive stress concentration<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="109">

To simulate long term structural performance it was essential that the material properties used by the software tool reflected the long term material performance of the product after 10 and/or 15 years of use. </p>

PDC regarded it as necessary for the material they used to have an appropriate degree of UV protection but never appears to have considered how effective the various elements of the design – wall thickness, pigment (type, concentration and admixture), and processing – would be in relation to UV degradation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">In my view the criticism advanced of the design of the tanks by Borealis’ experts is justified. The sharp angular features of the tanks (particularly prominent in the case of R 1225 and R 245) and the extensive ribbing were intended to provide stiffness - important in order to pass the OFTEC deformation test but upon which there may well have been excessive focus to the detriment of the tank’s long term performance. These features were likely to produce shear thinning and undesirable thickness variations. This effect was inherently likely to increase with the use of a material with a higher MFI and a lower viscosity. Another effect of the use of sharp features is to make it very difficult to use FEA to predict the displacement and stresses during the service life of a tank (which will be emptied and refilled) compared with, say a pipe, where the stresses will be uniform. </p>

Tanks made from ZN to the same design failed rarely and at an acceptable rate. That shows, they submit, that the designs were not defective. It was the introduction of Borecene that caused failures at a far greater rate which is essentially to blame. No one told them that they would or might have to change their designs or their processes. The general picture given was that they could switch material without difficulty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">I do not agree. Figure 15 in para 691 above shows that the failure rate for ZN in 2002 and 2003 was between 1% and 4%. As I have already said (see para 708 (v) above) I do not regard that rate as acceptable in a product such as an oil tank where leaking may have drastic consequences and it should have signalled a possible need to change designs or processes. With appropriate design and wall thickness a 100% success rate is achievable. Motoral in Finland achieved it for some 43,000 tanks made from RM 8402 with a much smoother and more rounded design. These were for internal use to store heating oil and in that respect resemble the inner bunds of Kingspan’s bunded tanks. I accept the submission that the ZN failure rate should itself have prompted reconsideration of the designs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Kingspan did in fact make design changes in respect of some of their tanks in 2005 in the light of what had occurred. One was in the design of the R 1225 used by Titan. In August 2004 Sean Gill, a design engineer produced an FEA Report on the stress concentrations in the R 1225, which identified stress hotspots which coincided with 2 common failure locations. (The model assumed constant wall thickness which was unlikely in practice). Later reports on the R 245, H 2500 and H 1300 produced a similar picture. In respect of the latter it was discovered that in the critical area the radii had been designed to be 10 mm but were in fact between 5 mm and 7 mm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">A further report was made in August 2005 in respect of weak areas in the R 1225 tanks. These were redesigned by smoothing out contours and eliminating sharp radii, because it was recognised that the existing designs had features which created stress concentration. The report highlighted as weak factors (a) the vertical ribs at the end; (b) the vertical side ribs, which were tending to move out like the vanes of a concertina; and (c) the sharp intersection of the top of the tank with the rear of the upstand; and (d) sharp edges of the bosses along the top of the tank. Kingspan introduced a rib across the top of the tank to rigidise it; and they eliminated all the various radii that were causing stress concentrations on the roof of the tank. There was also a change in the rotation ratio. It is noticeable that the majority of the designs at Carrickmacross and Glenamaddy, where failures were markedly less than at the other two sites, were more rounded with less angularity and ribbing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Further, after it stopped using Borecene, Kingspan took steps to increase wall thickness and improve thickness distribution in some of its tanks by changes to the shot weights and rotational ratio: see the evidence of Mr Carey of Titan. Titan increased the shot weight of the R 1225 and H 1300 tanks and Tyrell increased the shot weight of the R 245 tank. </p>

Even if use was to be made of <span style="font-style:italic">natural</span> material to mould parts, it would be important to determine the lowest mechanical properties on the standard deviation curve, because it is these with which an engineer needs to work.

Kingspan’s failure to carry out any of these tests was, in my view, a significant fault. Impact testing, although desirable, may not have been absolutely essential although, as Mr McDonald indicated, its omission was very surprising. Failure to carry out any further FEA testing in respect of Borecene does not seem to me justifiable in circumstances where FEA analysis was available, had been used for the original design, and was something which Kingspan were relying on to satisfy themselves that their tanks would last for the requisite time. Given that the material characteristics of PE may differ from grade to grade, it could not safely be assumed that the results of FEA analysis on ZN material were equally applicable to Borecene. It was necessary to feed into the analysis reliable data in respect of the moulded Borecene. </p>

The checking of tanks against OFTEC’S 4.5 mm standard arose as a result of a failure to give any different instructions and a misunderstanding at the operational level as to the significance of that figure. To design a tank with one thickness and check it by reference to another, and then not at the places which mattered most, was irrational, as Mr Campbell accepted. PDC should have given, but did not give, instructions that the moulded tanks should have the minimum wall thickness assumed as a constant thickness in the FEA programme for the tank in question. These errors meant that Kingspan lacked the necessary information with which to monitor the success or otherwise of their manufacture.

In those circumstances the excess of the stresses above the design stress is likely to have caused the cracks in those locations and to have been something that would have been revealed if the FEA had been run using as moulded measurements. </p>

Control of the early stages of cooling is needed in order to prevent the material from soaking or lagging at high temperatures for an extended period, as a result of which the material will continue to move round the mould which would lead to greater thinning at internal corners. By controlling PIAT and the early stages of cooling you are, as Dr Nugent put it, effectively managing the viscosity profile of the material. The effect of different PIATs on mechanical properties and wall thickness distribution may be gauged by (i) carrying out low temperature impact tests; and (ii) cutting up tanks to determine wall thickness. </p>

The 4.5 mm figure was well below the design figure and related to permeation. Whether and where a tank will crack will depend on a number of factors of which wall thickness is only one. Not all failures will necessarily occur at the thinnest point of the tank.

The effect was to reduce the heat on the part with the result that less material is attracted during the rotation process. When the tank expands with heat the sides are forced outwards and the tops of the tank experience a degree of bending. When the tank contracts stress is generated by the tank contracting against the resistance of the oil. The effect of having a thinner part on top is to increase the stress there, in some cases (e.g. H 1300 and R 1225) in an area already subject to stress hotspots. No FEA analysis appears to have been done to assess the stresses once the tops of the walls were reduced by insulation. Figures 29 and 30 of Dr Beneke’s report show the correspondence between an FEA hotspot (where the tanks is grossly overstressed and is close to yield stress) and a crack on the top of a R 1225 tank. </p>

However, the evidence of Dr Nugent is that stresses are not necessarily at their highest at the base. (In this respect account has to be taken of what are usually the more generous and </p>

The analysis by Mr Beneke shows where hotspots on top coincided with failure. Further, if the top is thinner (so that there is a differential in thickness relative to load) either because of insulation (see previous paragraph) or poor processing this may also create stress hotspots at which failure is likely to occur. </p>

Mr Wood’s evidence was that it was cheaper than green (but I assume that that does not include the cost of compounding). Three out of the four claimants guaranteed their tanks for 10 years and the design life of the tank was between 15 and 20 years. In those circumstances it is perhaps surprising that Kingspan chose to use dry blended green pigment, even though that is very widely used by rotomoulders. Kingspan was giving, on the basis of commercial considerations, a guarantee of 10 years – so that, if the expectation as expressed was fulfilled, there was no safety margin at all. </p>

I do not mean thereby that it was imperative for them to have done so. But if they did not, it was necessary to recognize that the most inhomogeneous method of incorporation would afford much lesser protection than other methods so that weaknesses in design or processing would not be compensated by the (known) beneficial effects of compounding. </p>

The parting line is a heavier section of the mould. It thus acts as a heat sink with the result that material may not build up at the parting line to the same extent as at the surrounding walls and thinning will result. Leakage onto the mould surface can act as an insulating layer reducing heat flow. Leakage may also arise where there is a problem between the fit of the two halves of the mould. As a result flash occurs on the moulded part and there is more thinning at the parting line as material is extruded between the flanges. The flash then has to be trimmed. If that is not done properly a rough edge can result which may act as a crack initiation point. If the two halves of the mould do not correspond exactly a step feature is created. This creates a stress concentration<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="116">

The process is relatively uncontrolled since its effect depends on how close the operator gets to the tank, the degree of flame, and how long he positions the torch in any one place. That that is so is apparent from the still photographs from a video showing Mr Carey, Titan’s quality and processing manager, polishing a tank at what he thought was at least a foot distant, but in fact was closer. As a result very considerable heat (280-350°C) can be concentrated at or near to the corners on the tank, which were areas of weakness and of localised degradation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">UV, which modifies molecular structure and promotes oxidation, played a significant role in the failures. Insofar as the degradation which led to failure arose from oxidation caused by UV, the failure would not have occurred “but for” UV. That does not mean that Borecene was unfit for use or that such unfitness was the effective cause of the increased failures. UV is a fact of life. All polyethylenes degrade under its effect (and that of heat and moisture) which leads to oxidation. (The ZN made tanks did so and in the same way as the Borecene ones). The fact that they do so is not of itself a defect. Inevitably, most oxidation from UV will arise on the exterior. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Oxidation is not the same as, although it may lead to, cracking or failure. Whether and to what extent it does will depend, inter alia, on the extent of the oxidation. Professor Malatesta’s view, which I think likely to be correct, is that cracking can occur even when oxidation is minimal if the stress is substantial enough. Per contra the fact that a part is heavily oxidised does not necessarily mean that it is going to fail<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="122">

	      </authorialNote>. Stress, which is the equivalent of providing energy, increases the rate of oxidation and the risk of a crack beginning and, if it does begin, of its propagating to failure. Increasing the stress increases the likelihood. A constant cycle of heating (when the thinner sections will get hotter than the rest and therefore expand at a different rate) and cooling (when the tank may not fully recover because the fluid keeps it under tension) can create stresses which cause failure. </p>

In general Borecene made tanks failed to a much greater extent than ZN tanks because Kingspan failed to adapt or alter their designs and/or processes in a manner appropriate to a new material of lower viscosity and different properties – characteristics which were differences but not defects – which adaptation/alteration was necessary, having regard to the problems inherent in those designs and processes and the known characteristics of a new material. </p>

Professor Marshall’s view was that the use of the dry blending method of pigmentation was a major factor in the difference in performance of Borecene and ZN and very severely affected the mechanical properties and crack resistance of Borecene.

They used on the shop floor a minimum wall thickness of 4.5 mm which was lower than the design thickness and derived from an OFTEC minimum which related to permeation. As a result the shot weights were too low. As the Schindler data spread sheets show tanks were often produced with areas of wall thickness below, sometimes well below, 4.5 mm. They had inadequate checks (including in particular destructive testing and checking of thicknesses at corners and changes in profile) as to the wall thicknesses, which were in many instances too thin, and as to the wall thickness variations being created, which were in many instances too great. Had they carried out the necessary checks, they should have discovered the need for changes and adjustments. They used the least homogeneous method of pigment incorporation with pigments whose UV weatherability characteristics are uncertain. In my judgement, even if it is to be assumed that the pigment would be dry blended, it was possible to make satisfactory tanks by other reasonable adjustments. </p>

On the other hand, the required standard for the specification of the lack of conformity must not be set too high. In order to describe the duty of the buyer, a standard of both objective and subjective elements must be applied. This standard takes the positions of both the buyer and the seller in their commercial transaction into account, any possible cultural differences as well as, in particular, the name of the goods. Possibly, an expert can be expected to give a more specific account of a lack of conformity than a layman. Under the CISG, any general complaints (“not alright”, “inadequate characteristics”, “wrong delivery”, “poor quality”, “bad construction”) as well as any general statements of dissatisfaction (“not according to our expectations”) are clearly insufficient notices. The buyer will be expected to identify whether and to which extent he relies on an insufficient delivery, which specific deviations in terms of quality are complained about, and in what respect the delivered goods form a mere aliud compared with the goods owed under the contract. If the buyer has carried out an examination of the goods, he will have to inform the seller about the main results. However, in case of machinery and technical equipment, the buyer can only be expected to give an account of the symptoms but not of their respective causes. The notification does not require any specific form, so that a notification over the telephone may be appropriate. With regard to the applicable time limit, the circumstances of the individual cases must be considered, including any trade usages and established practices between the parties. If the buyer wants to keep the goods and merely claim damages or claim a reduction of the purchase price, the time limit may be longer compared with a case where the buyer seeks to reject the goods. Since a variety of different opinions exists with respect to the question of a “reasonable time” throughout the Contracting States of the CISG, a rough average duration of one month should be assumed. The period commences as soon as the buyer has become aware of the lack of conformity of the goods (cf. Schlechtriem, Kommentar zum einheitlichen UN-Kaufrecht, 3</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">The observation that “<span style="font-style:italic">the buyer can only be expected to give an account of the symptoms but not of their respective causes</span>” relied upon by Kingspan was directed at cases involving machinery and technical equipment. There is no warrant for extending it beyond this specific class of goods. Raw materials are not analogous to complicated machinery. Further, the decision of the Court did not depend on the observation. The Court found that no adequate notice had been given and dismissed the buyer’s case on that basis. The reference to symptoms in the judgment was therefore <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> (and, in any event, there is no formal system of precedent in the context of the CISG). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">In the course of his evidence Mr Bierfreund was also asked to consider the example of a watch which goes wrong because of some unexplained defect. He indicated that it would be acceptable for a customer to give notice that his watch did not work for reasons which the customer could not explain. Borealis submits that that, too, is not a good analogy for the present case, since it does not take account of the fact that what was sold in the present case was a raw material whereas the object which showed symptoms of failure was Kingspan’s finished product. A more appropriate analogy would be a buyer who purchased one cog to manufacture a watch. In such circumstances, it would not be sufficient notice of non-conformity of the cog to report that the watch was not working.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="125">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.36in"> Even then, the degree of precision of the notice required from such a buyer would still be less than for a user of a raw material, because the cog would not have been physically altered in the process of making the watch, in contrast to the raw material in the present case. A closer analogy might therefore be with a buyer who purchased metal with which to make a cog for a watch. </p>
	      </authorialNote> Further, the watch example involves a lay buyer with no relevant expertise. In this case, the performance of Kingspan’s tanks was dependent on a range of factors, only one of which was the raw material (and all of the rest of which were solely in their control). There is no necessary or even probable inference from the fact of tank failure that there is anything wrong with the raw material. In those circumstances, simply stating that tanks are cracking or failing cannot be regarded as an adequate or sufficiently specific notice in respect of nonconformity of the raw material. None of the examples put to Bierfreund, and none of the evidence he gave in response, went to this question. Rather, the common evidence of the Danish law experts that it is necessary to identify the specific non-conformity for a valid notice to be given continues to apply to the present case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in">Article 39 (2) operates – as is common ground – to deprive a buyer of a right to rely on non-conformity even when the defect is latent and undiscoverable. It provides an absolute cut-off beyond which nonconformities cannot be advanced. It would be inconsistent with this aim to water down the requirement that the nature of the non conformity be specified. This would enable the buyer to notify symptoms that might have nothing to do with the product sold in circumstances where the seller was unable to understand what non conformity was being alleged and to take the necessary steps to gather any evidence needed for legal proceedings. </p>

It must, therefore, be possible to give a notice in respect of such defects.

In stating that Kingspan was giving notice that RM 8402 appeared to be unsuitable for that purpose. I do not regard the fact that the letter was expressed in terms of great concern about suitability, rather than a stark allegation of unsuitability, as disqualifying it as a notice of non conformity, particularly in the light of the fact that only time would tell whether tanks would last 10 years.

Under Article 39 what is required is a notice of non conformity i.e. a complaint that the goods are non conforming (which may lead the seller to investigate its validity). Article 39 is intended to produce an absolute cut-off date beyond which claims are not possible even in the case of latent defects. Article 40 is a safeguard to the buyer precluding the seller from relying on want of notice. It is, as Mr Madsen observed, intended to be of very narrow application, where the seller must have been, or come close to, acting in bad faith in hiding latent defects. In that context it would make little sense for Article 40 to apply once the seller was aware of facts which were indirectly related to, or which did not clearly demonstrate, the non conformity in question. Such a construction could mean that the seller was caught by Article 40 even if he was unaware and justifiably unaware of it. </p>

The cracking at DESO, Balmoral and Rotec was never suggested to have had anything to do with intrinsically inadequate resistance to UV. In the case of Balmoral it was, as I found, not the result of any deficiency of Borecene but of poor rotomoulding practices. The cracking at DESO appeared to Mr Wood to have been largely the result of a mismatch of flanges around the window of the slim line tank and the removal of flash with a knife which had introduced notches on the top surface; and in vertical tanks the cracking had occurred when the wall thicknesses varied between 2mm and 15mm. Borealis’ view was that the problems experienced by Balmoral and DESO were not problems with the raw material but problems of poor processing and pigmentation practices. </p>

As to (f) it is true that the UV package in RM 8402 had been reduced in terms of ppm from that applicable to Tinuvin 622 but that did not indicate non conformity. I do not accept that Borealis had done no tests to determine whether RM 8402 was suitable for use in the manufacture of external oil tanks and no long term testing on its UV stability.
