	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 28 April 2017 a claim in fraudulent misrepresentation brought by the Claimants (“the Kings”) against the Second to Fourth Defendants to this claim commenced in the Chancery Division before Marcus Smith J. The claim is referred to below as “the Misrepresentation Claim”. The misrepresentations alleged arose out of the negotiations for the sale of a company founded by Mr James King, Kings Solutions Group Limited (“KSGL”) to the Fourth Defendant, Primekings. The trial was listed for 20 days. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is fair to say that the case did not go as the Kings hoped. On Day 10 of that action the Kings discontinued that claim, apologised to those Defendants, and consented to pay the costs of the action on the indemnity basis. After short argument, Marcus Smith J ordered a payment on account of £1.7 million to be made in relation to that costs liability (“the Payment on Account Order”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">From these basic facts has sprung a multiplicity of litigation which must inevitably put any observer with a taste for nineteenth century fiction in mind of the infamous Jarndyce case. The current claim is but one outcropping of that litigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this action the Kings bring a claim in unlawful means conspiracy against the First to Fourth Defendants (“the Primekings Defendants”), and those Defendants’ legal representatives in the Misrepresentation Claim: the Fifth to Eighth and Tenth Defendants, Teacher Stern LLP and certain partners, a former partner and an employee of that firm (“the Teacher Stern Defendants”) as well as Primekings’ leading counsel Mr Paul Downes QC. The conspiracy is dealt with further below, not least because it defies any powers of precis.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Kings claim substantial damages on the basis that but for this conspiracy they would have won the Misrepresentation Claim, or that they would now be owners of a 40% stake in KSGL, or that they would not have had to pay costs arising out of the Misrepresentation Claim. They also claim damages for a variety of other more unusual heads of loss. </p>

There was no question about whether the court had to assume all the facts alleged to be true. The reliance placed upon it was therefore thoroughly misplaced and evidences an apparent misunderstanding of the proper use of precedent, and what constitutes precedent, which recurs elsewhere in the submissions advanced for the Kings. </p>

This is particularly the case where there is a point of law; but summary judgment may be granted in a fraud case even on the facts. I have done so in a case heard very close in time to this application: <span style="font-style:italic">Foglia v The Family Officer and others </span>[2021] EWHC 650 (Comm), where at [14] I gave some examples of other cases in which this course was also followed.

Mr Salzedo said that that did not prevent the provision by the defendant of a defence, and as a matter of the rules that is plainly right, but as a matter of practicality it seems to me that a defence was required. That is not only because the summary judgment application did not deal with all of the aspects of the claim but also because in circumstances such as these a pleaded defence is very often the best possible way of setting out what the defence actually might be in advance of a hearing, such as today’s would have been. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However the absence of any automatic sanction for not filing a defence tends to indicate that not filing a defence is not a breach of a rule. That is strongly supported by the fact that the only “sanction” which does exist, default judgment, is explicitly not available where summary judgment has been applied for by a Defendant. Further it seems clear that the CPR views jurisdictional challenges and summary judgment as alternative means of the claim proceeding in the absence of a defence without being susceptible to default judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A point which is notable about these provisions is the absence of any automatic sanction on the Defendant for failing to file a defence. If the Claimant does not act by applying for default or summary judgment, CPR 15.11 is the only automatically operative provision in Part 15. There is no penalty as such – there is simply a risk of default judgment being entered following the Claimant’s application. If none is entered and no other steps are taken by the Claimant, the claim is (eventually) stayed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That absence of automatic sanction at the time when a defence falls to be filed and the fact that the rules plainly contemplate jurisdictional challenges and summary judgment applications as being suspensory of the right to apply for default judgment, provide a powerful indication within the rules that there is no breach by failing to file a defence even when the application for summary judgment is launched by the Defendant and not by the Claimant, as is more usual.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It would in particular seem to be nonsensical for the CPR to specifically provide that no default judgment could be entered if an application for summary judgment had been made if the view were to be taken that the Defendant in question was in breach of the CPR by not filing a defence. I would add that this chimes with the other logical point – that there seems to be no good reason for why the rules would (as it is clear they do) suspend the obligation to file a defence where the summary judgment application comes from the Claimant and not do so when the same application comes from the Defendant. This is the more so since a reverse summary judgment application is most likely to come where there is a clear defence in law. In such circumstances it would be both illogical and contrary to the overriding objective to require a Defendant to file a defence condescending to particulars where if he is right on the law, those facts are completely irrelevant. </p>

If it were, it might tend to indicate that not filing a defence is a breach of the rules in and of itself, rather than simply giving the Claimant the initiative as regards applying for default judgment. Those authorities (in particular <span style="font-style:italic">Football Association Premier League Ltd v O’Donovan</span> [2017] EWHC 152 (Ch), <span style="font-style:italic">Citicorp Trustee Co Ltd v Al-Sanea</span> [2017] EWHC 2845 (Comm), <span style="font-style:italic">John McLinden v Shiao Chen Lu</span> [2018] 4 WLUK 569 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of Beirut (UK) Limited v Sbayti</span> [2020] EWHC 557 (Comm)) tend to indicate that the discretion to lift the CPR 15.11 stay should not be approached as a relief from sanctions application and “<span style="font-style:italic">is not intended to place an especially heavy burden on the claimant to discharge before the court will agree to the stay being lifted</span>”. </p>

Mr Swain made contact with GE personally. On 18 December 2013 he met representatives from GE, a Mr Cole and a Mr Weedall. The meeting was also attended by a turnaround consultant, Ms Lord. It was initially planned that KSGL’s commercial director, a Mr Evans, would attend this meeting. However Mr Swain had passed word that Mr Evans’ presence was not wanted. There was and is a dispute about whether this was said to be because GE did not want Mr Evans to attend. </p>

It is not enough to say you threatened, therefore you knew, because the presence or absence of knowledge is central to the very existence of the threat. What may be a threat if the Teacher Stern Defendants knew about the breach of duty and absence of disclosure becomes no more than ordinary litigation tactics – an attempt to distract or rattle the other side - if there is no knowledge of breach of duty, just (for example) knowledge that the other side’s case was going rather badly for them. Examples of the latter might be an observation that a witness had not come up to proof or that a pleading was not consistent with underlying documents. </p>

The pleaded claim is that the Defendants placed pressure on the Kings and their legal team to discontinue the case by misleading the Kings into believing that if they did not discontinue then they might ultimately be liable for an amount of legal costs which Primekings knew it would not incur. Even assuming the basis for this (the hypothesis that Primekings had no properly recoverable costs because they had failed to take the necessary steps regarding a contingency fee arrangement – the Hidden Contingency Fee allegation<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"><span> </span>I will deal with this further below, but it either means a contingency fee arrangement which could never result in any recoverable costs, because it was not properly documented or (ii) a contingency fee arrangement which resulted in lower costs being incurred than were being listed in the Costs Budgets </p>

If the Kings discontinued they would have to pay costs; if they pursued the case to judgment and lost they would have to pay (more) costs. But if they discontinued they would still have to pay costs. Discontinuance reduces the liability – if the case is not good. Only if they pursued the case successfully (i.e. did not discontinue) would they not have to pay costs.  </p>

One important one is the timing aspect which itself has two aspects: (i) by the time the discontinuance happened costs had been largely incurred – the difference between discontinuing mid-trial and after trial was marginal; (ii) if these representations were made, they were made well before trial and the idea of a causative link becomes very difficult.

Finally and fundamentally the costs aspects (even insofar as they precede the discontinuance) have no effect on the merits of the Misrepresentation Claim. There is therefore absolutely no discernible link which could provide causation in relation to the costs allegations.

It may arise where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties or their privies to which the same issue is relevant one of the parties seeks to re-open that issue. In such a situation, and except in special circumstances where this would cause injustice, issue estoppel bars the re-opening of the same issue in subsequent proceedings. The estoppel also applies to points which were not raised if they could with reasonable diligence and should in all the circumstances have been raised, but again subject to special circumstances where injustice would otherwise be caused.”  245.<marker name="tab"/>Lord Sumption explained the effect of an issue estoppel in <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin Atlantic</span> at [22]: </p>

It either evidences the lack of structured thinking which affects the Particulars of Claim or a determination on the part of the Kings to pursue matters the way in which they would prefer to do so. </p>

It is common ground that in general such statements are subject to without prejudice privilege unless one of a number of specific exceptions (set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Unilever Plc v Proctor &amp; Gamble</span> [2000] 1 W.L.R. 2436, at 2444-2445) apply.

There is no pleading as to knowledge or (to the extent a case in deceit is maintained) as to fraud. At points the matters which are relied on are given in the form “Pending disclosure” (for example at [21] and [35]). </p>

Having done so they have apparently deliberately chosen not to (as they should have done) come to this hearing with a formulated draft pleading, so that the Court can assess the case properly – and indeed see whether (i) counsel is prepared to plead and clients to give statements of truth on such serious allegations and (ii) whether the pleading meets the strike out test.

This is because the Pleaded Threats are matters which took place some months before the trial commenced; and yet despite them the trial started (with, on the Kings’ case, their lawyers still giving bullish advice about their prospects of success) and proceeded for 10 days before being abandoned with the greatest reluctance by the Kings.

As a threat one can see that this might have more substance – in two situations. The first is if (i) this were contended to be causatively potent (ii) it was pleaded as being made to the lawyers and (iii) there was some discernible link to discontinuance. But none of these is the case. (I do note however that there is a question mark over (ii): in the Professional Negligence Action it is pleaded at [38] that it was shared by Mr King with his lawyers, but that their response was that the Kings had a very strong case.) </p>

On the contrary had it been necessary to deal with this case on the merits based on the Pleaded Threats, I would have concluded without much hesitation (and bearing well in mind the caution applicable to deciding fraud cases on the facts at the summary judgment stage) that the pleaded case lacked even fanciful prospects of success. </p>

Interpreting the case pleaded as best I can in the light of Mr Newman’s submissions it appears that there are two limbs to this. One is that it is to be inferred from the changes in the figure that there was a dishonest inflation of the figure, and later a dishonest reduction of the figure. The second is that the amendment to the pleading itself raises an inference of fraud because Primekings knew what it had paid. As to the latter I regard this as utterly hopeless. For one thing the figure given was not one which related to what had been paid. For the second, there is no reason to suppose that Primekings, Mr Fisher and/or Mr Swain would be <span style="font-style:italic">au fait</span> with the minutiae of correspondence on costs such that they would even have seen this letter. </p>

I quite understand that the picture which emerged as to the costs was not as clear as it might have been. It is plainly the case that there were inconsistencies. There is something of an oddity that in early June 2018 Teacher Stern said that the costs of the underlying action plus interest (but not including the costs of the enforcement proceedings) were £2.2 million, whereas in early July it gave the £3 million figure (though the amount given as the relevant figure for the purposes of what the Kings had to pay was given as £2.7 million).

Nor does the fact that Teacher Stern included VAT when Primekings is VAT registered provide a basis for inferring nefarious intent. Again there seems to be no basis for inferring that the Primekings Defendants read every letter before it was sent by their solicitors (which would be highly unusual in my experience); and the applicability or non-applicability of VAT to costs bills is the source of frequent confusion even with experienced solicitors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">What appeared to be the case when I was taken through the evidence by Mr Newman at the <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> disclosure hearing was that close focus was to be had on the matter number for the Misrepresentation Claim (PRI075/3). It was common ground, for example, that PRI075-1 was a different matter, and should not appear on the bill for the Misrepresentation Claim. The Kings submitted that one could see bills for this matter being “repurposed” into the bill for the Misrepresentation Claim; for example a printed copy of a transaction report showing payment for “BILL NO 8401” being made into Teacher Stern’s client account originally had the /1 number, but had been manually changed to /3. </p>

In his evidence Mr King set out the invoices in ledger format which he said showed implausible patterns. He then produced a second table in ledger format stripping out the invoices which he regarded as dubious. The result (which I described as “<span style="font-style:italic">rather beautiful</span>”) was a smaller, much tidier table which on its face balanced nicely. </p>

On their face they presented more credibly as examples of an original wrong accounting entry being corrected than as a forgery with nefarious intent. But at that stage I would certainly have regarded the point as within the bounds of arguability. </p>

Certainly the pleaded case does not set out the basis for the inference. 577 hours is certainly a large number to be added after such a statement is made. But there are a number of explanations which do not involve fraud. One is that Ms Toomer’s original statement contained the wrong figures, owing to some reporting error. Another is that the 577 hours was itself a mistake. A third is that both were right, but that in the event this time was spent over three months, whether by overzealousness to get the statements perfect, or by inefficiency, or overmanning the job. The latter seems perfectly credible in circumstances where 316 hours were spent reviewing the Kings’ evidence, and that figure was not questioned as unreasonable by the Kings. That coheres with the Master’s own view – he ultimately disallowed 114 of the 577 hours. </p>

I can also (just about) understand that it may be said that Primekings as clients (with a pleaded very keen interest in costs and an incentive to keep a track of what was billed) would know if a bill was false. But when it comes to Mr Rabinowicz, no basis for knowledge as at 24 February 2019 appears to be pleaded – on the contrary the Kings’ own pleaded case is that he joined the Common Design on around 10 May 2019. The 24 February Bill was not relied on before me, is not otherwise mentioned in the Particulars of Claim and is not apparently in the voluminous bundles which were placed before me. It is also hard to understand how, even at the later stage, Mr Rabinowicz, with no underlying knowledge of the case, should have ascertained that the bill was false. This is not explained. </p>
