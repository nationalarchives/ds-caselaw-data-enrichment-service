	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim in these proceedings arises from the termination of a long-standing relationship between two global groups of companies. The Claimants (collectively “GDS”) are part of the GDS group which manufactures screen displays and component parts thereof, including for use in bank automatic teller machines (“ATMs”) and retail point of sale systems (“POS systems”). The Defendants (collectively “NCR”) are part of the NCR group which manufactures ATMs used by banks and POS systems. Until January 2013 GDS had supplied products to NCR or its associated companies for many years. In the light of the arguments that developed at trial, it is generally not necessary to distinguish between the various companies that collectively comprise GDS and NCR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">An aspect of the contractual supply relationship between the parties was the provision of regular forecasts from NCR setting out NCR’s projected demand from GDS for the supply of products to NCR’s plants around the world.  The forecasts were provided on a rolling 12-month basis. GDS’s case is that it used these forecasts in making decisions as to its manufacturing plans.  </p>

In line with previous forecasts, it was for over 176,000 displays over the next 12 months. This included over 11,000 displays in December 2013, just under 12 months away.  The forecast demand had a value of over US$50 million.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Two days after this forecast had been supplied, on 16 January 2013, there was a telephone call in which NCR informed GDS that it had taken the manufacture of displays in-house.  This “desourcing” of GDS by NCR, and the 16 January call, was the culmination of a lengthy process, known as Project Dynamo (“Dynamo” or “Project Dynamo”), whereby NCR had worked on bringing manufacture in-house. NCR cancelled around US$ 5.1 million of existing purchase orders.  It also reduced all its forecasts to zero. GDS had received no prior warning from NCR that this cancellation and reduction of forecasts would happen. NCR accepts that this is so, although there is some evidence that GDS had its suspicions that it might be desourced at some point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Discussions took place between NCR and GDS at the end of January and in February 2013 concerning whether NCR would take a “last time” supply of products and if so at what price.  After discussions, including a meeting in New York in January 2013, the parties signed a “Letter of Agreement, Release and Waiver” (“the Letter Agreement”). The construction of the Letter Agreement, and specifically whether it precludes the claims made by GDS in these proceedings, is a central issue in the proceedings. NCR contends that GDS’s present claims have been settled. The circumstances leading to the Letter Agreement, including the discussions at the New York meeting, have been explored in considerable detail during the trial. Those circumstances are relevant to arguments advanced by NCR concerning the factual matrix in which the Letter Agreement was concluded, and claims by NCR for rectification for mutual or unilateral mistake. They are also relevant to a claim made by GDS for the tort of intimidation. </p>

GDS contends that others were involved in a conspiracy: principally two very senior individuals (superior to Mr. Kaparis) namely Mr. Bob Ciminera and Mr. Scott Delamater, but also three individuals (below Mr. Kaparis) who were involved in the relationship or operational dealings with GDS, namely Mr. Craig Mannion, Ms. Holly Ma and Ms. Kathleen Lappin. The allegation of involvement also originally extended to another individual, Mr. Flavio Canadas who worked for NCR in Brazil. By the end of the trial, and after Mr. Canadas had given evidence, the case against him was no longer pursued. The issue as to which individuals were involved is (or at least at present appears to be) very much a secondary issue, because no issues of attribution arise: NCR made it clear in opening that they do not advance any contention which seeks to distinguish between the various NCR defendant companies in terms of liability for deceit. Whilst the involvement of a number of individuals is potentially relevant to GDS’s claim in conspiracy, that claim does not seem to add anything to the cause of action in deceit which is, except for reliance and loss, effectively admitted in respect of the period after April 2012. </p>

In its closing submissions, GDS said that the breach of contract claim tracked the deceit claim, so that NCR were liable for breach of contract in respect of false forecasting from July 2011 (or whatever date the court determined to be appropriate). At an earlier stage, GDS appeared to put its breach of contract case on a wider basis, in reliance upon an implied term of good faith and fair dealing. However, that case appeared to add nothing to the claim that the giving of false forecasts was a breach of contract, which is no doubt why GDS ultimately submitted that the breach of contract claim tracked the deceit claim. </p>

Relative to the Delfor, unrestricted downturn can be accommodated subject to the funding arrangements defined in 6.2. Uplift will be limited to a maximum of 40% of the forecast total demand in any 24 week period following issue of the relevant Delfor. Of this additional quantity, approximately four tenths will be immediately available. The balance of uplift capability can be made available at not less than 4 weeks notice by using up forward holdings of details parts (6 weeks' worth). (For example, if the 24 weeks of Delfor is 100, NCR can increase its call-off by an additional 16, and the Supplier will deliver the Products in accordance with such call-off.) Beyond 40%, further uplift will depend on unscheduled replenishment of the pipeline and especially on expediting long lead time components. Such activity will be pursued on a joint best efforts basis by NCR and Supplier on the understanding that all exceptional costs incurred by the Supplier will be advised to NCR and will be refunded by NCR. In these circumstances, by definition, Supplier will be free of its contractual supply line uplift obligations until the normal levels of target stocks and pipeline have been re-established. </p>

Mr. Kendell’s evidence, which was not challenged, was that BPO’s were in fact only used in limited circumstances. While forecasts were provided as envisaged under the agreement, there was no practice at any material time of NCR placing BPOs except on a limited basis.  Generally, rather than placing BPOs, NCR placed Purchase Orders (“POs”) which specified the quantity of product required (using a “deljit” or line number) and date required.   </p>

They fluctuated week on week, and Mr. Kendell understood from conversations with NCR’s representatives that they would sometimes receive last minute orders from their own customers. NCR’s forecasts were originally sent by Electronic Data Interchange or “EDI”, but from around the start of 2011 they were generated by a supply chain management software system called Kinaxis. The forecasts were provided to GDS in Excel format, although there were occasions when Mr. Kendell received forecasts that had been manually updated. Whilst over the years he had received demand forecasts from various individuals at NCR, those received in 2011, 2012 and early 2013 were generally provided by Ms. Ma.

Mr. Kaparis was a man who could be brusque and rude, and he told Mr. Cariolato at the meeting that NCR would not be able to award GDS any new business opportunities: GDS was being put on what was described as “new business probation”. Mr. Crabb’s evidence, which in this regard I accept, was that in response to this Mr. Cariolato exploded and told NCR that GDS were not going to be shipping any more displays to NCR ever again.

This considered moving the supply of displays from GDS elsewhere. In the first half of 2010, however, Project Neptune was abandoned.  There had been a positive meeting between Mr. Cariolato and Mr. Ciminera in March 2010 and this period coincided with advances in lighting technology. The latter entailed a move from fluorescent lamp to LED backlit displays, thus necessitating an upgrade of NCR’s display portfolio.  NCR decided to put this project – known later as Ecolution – out to tender.  GDS was invited to tender and NCR could then assess it against other tenderers and go with the winner. GDS did tender for Ecolution and won it convincingly.  They were awarded the Ecolution contract, conditional on making further costs concessions.   </p>

The answer encapsulates a running theme in NCR’s argument as to why the case of deceit and GDS’s other causes of action were not established in respect of the period prior to April 2012. That case was, essentially, that there was a very considerable amount of uncertainty as to the successful realisation of NCR’s intended plan to bring its own production on-stream in the timescales envisaged in NCR’s internal documents. It was submitted that Project Dynamo was a complex project, involving numerous workstreams, with senior management wanting performance to be achieved in relatively short order but without necessarily appreciating the complexities and engineering challenges which were involved. As Mr. Crabb put it in the above answer, something could go wrong in which case the plan would change. </p>

If, as was the case in April 2011 and certainly by July 2011, NCR was planning to start to begin its exit from GDS by meeting 20% of its total requirements from its own production, and only taking 80% from GDS, then any forecast which was based upon NCR taking 100% of its requirements from GDS did not represent NCR’s genuine and honest belief as to its estimated future requirements. If, as here, a carefully prepared plan and internal assessment is made as to how NCR’s future needs will be met, and there is an intention to execute upon that plan, then I do not consider that NCR can maintain that different figures given to GDS were either genuine or honest. All estimates as to what will happen in the future necessarily have an element of uncertainty. Of course things can go wrong. But the admitted obligation required NCR </p>

He said that junior people produced indicative timelines from quite early on in the piece, but those plans were really aspirations or ambitions or documents to structure people’s thinking; because without some sort of plan, “you’ve got nothing”. They did not represent decisions taken at that stage, and far less do they represent decisions by senior people. The timelines were frequently cut and pasted.

It was apparent from the exploration of NCR’s internal documents in cross-examination that they were thoroughly and carefully prepared, and that this was done by senior people within the team rather than by junior people who were cutting and pasting without any careful thought. The timelines in the SRT and Pulse Check presentations were supported by detailed workings on each of the key aspects (engineering, technical operations, supply chain management and finance).

A slide at the end of the pack, which built upon a slide prepared back in September 2010, set out various GDS Exit Strategy options and the pros and cons thereof.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On 10 May 2011, Mr. Bryan Smola (who was the Commodity Manager and Dynamo Project Co-ordinator from 2011) e-mailed his colleagues saying that they had a “VERY difficult decision to make with respect to how we want to handle the exit from GDS (specifically, when do we let them know about our plans)”. He described the decision as being difficult solely because of the “unknown” reaction that would come from GDS given the fact that NCR was over 50% of GDS’s business. His email continued: “The ultimate fear is that GDS will shut down and therefore destroy NCR’s ability to continue shipping ATMs. If this is a valid possibility then we need to consider how much risk we want to take to supply continuity vs implementing cost reductions”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The concern being expressed, therefore, was not that GDS would retaliate by not shipping products, but rather that the discontinuation of business would have such a deleterious effect on GDS that it could not continue to trade. Mr. Smola’s e-mail also recognises a point that I consider to be relevant when it comes to considering NCR’s case that its deception of GDS was justified by its business need to ensure continuity of supply. If there is pressure to bring in cost reductions very rapidly, then the risks to continuity of supply will necessarily be greater than if there is a longer period of transition, with cost reductions being brought in at a gentler pace. There is therefore a balance to be struck. NCR’s internal documents indicate to me that NCR’s focus was very much on the rapid introduction of cost reductions. </p>

The slides recommended the 80/20 plan, and one of the decision points was to reach agreement on proceeding with the 80/20 GDS strategy. The slide identified the savings that would accrue if that strategy were adopted, including a US$ 1 million saving in 2012. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In June 2011, a further set of Pulse Check slides was produced and circulated. This was the first set of slides to contain a detailed product-by-product timeline for the replacement of those supplied by GDS (and other suppliers) with Project Dynamo production. Consistent with the approach taken in the April 2011 Pulse Check slides, the timeline envisaged that products previously supplied by GDS would start to be replaced by Dynamo products in the second quarter of 2012. One of these products (the 5967 15” display) was not subject to an 80/20 share: the slide envisages that product being fully supplied under Dynamo in the second quarter. Four other products, however, were to be subject to an 80/20 share also beginning in the second quarter, before coming into full production later in the year.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There was a very detailed underlying Excel spreadsheet which itemised each product by part number and supplier, and which showed on a month-by-month basis the production plans for Dynamo in relation to each such product. This spreadsheet showed that the 80/20 split shown on the coloured timeline on the slide represented the broad rather than the precise picture. For example, the first GDS product to be produced under Dynamo was the 15” display with the part number 009-0026887. The June spreadsheet showed the forecast for this product being 10% from Dynamo in May 2012, increasing to 15% in June and 30% in July 2012. </p>

On 17 June, Mr. Kaparis told a colleague that he should delete GDS from his memory/ rolodex/ contact list: “We are exiting GDS … we are months away from starting production at NCR Beijing and the last thing we need is more engagement with GDS”. By 28 June 2011, Ms. Ma had been brought into the circle of confidence, and (as Mr. Mannion indicated in his evidence) she would have been told about the aims and objectives of Project Dynamo. Mr. Kaparis told her and other colleagues that the decision had been made to end the GDS “SMI” (ie Supplier Managed Inventory) program for all sites. Accordingly, a hub for GDS-supplied NCR products was to be shut down. It is also clear that by September 2011, Ms. Ma must have been aware of Project Dynamo and what it was intended to achieve: she was one of the recipients of an email which explained how a volume of certain displays could be supplied by NCR in-house and another supplier.  </p>

That plan and intention was not the plan and intention which was communicated in the forecasts given to GDS, which continued to project GDS supplying all of NCR’s requirements. Those forecasts were a pretence. It was also a pretence that Mr. Kaparis sought to maintain through other communications.

In my judgment, however, there is nothing which enables any distinction to be drawn between the forecasts given after April 2012, and those given in the prior period. Nor is there anything which could justifiably lead to the conclusion that those forecasts given after April 2012 were deliberately false, but those given prior to that date were not.

In due course, as discussed in Section D below, this particular aspect of the plan changed. The plan also included “GDS and Benchmark demand/forecast reduction to Zero for all NCR Sites and CFC”. It was therefore envisaged that NCR would be placing purchase orders with GDS for goods that it did not intend to take, and giving forecasts to GDS for goods that it also did not intend to take, with the forecasts being reduced to zero on the day when the exit was revealed to GDS.  </p>

Whilst it admits the knowing falsity of the forecasts, it does so in respect of the forecasts in so far as they concerned NCR’s estimated future requirements “after about the end of 2012”. NCR’s case is, therefore, that the forecasts were honest and genuine in respect of the period up to the end of 2012, or at least were not proved to be other than honest and genuine. I reject that aspect of NCR’s case. The timelines in the slide presentations in and after April 2012 (as well as the timelines prior to April 2012) show Project Dynamo products being used in increasing quantities during the remainder of 2012.

Mr Gledhill sought to make a virtue of the vagueness of NCR’s evidence by emphasising the fact that the relevant events occurred many years ago, and the witnesses were doing what witnesses should do: ie giving their best recollection of events by searching their memories rather than looking at a large volume of contemporaneous documents. In their opening submissions, NCR explained that the NCR witness statements did not attempt to reconstruct from documents in the disclosure, which the witnesses had not seen for 8 years or more (if ever), what probably happened or to present that reconstruction as recollection. It was therefore unsurprising that no NCR witness gave “about the end of April 2012” as the relevant date. They submitted that the most likely date or period has to be worked out from the contemporaneous documents. Mr. Gledhill in his submissions also from time to time directed criticisms at GDS’s witnesses for basing their evidence (or, as NCR would submit, reconstructing their recollection) on a careful reading of the contemporaneous documents, rather than upon what they actually recalled. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I am not persuaded that there was any virtue in the way in which NCR’s witnesses had given their evidence in their witness statements, vague as it was, as to the period during which false forecasts were given. There was a significant issue in the present litigation not only as to whether false forecasts were given at all (a matter that was in issue until NCR’s amendment in January 2021), but the period of those false forecasts. There is no reason at all why NCR’s witnesses should not have considered, and indeed looked carefully, at the significant volume of contemporaneous documentation before giving their evidence in relation to the question of when the forecasts became false to their knowledge. The Civil Procedure Rules were amended early in 2021, after witness statements had been served in the present litigation, so as to introduce new rules relating to the way in which witness statements should be prepared. Even under the new rules, however, it remains permissible for witnesses to refresh their memory from contemporaneous documents before setting out their evidence in witness statements: Paragraph 3.2 of PD 57AC, and the Statement of Best Practice contained in the Appendix to the Practice Direction at paragraphs 2.6 and 3.4, contemplate that witnesses will be shown contemporaneous documents, particularly those which they have previously seen when the events were fresher in their minds. </p>

However, it does mean that their evidence is far less likely to be reliable than it might otherwise have been. It also means that there is no, or at best a very shaky, evidential foundation for NCR’s case, that forecasts were not false until around April 2012 and then only in respect of the period covered by the forecast after the end of 2012. </p>

Similarly, I reject Mr. Mannion’s evidence that it was only at a stage “later in 2012” (ie some time after his meeting with Ms. Ma in Beijing in the spring) that the forecasts became false. Ms. Lappin does not volunteer a date, and her evidence therefore does not take NCR any further forward. </p>

There is no evidence that she was a recipient of the detailed Project Dynamo slide presentations. However, she was a recipient of various documents which showed that she was within the Dynamo circle of confidence by June and certainly September 2011. On 28 June 2011, she was sent an e-mail which referred specifically to the “NDA Project Dynamo”, and which referred to the ending of the Supplier Managed Inventory programme. In September 2011, she was sent correspondence about future production which would have made little sense if she had not been told about the project. By October 2011 at the latest she had signed an NDA herself – although it is likely that she had in fact done so earlier. She was also a recipient of Mr. Kaparis’s “keep up the pretentions” e-mail of 13 March 2012. I agree with GDS that it is reasonable to infer that Ms. Ma would, when first told about Dynamo, have been provided with a briefing or presentation which informed her of the key details of the project including its timeline: Ms. Lappin’s evidence was that she received such a briefing, and it is probable that Ms. Ma would have received one too. If she did not receive such a briefing when she was first introduced to the project, it is overwhelmingly likely that she would have received it in March 2012 in connection with Mr. Kaparis’s visit to Beijing. I conclude that it is probable that, particularly in the period after March 2012, she knew that the forecasts that she was sending on a regular basis to GDS were false. </p>

Indeed, Ms. Lappin was only briefed on Project Dynamo in early 2012, some time after NCR had started to give false forecasts to GDS. In relation to those individuals, NCR relied upon a passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell </span>paragraph 23-103 where the authors state that: “it seems to be the better view that an employer is not ordinarily “in combination” with his employees and that no charge of conspiracy can be brought when the latter merely go about his business”. The footnoted reference indicates that there was a divergence of views expressed on this point in the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Crofter Hand Woven </span></p>

I do not need to resolve how the law stands in the light of that divergence of views. Even assuming that Mr. Mannion, Ms. Ma and Ms. Lappin were merely going about the business of NCR and for that reason could not be party to the conspiracy, the same cannot be said of Messrs Kaparis, Ciminera and Delamater who were the individuals who decided upon the strategy of deceit. Accordingly, even if the three individuals lower in the hierarchy are left out of account, the first requirement of conspiracy is established against NCR. 119.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The second requirement is an intention to injure GDS. In my view, this intention is clearly established on the facts. On any view, NCR was seeking, by its deceit, to advance their economic interests at the expense of GDS. Indeed, NCR’s case on “justification”, discussed below, effectively concedes this. That case is premised on the fact that, as sole supplier to NCR, GDS had a degree of power which it could use to its economic advantage if given notice of NCR’s intention to cease purchasing from GDS. For example, GDS might be able to use its bargaining power in order to charge higher prices for its goods after having been told of NCR’s intention to desource, and during the period when NCR was not yet in a position to meet its needs from Project Dynamo. NCR’s deceitful conduct towards GDS was directed towards advancing its own economic interests by giving GDS to understand that business was proceeding as usual, whilst at the same time taking steps “under the radar” to put itself in a position to maintain continuity of supply from Project Dynamo when the time came to tell GDS the truth. By this route, NCR would neutralise and destroy any economic bargaining power that GDS would have enjoyed if it had been told the truth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This conclusion is supported by the e-mail sent by Mr. Kaparis on 18 January 2013, two days after the call to GDS on 16 January. Mr. Kaparis reported to his colleagues that GDS was now “toast”. At the end of his e-mail, he said that GDS “can and most likely will go belly up in less than 30 days. We have all the aces in our sleeves and the deck is stacked in our favour. That was not an accident. That was engineered”.  It was not part of GDS’s case that NCR’s deceit was motivated by a positive desire to destroy GDS. However, Mr. Kaparis’s email does show that NCR’s approach was motivated by a desire to put NCR in the best possible economic position, vis a vis GDS, as and when the time came to tell GDS the truth, and simultaneously to ensure that GDS was in no position to do anything about it.  </p>

The conspiracy alleged in the present case is not simply a conspiracy to breach a contract, but a conspiracy to commit the tort of deceit. The conspiracy does encompass a breach of contract, since the contract obliged NCR to give forecasts which were genuine and honest estimates. The relevant breach involved NCR acting fraudulently. There is no authority which supports the proposition that a defence of justification can arise in such circumstances, and in my view there is every reason not to recognise such a defence. Fraud has always been regarded by the law as the most serious infringement of a party’s rights, and it would be surprising and in my view regrettable for a court to countenance fraud in any circumstances by saying that it was justified. </p>

One of the authorities cited in support of the proposition – that the commercial or other best interests of the interferer or the contract breaker does not amount to justification – is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Read v Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England, Ireland and Wales </span>[1902] 2 KB 732. The court in <span style="font-style:italic">Edwin Hill </span>described this decision as an important case. In <span style="font-style:italic">Read</span>, the plaintiff had entered into an apprenticeship contract with a company called Wigg. The defendant society learned of this contract, which was allegedly in breach of a contract between Wigg and the society as to the basis on which apprentices should be taken. In order to protect the interests of their members, the society threatened a strike by their members if the plaintiff started work on the terms of his contract. As a result, Wigg terminated the plaintiff’s contract. The plaintiff then sued the society, whose defence of justification was rejected. In the Court of Appeal, Collins MR (with whom Cozens-Hardy LJ agreed) said at 737: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“On these facts the case seems to me to be clear. The plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the contract which he had made, and that benefit he would have continued to enjoy but for the intervention of the defendants. The object of the defendants' intervention was to deprive him of that benefit. The facts leave no room for doubt as to that. He was not a member of their society, and was under no obligation, legal or moral, to conform to their rules. In these circumstances they conspired to enforce, by threats of a formidable character which they had the means of carrying into effect, a breach by his employers and instructors of the contract which the latter had with him ; and the only justification they can suggest for this conduct is that Messrs. Wigg &amp; Wright had come under an obligation to them, not perhaps legally enforceable, if not illegal, not to make such a contract as they had made with the plaintiff. But the justification to be of any avail must cover their whole conduct, the means they used as well as the end they had in view. As against Messrs. Wigg &amp; Wright they had whatever rights within the law the rules assented to by Messrs. Wigg &amp; Wright afforded them. But to combine to coerce them, by threats of the character I have described, to break their contract with the plaintiff was in my judgment an illegal act carried out by illegal means. They cannot be in a better position if the rules are unenforceable than they would have been had a breach of them given them a legal cause of action. But in such case how can they possibly justify taking the law into their own hands and compelling the opposing litigant by coercion to give effect to their view of a disputed obligation by breaking his contract with the plaintiff?” 128.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>He continued at page 738 – 739: </p>

Such conduct would be actionable in an individual and incapable of justification, a fortiori where the defendants acted in concert. These considerations seem to me to exclude from discussion in this case the illustrations given in argument of what might in given circumstances be "just cause," or, in other words, suffice to negative malice. There was no relation between the defendants and either of the parties in this case at all analogous to those existing in the instances put of father and child, or doctor and patient, which I leave for solution when the case arises. The defendants have no higher immunity from legal obligations than any other members of the community, and if they have legal rights they can enforce them by legal means only.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, even if I had been persuaded that there was a real risk of retaliation by GDS, with a real risk of a threat to NCR’s supply continuity by possible breaches of contract or tortious conduct by GDS, I cannot see that this justified NCR in effect taking the law into its own hands by a conspiracy to deceive GDS over a lengthy period of time in order to avoid the possibility of a breach or tort by GDS. If NCR had put in place contractual agreements whereby it was entitled to receive goods from GDS, and if in due course GDS had threatened not to perform its contracts with potentially serious consequences to NCR, then the appropriate way to proceed would have been for NCR in that situation to have applied for an interim injunction to restrain GDS’s breach of contract or other unlawful behaviour. To apply the words of Collins MR: NCR has no higher immunity from legal obligations than any other members of the community, and if they have legal rights they can enforce them by legal means only. Accordingly, the notion that NCR’s relevant individuals were justified in conspiring to deceive GDS over a lengthy period of time, in order to ensure that NCR’s supply chain continuity was maintained, is in my view a complete non-starter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">NCR also invoked the possibility that GDS would, if told the true position, “retaliate” by measures which fell short of breaching their contractual obligations or acting tortiously. For example, NCR referred to the possibility that GDS would use the period between notification and NCR being self-sufficient in order to raise prices, or take other steps which were within their contractual rights. I do not see how this possibility could provide a defence to the unlawful means conspiracy case. If, in consequence of being told of NCR’s decision, GDS had a degree of leverage or bargaining power which could legitimately be exercised during the ramp-down period, I see no reason at all why GDS should not have been able to use it, and conversely no reason at all why NCR should be entitled to resort to fraudulent conduct in order to prevent it. Ultimately, the consequence might have been that NCR would have had to pay higher prices, or been more accommodating towards GDS in other respects, than they might otherwise have been. This might have been disadvantageous to NCR commercially, although there was no evidence to suggest that this would have caused a major difficulty in the operations of NCR, which is a very substantial business. As I have said, it is well established that the commercial or other best interests of the “interferer”, in an inducing breach of contract case, do not provide a defence of justification. </p>

In that case, a lender was owed very significant sums by a borrower, and could have called in the loan. Instead, the lender agreed to advance additional funds, but on the basis that the borrower’s architect for a proposed development was replaced. A claim by the architect for inducing breach of contract failed because the lender was justified in doing what it did. The lender’s rights as a secured creditor were being protected by their actions. They were in a position to exercise a remedy, as a secured and unpaid creditor, to appoint a receiver, and thereby put an end to the architect’s contract. The leading judgment in the Court of Appeal was given by Stuart-Smith LJ. He said that it would be anomalous and illogical if the lender could appoint a receiver thereby terminating the contract with the architect, but could not reach the same result of putting an end to the architect’s contract by reaching an accommodation with the borrower. In both cases, the lender would be acting to protect his rights as a secured creditor, which were equal or superior to the rights of the architect to maintain his contract. </p>

The lender had no contractual obligations towards the architect and (apart from the allegation that it was inducing a breach of the architect’s contract) was not acting unlawfully, still less dishonestly, in its dealings with its borrower. In the present case, by contrast, NCR had a contractual obligation to provide honest and genuine forecasts to GDS. The giving of false forecasts was also (subject to the reserved issues) tortious, involving dishonesty in the sense in which that expression is used in the context of the tort of deceit.  It is no answer to a case in either breach of contract, or for the tort of deceit, that NCR had concerns as to possible retaliation by GDS. Even if GDS had in fact broken any contract with NCR, this would not entitle NCR to breach its contractual obligations in relation to forecasting, or to deceive GDS. In those circumstances, I do not accept that NCR had any right, equal or superior to that of GDS, which it was justified in protecting by a conspiracy to defraud GDS.  </p>

His approach to the GDS relationship and to costs in general on that occasion was, as GDS submitted, part of a general strategy of “shock and awe”. He was brusque and rude, seeking to move GDS out of its comfort zone. His putting GDS on new business probation was patronising and provocative. Mr. Cariolato reacted badly at the meeting: he had a melt-down, and did threaten not to supply product to NCR. However, this is not what actually happened.  </p>

That letter did not threaten to cease supplying product to NCR. In section 10 of the letter, GDS said that it could only continue to provide its existing services if there was trust and respect between the key players on both sides and within the framework of a rolling, 2-year supply agreement.  The letter said that the statement made at Cornedo that GDS would not be invited to participate in new business programs (ie new business probation) effectively began a disengagement process. GDS said that under such conditions “GDS must protect itself and would need to transfer immediately to NCR responsibility for all the risks of NCR’s business and their related costs”. This meant that GDS could be obliged to do a number of matters, including moving to firm orders based on purchase orders rather than “delfor”. One of the matters at the end of the list was: “Other measures TBA”. However, there was no indication in the letter that GDS intended to breach its contractual obligations or act improperly. An internal email sent by Mr. Cariolato on 2 August 2009 shows that he did not have breaching the contract in mind, even if GDS went down the disengagement route: he referred to putting in place the disengagement model “as hard as the contract allows”. </p>

As NCR correctly accepted in its opening, relations between GDS and NCR stabilised in the months after the 29 June meeting. There was therefore no disengagement by either party. GDS continued to supply products to NCR. In March 2010, Mr. Ciminera told his colleagues about a meeting with Mr. Cariolato: Mr. Ciminera had not been expecting much, but he </p>

The “new business probation” was not carried through. GDS was asked to tender for the Ecolution project and it became clear that GDS was in fact the most price competitive supplier that NCR could in practice use. In its internal evaluation of GDS’s alignment with its core values in 2010, NCR awarded GDS top marks using its evaluation scale. There was no evidence that GDS had materially broken any contractual obligations in the period between July 2009 and the telephone call in January 2013. </p>

In my view, the exchanges at that meeting, and the statements made in the July letter that followed, did not have the ongoing significance which NCR sought to attribute to them. Approximately 15 months after the Cornedo meeting, the slides prepared for the “Initial Planning Session” on 24 September 2010 identified the various risks involved in Project Dynamo.

The pros and cons of that course were identified, but no concern was expressed at the possibility of retaliation by GDS. The concern, consistent with the earlier slide, was that GDS might fold or be forced to exit the business. The 80/20 scenario was also included in this slide and (see Section B above) was ultimately adopted: this would allow NCR to “complete the whole operation without GDS knowing we are about to de-source them.” Continuity of supply was therefore an important consideration for NCR. However, the concern was not retaliation by GDS, but rather a concern as to whether GDS would stay in business or be able to perform. Similarly, the relevant slide for the Dynamo Pulse Check meeting in April 2011, which recommended the 80/20 plan, referred to this mitigating the risk of GDS “imploding” and putting supply and revenue in jeopardy. It does not refer to any risk of retaliation. </p>

We know it’s going to be negative, that’s why we are going down the path with the 80-20 rule etc. You might want to consider removing this item unless I am missing anything here”. The evidence does not show what Mr. Smola had originally written, since it appears to have been removed from the finalised slide available in the hearing bundle. It appears, however, that Mr. Kaparis may have had more concern as to an adverse reaction than his other colleagues. Mr. Smola had himself, in an earlier e-mail dated 24 May 2011, described the possibility of GDS stopping production as “the worst case”. A worst-case scenario is, however, not a likely scenario. </p>

The “Risk Barometer” slide addresses the relevant point squarely: it identifies scenarios in the form of a number of possible weather conditions ranging from “sunny” to “tornado”. The tornado was: “Vendor hears of our plans prior to replacement products being finalized and stops delivery of the current product”. In relation to tornado, the “mitigation” comment was: “This is self-destroying on behalf of the vendor. Likely hood is will look for short term price hike or promise of continued orders”. This comment is broadly consistent with the evidence of Mr. Cariolato, described above, as to why there would have been no point in stopping continued orders. It is also consistent with the view expressed by Mr. Delamater in his 15 April 2011 e-mail to Mr. Kaparis. There is no reference in this slide, or indeed in NCR’s internal documents generally, to anything that had been said in the June 2009 Cornedo meeting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Moving on in time, NCR’s internal documents show a recognition of the likelihood of deliveries continuing under purchase orders that had been placed: ie NCR was not anticipating that GDS would breach contractual obligations. For example, in an e-mail to Mr. Peter Little (the Project Manager of Project Dynamo from September 2011) and others in December 2012, Mr. Chad Lockhart said: “further incremental orders likely to be delivered beyond point of disclosure with the risk of disruption due to breakdown of relationship although it is thought GDS would deliver any products they have material to build”. This comment was incorporated into a December 2012 slide presentation. A similar sentiment had been expressed by Mr. Little himself in an earlier e-mail dated 31 October 2012: (“if they are committed to buy, they are less likely to tell us to go away once the announcement is made, and we may be able to bump up safety stock a bit before then”). Although NCR referred to another e-mail where Mr. Little had referred to mitigating the risk of GDS “going postal” (which apparently means becoming uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment), there is nothing to suggest that Mr Little thought that this was a serious risk. </p>

Rather, the decision to mislead GDS was simply a commercial decision taken in order to achieve the swiftest possible implementation of Project Dynamo and thereby obtain the benefit of cost savings as quickly as possible and avoid the cost of possible price increases during a ramp down period or the possibility that a negotiated ramp down period would result in a delayed introduction of Dynamo.  </p>

There were significant commercial incentives on both sides to reach agreement. It would, as Mr. Cariolato’s evidence indicated, be commercially extremely strange if not suicidal for GDS to have decided to cease supply: it would have had stock in hand, it would lose the profit on sales, it would risk not being paid accounts payable particularly if it broke contractual commitments, and it would be hoping that the relationship could continue in some form as a potential second source supplier. The parties had been dealing with each other for very many years, and it is difficult to see how a sensible commercial negotiation would not have led to a mutually acceptable ramp-down. This might have been more expensive to NCR, and delayed the introduction of Dynamo for a relatively short while. If so, then that would simply have been a consequence of honest commercial dealings reflecting the relevant bargaining power of the parties. It is not a justification which excuses the unlawful means conspiracy that took place. </p>

Matters that were communicated in the written and oral exchanges between the parties were relied upon by NCR, and to some extent GDS, as forming the factual matrix against which the Letter Agreement is to be construed. Those communications, as well as internal communications on each side, were also relied upon in support of NCR’s case that the Letter Agreement should be rectified for common or unilateral mistake. That case required scrutiny of the documentary record, including internal communications, in order to establish the state of mind of relevant participants. Aspects of the communications during this period were also relevant to GDS’s case based on the tort of intimidation, although by the end of the trial the focus of that case (as far as intimidatory acts are concerned) was principally upon the unlawful acts of deceit and conspiracy which preceded NCR’s call to GDS on 16 January, rather than upon any implicit or explicit threats made thereafter. </p>

I have re-read the entirety of the relevant parts of their cross-examination concerning the events commencing with the 16 January call. Both witnesses sought to answer questions honestly and did so in a manner which was largely consistent with the contemporaneous documents, although their evidence was inevitably to a degree coloured by their knowledge of the case that GDS is advancing in the present proceedings. Whilst Mr. Cariolato at the beginning of his cross-examination gave very lengthy answers, which were not clearly focused on the questions asked, he soon appreciated that this was not appropriate. His answers in cross-examination on the period after 16 January were generally shorter and more to the point, as were Mr. Bisognin’s. Both witnesses had clearly looked carefully at the contemporaneous correspondence, and to a large extent their evidence was based upon what was contained in the documentation. Despite criticisms by NCR as to this approach, on the basis that it was largely based upon what the documents said rather than independent memory or recollection, I did not think that there was anything wrong with it. As discussed in Section B above, it is legitimate for witnesses to look at contemporaneous documentation in order to refresh their memory of relevant events, and an enquiry into what a witness remembers independently of the contemporaneous documents is in my view not something which needs to be carried out or which is likely to be productive.  </p>

This will also, very frequently, be accompanied by a waiver of privilege of documents which provide contemporaneous evidence supporting the factual case that a mistake was made. The position here is that the contemporaneous documents show that an in-house lawyer at NCR drafted, or was certainly involved in drafting, the Letter Agreement: on 15 February, after GDS had accepted NCR’s proposal as described below, Mr. Kaparis told his colleagues that “our attorney (Louise M) is preparing the specific language that needs to accompany our offer to GDS + the subsequent purchase orders that follow”.

At the start of his oral evidence, in response to questions asked by way of examination in chief, Mr. Mannion sought to explain that he was giving evidence not only as to his recollection of what he thought, but also as to what others within NCR were thinking at the time. It was obvious that this evidence was given in recognition of the evidential gap created by the absence of any evidence from Mr. Ciminera (and indeed Mr. Delamater) and the inability of NCR to call Mr. Kaparis due to ill-health. As Mr. Mannion’s evidence progressed, however, it became clear that he was not closely involved in the consideration of the terms of the Letter Agreement. There were also other difficulties with his evidence, as discussed in Section F below. He was therefore not in a position to fill the evidential gap – a fact which no doubt contributed to the belated application to adduce evidence from Mr. Ciminera. </p>

At the time that the court was advised of NCR’s decision not to do so, the medical evidence relating to his alleged inability to give evidence by video-link was by no means satisfactory. Indeed, there was no evidence from a doctor or healthcare professional as to his then current state of health, and such evidence as was given came from NCR’s US in-house attorney Mr. Murphy, basing himself on information given by an NCR employee in Greece (Mr. Kaparis’s line manager) who was in turn basing himself on information from a relative of Mr. Kaparis. Eventually, however, some more direct evidence of Mr. Kaparis’s ill-health was forthcoming (albeit still unsupported by evidence from any medical professional). I accept, on the basis of that evidence, that NCR was not in a position to call Mr. Kaparis during the trial and that there were legitimate reasons for NCR not wishing to seek a lengthy adjournment in order to accommodate the uncertain possibility that Mr. Kaparis might be able to give evidence in the future. </p>

GDS’s case is that, at this time, NCR’s focus was on its potential contractual liability to GDS in consequence of cancellation of orders which had been placed. NCR was not therefore thinking about any possible wider potential liability to GDS in consequence of the false representations which had been made in forecasts for some very considerable time previously.  GDS contends that the documentation shows that this remained NCR’s mindset, and that it explains why the Letter Agreement was drafted in the way that it was and also why there is an absence of evidence to establish that NCR had the relevant intention necessary to establish a case of rectification. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">As far as NCR is concerned, Mr. Gledhill sensibly acknowledged in his oral closing that there was no documentation pre-January 2013 which showed that NCR was considering their own liability for false forecasting. He submitted in his oral closing submissions that the reason for that was probably that they mistakenly thought or failed to consider that because the forecasts were not binding commitments to purchase, that NCR was allowed to zero them out. NCR therefore probably thought that the nonbinding nature of the forecasts meant that “they did not mean anything at all”. He said that this was wrong in law, but may explain why NCR was not giving a lot of consideration to forecasts and it may explain why there isn’t “much documentation considering their liability for forecasts pre-January”. As will become apparent, I think that this is a realistic explanation of NCR’s mindset prior to the 16 January call. (These facts are relevant to the question of exemplary damages: see Section J below). I also consider that it was also NCR’s mindset thereafter. Whilst it is true that false forecasts were a significant matter raised by GDS in the parties’ discussions, there is nothing in the NCR internal documentation which indicates that NCR’s pre-16 January mindset was altered. In my view, this explains why (as GDS submitted) the Letter Agreement was drafted in the way that it was. This is borne out by the chronology described below.  </p>

It appears that NCR may at this stage have lost sight of the 2006 Amendment Agreement which extended this to 120 days.

This provided that the termination of the agreement itself would have the effect of cancelling all outstanding purchase orders. NCR would be able then to place a purchase order, but GDS’s only obligation was to use best efforts to supply. The result would therefore be that, in relation to goods which NCR really needed, the cancellation of the Purchase Agreement would result in GDS’s obligation reducing from a commitment to supply to best efforts to supply. This could potentially have serious consequences, particularly if the effect of termination on GDS was to create liquidity problems which might impact upon the best efforts which it could make.

I consider that, as Mr. Ritchie submitted, there was indeed a change of approach at around this time, caused by the potential adverse effect to NCR of terminating the Purchase Agreement. This provides the explanation as to why, come 16 January 2013, there was a cancellation of selective purchase orders. The slide headed “Proposed GDS Disclosure Game Plan” indicated that NCR recognised the difference between cancelling purchase orders, and terminating the contract: a “Note” at the bottom of the slide set out proposed wording if NCR decided to terminate the contract.

The slide identified the “Liability” in respect of “Finished Goods required to fulfil the delivery schedule for 30 days following GDS receipt of the termination notice”: the period being 14 January to 13 February, and the liability being US$ 4.86 million. The liability in respect of “WIP at GDS to the extent required to fulfil an additional 30 days of deliveries to NCR”, during the period 15 February to 16 March, was US$ 3.38 million. This 30 + 30 day timeframe was taken not from the Purchase Agreement, but rather from the terms which were alleged to have been incorporated in the purchase orders themselves. The parties’ opening written arguments addressed the question of incorporation, but in my view NCR had no effective answer to GDS’s argument that the Purchase Agreement was the governing contract, rather than any terms allegedly incorporated via the purchase orders themselves.

The plan was then to “negotiate our 60 days WIP contractual commitment with GDS”. It is clear from a spreadsheet that Mr. Mannion prepared at that time that some purchase orders were indeed to be cancelled, even though they did fall within the second part of the 60 day window. Those orders in due course featured on the list of cancelled purchase orders. I reject Mr. Mannion’s evidence that NCR intended to stand by all the contractual commitments that it believed that it had undertaken. Even if I make the assumption, favourable to NCR, that it genuinely believed that its commitments were limited to the 60 day window, it is nevertheless clear that, contrary to Mr. Mannion’s evidence, there was an intention to cancel (and an actual cancellation) of purchase orders with deliverable material during that window, and an intention to negotiate with GDS about that material. <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span></p>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> Following the provision of the draft judgment to the parties, Mr. Gledhill e-mailed on 28 April 2021 inviting reconsideration of the findings in paragraphs 173-176 and the related finding in paragraph 228 of the draft. The substance of the argument was that NCR did, contrary to my findings, intend to comply with all its contractual commitments as it understood them to be, in the light of clause 16 of the Purchase Orders. I considered that this was an attempt to reargue an issue of substance, which is generally impermissible: see </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Egan v Motor Services (Bath) Ltd </span>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">[2007] EWCA Civ 1002, paras [49] – [51] referred to at 40.2.1.2 of the White Book. GDS had argued, during the trial, that NCR’s cancellations of purchase orders went further than its (alleged) understanding of its contractual entitlement. The point was squarely put to Mr. Mannion in cross-examination at Day 6/60-68. The issue was then addressed in GDS’s written closing, paragraphs 53, and 97 -100. In its closing submissions, NCR did not respond to this point, and therefore did not put forward the arguments advanced in Mr. Gledhill’s e-mail. I do not consider it appropriate for NCR to seek to advance its present arguments at this stage. I have nevertheless looked again at the point in the light of Mr. Gledhill’s e-mail, and see no reason to change the relevant fact findings. The analysis of the position advanced in Mr. Gledhill’s e-mail was not put forward by Mr. Mannion in the course of his cross-examination (or, as I have said) in argument at trial. Mr. Mannion accepted that the document, about which he was asked at Day 6/61:4-13, said that NCR would cancel the goods that it did not need: see paragraph [175] above. When NCR cancelled on 16 January 2013, it made no attempt to ascertain, prior to cancellation, which orders reflected “work-in-progress inventories required to fulfil an additional thirty (30) days of deliveries”. If it is right (as Mr. Gledhill submitted) that Mr. Mannion would not know the supplier’s work in progress at any given time, then a party which was seeking to comply with its contractual obligations under clause 16 (assuming that clause to be applicable) would need to take steps to understand the position prior to cancellation. This is not what happened: NCR simply cancelled orders falling within the 30-60 day window if it did not need the goods. In any event, the relevant findings are not in any sense critical to my overall judgment, which would remain the same even if I had made the findings for which NCR now contends. </span>

We have always said to NCR and often repeated among ourselves that, no matter how difficult the circumstances and no matter what commercial dispute may arise, we would never abuse our position as the sole display supplier to our largest customer and our record is evidence that we have been true to that principle even, for example, when NCR owed us millions of dollars in overdue payments. The relationship has been symbiotic and the dependency mutual and this has been its strength. Since the single source has worked for NCR for so long, despite so many challenges that GDS has always risen to meet, the change of philosophy now to in-source is a legitimate one that we respect but it is not one that follows logically from what has gone before.  </p>

NCR has evidently deliberately misled us in recent months by delivering demand forecasts that it knew it would not fulfil and also by blocking all dialogue, preventing us from investigating plans for the future. NCR has even stood by and allowed us to make a last time buy for parts it did not intend take and knowing we would invest in the associated engineering effort that would secure NCR's supplies.  </p>

The explanation for this, in my view, is that NCR was not in fact thinking about matters in those terms. NCR’s focus was on the contractual position, and in particular the question of whether and to what extent it was entitled to cancel purchase orders or at least claim to be entitled to cancel those orders. When it came to the discussions with GDS as to the amount of material that it was prepared to take, NCR’s focus was on the materials that it needed in order to continue production and obtaining the lowest price for those materials. </p>

GDS certainly did complain about the forecasting, and how this had the consequence it had been left with a very large pipeline of materials. But this did not prompt any recognition within NCR that there were potential liabilities arising out of their deceitful conduct. This was a point that appears to have been overlooked. Nor was NCR thinking of the proposed agreement as providing compensation for potential wrongdoing in relation to forecasting.

At the time that this e-mail was sent, Mr. Kaparis and his senior colleagues had already received Mr. Cariolato’s email sent on the previous day, in which the point had been made that NCR had misled GDS in recent months by delivering forecasts that it knew it would not fulfil. However, it is clear from this e-mail that Mr. Kaparis’s eye was firmly on the contractual ball. There is nothing at this stage to indicate that he was giving any thought to possible extracontractual liabilities arising from the misleading forecasts which had been provided and to which Mr. Cariolato had referred. Mr. Kaparis’s e-mail strikes a tone of triumphalism and self-congratulation at the desperate situation in which he believed that GDS now found itself (the company “can and will most likely will go belly up in less than 30 days”) and that he had engineered. There is in my view nothing in the correspondence thereafter which suggests that NCR gave any consideration to, let alone had any concerns about, the possible legal consequence of the misleading forecasts to which GDS had already referred. </p>

A PowerPoint was prepared, dated 25 January 2013, and headed “GDS Exit Negotiation Preparation Material”. The first slide said that it should be clearly stated at the beginning of the meeting that the discussions should be on a “without prejudice” basis. This would “allow open negotiations and any offers to settle cannot be used against NCR in subsequent litigation as an admission of liability”. The PowerPoint shows that NCR was focused on its contractual obligations, and was likely thinking that any settlement would resolve disputes relating to those obligations. The second slide was headed: “Contractual Obligation Summary”. A number of further slides addressed the information which Mr. Kaparis had previously requested as to NCR’s need for goods and materials.  </p>

The focus was again on the contractual position. The “Back Up Material” slide contained the Purchase Agreement itself (labelled “GDS Contract”), and a Microsoft Word document called “GDS Contract Summary”. The latter, which appears to have been a document prepared with the benefit of legal advice, contained a contractual analysis of various contractual provisions. The slides did identify various “off balance sheet liabilities that NCR is responsible for PRIOR to the exit”. The relevant amounts (US$ 1.157 million) were unrelated to forecasting liabilities, but principally to various stranded components. Another slide indicated that these liabilities could be reduced by US$ 632,159 relating to various NCR costs that GDS had declined to reimburse. The most significant items in this figure concerned the costs of reworking a number of displays, and certain units that had been affected by corrosion. </p>

The discussion focused on the amount of material that GDS had left on its hands in the pipeline, and whether and the extent to which NCR would be willing to take that material. A range of matters was discussed. There was reference to and brief discussion of the misleading forecasts. GDS complained about the fact that they had a huge problem to resolve; a problem arising because the forecasts were false. NCR explained to GDS that it had provided misleading forecasts because they needed to protect their supply chain from retaliation or lack of cooperation by GDS. As recorded in an email sent by Mr. Cariolato on 30 January, Mr. Kaparis made the point that forecasts are not binding. This comment confirms, in my view, that he was not thinking that any liability resulted from the forecasts, and that his focus was on his perception of the contractual position and the non-binding nature of the forecasts. </p>

When GDS sought to draw NCR’s attention to the 2006 amendment to the Purchase Agreement, NCR shut down the conversation, saying that they were not lawyers and did not want to discuss legalities.  Mr. Ciminera said that NCR was not there to follow a legal process, and they were there to see what they could do to help GDS. He said if GDS believed that lawyers should join the meeting, then they would be happy to go down that route. Mr. Cariolato said no. He said this because his main objective was to reach a commercial deal and he was concerned that the involvement of lawyers might provoke NCR to close down the discussion. Mr. Bisognin was also reluctant to discuss legalities, because he could not see how that would assist in reaching a commercial deal. Accordingly, as Mr. Bisognin said, “we didn’t discuss any legal in the New York meeting”. NCR told GDS that it was receiving legal advice, but the upshot was that neither side wished to involve lawyers in their discussions.  </p>

Mr. Ciminera said that he would do his best to consume the material. On the GDS side, there was a hope that an offer would be forthcoming, although Mr. Bisognin for his part was not optimistic. Mr. Swetman expressed the view on 30 January that NCR currently thought that they had “no obligation to us and so any offer they make is likely to be derisory”. GDS was given what Mr. Cariolato described as “homework”: to provide information as to products and materials within the pipeline, on the basis of which GDS hoped that NCR would make a proposal. </p>

We did not even need the extra products we bought from them”. NCR’s internal documentation, both prior and subsequent to the meeting, shows that NCR was not at all focused on assisting GDS, but rather on the products which they did indeed need bearing in mind their stock levels and “run out” dates, and the need to maintain continuity as Project Dynamo was introduced. This is illustrated by the slides in the 25 January 2013 pack, for example that headed: “Proposed Incremental GDS Take (Risk Mitigation)”. At that time, before further work was done at NCR, this total cost to mitigate the risk on Dynamo was US$ 6.936 million: this was a figure very close to the amount which was ultimately paid.  </p>

I do not accept that this was NCR’s approach. There are many internal documents which show NCR trying to ascertain how much material it needed, with some individuals being concerned that not enough was being ordered. For example, an internal exchange on 5/6 February records the wish list of Mr. Lisecki, including products which were “critical to ensure continuity of ATM production”. There are no internal documents recording NCR’s intention to help GDS as much as it could. Mr. Kaparis’s e-mail of 22 January, referring to going in for the kill and grinding GDS, fairly reflects his attitude. </p>

On 29 January, Mr. Kaparis sent a lengthy e-mail requesting information as to GDS’s finished goods inventory, the quantity of displays that GDS could build with material GDS would have on hand by 7 February, a costed bill of materials for each display purchased by NCR, and a full list of all open purchase orders with component suppliers. In an MSN conversation between Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Kaparis on 31 January, Mr. Bisognin referred to his hope that they would “find the right fair solution over the stock as discussed in NYC”. Mr. Kaparis referred to doing his best to send an offer in two working days after receipt of the information that he had requested. On 1 February, Mr. Bisognin sent Mr. Kaparis various electronic spreadsheets containing the information requested.

Mr. Mannion agreed (rightly) that this proposal was not being put in terms of a settlement of legal liabilities. Rather, Mr. Kaparis was looking at the issue in terms of what material NCR wanted, and how much it was prepared to pay. Contrary to the suggestion in his evidence that he was seeking to assist GDS, the majority of the items listed in the email were regarded as “High Priority” for NCR.  He also expressed the need to make an offer quickly “before they close their doors due to a lack of liquidity on their part”. The reference to a US$ 2.3 million “PPV” was to “Purchase Price Variance”. This was in essence an additional profit beyond that which had previously been anticipated, resulting from the downward adjustment on the price that had been expected to be paid.

Mr. Frisby advised that whilst the offer was an improvement on NCR’s initial position, there were good grounds for beginning a claim which might result in a higher recovery. Mr. Frisby was keen to explore the legal position with counsel. There was discussion within GDS as to whether litigation was a preferable option. As matters developed, however, Mr. Cariolato was not attracted to litigation, and ultimately considered that GDS should accept the proposal. Counsel was, therefore, never consulted. </p>

In the shorter conversation that afternoon, Mr. Bisognin asked NCR to take more product. Mr. Kaparis told Mr. Bisognin that his offer “doesn’t fly”. This was also the message conveyed in the longer conversation. Mr. Kaparis said that he was being honest and not negotiating: he did not care whether GDS shipped another display tomorrow. He said that he had tried to find something which did not crush GDS, and had taken the maximum amount of material. GDS had a US$ 20 million problem, and NCR had taken around US$ 7.5 million off their hands. Mr. Bisognin made the point that, leaving the “legal aside”: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This, and other points made by Mr. Bisognin, cut no ice with Mr. Kaparis. He pointed out that time was on his side, and that NCR had all the leverage and GDS had none. Mr. Kaparis was not trying to take advantage of him, but was trying to put something together which worked internally at NCR. Mr. Bisognin suggested NCR taking US$ 15 million of material, and Mr. Kaparis pointed out that US$ 7 million was better than zero. The discussion continued with Mr. Bisognin trying to persuade Mr. Kaparis to take more product (“we need to find an agreement for all the volumes, ok. So let’s say that …”), and Mr. Kaparis indicating that any agreement could not be based on Mr. Bisognin’s proposal (“Take your proposal you put together and put it in the garbage, ok?”), but suggesting some ideas based around his proposal. These ideas seem to have concerned the timing of deliveries, rather than the taking of additional quantities. Towards the end of the discussion, Mr. Bisognin referred again to the problem generated by the forecast, with GDS having been told as late as 14 January 2013 that the “forecast is ok”. The upshot was that Mr. Bisognin would talk to Mr. Cariolato, but that Mr. Kaparis did not know what else to offer although he would speak to Mr. Ciminera. </p>

But Mr. Cariolato and Mr. Bisognin were saying that the only option was for NCR to accept their counter-offer of 7 February: “Amazing but true”. He said that GDS was marching down the path of bankruptcy, and that he did not plan on talking to them any more, because there was nothing more that he could offer. He had tried giving them some “reasonable avenues” but they did not want to listen. Mr. Ciminera told Mr. Kaparis that NCR should “sit and see what they come back with”. </p>

Mr. Bisognin asked whether there was any possibility of NCR taking more materials. Mr. Kaparis told him (apparently repeating what had been said in an earlier conversation) that NCR’s offer contained what NCR could do, although “[w]e are trying, Luca”. As with much that Mr. Kaparis said, this was not true. There is no evidence that NCR was trying at all: NCR’s decision, conveyed by Mr. Ciminera on the previous Friday, had been to sit tight. Mr. Kaparis said that NCR had made basically the best offer that they could make, and that there was nothing to do. </p>

He also thought that the “current settlement is very low”, and that GDS was being intimidated unduly to accept it. Mr. Swetman commented that he thought “we agree and accept that”.

His email also referred to the potential for a good claim for damages for misrepresentation and the tort of deceit.

FROs concerned potential claims which NCR would put forward from time to time relating to issues with GDS displays. As described above, they had been referred to in the NCR internal slide presentations, but Mr. Kaparis had decided not to include any “FRO language” in the proposed agreement. The reference to the accounts payable was to a balance of more than US$ 5m that NCR owed GDS in respect of products that had already been delivered and invoiced. NCR was late in paying some or all of these invoices. One of GDS’s concerns, ventilated in prior internal communications, was that a rejection of NCR’s offer would lead to a delay or refusal to pay the accounts payable, and thereby further significant financial pressure on GDS. This was a factor which lay behind Mr. Cariolato’s decision to accept the offer. The accounts payable were not addressed in the proposed agreement sent on 20 February, with Mr. Kaparis saying that he was working on clearing them out; in other words, paying them. The GDS internal correspondence shows that Mr. Bisognin was not unduly concerned at the absence of any reference to accounts payable in the proposed agreement, and it was common ground that these were not addressed in either the draft or the final version of the agreement. The accounts payable were in due course paid by NCR, albeit after a degree of further delay. </p>

Mr. Cariolato asked his colleagues whether it was necessary to “confront with our lawyer” or whether it was OK to confirm the document as presented by NCR. It is apparent from the correspondence that he was inclined simply to sign, and certainly not to enter into any real negotiation. This reflected his view that agreement to the terms proposed by NCR was GDS’s only practical option. This view had resulted in GDS’s decision to accept NCR’s proposal in the first place. Mr. Cariolato on 20 February also preferred to deal with matters by email, since he was at home with a strong cough. </p>

There was then an exchange of emails between Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Swetman (copied to Mr. Cariolato) concerning the accounts payable in respect of invoices already issued, and they both agreed that this need not be specifically addressed in their response to the draft Letter Agreement. </p>

He did not remember what had been discussed, but recalled that Mr. Bisognin did most of the talking because Mr. Cariolato was unwell and it was uncomfortable for him to speak. In his oral evidence, Mr. Cariolato maintained that there was indeed a call. Mr. Bisognin said in his witness statement that it was likely that he spoke to Mr. Cariolato that evening to update him on the advice from S&amp;B, but he did not remember doing so.  I think that it is inherently probable that there would have been a call between Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Cariolato that evening in order to bring matters to a conclusion following Mr. Frisby’s redraft and advice, and I therefore accept that a call took place. Whilst it is correct that no call is referred to in the documents, there is equally no documentary record of Mr. Cariolato giving his assent to Mr. Frisby’s proposed redraft. It is again inherently probable that Mr. Bisognin would have sought that assent, by speaking to Mr. Cariolato, prior to sending GDS’s proposals back to NCR. </p>

Here, the key point was that GDS was complaining, repeatedly, that by the forecasts NCR had deliberately misled GDS. This complaint was intertwined with GDS’s complaint that NCR had cancelled purchase orders. During the course of the parties’ discussions, GDS was asking NCR to pay for its pipeline of material. It was therefore asking for far more items and far more money than was represented by the cancelled purchase orders. The cancelled purchase orders involved approximately 16,000 pieces which were valued (in the slides sent to NCR by Mr. Bisognin on 21 January) at US$ 5.1 million. GDS wanted NCR to take far more material than that. Even the Letter Agreement as signed involved NCR paying for many more items and paying much more money than represented by the cancelled purchase orders: Exhibit 2 to the Letter Agreement involved around 33,000 items for a price of just under US$ 7.7 million. The discussions which led to the Letter Agreement were all part of settlement discussions in relation to a potential legal dispute arising from the matters announced on 16 January 2013. By the time of the New York meeting, those discussions were expressly without prejudice. The parties were therefore concluding a settlement, not simply entering into a commercial agreement for the purchase of goods. </p>

NCR sought to link the concept of “orders placed” with NCR’s forecasts in a number of ways. NCR submitted that “orders placed” were orders that were supposed to be placed to reflect NCR’s needs, as estimated in NCR’s forecasts, and might cover a period as long as the forecasts themselves. The forecasts were estimates, and were subject to change. Forecasts for more distant periods were known to be inaccurate as predictions of amounts that would actually be taken. But under the Purchase Agreement, and as a matter of the parties’ dealings, the forecasts were supposed to be and were updated. When the time came to issue orders, the expectation was that orders would reflect forecasts as updated. Forecasts were therefore closely connected to and were directly or at least indirectly related to orders placed. </p>

A compromise of all claims arising from NCR’s deliberate concealment of its in-sourcing plans, and all claims intimated by GDS in relation to them since 16 January 2013, in order to wipe the slate clean, makes obvious commercial sense.

The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice.

But, in striking a balance between the indications given by the language and the implications of the competing constructions the court must consider the quality of drafting of the clause (the <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky </span>case, para 26, citing Mance LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Gan Insurance Co Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd (No 2) </span>[2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 299, paras 13, 16); and it must also be alive to the possibility that one side may have agreed to something which with hindsight did not serve his interest: the possibility that a provision may be a negotiated compromise or that the negotiators were not able to agree more precise terms.  </p>

Rather, the lawyer and the judge, when interpreting any contract, can use them as tools to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will vary according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements. Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis, for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they have been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals. The correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater emphasis on the factual matrix, for example because of their informality, brevity or the absence of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of complex formal contracts may often not achieve a logical and coherent text because of, for example, the conflicting aims of the parties, failures of communication, differing drafting practices, or deadlines which require the parties to compromise in order to reach agreement. There may often therefore be provisions in a detailed professionally drawn contract which lack clarity and the lawyer or judge in interpreting such provisions may be particularly helped by considering the factual matrix and the purpose of similar provisions in contracts of the same type. The iterative process, of which Lord Mance JSC spoke in <span style="font-style:italic">Sigma Finance Corpn </span>[2010] 1 ALL ER 571, para 12, assists the lawyer or judge to ascertain the objective meaning of the disputed provisions.” </p>

Since a settlement agreement requires a party to give up existing rights, and since such agreements are (unlike dispute resolution clauses) usually the subject of careful and sometimes intense negotiation, their interpretation cannot commence with a presumption that one party or the other intended to relinquish all of his existing rights in order to wipe the slate clean.

In other words, they would remain to be fulfilled. But the uncancelled open purchase orders had been listed by GDS and included as Exhibit 3. Apart from making it clear that these orders remained to be fulfilled and paid for, the listing in Exhibit 3 was subject to the provision in the fourth paragraph of the Letter Agreement that: “none of the orders on Exhibits 2 and 3 can be cancelled or reduced”. That sentence provided protection for GDS against the possibility that the open purchase orders, as well as the orders for the Exhibit 2 products, would be subject to the same abrupt cancellation as had occurred (in relation to the Exhibit 1 purchase orders) on 16 January 2013. </p>

Thus, the first paragraph refers specifically to the cancellation of the open purchase orders set out in Exhibit 1. That exhibit identifies each purchase order by number, as well as providing for example </p>

The first paragraph of the Letter Agreement then goes on to refer, additionally (“Furthermore”), to the amendment of the forecasts to zero. Exhibit 3 is similar to Exhibit 1 in that it too refers to orders rather than forecasts: it lists the detail of those purchase orders which were not being cancelled, and which therefore remained as contractual obligations. The additional quantities to be taken pursuant to the Letter Agreement, as listed in Exhibit 2, were also described (in the fourth paragraph of the Letter Agreement) as “orders”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The critical third paragraph refers not to forecasts but to orders. Whilst it can be said that the orders were the culmination of a process that started with the giving of forecasts, there is in my view no basis for seeking to equate forecasts with orders. The parties clearly had in mind the termination of the contractual commitments which had been created by the purchase orders: hence the express reference to “the termination of Orders pursuant to the Purchase Agreement”. It would be strange to speak of the “termination” of forecasts which had been made in the past, and the language actually used cannot be read as referring to that unusual concept. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Furthermore, the third paragraph does not simply refer to orders in the abstract, but specifically “all orders placed by NCR pursuant to the Purchase Agreement between NCR and GDS on or before 16 January 2013”. These words therefore refer to orders which were actually placed pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. I accept that claims relating to orders placed on or before 16 January 2013 could encompass a claim in respect of an order which was not placed in that period. For example, it might well cover a claim that a particular order or series of orders placed before 16 January 2013 should have been for a larger volume of goods, and in that sense it would be a claim for an “order not placed”. (I do not actually understand GDS to be making any such claims in these proceedings). However, the language cannot in my view be read as referring very generally, as NCR submitted, to orders which were not placed, and thereby as a reference to forecasts. Even if the contractual language is interpreted to mean “the placement of orders” (as NCR submitted), this makes no difference of substance: the placement of orders pursuant to the Purchase Agreement means the same as “orders placed pursuant the Purchase Agreement”. It refers to orders actually placed rather than to orders which were not placed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The temporal reference in the third paragraph shows that the attempt to equate the contractual language with forecasts is unsustainable. The settlement relates to orders placed by NCR on or before 16 January 2013. The period covered by the forecasts is different to the period covered by purchase orders. The former looked ahead for a period of approximately one year, so that the latest forecast prior to the 16 January cancellation covered the entirety of 2013. The purchase orders generally did not look so far ahead: as shown by the list of cancelled orders in Exhibit 1, these were concentrated in the period up until June 2013, and with relatively few orders in August and September and none thereafter. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The temporal reference also highlights the difficulty of interpreting the words “orders placed by NCR” as including “orders not placed by NCR” so as to produce the result that the Letter Agreement covered all claims based on forecasts. This was relied upon by NCR as a staging post in the argument that the language of the third paragraph can be read as referring to forecasts. Even if the words can be read as referring to orders not placed, there would be no basis for divorcing those words from the remainder of the text. The language would therefore be, in full, “orders not placed by NCR pursuant to </p>

So read, the difficulty of treating the language as referring to forecasting claims is revealed.  Claims in relation to orders not placed on or before 16 January 2013 cannot be a reference to claims in relation to forecasts which, during 2012 and 2013, covered a period well beyond that date, essentially up to the end of 2013. A claim arising from those forecasts would therefore relate to the consequences of orders “not placed” in the months after 16 January 2013, rather than those which were “not placed” in the period prior to that date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have hitherto considered the question of whether the language of the Letter Agreement can be read as excluding all claims relating to NCR’s forecasting. The case for so construing the agreement would be enhanced if it could be said, for example, that it was difficult to see why the parties would have wanted to settle claims relative to, or arising directly or indirectly from, the orders placed on or before 16 January 2013, or that such a settlement would be devoid of substantial content. I do not believe that this can be said. On the contrary, if the language of the Letter Agreement is applied in accordance with its natural meaning, it does nevertheless result in a considerable relinquishment of the rights that GDS would or might otherwise have had.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is not appropriate here to explore the full extent of the impact of the settlement, since (in the event that it does not exclude all of GDS’s claims) its precise application to the claims made by GDS is to be determined hereafter. It is, however, clear that the settlement, even if interpreted so as not to exclude all claims relating to forecasting, does have very real and substantial content. There is on any view a settlement of all contractual claims arising from the January 2013 cancellation of a significant volume of purchase orders. The settlement does not, however, simply relate to the cancellation of orders, but precludes any claims arising directly or indirectly from all orders placed by NCR at any time prior to January 2013; in other words, during the entire history of the relationship. It seems (without finally deciding the point) that this would prevent claims being made on the basis that NCR should have paid more for products that were supplied pursuant to pre-January 2013 purchase orders; for example, it would cover the claim that GDS would have increased their pricing for goods actually supplied if they had not received false forecasts. The language which excludes claims “arising directly or indirectly from all orders placed by NCR” prior to the relevant date is also wide. The connection between the claims or losses and the orders need therefore be no more than indirect. It may be (and again I express no final view) that this language is sufficient to exclude or at least impact upon GDS’s proposed claim for losses comprising investment and development costs, in so far as the orders actually placed, but without real intent to take delivery, were one of the causes of those losses. </p>

It was a fact known to GDS prior to the conclusion of the settlement agreement, as a result of the discussions in New York,  that NCR was receiving in-house legal advice. Furthermore, apart from NCR’s submission that the failure to refer expressly to forecasts was an obvious drafting error, NCR did not identify any other errors or suggest that the Letter Agreement was, apart from that omission, not well drafted. In these circumstances, and given that the identification of the disputes which have been settled depends first and foremost upon the language which the parties have used, I consider that this is a case where the agreement can and should be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis: see <span style="font-style:italic">Wood </span>at [13]. </p>

That may be so in many cases involving settlement agreements, because the complaints and positions taken by each party in the course of negotiation for the settlement agreement are, as <span style="font-style:italic">Foskett</span> indicates, potentially relevant factual matrix evidence in resolving issues as to what disputes the parties were settling. </p>

I did not think, however, that this fact materially assisted NCR’s argument that the critical third paragraph was to be read as encompassing GDS’s claims concerning forecasting. In fact, as GDS submitted, the opposite conclusion could equally, and perhaps more appropriately, be drawn. The Letter Agreement refers specifically, in the first paragraph, both to the cancellation of orders and the zeroing out of forecasts. This shows that the parties themselves, being alive to GDS’s complaints about forecasts, distinguished between orders and forecasts, and then – in the critical third paragraph – referred only to orders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also important to note that the complaints and positions of GDS, as known to NCR, were not confined to the issue of forecasting. The “big issue” was indeed the very substantial pipeline which GDS had on its hands, and which it said was the result of false forecasting. However, there were other issues that were discussed between the parties, including contractual rights of cancellation, applicable notice periods, TUPE liabilities, unpaid accounts as well as FRO’s (a potential liability of GDS to NCR), the possibility of a continuing relationship and ongoing liabilities for products sold (an issue which is to some extent addressed in the fourth paragraph of the Letter Agreement). The range of issues which were in play, and which form part of the overall factual matrix, serves to underline the prime importance of the language which the parties have actually used when defining what has been settled and the rights that GDS has relinquished in the release.  </p>

He stated, as his fourth proposition, that the relevant background “may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax”. However, I see no reason to conclude in the present case that the parties used the wrong words or syntax. NCR’s construction argument does not postulate that any of the words used in the Letter Agreement were wrong. As already explained, those words do bring a substantial benefit to NCR and do result in a very real and significant relinquishment by GDS of its rights. Rather, NCR’s case is that the words used were not as comprehensive as they should have been, and should therefore be extended by additional words so as to produce the result that GDS’s relinquishment of rights was more complete. Whilst that result might be achieved through NCR’s claim for rectification, I do not consider that it can be achieved by a process of construction. In reality, it invites the court to rewrite the settlement agreement rather than to interpret the agreement which the parties have actually made. </p>

The Exhibit 3 commitments were already in existence, and the effect of the 16 January announcement was that NCR wished those commitments to remain in place. The Exhibit 2 commitments were new. They benefited both parties, in that GDS were able to supply some of the goods in the pipeline, and NCR was able to obtain goods at heavily discounted prices compared to those which had previously been payable.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, the argument pays insufficient regard to the fact that the payment of US$ 7.7 million was not an outright payment of money in return for a settlement of GDS’s cancellation claims. NCR would be receiving valuable goods in return for that payment, and moreover would be doing so at heavily discounted rates. Accordingly, even though the US$ 7.7 million may have exceeded the value of the cancelled purchase orders, there was obvious commercial benefit to NCR in making that payment in return for the Exhibit 2 goods, even leaving aside the benefit achieved by the relinquishment by GDS of the rights specified in the Letter Agreement. This is illustrated by the fact that NCR’s initial offer, on 6 February 2013, was simply for the purchase of displays valued at US$ 7.68 million, without any proposed terms relating to the relinquishment of rights. </p>

He describes the financial benefit of the purchase, which significantly improved performance against anticipated results, albeit that this internal calculation would not have been known to GDS at the time and cannot be regarded as part of the factual matrix. It does, however, further illustrate the commercial good sense of the Letter Agreement from NCR’s perspective, even on the basis that it does not effect as broad a relinquishment of GDS’s rights as that for which NCR contends. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Another theme in NCR’s argument on commercial sense is that GDS’s interpretation means that the settlement is not comprehensive. If it is interpreted as only a partial settlement of GDS’s rights, then there is inevitably scope for argument as to how the settlement applies to the various claims which GDS now seeks to bring. In this way, a partial settlement creates issues and the scope for later argument, whereas a comprehensive settlement does not.

It would certainly have been commercially rational for NCR, who were the authors of the Letter Agreement, to have sought to achieve a comprehensive settlement and one which gave them wider protection. However, as <span style="font-style:italic">Foskett</span> shows, it is far from unusual for settlements to leave matters out, and to compromise some matters but not others. The commercial good sense of a more comprehensive settlement, from the perspective of one party, is not in my view a reason to interpret the Letter Agreement in a manner contrary to the natural interpretation of its language. It involves equating orders with forecasts and, at a wider level, construing the settlement as wiping the slate clean, neither of which is supported by the terms of the Letter Agreement. The effect would be to rewrite the parties’ agreement. Bearing in mind the judgment of Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton </span>as to the approach to arguments based on commercial sense, I do not consider that this is the appropriate way in which to construe the Letter Agreement. </p>

He said that it required a strong case to persuade the court that something had gone wrong with the language. In that case, he considered that the interpretation of the relevant clause in accordance with the ordinary rules of syntax made no commercial sense. The judgment also makes clear that: the fact that a contract may appear to be unduly favourable to one party is not a sufficient reason for supposing that it does not mean what it says; that in deciding whether there is a clear mistake, the court is not confined to reading the document without regard to its background or context; and that the exercise of correcting mistakes as a matter of construction is part of the single task of contractual interpretation. </p>

The likely reason for that is that Mr. Kaparis and NCR’s in-house legal adviser were themselves focusing on the contractual position: see Section D above.

The shared understanding may therefore be tacit. It may therefore include understandings that are so obvious as to go without saying, or that were reached without being spelled out in so many words. The Court of Appeal emphasised, however, that the court is concerned with what the parties actually communicated to each other, and not with identifying their presumed intention by means of an “officious bystander” test: see [87]. The concept of a tacit agreement is to be contrasted with uncommunicated intentions which happen, without the parties knowing it, to coincide.

At the time, NCR’s focus was on the commercial terms of the purchase of products for which it had a critical need and was able to obtain at a heavy discount. The need to obtain supply continuity and cost reduction were NCR’s enduring twin concerns. NCR perceived that there was only potential exposure in respect of purchase orders placed before 16 January 2013, and they wished to settle any claims or liabilities in connection therewith. Whilst NCR understood that GDS was complaining about NCR’s forecasts, NCR did not consider that GDS had any claims in respect thereof.

When GDS responded (on 7 February 2013) to NCR’s prior offer, GDS put forward two scenarios involving payment of over US$ 12.5 million or over US$ 16.4 million. Figures in this region could not be explained merely as an offer to settle a cancelled purchase order claim for US$ 5.1 million, which would then leave GDS free to sue in respect of forecasts after receiving payment.

Whilst Mr. Mannion was less involved than Mr. Kaparis, he said that it was “blatantly obvious to everyone” that the settlement resolved all the loose ends. It was, he said in evidence, a final termination of the relationship: “everything decided and we would walk away and go our separate ways”. Whilst Mr. Ciminera had not provided a statement, Mr. Kaparis had given evidence as to his intention. It was also inherently plausible that Mr. Ciminera was aware of and shared Mr. Kaparis’s intentions in relation to the Letter Agreement, including to settle GDS’s forecasting complaints. The court should therefore not hesitate to find that NCR believed that the Letter Agreement settled forecasting claims. </p>

Mr. Frisby’s initial advice on the Letter Agreement, in the early afternoon of 21 February 2013, was that it was a full and final settlement of all claims which GDS may have. If it was signed, then GDS would be bound and will have waived all claims. The subsequent call and e-mail did not materially change that position. Mr. Frisby was only suggesting that it was arguable that forecasting claims were not covered by the settlement. It was doubtful that Mr. Cariolato even read the relevant paragraph of the e-mail where Mr. Frisby addressed that issue. He did not pay it any attention.

The upshot of that meeting was that information would be provided by GDS with further details of the pipeline which would be requested by NCR, with NCR indicating that it would do what it could. GDS did not know whether any offer would in fact be forthcoming, and NCR itself at that stage had not decided to put forward an offer. There was certainly no discussion or consensus that any proposal would be in full and final settlement of all complaints including forecasting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">NCR sought to characterise the “big issue” for discussion at the New York meeting as the dispute as to NCR’s obligations arising out of its forecasts, and its deliberately incorrect forecasting, and the loss caused by GDS’s reliance on the forecasts. I do not accept that this is an accurate description of the “big issue”. The New York meeting was not a meeting aimed at the resolution of a claim for false forecasting, and both parties at the meeting wished to avoid discussion of the legalities and the involvement of lawyers. The big issue was the large pipeline of goods and materials which GDS had on its hands, and whether or not NCR would take any of that material. Both parties viewed that as a commercial question. Whilst it is true that GDS was making the point that the pipeline was to a significant extent the consequence of the false forecasts, the focus of the parties – and certainly GDS – was upon seeing whether there could be a commercial resolution of this big problem. I accept that, at least in theory, there was a possibility of litigation between the parties: at NCR’s request, the meeting was held on a “without prejudice” basis, so that any statements made could not be used against them at a later stage. Litigation was, however, very far in the background, and the parties did not discuss it. This was, not least, because Mr. Cariolato was not seriously contemplating litigation and GDS did not want to antagonise NCR. Instead, GDS was focused on whether there was a commercial agreement which might address the problem of GDS’s pipeline. Mr. Bisognin’s statement, in his MSN conversation with Mr. Kaparis on 31 January 2013, captures the essence of what was being discussed and what GDS was hoping for: “I hope obviously to find the right fair solution over the stock as discussed in NYC”. </p>

When NCR made its offer on 6 February, this was a without prejudice offer to take a certain volume of goods, but without any terms attached. Any acceptance of the offer was to be accompanied by a detailed shipment schedule. There was, however, no indication that any terms were to be attached to that offer, or what those terms were. There had not been any prior discussion or communication on the question of terms which would apply in the event that the parties were to reach agreement on the quantities that NCR wished to take and their proposed price. In fact, that remained the position until 20 February 2013, when the terms of the draft Letter Agreement were sent by NCR. </p>

These were not acceptable to NCR and the lengthy call on 8 February was rightly described by Mr. Gledhill as an impasse. At this stage, therefore, the parties were very far apart on the question of how much material in the pipeline NCR should be willing to take. The transcript of the call does not suggest that was any consensus as to the applicable terms if the parties were able to reach agreement on quantities to be taken by NCR. There was no discussion that this would be a final resolution of all disputes between the parties including any claims by GDS for false forecasting. It is in my view apparent from some of the somewhat belligerent comments made by Mr. Kaparis in the call, to the effect that he was not in the slightest concerned about GDS’s problems, that he had given no thought to the possibility that deceitful forecasts could give rise to a liability on the part of NCR. </p>

Those terms were set out, principally, in the third paragraph of the draft Letter Agreement. The material terms of the release and settlement in that paragraph were not materially altered thereafter.  This was, therefore, the first express outward expression of accord by the parties as to the terms of settlement and release.

The discussion between Mr. Kaparis and Mr. Bisognin on 8 February was concerned with the question: how much of the material in the pipeline will NCR take, and at what price? In the end, the parties were able to reach agreement on those issues in the Letter Agreement. Furthermore, when the first draft of the Letter Agreement was sent, the quantities in Exhibit 2 were described as a “last time buy purchase”. When the </p>

Indeed, Mr. Bisognin in his oral evidence referred to the parties negotiating for a “last time buy”. Curiously, NCR then omitted these words in the final version of the Letter Agreement. It seems likely that this was a consequence of the inclusion of the list of open purchase orders in the new Exhibit 3: it might have been thought that since these orders had been placed previously, and had not been cancelled, the expression “last time buy” was no longer appropriate. </p>

There is no claim for rectification other than a case whose effect is that all claims based on forecasts are precluded. NCR has not therefore advanced a more limited case for rectification whose effect would be to preclude some aspects of the damages claim advanced (eg for the balance of pipeline that was not purchased under the Letter Agreement), if not precluded on the true construction of the Letter Agreement. As discussed in Section E above, I am only presently concerned with the question of whether the effect of the Letter Agreement, whether by construction or rectification, precludes all claims in respect of false forecasts. The question of whether particular aspects of the damages claim are precluded, on the true construction of the Letter Agreement, is for later determination.  </p>

They had both been advised that the terms of the Letter Agreement put forward by NCR left open the possibility of claims based on forecasting, and they did not intend to contract on terms which closed off this potential right.

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses' motives, and to the overall probabilities, can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth." </p>

On 12 February 2013, Mr. Cohen complained to Mr. Cariolato that NCR had acted unprofessionally, and that he wished that GDS was in a stronger position. But “as much as it hurts me to say this I think it best to get as much out of NCR as possible, even if it </p>

Thus, on 12 February 2013, Mr. Cohen asked whether they could take the “$ 10 - $ 12m ASAP and then once we receive all of it, could we then take legal action?  This is no worse than what they have done to GDS”. At the time that this question was asked, GDS had not received any terms for the agreement, beyond those in NCR’s original 6 February 2013 offer.

He described this email as, in essence, seeking to prevent Mr. Cohen thinking that that there was any alternative to accepting NCR’s proposal, and therefore that they had to live with that reality.

The first paragraph of Mr. Frisby’s email sent at 1.10pm should in my view be read as a whole: he was there focusing on the duress claim rather than issues of interpretation of the Letter Agreement. But even if that is wrong, it was not long afterwards on that day that he specifically focused on the interpretation of the Letter Agreement, and gave clear advice to GDS that the possibility </p>

However, Mr. Bisognin’s emails show that he was unsure as to the effect of the Letter Agreement, although his focus at that time was not on forecasting claims but other issues. He said: “Let’s see what Michael [Frisby] says and then sign it”. Mr. Frisby then did advise, both orally (as recorded in his attendance note) and subsequently in writing (in his e-mail that evening) that it was arguable that forecasting claims were still open. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The advice that forecasting claims were arguably still open was initially given by Mr. Frisby to Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Swetman in a lengthy telephone call on 21 February. The advice went no further than indicating that there was a possibility of bringing claims, but also that it may be “affected by compromising the claims around the orders”. S&amp;B would need to look into that. There is nothing in the attendance note which indicates that Mr. Bisognin or Mr. Swetman told Mr Frisby that the possibility of leaving open the possibility of a claim was contrary to their intentions, or even that this advice took them by surprise. Mr. Bisognin had always been looking at the discussions with NCR as being directed towards a commercial agreement to take products. For example, in his email to Mr. Swetman on 13 February 2013, prior to GDS communicating its acceptance of NCR’s original proposal, he had expressed a concern that GDS was “moving toward a legal perspective instead of commercial”. I do not think that he had previously given any thought to the question of whether forecasting claims might remain possible, but was no doubt pleased to hear Mr. Frisby’s view that they might be. </p>

At this time, his focus was on trying to save the company and put the agreement with NCR to bed, and his original decision to accept NCR’s proposal was made because he had no real appetite for litigation. Even after the agreement had been concluded, GDS had no immediate appetite for litigation: on 1 March 2013, Mr. Frisby’s offer to explore the issue of whether or not any claims remain open was politely declined by Mr. Swetman because “the process would cost us and I do not have that mandate”. However, none of this leads to the conclusion that Mr. Cariolato’s intention was to enter into a more comprehensive agreement, which excluded all possibility of forecasting claims, notwithstanding the advice from Mr. Frisby that such claims might remain open. It would be strange, in the light of the advice received, for Mr. Cariolato or others in GDS to have intended to give up rights which, on advice, might remain open. I do not consider that either Mr. Cariolato or his colleagues did so intend. Their intention was to conclude an agreement on the terms proposed, subject to certain amendments of a relatively minor nature which were sent to NCR on the following morning.  </p>

My conclusion from the review of the evidence in Section D is that the focus of Mr. Kaparis, who was the individual responsible for leading the discussions with GDS, was upon the contractual position rather than any possible liability for dishonest forecasts. He had no relevant intention in relation to the latter, because the point was overlooked by him and his colleagues, all of whom were principally focused on the question of how much product they needed and could buy from GDS at an advantageous price. In my view, this is the likely explanation as to why the Letter Agreement was drafted in the way that it was. But whether or not that is so, I remind myself of the evidential burden that lies upon a party seeking to displace the cogent evidence that the signed document does indeed represent the mutual intention of the parties. That evidence has not been provided by NCR in this case. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyd v Stanbury</span>, there is here no evidence as to the nature of the instructions given by Mr. Kaparis to the legal adviser responsible for drafting the Letter Agreement, and no explanation at all of the reason why the Letter Agreement was drafted as it was. </p>

Mr. Delamater then comments: “I am not looking forward to this”. Mr. Kaparis then says: “Me neither – but I do want to put this behind me”. I do not read that comment, in context, as reflecting an intention to compromise all claims including forecasting claims. It is simply Mr. Kaparis recognising that the face-to-face meeting will be uncomfortable for NCR, and that Mr. Kaparis will be pleased when it is over.

His evidence that the intention on the NCR side was for a full and final settlement of all issues and potential claims between the parties is inconsistent with the contemporaneous documents, and is plainly unreliable. It is clear from, for example, the 20 February exchange between Mr. Kaparis and Mr. Bisognin, that there was no intention to settle (for example) NCR’s warranty FRO claims or the accounts payable. It is also clear that other liabilities would potentially remain and were not settled; for example, liabilities on the part of GDS for defects in products supplied previously or which were to be supplied under the Letter Agreement itself. </p>

In that case, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge, who had granted rectification for unilateral mistake, had erred in making a finding of dishonesty against the key witnesses of a party when a case of dishonesty had not been pleaded or put to the witnesses: see [34]. On appeal, Wimpey did not seek to rely upon the judge’s finding of dishonesty, but argued that it could rely upon a finding (in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, quoted at [25]) as to the requisite knowledge “shorn of any imputation of dishonesty in that reasoning”: see [28]. This led the court to consider whether the judge’s decision could be salvaged by reliance on paragraph 78 of the underlying judgment (see [34]), and thence to consideration of the question of whether dishonesty was a requirement for rectification in the context of a case where it was said that a party had wilfully shut his eyes to the obvious, or wilfully and recklessly failed to make such enquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make. </p>

The true distinction is between honesty and dishonesty. It is essentially a jury question. If a man does not draw the obvious inferences or make the obvious inquiries, the question is: why not? If it is because, however foolishly, he did not suspect wrongdoing or, having suspected it, had his suspicions allayed, however unreasonably, that is one thing. But if he did suspect wrongdoing yet failed to make inquiries because "he did not want to know" (category (ii)) or because he regarded it as "none of his business" (category (iii)), that is quite another.

Why, he asks, if rectification can be ordered if the non-mistaken party has actual knowledge of the mistaken party's mistake, but there is neither dishonesty nor sharp practice, should knowledge in categories (ii) and (iii), which is the equivalent in law of actual knowledge, involve dishonest behaviour for the purposes of rectification? I see force in that submission.

I do not accept that it is open to Wimpey to rely on the judge's finding in para. 78 that VIC had such knowledge but to say that such knowledge was without dishonesty or sharp practice where it is plain that the judge's remarks in para. 78 were permeated by his finding of dishonesty, which, because of C<span style="font-style:italic">ommission</span>, he thought was required.” </p>

There is nothing in that traffic which indicates that anyone on GDS’s side thought that NCR had made a mistake, or that any individual was deliberately shutting his eyes to something obvious. Mr. Frisby had been involved in advising GDS since prior to the New York meeting, and he was not coming fresh to the draft Letter Agreement. When Mr. Frisby advised in the afternoon of 21 February as to the possibility that a forecasting claim was left open, he said nothing to his clients to indicate that he thought that NCR had made a mistake, or that this was an issue which should be queried with NCR. I see no reason why GDS should themselves have drawn some different conclusion. His advice showed that he was uncertain as to the full impact, on potential claims, of a settlement referable to the “Orders”. It was an issue which would require further consideration if GDS wished to pursue matters further thereafter, but there was nothing to suggest that it needed to be considered by GDS further at that stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also relevant to consider the context in which GDS’s consideration of the draft Letter Agreement took place in that short period of time. The survival of GDS had been imperilled by NCR’s conduct and announcement in January. It was obviously a period of considerable stress for GDS’s principals, as the witnesses explained. Even with the acceptance of NCR’s offer, and the subsequent conclusion of an agreement, there was no guarantee that GDS would survive, although there was obviously hope that it could do so. There is also evidence that Mr. Cariolato was not well at the time, albeit that he was able to work and deal with matters in writing. GDS recognised that it was in a position where it had no real bargaining power, and that in practical terms NCR could dictate the terms of the proposed agreement. In these circumstances, I accept the evidence of Mr. Cariolato and Mr. Bisognin, when asked about what they were thinking about what NCR was thinking, to the effect that this was not something that they thought about. They had major problems of their own, and they were considering what changes they could propose to NCR without disrupting the urgent need to conclude the agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also important that the relevant events happened quickly, and at a time when GDS was anxious to conclude the agreement which was vital to its survival. The draft came in on 20 February, and the immediate need was for GDS to consider how, if at all, they could protect their position on issues which concerned them. Quite reasonably, they were not considering whether NCR had done enough to protect its own position. Given the background of hard-nosed conduct by NCR which was designed to serve its own interests, together with the fact that NCR had said that it had taken legal advice and that the Letter Agreement was clearly drafted with the benefit of legal input, it would not have occurred to the GDS individuals that NCR were making mistakes in the drafting. The natural assumption and reaction would be and in my view was: NCR had put forward the contract which they want. GDS knew that they had to agree to it without an extensive negotiation. In my view, this context makes it inherently probable that neither Mr. Cariolato nor Mr. Bisognin gave any real thought to the mistake which it is said that NCR made, and that neither shut their eyes to the obvious. </p>

NCR’s case on rectification for mutual mistake went so far as to suggest that, because Mr. Cariolato was determined to settle, he did not even read the full text of the relatively short e-mail that Mr. Frisby had sent. For reasons already given, I do not accept that this was so. Mr. Cariolato did read it, but his focus was on concluding the settlement as quickly as possible. Indeed, the internal correspondence shows that it had been GDS’s intention to send any comments back to NCR that night – hence the late exchange of e-mails. In the event, however, GDS’s response was only sent on the following morning. Mr. Cariolato would have noted the possibility that forecasting claims remained open to some degree, but this was not an important point to him since litigation was far from his mind. </p>

The House of Lords in that case was concerned with the question of whether the tort of intimidation did exist, and if so, what its requirements were and in particular whether it extended to a threat to break a contract. Thus, Lord Reid (at 1167) addressed the argument of the respondents (who were trade union officials) that there was no such tort as intimidation, and said that to cause loss “by threat to commit a tort against a third person if he does not comply with their demands is to use unlawful means to achieve their object”. At 1168, Lord Reid described the respondents as using a weapon which they knew would cause loss, namely a threat. He accepted the argument of the appellant that there was no difference in principle between a threat to break a contract and a threat to commit a tort.  </p>

Indeed, in practice I conceive a parallel would not be other than close with the case of one who, instead of breaking  a contract with his employer, assaulted him, and as a result (intended by the assaulting party) the employer disposed of the services of his servant. As in the case of the broken contract, the inference would no doubt be that unless the employer permanently severed his relations with his servant the third party would assault the employer again: and so a cause of action would fairly arise from the implied intimidation rather than from the actual assault.” </p>

It is also clear from page 1208 and in particular the passages underlined in the quotation below.

This means, it is argued, that if A threatens first, C has a cause of action; but if he strikes without threatening, C has no cause of action. I think that this also is fallacious. <span style="text-decoration:underline">What is</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">material to C's cause of action is the threat and B's submission to</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">it</span>.

Thus the reason why C can sue in one case and not in the other is because in one case he is injured and in the other he is not. The suggestion that it might pay A to strike without threatening negatives the hypothesis on which A is supposed to be acting. It must be proved that A's object is to injure C through the instrumentality of B. (That is why in the case of an "innocent" breach of contract which was remarked upon by Sellers L.J., that is, one into which A was forced by circumstances beyond his control, there could never be the basis of an actionable threat.) If A hits B without telling him why, he can hardly hope to achieve his object. Of course A might think it more effective to hit B first and tell him why afterwards. But if then B injures C, it would not be because B had been hit but because he feared that he might be hit again. <span style="text-decoration:underline">So if in the present case A.E.S.D. went on strike</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">without threatening, they would not achieve their object unless</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">they made it plain why they were doing so.

A threat is an intimation by one to another that unless the latter does or does not do something the former will do something which the latter will not like. The threat must be coercive, it must be of the “or else” kind. It must be capable of being effective, to produce the desired result, and be more than “idle abuse”, something to be taken seriously.  Furthermore, the concept is not limited to express threats; for there may be acts from which a threat can be implied, for example a strike begun without previous negotiation where the implication is clear that unless the employer does certain things the strike will be continued. So too, keeping a person as “virtually a slave”, in conditions of coercion as a domestic drudge, has been regarded as “intimidation”, perhaps because of the “implied threats of further assaults”.” </p>

It must be capable of being expressed in the form, "I will hit you unless you do what I ask," or "if you do what I forbid you to do." A bare threat without a demand does not to my mind amount to the tort of intimidation. If a man says to another, "I am going to hit you when I get you alone," it is undoubtedly a threat: and an injunction can be obtained to restrain him from carrying out his threat. But the threat itself does not give rise to a claim for damages. It is only when he delivers the blow that it is actionable: and then as an assault, not as intimidation.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Where a party alleges that he has been blackmailed, he is necessarily alleging that he has been threatened with adverse consequences if he does not do something (usually paying money). The potential difficulty in fitting all blackmail into the tort of intimidation does not arise from the absence of a threat, but rather that what the blackmailer has threatened to do may not in itself be unlawful (eg telling a victim’s wife that he has been having an affair). Blackmail may therefore, depending on the facts, give rise to an issue as to whether or not, for the purposes of intimidation, the relevant threat must be a threat of an unlawful act. This is an unresolved legal issue which is discussed in some detail in the textbooks: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Grant and Mumford: Civil Fraud </span>paragraphs [5-015] – [5-029]. </p>

He referred in that context to the <span style="font-style:italic">Godwin </span>decision. He then said (at [230]) that conduct “which amounts to blackmail is plainly both coercive and unlawful, even if what the blackmailer has threatened to do is not”.  </p>

Where there is blackmail, there is necessarily a threat. The case is therefore no support for the idea that the making of a threat is not an essential ingredient of the tort of intimidation. Instead, it supports the proposition that where the making of the threat is itself unlawful, because it amounts to blackmail, that is a sufficient threat for the purposes of the tort of intimidation. </p>

Leggatt LJ held in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Nehayan </span>(at [224]) that conduct which entitled a party to rescind a contract for duress would not necessarily give rise to a claim in tort. He agreed with Sales J in <span style="font-style:italic">Investec </span>that facts amounting to the tort of intimidation would need to be pleaded, unless there was some other basis for claiming damages. <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell </span>say (at [2369]) that the better view is that economic duress does not itself amount to a tort. </p>

As far as the period up to 16 January 2013 was concerned, GDS could not identify any explicit or implicit threat, or conduct amounting to such a threat. That is because NCR’s intentions were hidden from GDS, with the ordering and forecasting process proceeding broadly as normal. However, GDS submitted that NCR’s conduct up to that time was unlawful, and intended to place GDS in a position where it had no bargaining power, so that GDS would be coerced into accepting terms offered by NCR, and to cause loss – this being a necessary part of NCR’s plan, including as the other side to the coin of NCR’s gain in relation to any negotiations.

The cancellation of purchase orders was not capable of being a threat, because it was not an action coupled with a demand that GDS do something. It was something that NCR had already done, unilaterally. NCR was not saying that it would cancel purchase orders unless GDS signed the Letter Agreement.

This was not therefore a discussion starting as a result of NCR threatening GDS with adverse consequences if GDS did not enter into those discussions or conclude an advantageous agreement. Whilst it is true that NCR had internally contemplated prior to 16 January that there might be a discussion and negotiation in relation to the purchase orders which had been cancelled, NCR does not appear to have initiated any such discussion.

The discussions at the New York meeting are described in Section D above. No demand or threat was made. The upshot of the meeting was that GDS was to provide certain information to NCR, which was to consider what if anything it was prepared to offer. The question was whether NCR would be willing to take any goods over and above those to be supplied under purchase orders which had not been cancelled. At the time of the New York meeting, NCR had not offered to take any, and GDS’s representatives were uncertain after the meeting whether any offer would be forthcoming. There is, however, no suggestion in the inter partes or internal correspondence that NCR was making any threat, or that GDS understood that NCR was making any threat or indeed any demand. Instead, there was a request by NCR for factual information concerning the pipeline which would be relevant to NCR’s decision as to what, if any, goods to take. </p>

There was then an impasse reflected in the discussions which took place between Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Kaparis in the recorded 8 February phone call.  Essentially, Mr. Kaparis was saying that NCR had reached its limit, although he put forward possible suggestions as to the timing of deliveries. In its closing submissions, GDS submitted that, in the phone call, “Mr. Kaparis had threatened [GDS] into accepting the offer on the table by reference to [GDS’s] lack of negotiating strength”, and that NCR made it clear to GDS that its offer was all that was realistically available at that stage.  </p>

There comes a point in all discussions where one party says to the other: “this is as far as I am prepared to go, and if the offer is unacceptable then there is no deal”. But I do not consider that such statements can be regarded as a threat for the purposes of the tort of intimidation. They represent a statement of one party’s negotiating position, namely that he is not prepared to make an improved offer. They do not demand that the other party do something: they simply indicate that if the other party wishes to have an agreement, then it must accept the offer on the table and cannot hope for anything better. </p>

No case was advanced, rightly in my view, that NCR was under an existing contractual obligation to buy all the goods which were contemplated by the forecasts or which formed part of GDS’s pipeline. NCR’s contractual obligations for the purchase of goods extended, at most, to those purchase orders (priced at US$ 5.1 million) which had been cancelled. However, the parties were not negotiating about, or at least only about, the cancelled purchase orders, but instead were engaged in a discussion concerning the wider pipeline and the volume of goods that NCR was prepared to take in circumstances where there was no existing contractual obligation to take all of that pipeline. As NCR correctly submitted, there was nothing unlawful or illegitimate, in that context, in NCR declining to buy any particular volume of products, or declining to pay higher prices than it was prepared to offer. </p>

In fact, Mr. Kaparis in the course of the negotiations made it clear that he was working on having those accounts paid. Nor was there any threat to amend the forecasts to zero unless GDS did something. The forecasts had been amended to zero unilaterally on 16 January, without any demand being made. NCR was also right to say that there was nothing unlawful or even illegitimate about NCR not buying that which NCR had not committed to buy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view, the closest that GDS came to establishing a potentially relevant threat was the fact that NCR had made it clear that it was not willing to take and pay for the products which were the subject of the cancelled purchase orders.

In my view, NCR did not have a contractual entitlement to cancel all of the purchase orders which were cancelled on 16 January 2013. That alleged entitlement depended upon NCR’s case that terms and conditions allegedly found in various purchase orders overrode the terms of the Purchase Agreement between the parties. I reject that case. However, that does not establish a case in the tort of intimidation for the following reasons.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the cancellation of the purchase orders was not accompanied by any threat or demand. NCR was simply making it plain that it was not going to take certain products which it had previously ordered. In so doing, NCR were no doubt committing an anticipatory breach of contract or contracts. However, an anticipatory breach of contract is an intimation that a party will not perform a contract in the future. It is not in itself a threat, although there may be cases in which it may be accompanied by a threat express or implied. But that is not what happened here. In the present case, the orders were unilaterally cancelled without any demand, whether to enter into the Letter Agreement or otherwise. It was approximately a month after the unilateral cancellation that the parties finally agreed on the terms of the Letter Agreement. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, even if the cancellation could be construed as embodying a threat, other requirements of the tort of intimidation were not made out in this respect. When NCR cancelled the orders, and reduced the forecasts to zero, there is no evidence to suggest that its representatives understood that they were making a threat. Their strategy was to present GDS with a fait accompli on 16 January, and they demanded nothing from GDS at that stage, save only to express the hope and request that the parties cooperate on the transition. In those circumstances, the second requirement in <span style="font-style:italic">Berezovsky,</span> that the threat is intended to coerce the claimant to take or refrain from taking some course of action, is not made out.  I therefore accept NCR’s case that it did not understand itself to be making any threat, and did not intend GDS to be coerced by any threat. In its actions following the New York meeting, NCR was trying to achieve an orderly transition and obtain such further product as it needed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Similarly, the third requirement, that the threat in fact coerces the claimant to take such action, is not made out. My focus is again, here, on the cancellation of orders. These orders were worth US$ 5.1 million. GDS’s problems, arising from the 16 January 2013 phone call, were very substantially greater than that. The real problem which GDS was </p>

The effect of the evidence of both Mr. Bisognin and Mr. Cariolato was that GDS’s decision to enter into the Letter Agreement was forced upon them by the overall situation in which GDS found itself in consequence of NCR’s announcement on 16 January 2013. I do not consider that either of them perceived NCR as having made any threat, or were reacting to any threat which had been made by NCR, still less a threat concerning the cancellation of orders. They were instead reacting to a threat of a different kind, namely the very real threat to the survival of the company as a result of the situation in which they found themselves in consequence of NCR’s announcement. That is not, however, a relevant threat for the purposes of the tort of intimidation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Furthermore, any claim of intimidation based upon any threat to cancel the orders would fail the “but for” test of causation which is applicable in cases other than threats of violence: see <span style="font-style:italic">Al Nehayan </span>at [233]. In my view, GDS would still have concluded the Letter Agreement on the same terms even in the absence of any (alleged) threat to cancel the orders, because the Letter Agreement was beneficial and required in order to alleviate the overall problem caused by the existence of the significant pipeline. This is demonstrated by the fact that the amounts to be received under the Letter Agreement exceeded by over US$ 2.5 million the amounts payable in respect of the cancelled orders. </p>

NCR relied, for example, upon the fact that GDS was a substantial company, that its main shareholder Mr. Cariolato was likely to be a wealthy individual, that additional credit lines may have been available in the event that NCR did not pay the accounts receivable, that it was receiving legal advice which indicated the favourable prospect of litigation, and similar matters.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view, however, NCR’s deceitful conduct, followed by its announcement on 16 January 2013, did put GDS into a dire position from which its only practical and realistic alternative was to accept the best terms that NCR would offer to take goods within the pipeline off its hands. It is clear from Mr. Cariolato’s evidence that his perception was that the future existence of GDS, and with it the jobs and livelihood of many employees, was in serious jeopardy. A notable feature of the case is that this evidence, as to the existential threat to GDS, was shared by Mr. Kaparis himself, as is evident from his “toast” e-mail on 18 January 2013. Similarly, on 4 February 2013, he told his colleagues that they were on a “short fuse to make this offer to GDS before they close their doors due to lack of liquidity on their part”. The recorded conversation on 8 February contains statements from Mr. Kaparis as to his knowledge that GDS had no bargaining power – a proposition from which Mr. Bisognin did not dissent in that call. NCR’s internal correspondence after that conversation reflects the fact that their senior individuals knew that they simply had to sit tight, and GDS would have to accept their proposal. This is exactly what happened. The evidence on both sides, as to the lack of a realistic alternative, is therefore essentially the same. I therefore reject NCR’s case that, as Mr. Gledhill put it in closing, GDS had other viable options. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As far as concerns NCR’s defence of justification: I could not see how, if there were threats of unlawful or illegitimate conduct after 16 January 2013, these could be justified by any of the matters on which NCR relied. The heart of NCR’s justification case concerned the alleged justification for deceiving or conspiring against GDS in the period up to 16 January, because of the alleged fear of retaliation by GDS. Even in that context, I do not consider (for the reasons given in Section C above) that there was any justification for NCR’s approach, so as to provide a defence to the conspiracy claim. The case is, however, even less tenable after 16 January 2013, by which time NCR’s plans and intentions had been fully revealed to GDS. Indeed, Mr. Gledhill fairly acknowledged that the case of justification was more realistically focused on the period prior to 16 January 2013, and that the difficulty in fitting justification into the period thereafter was largely created by the fact that there was in fact no threat.  </p>

In its closing submission, under the heading “Continuing influence of the deceit”, GDS invited the court to find that GDS was induced to enter into the Letter Agreement by NCR’s deceit. It said that although GDS was aware when entering into that agreement that NCR had deliberately deceived them, GDS had been placed in such a poor position by that deceit that it felt that it had no option but to enter into the Letter Agreement. These arguments, in the same manner as the intimidation claim, were aimed at nullifying the effect of the Letter Agreement.

The Letter Agreement therefore stands, and continues to exist, as a valid contract and must be applied in accordance with its terms: see Section E above. If the effect of the agreement, including its release provisions, is to prevent GDS from advancing certain claims in fraud or conspiracy, then that is simply a consequence of the agreement that has been concluded. Although arguments have been advanced as to the scope of the agreement and the release, it has rightly not been suggested that its comprehensive language is insufficiently wide to embrace potential claims in deceit or conspiracy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Furthermore, there is in any event no basis for a conclusion that GDS was induced to enter into the Letter Agreement by NCR’s deceit or conspiracy. As GDS acknowledges, it believed and was aware when it entered into the Letter Agreement that NCR had deceived it. The fact that it felt that it had no option but to enter into the Letter Agreement does not mean that the agreement was a consequence of the deceit. Rather, it was a consequence of GDS’s lack of bargaining power, and the fact that it took the decision to compromise its rights in accordance with the terms of the Letter Agreement. Neither of these matters enables GDS to escape from the terms to which it agreed. Inequality of bargaining power is not a basis for invalidating a binding agreement, and compromises and releases of claims for fraud or other serious tortious conduct are permissible and commonplace.  </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription"><span> </span>After receipt of the draft judgment, Mr. Gledhill QC invited me, in an e-mail sent on 27 April 2021, to consider whether there were points made in his written and oral submissions (particularly the latter) which warranted being addressed in Section J. Those points concerned the facts which were relied upon in support of the “justification” case. Reference was made to certain documents which were relied upon as showing that NCR </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Subjectively, the conduct was calculated by NCR to make a profit for themselves which might well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff. NCR did not carry out a precise calculation. But their course of conduct was designed to put NCR in the best possible economic position during the period of false forecasting: in particular, by preventing GDS from taking advantage of any bargaining power that they might enjoy during the ramp down period. It was also designed to put NCR in the best possible economic position as and when the time came to reveal its decision to GDS. As set out in Mr. Kaparis’s “toast” e-mail, NCR perceived that the likely consequence of its conduct was that GDS would go belly-up. Mr. Kaparis clearly believed that NCR would have no liability for the consequences of GDS having large stocks on its hands or going belly up: as discussed in Section F above, NCR gave no thought to the possibility that false forecasting might gave rise to any adverse consequences in terms of possible liability. Mr. Kaparis also contemplated prior to the 16 January call that there might be a negotiation with GDS about the cancelled purchase orders, and he would have recognised – as the “toast” e-mail indicates – that GDS would have no negotiating strength as a result of the way in which NCR had engineered its approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Similarly, if one considers the facts objectively rather than by reference to NCR’s subjective approach, NCR’s conduct was objectively likely to result in a profit which might well exceed any compensation payable. If a company has been reduced to a state where it will likely go belly-up, the prospect that it will be able to engage in potentially expensive litigation to recover losses will recede significantly. In addition, it is likely to result in the situation which in fact happened in the present case, where the difficulties in which GDS had been placed meant that NCR could obtain substantial discounts for products which it wanted and could dictate the terms on which it acquired those products.  </p>

Mr. Gledhill recognised that the facts in relation to justification were addressed in the judgment, but drew attention to the absence of any reference to those facts in relation to exemplary damages. Again (see footnote 1), this seemed to me to be an impermissible attempt to reargue the case. Nevertheless, following receipt of Mr. Gledhill’s e-mail, I reviewed the relevant parts of my judgment, and the principal documents referred to in Mr. Gledhill’s e-mail including his written and oral submissions. Having done so, I saw no reason to consider altering my fact findings in relation to justification, nor my conclusion in relation to exemplary damages. In my view, the absence of a cross-reference in the exemplary damages section of the judgment to earlier findings, where the issue of justification and the facts are considered in detail, is not a point of significance. I had rejected NCR’s case of justification, and it was not necessary to refer back to that rejection in the later section of the judgment. I had addressed the facts relating to the alleged justification for NCR’s conduct in detail earlier in my judgment, and had concluded (amongst other things) that I did not accept that there was any justification, whether in fact or by way of a legal defence, for NCR’s provision of false forecasts: paragraph [43]. My conclusions on the facts are contained within paragraphs [123] – [151], including my conclusion that the possibility that GDS would cease supply was not regarded as a major risk, at least by the decision-makers Mr. Delamater and Mr. Ciminera.  </span>

None of these matters in the present case leads to the conclusion that there should be no award.  </p>

I therefore award £ 125,000 as exemplary damages. This seems to me to be a relatively small fraction of the economic benefit which NCR enjoyed as a result of deceitful conduct which took place over a considerable period of time. In <span style="font-style:italic">Axa</span>, where the fraud was on a much smaller scale, the award was £ 20,000. An award of £ 125,000 is a sum which in my view is principled and proportionate. </p>
