If the defence is made out as a matter of Russian law, then it seems to me that that is the end of the matter and there is no scope to overlay any consideration of the merits. Professor Asoskov agreed in cross examination that the policy with which the law of limitation is concerned, is not only looking at the interests of the claimant but is also looking at the interest of the defendants in creating certainty and finality and in the interests of the administration of justice to ensure that stale claims are not being litigated.

But we have no support for it and so the question: why?  And the answer is simple: because the law didn't provide for it.  The law was different, maybe unfair, but the courts must follow the law.  They cannot just take a fair decision against the law because it would be unlawful judgment.  So therefore we don't have -- well, Asokov argument is that even before the reform we had the unified case law about this issue, but Asokov didn't refer to any case law with regard to tort cases, so the question: why?

In my view paragraphs (i) (ii) and (iv) can be seen as articulating the elements of the tort in that they refer to gaining control over Taiz and Tekhnoprogress, causing UTN to inject the funds and placing the intermediaries into bankruptcy. However as discussed above, it is not necessary to articulate the “means” by which the defendants caused the harm provided that the claimant can identify the causal nexus. Thus in my view it is not necessary for the claimant to have knowledge of the details of how the funds had been transferred through the Ukrainian and offshore companies in order to know of the relevant violation of rights. Paragraph (iii) is therefore in my view not necessary in order to have knowledge of the relevant violation of rights provided that there is knowledge of the causal link. If the claimant knew of the payment out of the intermediaries for the benefit of the defendants and the causal link between the payment out of the intermediaries and the harm to SK, it did not need to know about the mechanics of the payments through the sham transactions. It was sufficient if the claimant knew that there had been a misappropriation of funds by diverting money from Taiz and Tekhnoprogress for the defendants' own financial benefit.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The events with which the court is concerned occurred in 2007-2015. The claim was first lodged in 2016. This means that witness statements date in some cases back to 2016 but even these statements were seeking to recall events which in some material instances had occurred 5 or more years before. When giving oral evidence witnesses were being asked to recall conversations that occurred as far back as 2008. In relation to the issue of limitation the problem is particularly acute as the court is concerned to determine the knowledge of Tatneft and SK at particular dates and is seeking therefore to draw conclusions as to knowledge of particular facts when it is unlikely that a witness will recall such level of detail even if an event is recalled. Further in this case the witnesses had the additional disadvantage in that there appears to be almost a complete absence of documentary evidence in the form of letters and emails (both external and internal) between SK and Tatneft relating to the material issues before the court to assist their recall and the court's determination of the issues- there are almost no emails before the court which relate to relevant events and in addition there is a dearth of corporate minutes and other internal records. The reasons for, and the significance of the absence of these documents to the issue of limitation are considered below, but the starting point must be that purely due to the passage of time the court must consider the contemporaneous documents that do exist and will place more weight on these documents than the testimony of witnesses (particularly oral testimony) many years later. This appears to me to be self-evident but to the extent authority for this approach is required it is to be found in the judgment of Leggatt J in <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin SGPS v Credit Suisse (UK)</span> [2013] EWHC 3560 (Comm). </p>

I was afraid that there could also be negative consequences for the reputation of Tatneft.

It was in the interests of Tatneft that he should present evidence which supported Tatneft's case, there are clearly instances where he sought to do this in the face of documentary evidence to the contrary and there is in my view a real likelihood that, irrespective of the true position, this is what he did on the material issues.

It is clear from these articles that there were two partners who controlled Privat Group and they were Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. Since these are footnote references to lengthy pleadings, the principals at Tatneft are unlikely in my view to have read all the articles. However, Cleary Gottlieb (who were then acting for Tatneft) would be aware of their contents and, given the numerous references to Privat and the role of Mr Bogolyubov in those articles and the clearly held belief of Tatneft that Privat Group was behind the Scheme, it is highly unlikely that Cleary Gottlieb would not have drawn Tatneft's attention to the fact that Privat Group was widely believed (and publicly reported) to be a partnership between Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. </p>

I do not accept that there is any evidence which supports the submission (paragraph 1222 of closing submissions) that Tatneft did not have access to the contents of the interviews but was only aware of the "gist". Contrary to the submission for Tatneft, in my view the complaint made by Mr Konov as to the conduct of the interview does not show that Tatneft did not get access to the interviews from the criminal files (even if Mr Konov himself did not have access to the interview transcript). </p>

In my view an adverse inference is to be drawn in the circumstances from the absence of Ms Savelova that goes to strengthen the evidence on the issue of whether Tatneft had knowledge of the Scheme and whether it is likely that Ms Savelova would have shared Tatneft's knowledge of the Scheme and the defendants' involvement in it with S-K, particularly in the context of discussing the enforcement of the Tatarstan Judgment in Ukraine.  </p>

However, the court is here concerned with the second principle and in my view, it is not correct to characterise this case as one where only one party has relevant evidence. It is the case that the testimony of witnesses on the issue of knowledge are all witnesses called by Tatneft. However, the court is weighing the testimony of the witnesses for Tatneft as well as the contemporaneous documentary evidence which does exist and the other relevant background circumstances to reach a conclusion as to whether it is likely that SK had the relevant knowledge. Accordingly, where the court is weighing whether the evidence as a whole establishes that SK is likely to have had knowledge of relevant matters, in my view the presumption operates as a factor which the court can take into account in assessing what has occurred. </p>

In particular, I remember Ms Savelova mentioning that Mr Kolomoisky practically admitted that the Privat Group and Mr Yaroslavsky, another Ukrainian oligarch, were behind the reinstatement of Mr Ovcharenko and after his reinstatement they were directing UTN’s operations and decisions. Ms Savelova also mentioned that Mr Kolomoisky confirmed that Privat Group controlled in some way the bankruptcy of the Ukrainian intermediaries.

Tatneft therefore had decided to file a complaint to the investigation authorities requesting that they initiate criminal proceedings in connection with embezzlement of funds for oil by directors of Ukrainian intermediaries. N.U. Maganov asked that S-K join Tatneft in filing the criminal complaint since neither Tatneft, nor S-K had received the oil monies. N.U. Maganov had brought the prepared criminal complaint with him and we signed it together. I briefly read the document before I signed it. Once R.V. Gubaidullin was back at the office I informed him of what had happened during my meeting with N.U. Maganov. I did not discuss my signing of the criminal complaint with R.V.

So far as I was concerned I was simply going to provide some assistance to Tatneft in resolving this matter.

As early as June 2009 Tatneft referred to the payments to the accounts of Taiz and Tekhnoprogress as unlawful and having features of financial machinations. The source of the funds for the payment is not an element of the tort for the purposes of knowledge. Similarly, as discussed above, Tatneft had made the link to Korsan and coincidence with the amount paid for the stake in UTN by January 2010 when Mr Maganov was interviewed and is also evident from the April memorandum so any lack of knowledge of the intervening steps did not affect the ability of Tatneft to bring its claim within the limitation period. </p>

The imposition of prescription and limitation periods inevitably involve balancing competing public and individual interests. In particular, it involves balancing the public interest in valid claims being litigated and legal wrongs being righted with the public interest in claims not lingering over the heads of potential defenders and claims not being difficult to dispose of justly due to their antiquity. Similarly, it is an area which throws up another, familiar, tension: on the one hand, it is desirable to have general and clear rules about limitation, even if they occasionally appear to produce a harsh result; on the other hand, it is sometimes appropriate to have specific exceptions to avoid too many unfairnesses. I see no particular policy reasons for adopting either interpretation in the present case, as each of them seems to me to result in a defensible and appropriate outcome. </p>

In my view, the legislature could perfectly reasonably have assumed that in almost every case, five years from the date of discovery of loss, injury or damage would represent plenty of time for the injured party to discover all he needs to know to bring proceedings. The fact that there may be a very rare case where five years may not be enough is simply an example of the inevitable consequence of the compromise which limitation law involves. After all, even under the interpretation favoured by Lord Hodge there could be potential unfairnesses in individual and unusual cases, sometimes to pursuers and sometimes to defenders.” </p>

That is obviously true in the field of limitation law, which involves striking a balance between allowing claimants to assert their legal rights and protecting defendants against stale claims. Different legal systems may legitimately strike this balance in different ways. An English court should for this reason be very slow to substitute its own view for the solution adopted by the foreign legislature.”  </p>

In other cases, the claimant, aware it had been caused unlawful harm, was on notice to use the limitation period to identify the proper defendant. That is not fundamentally unjust. In this case I have already discussed the issue of whether the defendants’ actions amounted to deliberate concealment and in my view, this is not a case where concealment has resulted in an action becoming time barred. </p>

Against that background as discussed above, they nevertheless presented a <span style="font-style:italic">“consistent”</span> narrative of <span style="font-style:italic">“speculation”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“theory”</span> when it appeared that their assertions that Tatneft and/or SK lacked knowledge conflicted with the evidence of the contemporaneous documents. One might ask why the witnesses presented such a consistent picture.

Tatneft has not nailed its </span>claim solely to the mast of the 2008 Assignment Agreement but is saying that the money for the oil should have reached S-K by whatever route was appropriate. If the defendants want to rely on the 2008 Assignment Agreement as a matter of defence and to say that UTN’s debt was discharged by payment to Tekhnoprogress and Taiz, that defence can be pleaded and can be tried but the claim (that payment for the oil was stolen by the defendants) cannot now be said to be bound to fail. Indeed one wonders if the defendants are likely to plead that Tatneft’s claim is destroyed by the assignment when the position may well be (1) that it was the defendants themselves who procured the Ukrainian courts to hold that the assignment was invalid and (2) that the consequence of that plea would be that the contractual chain remained inviolate.” [emphasis added] </p>
