	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Between June 2016 and June 2017 Biosol supplied, installed and commissioned ten biomass boilers for R&amp;A at the Property pursuant to a series of contracts.  The boilers were supplied and commissioned in four groups: Boilers 1 and 2; Boilers 3 and 4; Boilers 5, 6 and 7; and Boilers 8, 9 and 10. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In these proceedings, Biosol makes three claims against R&amp;A: first, £371,987.30 in respect of the balance of the price for the boilers; second, £310,602.74 for ancillary works to facilitate the installation of the boilers and for the supply of woodchip; third, damages for the loss of profit on a separate contract for maintenance of the boilers and the supply of woodchip; the lost profit is said to be £661,358. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">R&amp;A denies liability on the claims.  As well as raising particular contractual disputes on the second and third claims, it contends more generally that it is entitled to exercise a right of abatement or set-off in respect of matters raised on its counterclaim.  The counterclaim alleges that Biosol (a) induced R&amp;A to enter the contracts for the supply, installation and commissioning of the boilers by misrepresentations as to their performance and capacity, (b) was in breach of a common law duty to exercise reasonable care in making recommendations as to the installation of the boilers, and (c) was in breach of various contractual obligations and warranties.  R&amp;A counterclaims damages in excess of £6,000,000.  The counterclaim is denied in its entirety by Biosol. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The three defendants (I shall sometimes refer to them as “the partners”) formed R&amp;A in 2008.  Mr Lovering is an experienced businessman in several fields, including telecommunications, IT solutions and water purification, and he was the partner who had the main involvement in the matters with which the case is concerned.  Mr Pickering is well known as a former rugby union player and administrator.  He also had some involvement in the dealings with Biosol, though to a lesser extent than Mr Lovering.  They both gave evidence at the trial.  Mr Preece had no material involvement and did not give evidence.  At the time in question, all three partners were also directors of a company called Hydro Industries Limited.  That company is not directly concerned with the matter of the proceedings, but it occupied a unit at the Property and is sometimes referred to in that connection. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Two other people feature prominently in the narrative.  Mr Ceri Golding was employed by Biosol until the summer of 2017.  He was R&amp;A’s initial point of contact with Biosol, and he was closely involved with most of the relevant discussions and agreements.  When he left Biosol’s employment, he went onto R&amp;A’s payroll, though he has not been in their employ since 2019.  He did not give evidence.  Mr James Partridge was the sole member and director of JBP Industries Limited (“JBPI”), which was incorporated in May 2014 and provides consultancy services for biomass heating systems.  Mr Partridge was never employed by Biosol, though at one stage there was talk of forming a joint venture between JBPI and Biosol, but Biosol used him as a sub-contracting consultant in respect of some of the technical design and commissioning work for biomass systems.  Mr Partridge was accredited by Fröling, the boiler manufacturer, as an approved engineer for its boilers; he says that it was only through him that Biosol was able to obtain Fröling products and even discounted prices on them, although Mr Bundock denies that.  Mr Partridge gave evidence at trial on behalf of R&amp;A. </p>

At the time material to these proceedings the RHI Scheme operated pursuant to The Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2011, as amended, which were made pursuant to the Energy Act 2008 and came into force in November 2011.  (The 2008 Regulations were revoked on 22 May 2018 by The Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2018.  Nothing turns on this for present purposes.)  The Regulations established eligibility criteria for various forms of installation, including biomass heating systems.  Payments accrue from a “tariff start date” and are payable for a 20-year period in accordance with the applicable tariffs, which are liable to adjustment each year in accordance with the Retail Price Index for the previous calendar year.  Tariff payments are categorised by the capacity of the installation and, subject to the annual adjustments, are fixed for the 20-year period.  For installations in commercial use, the Regulations provide a tariff for “the initial heat” generated in a 12-month period (“Tier 1”) and a lower tariff for all further heat generated in that period (“Tier 2”).  The “initial heat” means the heat in kWh generated by an accredited installation running at the equivalent of its installation capacity for 1,314 hours (so that, for example, a boiler running at half of its capacity would generate the “initial heat” in 2,628 hours).  All of the systems supplied by Biosol to R&amp;A were medium commercial biomass systems, being systems with a capacity of 200kW and above but less than 1MW.  The applicable Tier 1 tariffs were 5.24p per kWh and 5.32p per kWh.</p>

In the case of heated buildings, the tenants bore the heating costs.

Neil Bundock’s evidence was that both Mr Golding and Mr Lovering told him that Mr Golding had previously worked for Mr Lovering.  Mr Lovering’s evidence was that Mr Golding had not worked for him and that they had not known each other previously, and that he had not said anything to the contrary to Mr Bundock.  However, I prefer Mr Bundock’s evidence as to what Mr Lovering told him and I accept Mr Bundock’s evidence that Mr Golding claimed to have worked previously for Mr Lovering.  It is probable, therefore, that Mr Golding had indeed worked for Mr Lovering.  Whether that work was as an employee or as a self-employed contractor or consultant, and whether Mr Bundock is right that the work was for Hydro Industries (as was his recollection) or for R&amp;A (as he seemed to think possible in the alternative), is a matter of no importance in itself. </p>

I find that Mr Pickering was also present, at least for the formal part of the meeting, although his evidence was that he was not present.  I find that Mr Partridge was not present and that he did not meet any of the partners before 2016.  Mr Lovering showed Mr Bundock and Mr Golding around the Property.  There is some conflict of evidence as to the nature of the interest expressed by R&amp;A at the meeting: Mr Lovering says that he made clear that he was especially interested in the provision of a biomass system for Building 200; Neil Bundock, however, says that he was told that R&amp;A wanted to put a biomass boiler into each of the 22 buildings at the Property and that he had to explain that this would not be feasible.  I find that Mr Lovering did say that R&amp;A wanted a heating solution for all 22 buildings (cf. para 25 of his first statement) but he emphasised Building 200 as a priority, and that Mr Bundock told him that it was not feasible to put a boiler into each building.  Anyway, by the end of the meeting the focus was squarely on Building 200.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A more important issue concerns the expressed purposes for which R&amp;A wanted to consider biomass heating.  Mr Lovering’s evidence was that, from the initial meetings and throughout their discussions with Neil Bundock and Mr Golding, he and Mr Pickering made clear that their interest in a biomass system was due to their wish to heat the buildings at the Property efficiently; they were having problems with the existing system, and the cost of gas was proving prohibitive.  He said that Neil Bundock assured him that the biomass system would be reliable and more efficient, heating the buildings at lower fuel costs, and that R&amp;A would make “loads of money” out of the system.  Mr Bundock’s evidence was that heating efficiency was not a concern of R&amp;A: the twin aims stated to him were to make money out of RHI payments and to reduce fuel costs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On this point I accept Mr Bundock’s evidence.  This is partly because he is a more reliable witness than Mr Lovering or Mr Pickering.  It is mainly, however, because of what the other factual evidence shows, as regards both the position at the time of the initial contact and the events that transpired thereafter.  The partners’ interest in biomass originated not from any concern about heating in particular but from their desire to put money into an investment that would give them a good return.  The acquisition of biomass boilers was one of two alternative (not cumulative) investment schemes they were considering; the other related to the possible acquisition of another business.  The attraction of biomass heating systems was the opportunity it gave for a return under the RHI Scheme.  An incidental advantage of biomass heating was that it would reduce the fuel costs as compared with the production of similar heat by means of fossil fuels.  I accept that this incidental advantage was attractive to the partners—it was mentioned to Mr Bundock—but it was, as I say, incidental: the tenants bore the heating costs; cheaper heating costs might make the premises more attractive to prospective tenants, but there is little evidence to suggest that this was a major factor in the partners’ thinking.  The subsequent narrative shows that the most important factor was the prospect of generating income from the RHI Scheme: this runs through the later documentation, and there is plenty of evidence that the partners ran the boilers with a view to maximising the production of heat, regardless of efficiency (for example, they did not complete the insulation of the pipework after Biosol left the site) or of the requirements of the tenants who occupied the buildings.  I am satisfied that the partners did not identify “the efficient heating of the buildings” as their purpose or concern.  They were obviously not particularly interested in “efficiency” in a technical sense (such as: the units of heat generated per unit of fuel) or even in the sense of ensuring that just enough heat but no more than was necessary would be produced.  They were interested in making money, primarily by maximising revenue through the RHI Scheme and secondarily by minimising expenditure (which would principally be a matter relating to the attractiveness of the units to prospective tenants).  Obviously, however, as the installation of biomass heating was plainly intended as an investment, it is impossible that outlay on capital and finance costs was unimportant, because the expected RHI payments would have to be weighed against the costs necessary to achieve them: that is, there had to be an attractive return on the investment. </p>

I think it unlikely that Mr Bundock offered any projections for a return on investment at this stage, though it is very likely that he emphasised the financial benefits of a biomass system, as any salesman would. </p>

I doubt whether this was “agreed”, in the sense of constituting from the outset a unilateral contract, but I accept that this was the basis of discussions at this point and became the basis of future trade between the parties. </p>

Mr Lovering’s evidence was that he could not remember whether he paid any attention to the signatures; they were consistent with his existing understanding at the time. </p>

The meeting was not very productive.  After the meeting Mr Bundock came to the conclusion that Mr Lovering and Mr Pickering were focusing on Proposal 1, whereas he had been focusing on Proposal 2, and he sent them an email explaining that he thought they had been at cross-purposes and attaching Proposal 2 again.  I am not persuaded that Mr Bundock’s conclusion was correct: if he had believed during the meeting that R&amp;A were looking at the wrong Proposal, he would have been able to address the problem then.  Mr Lovering accepted in cross-examination that he examined Proposal 2 carefully, and I see no reason to doubt that he did so when he first received it.  At all events, the Proposals under consideration and discussion at that time were for 4 boilers serving 3 units (Proposal 1) and for 2 boilers for 2 units (Proposal 2). </p>

Further meetings with Mr Bundock took place in the middle to later part of November 2015.  According to Mr Lovering, in the face of reluctance to commit on the part of R&amp;A, Neil Bundock became “more and more pushy” (a word used also by Mr Pickering) in his efforts to emphasise the benefits of the proposed system.  That evidence comes from a particular perspective, but it may certainly be accepted that Mr Bundock was a salesman looking to make a sale. </p>

On the same day, Neil Bundock provided to Mr Lovering contact details for the finance companies that Biosol dealt with.  He asked for Mr Lovering’s permission to pass on his contact details to those companies. Mr Lovering duly gave his permission.  There was at this stage no contractual commitment on the part of R&amp;A to proceed; clearly, however, the partners were actively looking for finance for a biomass system. </p>

If that evidence be taken on its face, the most likely date for the production of the document will in my view have been one of the later November meetings rather than the December meeting.  The Summary is a one-page document headed by the Biosol name and logo.  Beneath the heading is a table setting out projected annual income and savings from the use of different sizes of biomass boiler.  For a 250kW boiler the income from RHI payments is shown as £59,533.95 and the total financial benefit, after taking into account savings on the cost of fuel, is shown as £128,270.45.  The corresponding figures for a 500kW boiler are £119,067.90 (pointed to by Mr Lovering as corresponding to the figure of £120,000 mentioned orally by Mr Bundock) and </p>

Neil Bundock denies either preparing the Summary or providing it to R&amp;A.  His evidence was that the document was not in the format of documents produced by Biosol and that the figures it contained, though possible, were extremely high and the absolute maximum that could be achieved; and he had already told Mr Lovering and Mr Pickering that it was not feasible to place a boiler in each building.  He also stated that he could not have made the projections contained in the Summary without knowing R&amp;A’s fuel costs.  Mr Bundock said that it was possible that the document had been produced by Mr Golding for internal purposes, but he said that he had no recollection of it and would certainly not have passed it to R&amp;A.

Mr Lovering and Mr Pickering do not claim to have queried these differences when Mr Bundock went through the figures in the Summary.

He was not called to give evidence, and an email from him that was included in the trial bundle seems to show that the documents he was working from comprised a Proposal from Biosol and internal financial information from R&amp;A.

The alleged assurance is not minuted and not supported by any reliable documentary evidence and is quite different from the figures set out in the Proposals, which themselves were expressly stated not to be guaranteed figures.  Further, although R&amp;A’s primary case has been that Mr Bundock gave an assurance that Boilers 1 and 2 would each generate RHI income of £120,000, Mr Lovering’s evidence on day two of the trial, when dealing with the alleged later assurance that ten boilers would generate £650,000, was to the effect that Mr Bundock had mentioned £120,000 as the maximum income that a single boiler could generate if running constantly at full capacity.  As for the Summary, for reasons appearing above I find that it did not constitute, or form the basis of, representations made by Neil Bundock and that neither it nor its contents were relied on by R&amp;A. </p>

The email ended: “We need to push on the financials for biomass plant asap—let’s discuss Thursday at the board meeting.”  Mr Lovering replied with some comments the following day.  His email remarked: “All looks positive.  We should be in a position by the end of next week to place an order.  My understanding is six weeks lead time.”  However, it also said: “I have put in a call to graham to see what he has done on the system re pricing and getting other quotes.”  The reference to “graham” is to Graham Jones, who was Head of Development Projects at Hydro Industries.  In cross-examination Mr Lovering confirmed that he had asked Mr Jones to obtain alternative quotations for boilers.  He said that he could not remember whether any alternative quotations were produced; none have been disclosed.  I infer from this that either no alternative quotations were produced or they were less favourable than those produced by Biosol.  Mr Jones was not called to give evidence. </p>

Also implausible, in my view, is Mr Lovering’s insistence that he never saw that there were terms and conditions on the sales orders; that would be plausible only if he had received only a photocopy of the front of the document on each occasion.  He was also evasive as to his knowledge that there were terms and conditions on the order forms.  (It may well be, of course, that he did not read the terms and conditions.)

Buildings 2 and 4 were already heated by gas boilers; they were occupied by the NHS for the purpose of the storage of paper records, which required a warm and dry atmosphere.

The order form stated that the required deposit was £141,000, comprising 10% of the net price plus the entire VAT.  Mr Lovering says that the stated price was a mistake, although it is stated both on the order form and, as I find, on the written quotation provided at the time.  When Biosol invoiced the finance company that would be providing finance for the boilers under a hire-purchase agreement, the invoice showed the price as £460,000. </p>

Mr Partridge’s evidence was that this was because Biosol had begun supplying R&amp;A with heavily contaminated low-grade woodchip fuel; when initially commissioned, the boilers had been set up to burn Grade A fuel, but now (according to Mr Partridge) they had to be re-set to burn the contaminated low-grade fuel.  Neil Bundock disputed that version of events: he said that the boilers were initially set up to burn virgin fuel and were subsequently re-set, on Biosol’s instructions, to burn Grade A fuel, which was perfectly acceptable for the boilers.

Or it could have sent an email simply asking for the points to be put in writing.  The notion that it waited for at least six months (see below) without doing either, but nevertheless pressing—presumably orally—for something in writing makes little sense. </p>

However, the internal evidence is enough to show that the document was not contemporaneous, because in January 2017 what was under discussion was the supply of at most a further six boilers, and probably only a further three: R&amp;A had already concluded the contractual arrangements for four boilers, and it had paid a deposit for a further three boilers.  By itself this suggests one or more or all of the following conclusions: first, that the document was written long after the events it purports to describe; second, that its contents are not merely inaccurate but, in at least certain respects, fictitious; third, that it seeks to put the matters alleged at an early stage of the parties’ relationship. </p>

Equally, however, I do not think it likely that Mr Bundock said specifically on that occasion that it would take until June 2017 before Boilers 5, 6 and 7 would be commissioned.  An email exchange on 11 and 12 January 2017 between Mr Golding and Messrs Lovering and Pickering suggests that a target date of 31 March 2017 had been mentioned but that Biosol was awaiting confirmation from R&amp;A of its acceptance of its costings for the works associated with installation and commissioning, and that R&amp;A did not provide confirmation as requested. </p>

As for “the next 3 (three) Boilers”, namely Boilers 8, 9 and 10, there was as yet no concluded agreement but there was an expectation that R&amp;A would proceed. </p>

The meeting was arranged because Biosol was concerned about matters of payment: Boilers 5, 6 and 7 had been delivered by Swebo and paid for and were ready to be installed, but R&amp;A had not completed the necessary arrangements with the finance company that would enable Biosol to be paid.  Sums were also outstanding in respect of woodchip.  No particular progress was made at that meeting, but further meetings took place during February, when Mr Lovering was back.  The finance for Boilers 5, 6 and 7 was arranged, Biosol was paid for them, and on 15 February 2016 Biosol ordered Boilers 8, 9 and 10 from Swebo. I accept Biosol’s evidence that this was when it was agreed where Boilers 5, 6 and 7 would be sited. </p>

There are two particularly interesting features of the email.  First, it appears that the substance of the text was actually provided to Ms Davies by Mr Golding, who was still an employee of Biosol.  Second, the email notes with concern that the NHS had turned off the heating in Building 4, which it occupied, with the result that RHI income form the biomass boiler was reduced.  Mr Lovering acknowledged in cross-examination that it was not surprising that a tenant should turn the heating off in the summer.  The incident serves to highlight the obvious fact that any projected figures could only be indicative, if for no other reason than that a third party obviously could not dictate the use made by the tenants of the heating.  It also indicates, as Mr Walker submitted, that R&amp;A was interested not so much in the ability to meet tenants’ heating requirements as in its opportunity to maximise RHI income.  (This latter point is graphically illustrated by communications between R&amp;A and the NHS in April 2018, which show that an agreement was reached that the heating would run constantly but that temperatures would be controlled by enhanced ventilation and heating costs would be controlled by a price cap.) </p>

Biosol would supply sufficient woodchip fuel of the required standard, namely Grade A, at a price not exceeding £16,563 per annum for each boiler.  From the time when Boilers 5 to 10 were ordered, the agreement was that Biosol would provide all necessary fuel and maintenance for a price not to exceed £120,000 per annum in total.  Mr Lovering stated that he did not understand that the document he was signing was intended to alter the deal already struck, and he would not have wanted to change it. Mr Pickering’s evidence as to the oral agreement was to the same effect, and he said that he had not known of the written document and had never understood that the terms for the supply of woodchip and of maintenance services had been altered. </p>

Mr Lovering’s evidence was that Mr Golding took him to inspect the hangar at the Property where Biosol stored the woodchip for use in the boilers, and found it to be contaminated with various foreign bodies.  In cross-examination he said that, before Mr Golding brought these matters to his attention, he had not had any concerns that the fuel being used was unsuitable, although the partners had “massive concerns” about the performance of the boilers.

As Mr Golding had started working for R&amp;A at least two months previously, it is unlikely that, if he expressed concerns of this sort, he first did so in October 2017, especially if (a), as is implied by Mr Lovering’s evidence (first statement, para 129), the disclosure was of matters known to Mr Golding by reason of his former employment by Biosol and those matters were at least part of the reason why Mr Golding had been unhappy working for Biosol, (b) Mr Golding had been giving covert assistance to R&amp;A for at least two months before he took up formal employment, (c) R&amp;A was already facing large claims for payment from Biosol, and (d) R&amp;A had for at least a month been looking to end its relationship with Biosol.  It is clear that Mr Golding had not told R&amp;A of problems with the quality of the fuel prior to October 2017, and this means that he was almost certainly not aware of any such problems.  Some of the documents cast light on how the situation developed after 18 October 2017. </p>

The copy in evidence has comments on the original email in both red and blue ink; I think that the comments in red are Mr Golding’s and the comments in blue are Mr Partridge’s, though it is conceivable that it is the other way around.  There are two places where the comments in blue advise that Biosol should be asked for confirmation as to the classification of fuel that has been provided; neither of them positively asserts that the fuel is of the wrong classification, though the second of them, which is neither grammatical nor wholly intelligible, might suggest that the classifications of fuel supplied had been variable, though not substandard.  None of the comments in red say anything about the fuel.  There is nothing in the annotations to suggest that as at 19 October 2017 Mr Golding had knowledge that Biosol had been supplying substandard fuel. </p>

I think it reflects the degree of animus towards Mr Bundock that was sometimes evident in Mr Partridge’s evidence.  In agreement with Mr Bundock’s evidence, I find that Mr Partridge did not attend meetings at which Mr Bundock and the partners were present.  Mr Bundock might well have described Mr Partridge as Biosol’s “partner”, because he appears to have used that word for anyone with whom there was a collaborative relationship.  He said that he would not have called him a director, because he was not a director and because any good businessman could easily ascertain the identity of the directors by a quick check at Companies House. </p>

Once something is a term of a contract, it regulates the conduct of the parties to the contract, regardless of how unclear its meaning might be.  No matter how arguable may be different interpretations of the term, English law insists that only one interpretation is “correct”.  Representations, not forming terms of any contract, do not regulate the parties’ relationship prior to the making of a contract; if they are ambiguous, there is no reason why they should do so.  The representee can seek clarification, if the point is important.  This is not to say, incorrectly, that a representee who would otherwise have a claim for damages for misrepresentation is disqualified if he failed to take an opportunity to ascertain the truth. It is to say that an ambiguous statement may by reason of its ambiguity and the ease with which it can be clarified, not amount to a material representation.

This is why Mr Emmett re-casts his submission in terms of identification of the “core team”.  (Another point, about “control” of a company, is remarked on below.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Analysis of R&amp;A’s case as to the “Income Assurance” is made difficult by two related matters.  The first is the diffuse and discursive nature of the defence and counterclaim, including its introduction of an allegation of a “Profitability Assurance” (an assurance allegedly given by Mr Bundock that R&amp;A would “make a load of money” and would not be “out of pocket”), which does not however function as an actionable misrepresentation in the defence and counterclaim.  The second is the way in which Mr Emmett’s submissions alter the nature of the alleged misrepresentations: these are now characterised as (1) a representation that the boilers could operate constantly at full capacity (paragraphs 52 – 59) and (2) a representation that the purchase of the boilers would be profitable (paragraphs 70 – 78).  In the defence and counterclaim, however, the constant operation of the boilers is not relied on as a substantive misrepresentation but as the necessary premise of the representation actually pleaded, namely the assurance that each boiler would generate RHI income of £120,000 per annum and (by implication) that Biosol had reasonable grounds for believing that it </p>

Neither of these so-called representations is pleaded. </p>

The facts and matters set out in the defence and counterclaim and the breach of the implied term alleged in paragraph 45 all relate to oversizing of the boilers.  The point to which R&amp;A’s talk of efficiency is directed is that, insofar as the adoption of biomass heating is motivated by a desire to make money from an investment, one does not want to be incurring unnecessary capital costs that nullify the potential gains.  Thus, in identifying the principles relevant to the sizing of biomass boilers, CIBSE AM15 (see below) says at section 6.1:  </p>

Furthermore, the low turndown ratio of biomass boilers, typically between 2:1 and 3.5:1, means that most biomass systems will be significantly mismatched with respect to summer loads.  Hence, it is very important not to oversize a biomass boiler system.”   </p>

It has to do with the suitability of what was installed or commissioned; this is the province of the implied term as to fitness for purpose.  If R&amp;A is correct in saying that the boilers were oversized, it could perhaps be said that Biosol failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in designing systems appropriate to the buildings for which they were intended.  However, R&amp;A has not relied on the contracts as contracts for the supply of design services.  This seems right, because Biosol contracted to supply boilers of a certain specification; the contracts themselves specified the size of the boiler, and any design carried out under the contract can only have related to such matters as precise location </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“The capital cost of a biomass boiler system is, typically, ten times that of a fossil fuelled boiler system.  Furthermore, the low turndown ratio of biomass boilers, typically between 2:1 and 3.5:1, means that most biomass systems will be significantly mismatched with respect to summer loads.  Hence, it is very important not to oversize a biomass boiler system.  The key principle of sizing a biomass boiler and thermal store combination is to design the system using a small boiler in relation to the peak load while operating it continuously, and hence at high efficiency, to charge a thermal store: energy is stored overnight to meet peak loads the following day.  The extent to which the boiler size can be reduced in relation to peak load is wholly dependent on the shape and duration of the daily load profile. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">A thermal store, in combination with a biomass boiler, should be designed to meet the desired percentage of energy from biomass (when an auxiliary boiler is incorporated) or 100% of the annual energy requirement if a biomass system only is to be installed.  A thermal store collects energy from the biomass boiler when the demand from the load is less than the boiler’s output and releases it, in combination with the biomass boiler, when the load demand is greater than the boiler’s output it served as a peak lopping and load smoothing device.” </p>

The text continues: “[F]or many typical existing buildings, a biomass boiler rated at 30% of peak load with a thermal store and auxiliary boiler(s) is probably not too far from the optimum solution and should achieve efficient biomass boiler operation and enable the system to be effectively controlled.”  The Guide emphasises the importance of proper calculations and recommends reference to the Carbon Trust’s Sizing Tool. </p>

Design margins must therefore be used with caution.  Nevertheless, the designer must be able to deal appropriately with the risk of heating systems not performing as required.

In simple terms an oversized biomass boiler has a maximum heat output that is much greater than the maximum heat demand.  To work effectively biomass boiler[s] should be undersized, that is to say their heat output should be equal to or slightly less than the maximum heat demand.  This is because unlike traditional heating technologies biomass boilers are designed to run for long periods and at high output[,] only turning on and off infrequently.  At full output a continuously running biomass boiler is at its most efficient, it is much less efficient during periods of start-up and shut down.  These startup and shut down periods are mechanically intensive.  Excessive start-ups and shutdowns will decrease the efficiency, increase pollutant emissions and increase wear and tear on the firing system and ancillary equipment.  These in turn can create error faults … This is why most biomass boilers include accumulators (thermal stores) to increase thermal mass to reduce cycling.” </p>

Gas boilers typically take less than 15 seconds to start up and shut down.  Therefore, to operate as designed biomass boilers must run for extended periods with very few shutdowns.  If they are oversized they will switch on and off quickly in an operation called boiler cycling.” </p>

The bigger the boiler, the smaller the annual load factor.  CIBSE AM15 shows a typical utilisation factor of 20%, which reflects typical operation for 1,750 hours p.a. (7 hours x 250 heating days) as compared with a total of 8,760 hours in the year.  The RHI Scheme requires an annual utilisation factor of greater than 15%.  A factor above 20% risks underheating of the building on the coldest days.  A key tool in boiler sizing was the use of accumulators, which store large amounts of heated water for use in meeting the heating requirements during periods of low heating loads without the need to start up the boiler.  The reservoir of heat also allows the boilers to be undersized but still meet heating requirements during highest demand. </p>

The designs of the systems of the six Swebo boilers were practically identical to each other, as are the designs of the systems for Boilers 3 and 4 (Fröling boilers); only Boilers 1 and 2 have a different piping installation.  This would only be expected if the buildings they were heating, and the associated heat loads, were identical.  This “suggests that the design work may only have been carried out once and that the design has been copied each time” and “explains why the eight boilers installed with the same output and piping configurations are having the same issues with low heat output and mechanical breakdowns as they have not been sized for the heat demand” (first report, para 33). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first method showed that the heating capacity of the boilers was 10 times the previous capacity of the gas heating system.  A direct comparison was possible in the case of Building 2 and Building 4 (both occupied by the NHS and previously heated by gas, and both requiring a constant internal temperature of 21⁰C); in both cases Biosol assumed a load factor that indicated very substantially increased heating demands for the buildings.  Mr Crowther said: “I would not expect a biomass boiler to have a higher rated output than a gas boiler it was replacing” (first report, para 50).  Mr Crowther cross-checked this preliminary conclusion by reference to the heat loss coefficient (U-value) for the various buildings, as calculated by DC2 Engineering Limited, an engineering firm retained by R&amp;A to restructure the biomass boiler installation.  Mr Crowther said that the U-value for Building 4, for example, would indicate a boiler size of 130 kW and that historical gas data indicated a boiler size of 140kW.  </p>

One of the key findings of the Report was that the efficiency of biomass boiler installations was significantly compromised by rapid cycling, which in turn resulted from a number of causes, one of which was that boilers were frequently significantly oversized for demand. </p>

He did not accept that the size of the boiler ought to be determined by the peak load, because he said that this resulted in oversizing.  For the same reason, he said that the capacity of the existing gas- or oilbased system did not provide a reasonable basis for assessing peak load, because there was no downside to oversizing fossil-fuel boilers, but there were big environmental and cost downsides to oversizing biomass boilers.

With reference to the exchange of emails between Mr Partridge and Daniel Davies on 5 October 2015 and to the “Heat Loads” section of Proposal 1 (cf. paragraph 30 above), Mr Crowther said that, if (as appears to have been the case) Mr Partridge was using the capacity of the existing gas boilers to size the proposed biomass boilers, he was wrong to do so; it was such a practice that resulted in so many biomass boilers being oversized, as identified in the BEIS Report, though he accepted that the Report tended to indicate that in practice it was common for biomass boilers to be sized by reference to the capacity of the systems they were replacing.  </p>

The inherent uncertainties in the exercise were evident in Figure 10 to the experts’ joint statement, which showed the experts’ heat loss calculations and the assumptions on which they were based.  Despite this, the experts had arrived at very similar outcomes in their heat-loss calculations, resulting in a peak heat demand of roughly 200kW.  The main difference between them was that Mr Crawford had incorporated a margin for uncertainty.  Mr Crowther considered this appropriate only for fossil-fuel boilers but not for biomass boilers: the former should be sized for a peak load because there is no disadvantage in them being oversized, whereas the latter should be undersized, so that they work nearly all the time.  It was put to him that this was inconsistent with the opinion expressed in paragraph 51 of his first report; he replied that the peak load was an important factor but not the be all and end all when sizing a biomass boiler.  He summarised his opinion: </p>

Of these factors, the third was the least reliable, for reasons already stated.  (Mr Crowther acknowledged that he had not recorded the sizes of the old gas systems.)  In theory, heat loss calculations provided the best criterion; however, in buildings such as those under consideration the uncertainties inherent in the calculations meant that, where there was evidence that the building in question was subject of a stable letting and that the tenant was content with the level of heating being provided, historic gas use would be a better guide to boiler sizing than would heat loss calculations.   </p>

He was asked why he had not considered the data in respect of the heat actually produced by the biomass boilers, although he had been provided with the meter readings.  He accepted that those data showed that the actual demand on the biomass boilers far exceeded the historical usage of the gas boilers, but he said that he had been asked to comment on the original design of the boilers, not on their subsequent usage.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“The first step in the design process is to assess the likely heat loss from a building the design winter day.  This is achieved by using the building dimensions to work out surface areas of the various components (roof, walls, floor, rooflights, doors etc).  To those areas are then applied what are known as U-values and the difference in temperature between the external environment and internal environment.  The U-values vary from component to component and define the rate at which heat passes through the component in the direction of the temperature gradient (i.e. inside to outside). … By definition all of the figures used in this calculation contain a margin of error for a number of reasons.  The final result therefore contains the summation of these errors.  Therefore, to mitigate this risk, as with the design of any system, a margin [also referred to as a ‘margin of uncertainty’] is added. … In-house, we use margins of 15-20% (i.e. multiplication factors of 1.15 – 1.2) depending on how reliable we perceive the input data to be. …” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“[T]he occupancy profile of most buildings includes the fact that the heating is switched off when the building is unoccupied and the heating switched back on at a predetermined time period before the occupants are due to arrive.  During the period following switch-on, the instantaneous demand from the heating system can be much higher than the demand required to keep the building warm once it is already up to temperature (i.e. the steady state losses).  This additional demand is called the Cold Start Margin …  Failure to include this value will result in the building taking a long time to heat up and therefore not meet the design criteria. … I have proposed the use of a Cold Start Margin of 1.2, which is at the conservative end of the range advised [by CIBSE AM:15].  Using a larger margin would result in an even higher buffer vessel volume.” “Once the steady state heat loss (including margin for uncertainty) and cold start margin have been established, the optimum boiler capacity and buffer vessel combination can be determined.  For any combination of boiler capacity and buffer vessel volume to be successful, they must be able to provide both the start-up demand and the steady state demand for the duration of the occupied period.  Failure to meet either will result in the heating system being undersized for the building.  Too small a boiler can result in too larger a buffer vessel volume and vice versa.  Furthermore, there is not an infinite range of boiler capacities or buffer vessel volumes available and therefore the choices made for each are constrained by what products the market has to offer. … [T]he optimum boiler/buffer combination must be selected pragmatically.” </p>

He agreed that the worked example in section 6 of CIBSE AM15 would apply to the boilers in accordance with his original understanding that the boilers would run intermittently, but he acknowledged that he had not undertaken the first Step identified there (to create a load profile).

It was put to him that this was because the CT Tool was widely respected in the industry; he replied, “I believe so.  I don’t have first-hand knowledge of that.”  He was asked whether he knew if the Carbon Trust was “well-respected within the industry”; he replied, “Well-respected is obviously a subjective term.  I don’t have enough information to know whether that’s a true statement or not.”  However, he was able to accept that CIBSE was wellrespected within the industry, as it was the professional body representing mechanical/electrical design.  He said that his own experience of using the CT Tool made him doubt its credibility, though he did not cite any other source within the industry as expressing the same doubts.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Crawford explained that his “margin of uncertainty” was used in establishing heat loss from the building; it was not applied at the stage of sizing the boiler.  The Uvalue would first be calculated as accurately as possible, and the margin would be applied at the end of the process.  He insisted that the margin he was talking about was different from that referred to in the text accompanying Figure 6.3 in CIBSE AM15.  On that textual point, I think that Mr Crawford was correct.  Whatever the merits or demerits of the arguments about his margin of uncertainty and about the sizing of the boilers, the passage in question is not referring to a margin added to the heat loss figure provided by the calculation of the U-values, but rather to a safety factor regarding boiler sizing with respect to the simultaneous imposition of various demands.  It is not in itself helpful with respect to the issues before me.   </p>

It was put to Mr Crawford that it was irrational to reflect the uncertainty of heat loss by applying a margin of increase to the figures: the uncertainty could operate in the other direction, which would lead to a margin of decrease to the figures; no more can be done than perform the calculation itself on the best available basis, and there is then no basis for the application of a margin at all. </p>

They [i.e. CIBSE AM15, section 6] say in relation to their example, and the figures that they have taken for that example, while the thermal store size would be reduced to 44,000 litres, the capital cost would be significantly greater while the minimum boiler output would also increase.  So, for their calculation, they are not only performing an engineering calculation to see what the size of the thermal store should be in some abstract sense, but they are also asking themselves how would different balances between boiler and thermal store size affect the cost that would be incurred by the ultimate customer in purchasing and installing the system, are they not?

His main objections to the CT Tool appeared to be, first, that he could not get it to work reliably and so had doubts about its “credibility” and, second, that it did not make manifest the formulae used in its algorithms and did not permit application of the margin of uncertainty.  These are not convincing objections.  As to the first, this is very likely to be the result of Mr Crawford’s prior unfamiliarity with the CT Tool; it is hardly likely to be recommended by CIBSE if it is unreliable.  As to the second, it is in the nature of computational tools that the formulae on which they are based are built into the programmes.  The fact that there is no room for the application of a margin of uncertainty need not occasion surprise.  I note at this point that the disclaimer in the CT Tool does not seem to me to reduce its reliability, for reasons that were explored by Mr Emmett with Mr Crawford.

He emphasised the importance of efficiency in meeting “heat demand” (for example, paragraph 217 above).  But it is entirely clear that R&amp;A was not interested in acquiring the boilers to meet any existing demand but rather to generate heat and therefore income.  For essentially this reason, Mr Crowther placed primary emphasis in his approach to sizing on historic heat demand and was dismissive of subsequent heat production as being of no design relevance.  But the purpose of acquiring ten boilers was emphatically not to meet historic heat demand, and the subsequent generation of heat cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to an expert’s consideration of design, because it is or may be indicative of the purposes for which the design was implemented. </p>

The principles are summarised in CIBSE Guide B; see above.  Such a margin may clearly be justified in the individual case, but the design margins have to be applied with caution and with due regard to the risk that they create, not only the risks they obviate.  Mr Crawford’s practice of routinely applying a margin within a given range is inconsistent with the guidance, and in my judgment, Mr Emmett’s cross-examination was successful in showing the incoherence of Mr Crawford’s position.  If the calculation has been done on the most accurate available basis, there is no rational basis for supposing that the uncertainty can only have resulted in figures that are too low: it might just as well have resulted in figures that are too high.  One can do no more than make the best possible calculation.  The justification for applying the margin in a given case must rest on consideration of the relevant risks, having regard in particular to the downsides of under-sizing and those of oversizing the heating system.  Mr Crawford appeared to accept this point eventually. </p>

This is because to match the boiler to the peak load can result in significant oversizing at other times of the year, cause inefficient operation at low fractions of maximum capacity, and result in disproportionate capital outlay.  The evidence suggests that many biomass boilers are oversized for their locations, and CIBSE AM15 observes that it is very important not to oversize a biomass boiler.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Regarding the present case, I have set out the evidence at considerable length.  Subject to a qualification to which I shall turn presently, I agree with Mr Walker’s submission that the evidence shows that R&amp;A’s principal purpose in acquiring the boilers was to maximise the generation of heat, without regard for prior capacity, historic demand or, indeed, whether that heat was needed, and so to maximise the RHI payments: I refer, briefly, to the huge increase in the heat generated in the NHS buildings; the agreement to cap the NHS’s heating charges and to provide additional ventilation rather than to turn down the boilers; the failure to complete the insulation of the pipework after Biosol left the site; the omission of thermostats; the omission of time clocks; and the provision in clause 3 of the Maintenance and Woodchip Agreement that the supply of fuel was “for the purposes of maintaining [the boiler’s] output at maximum capacity”.  It seems likely, indeed, that R&amp;A was clearly and deliberately generating useless heat and was thereby abusing the RHI Scheme.  As the government publication <span style="font-style:italic">Renewable Heat Incentive </span>explains (cf. paragraph 17 above), the payments are calculated by metre readings, which do not themselves confirm that the heat was useful; the Scheme relies on the tariff system and normal economic considerations to control the risk of abuse.   </p>

Mr Emmett, who is careful and precise with his use of language, described the partners’ conduct as the “best evidence” of oversupply.  That is indicative of the fact that the evidence adduced by R&amp;A fails to establish what Biosol ought to have done.  For reasons already indicated, Mr Crowther’s sizing calculations do not establish the respects if any in which, in the circumstances, Biosol departed from the range of reasonable and acceptable practice.  Neither expert calculated the actual efficiency of the boilers or the relevant load factors.  Mr Crowther was ultimately unable to say whether smaller boilers would have been able to generate the heat, or the RHI payments, that the boilers actually installed did generate.  (Mr Emmett submitted that 6 boilers would have been able to generate RHI payments equivalent to those actually generated by the 10 boilers, but that was not the way the case was put in para 46 of the defence and I do not find it to have been proved.)  In a passage of evidence already referred to, it was put to Mr Crowther that he had not calculated the actual performance of the boilers and therefore did not know whether or not they were oversized for their actual use.  He agreed.  Correspondingly, Mr Crowther did not (and was not asked to) prepare a design for what ought to have been installed.  Mr Walker submitted (written submissions, para 124) that R&amp;A has not quantified or explained the economic factors at play or what solution ought to have been achieved by Biosol: “For example, there is no credible analysis of relative capital costs or the impact of RHI.”  I regard that submission as well made. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Moreover, in my judgment there is a basic problem with R&amp;A’s case, which its formulation—in terms of the efficient heating of the buildings in which the boilers were located—tends to hide.  The case takes as its starting point a desire to heat suchand-such buildings and to do so efficiently; and it says that 6 boilers could have achieved the job as well as 10.  But this is a fundamentally false way of putting things.  R&amp;A did not start from a desire to heat such-and-such buildings.  It started from a desire to maximise its investment in biomass boilers as a way of providing a return on capital: that is why it saw buying boilers as an alternative to buying a business; it is why it started with an interest in putting a boiler in each building; and it is why it agreed to acquire more boilers before it even decided where to put them.  This shows why framing the case in terms of efficiency is pernicious.  It leads to a submission like that quoted in paragraph 264 above.  If indeed it is the case, as alleged, that the ten boilers are more than is required to heat the buildings to which they are connected, it does not follow that R&amp;A wanted fewer boilers: as the boilers were the reason for the production of heat, rather than the need for heat being the reason for the boilers, the proper conclusion would merely be that the boilers should be connected to additional buildings, of which many at the Property remain unheated.  No evidence shows that this could not reasonably be done, because R&amp;A’s case has been formulated so as to look through the wrong end of the telescope, and Mr Walker was entirely right to warn against taking the partners’ actions in decommissioning four boilers as anything other than a course of action adopted in order to defeat Biosol’s claim. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The award of contractual damages would not be entirely straightforward, because of the way in which R&amp;A puts its case.  It is not said that the boilers were unsuitable because they did not work as they ought to have: in that case, expectation damages might be awarded, for example, for the cost of providing necessary supplemental heating.  Rather, what is said is that the boilers were not needed and ought not to have been supplied.  This does not appear to leave any room for the application of expectation damages, because the contention is not that the contractual expectation ought to be made good but that the contract ought not to have been made.  This might sound in an award of reliance losses.  I shall simply proceed on the basis that the damages sought are for negligent advice to acquire four unnecessary boilers (counterclaim C3, in my classification). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The total cost of the supply and installation of each boiler was £220,000, of which £85,000 represented the cost of the boiler.  There is no doubt but that the omission of a boiler would have entailed the omission of most of the mechanical engineering work associated with its installation.  However, the use of six boilers to heat the buildings actually heated by the ten boilers would necessarily have resulted in additional pipework and in the installation of the necessary heat emitters.  It may be that additional or larger thermal stores would have been required; if so, they would have required additional construction work.  However, the premise of R&amp;A’s case is that it would have acquired fewer boilers, not smaller boilers, and on that basis there is no reason to posit the need for additional construction work.  It is highly likely that the supply of only six boilers would have saved additional costs beyond those of the boilers themselves.  Mr Walker submitted that a relatively simple exercise would have enabled R&amp;A to produce the necessary evidence but that, in the absence of such evidence, there was no rational basis for assessing the further costs that would have been incurred; therefore, he said, no award ought to be made in respect of the ancillary costs of installation.  That is not very attractive.  If the court finds on the balance of probabilities that loss has been suffered, it must do the best it can on the evidence available: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts, </span>33<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> edition, para 26-018; <span style="font-style:italic">Wemyss v Karim</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 27 at [40]-[49],<span style="font-style:italic"> per</span> Lewison LJ; and <span style="font-style:italic">116 Cardamon Ltd v MacAlister</span> [2019] EWHC 1200 (Comm) at [77]-[83], <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Cockerill J.

Therefore, I would have taken as the starting point of the calculation (a) the cost of four boilers (4 x £85,000 = £340,000) and (b) half of the ancillary costs of the supply and installation of each boiler (4 x £135,000 ÷ 2 = £270,000): a total of £610,000. </p>

Mr Emmett says that they are “white elephants” and that credit should only be given for them if they are sold before judgment.  That cannot be right.  R&amp;A would have to give credit for the value of the boilers.  The question would be: what is that value?  The evidence is that they are identical to the boilers that were sold for £85,000 each.  That is, as it seems to me, the best evidence of their value.  As Mr Walker observes, the figure should not occasion much surprise, because (i) the boilers are accredited boilers, and (ii) that is in fact what the other two boilers were sold for. </p>

However, as the matter is really just an arithmetical question, I would have permitted it to be explored before fixing a judgment sum. </p>

However, I am not satisfied that the costs properly attributable to maintenance of ten boilers were in excess of £100,000 for a two-year period, as R&amp;A claims.  Biosol identifies invoices amounting to slightly in excess of £15,000 as relating to maintenance costs for that period.  It will be seen below that the cost of maintenance under the Woodchip and Maintenance Agreement would be of the order of £10,000 per annum; that is not itself the relevant measure of this head of R&amp;A’s counterclaim, but it provides an interesting cross-reference.  Something of the order of 40% of £20,000 would be acceptable under this head, absent close examination of the invoices.  It is not profitable to spend more time on this point here. </p>

In view of my earlier findings concerning R&amp;A’s failure to prove its case on liability, I say no more on this point. </p>

The programme in Proposal 3, for Boilers 1 and 2, is set out at paragraph 53 above.  On the basis that stage 4 (planning) could be dealt with at the same time as stages 2 and 3 (manufacture and freight) and that stage 5 (removal of the redundant system) would not require planning permission, the programme would permit installation to commence within 8 to 11 weeks after the placing of the order.  The subsequent parts of the programme are hard to analyse from the text, because stage 8 (heat mains and interface works) was to be concurrent with construction of the energy centre, which was not shown separately but had previously been allocated 4 to 6 weeks.  It looks as though something of the order of 10 to 14 weeks was being allowed for the installation and commissioning stages.  This indicates a total of between 18 weeks and 25 weeks from the placing of the order to the commissioning of the boilers: roughly 4 to 6 months, as compared with the two months contended for by R&amp;A as a reasonable period. </p>

He accepted that there might be some overlap between the times allowed for stage 6 (boiler and fuel feed site assembly) and stage 7 (pipe and chimney installation), though he was understandably unwilling to commit himself on this point without detailed knowledge of the works.  He did accept, however, that the programme in the Proposal would have been produced on the basis of generous figures, so as to provide Biosol with a “a larger timescale than they felt was necessary” and thus give them some “elbow room”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As I have said, I award no damages for breach of contract in respect of the delays in installation and commissioning of Boilers 3 and 4.  R&amp;A puts its claim on the basis that it lost RHI revenue at the rate of £10,000 per month for the period of delay.  That is a false basis.  First, the rate is premised on a warranted return; however, I have rejected R&amp;A’s case as to that warranty.  Second, and more importantly, the benefits under the RHI scheme accrue for a period of 20 years.  R&amp;A will get benefits for just the same duration, whether the boilers were commissioned early, late or on time.  The effect of delay in commissioning is not to reduce the income stream but to delay its commencement.  As it seems to me, the proper measure of damages would probably be interest on the amount of the income for the period of its delay (so, if income of £y were delayed for 1 month, the loss would be £y x z% ÷ 12).  R&amp;A has not advanced a claim on this basis or acceptable data for the calculation, and in view of the small amounts that could be involved—I think, at most a few hundred pounds—I do not propose to permit further time to be taken on it. </p>

R&amp;A’s difficulty in identifying losses attributable to the matters complained of was apparent from the Part 18 further information that it provided in March 2019, when in answer to a request for particulars of the losses it replied that they were “a matter for expert evidence” and “[could] not be fully particularised” at that time.  However, the experts’ joint memorandum produced in March 2020 recorded agreement that the experts did not have sufficient information to be able to say whether the maintenance costs already incurred were any different from what was to be expected.

It is clear that the impression given by Mr Lovering, namely that Mr Golding alerted R&amp;A to malpractice that had been going on and that R&amp;A’s decision to terminate the relationship with Biosol resulted from that discovery, is substantially false.  Mr Golding had clearly not expressed any relevant concerns in the two months that he had been employed by R&amp;A, and his exchanges with Mr Partridge in October </p>

The issue concerning fuel arose after Biosol informed R&amp;A that it had put the matter of unpaid invoices in the hands of its solicitors.  That was the point at which R&amp;A began to look at the question whether the fuel was substandard.  And by that stage it had already decided to end its relationship with Biosol, though not for any reason to do with substandard fuel.  Only after the service of the statutory demand did R&amp;A seek an analysis of a fuel sample, though it did not give Biosol any input into the identification of the sample.  Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the issue arose do not answer the question whether or not R&amp;A’s complaint has substantive merit. </p>

Initially in 2016 Biosol was obtaining good quality fuel from a supplier in Port Talbot, Jason Hill.  However, after a time the relationship with that supplier broke down and Biosol began obtaining fuel from a supplier in Brighton, KPS.  The fuel from KPS was not burnable in the boilers, because it was contaminated.  In his witness statement, Mr Partridge said that the contaminants included paint, glass and metal, which he himself observed on site.  In his oral evidence, he identified two occasions when he had attended site because of a boiler blockage—apparently because of the introduction of inappropriate material— and confirmed that the woodchip was from pallets with paint on them and so was not Grade A.  His statement said (para 26): </p>

In November 2016 he stopped using Jason Hill, because the “fuel was too large” (Mr Worsfold said that fuel above the graded size could cause sticking of the feed system) and, if he changed suppliers, he could procure Grade A fuel at a cheaper rate.  In cross-examination he said that the decision to change supplier was made “after a discussion with R&amp;A and the legalities around burning Grade A fuels, which the boilers they had were capable and accredited to do”.  From November 2016 Biosol was supplying Grade A fuel that it obtained from KPS.  Mr Bundock acknowledged that there had been a problem with some of the fuel supplied by KPS, but he insisted that it was a specific and limited problem.  He stated (third statement, para 28): “I acknowledge that a small portion of the fuel delivered to R&amp;A from [KPS] was not of the standard required.  However, this was stored away from the fuel being used in the boilers and fenced off.  The issue of a substandard load from Brighton was brought up with the supplier and the issue </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">R&amp;A’s efforts to establish a case about the quality of fuel involved a degree of fabrication.  First, I find that the allegation that neighbouring residents complained about smoke and odours being emitted from the Premises is untrue.  There is no independent or objective evidence about such complaints and no residents were called to give evidence.  At one point in his crossexamination Mr Lovering acknowledged that Mr Oliver Matthews was called in by R&amp;A and I am satisfied that that was the case.  Second, I find that Mr Partridge gave untruthful evidence about the recommissioning of Boilers 1 and 2 in November 2016.  I reject his evidence that the boilers were recommissioned so that they could burn contaminated fuel.  Rather they were recommissioned so that they could burn Grade A fuel and not only virgin fuel.  This is the evidence given by Mr Bundock and it is consistent with what I consider to be the correct sequence of events regarding the supply of different kinds of fuel to the Premises.  Mr Partridge’s evidence is to be rejected for several reasons. (a) It is tainted by his animus against Biosol and Mr Bundock. (b) Recommissioning to burn contaminated fuel would have been egregious— everyone is agreed that contaminated fuel could not be burned in the boilers— and it is highly unlikely that Mr Bundock would have proposed it or that Mr Partridge, who had no stake in Biosol, would have been complicit in it.  (c) The contention that the boilers were recommissioned so as to be able to burn the contaminated fuel relies for any specious plausibility on the chronology given by Mr Partridge, according to which the recommissioning took place in January 2017, after contaminated fuel had been delivered; it makes less sense when it is appreciated that it took place in November 2016, when the decision to change suppliers and stop using virgin fuel was first taken.  (d) If Mr Partridge had known that Biosol had done what he now alleges, he would have been quick to tell Mr Golding and R&amp;A.  However, the email exchanges between Mr Partridge and Mr Golding in October 2017 do not contain any suggestion that Mr Partridge knew that the boilers had been specifically set up to burn contaminated fuel.  This tends to confirm that his evidence on this point is a later fabrication. (e) Mr Bundock’s communication with the supplier in February 2017 shows that, contrary to Mr Partridge’s evidence, Biosol was not content to receive contaminated fuel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence concerning Mr Matthews shows that in November 2017 there was a stock of virgin woodchip present in Building 65, and that there were distinct piles of contaminated woodchip within Building 65 and in the lean-to adjacent to that building.  Mr Matthews’ concerns were, first, that the contaminated woodchip be not burned in the boilers and, second, that for that purpose there be no contact between the piles of contaminated and virgin woodchip inside Building 65.  Accordingly there was indeed virgin fuel present.  The contaminated fuel was separate, even if Mr Matthews was concerned at a risk of mixing within Building 65.  The most likely source of the contaminated fuel is the supply in early 2017, many months before Mr Matthews attended at the Premises.  The contaminated fuel seen by Mr Matthews had, nevertheless, not been burned by November 2017.  This coheres with Mr Bundock’s evidence and with his complaints to the supplier in early 2017.  It cannot be concluded that no contaminated fuel at all had been burned in the boilers.  But it is a reasonable inference, and one that I draw, that the contaminated fuel was separated and was not being used for burning in the boilers, Biosol having (as Mr Bundock says) decided to change its supplier and reverted to the use of virgin wood. </p>

These are not natural opposites or mutually exclusive categories.  A damages clause may be neither or both. The fact that the clause is not a pre-estimate of loss does not therefore, at any rate without more, mean that it is penal. To describe it as a deterrent (or, to use the Latin equivalent, <span style="font-style:italic">in terrorem</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>does not add anything.  A deterrent provision in a contract is simply one species of provision designed to influence the conduct of the party potentially affected.  It is no different in this respect from a contractual inducement.  Neither is it inherently penal or contrary to the policy of the law.  The question whether it is enforceable should depend on whether the means by which the contracting party’s conduct is to be influenced are ‘unconscionable’ or (which will usually amount to the same thing) “extravagant” by reference to some norm. </p>

The true test is whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation.  The innocent party can have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter. His interest is in performance or in some appropriate alternative to performance.  In the case of a straightforward damages clause, that interest will rarely extend beyond compensation for the breach, and we therefore expect that Lord Dunedin’s four tests would usually be perfectly adequate to determine its validity. But compensation is not necessarily the only legitimate interest that the innocent party may have in the performance of the defaulter’s primary </p>

Even in a consumer context the stipulated rate would be unlikely to raise eyebrows.  This is not, of course, a case of a rate of interest that increases in the event of default; no interest would be payable if the debt were discharged promptly.  Biosol had a legitimate and obvious interest in receiving payment quickly, because its own outlay was very considerable in respect of each contract of supply and it is a relatively small company.  A rate of 1.5% per month is clearly not disproportionate to, or extravagant or unconscionable in comparison to, its legitimate interest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Emmett submits that, if such an approach to construction is capable of imposing any obligations upon Biosol, those obligations are illusory or uncertain.  For example, Biosol might avoid any effective obligation under clause 1 of the agreement by failing to advise that maintenance or repairs are required, or by stipulating an unreasonable and prohibitive cost.  It is an unattractive feature of the submission that it seeks to negate the efficacy of an agreement, intended by commercial parties to be efficacious, by reference to hypothetical problems that are unlikely to reflect genuine difficulties in operating the agreement in practice.  Especially where agreements have been drawn up by commercial parties themselves, without the professional assistance of lawyers, it can be very easy to identify all manner of problems that could arise out of the drafting.  The courts are well used to applying principles of construction and implication to ensure that effect is given to agreements which the parties believed to be binding.  To find that an agreement cannot be saved is a conclusion of last resort.  In agreement with Mr Walker, I see no particular difficulty in addressing matters such as those raised by Mr Emmett by the implication of terms requiring Biosol to give such advice as may reasonably be required and to stipulate reasonable charges.  I do not consider that the latter requirement contradicts the express terms of clause 1: the maintenance and repair cannot be priced in advance, it must be priced as it is required; Biosol will specify the price—there is no need to seek the view of a third party; but the price must be reasonable. </p>

A well-known text-book describes contracts in restraint of trade as those which 'unreasonably restrict' the rights of a person to carry on his trade or profession. There is no need to regret these tendencies: indeed, to do so, when consideration of this subject has passed through such notable minds from Lord Macclesfield onwards, would indicate a failure to understand its nature. The common law has often (if sometimes unconsciously) thrived on ambiguity and it would be mistaken, even if it were possible, to try to crystallise the rules of this, or any, aspect of public policy into neat propositions. The doctrine of restraint of trade is one to be applied to factual situations with a broad and flexible rule of reason.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“The onus is on the party asserting the contract to show the reasonableness of the restraint. That rule was laid down in the <span style="font-style:italic">Nordenfelt</span> case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Herbert Morris Ltd v Saxelby</span>. When the court sees its way clearly, no question of onus arises. In a doubtful case where the court does not see its way clearly and the question of onus does arise, there may be a danger in preferring the guidance of a general rule, founded on grounds of public policy many generations ago, to the guidance given by free and competent parties contracting at arm's length in the management of their own affairs. Therefore, when free and competent parties agree and the background provides some commercial justification on both sides for their bargain, and there is no injury to the community, I think that the onus should be easily discharged. Public policy, like other unruly horses, is apt to change its stance, and public policy is the ultimate basis of the courts' reluctance to enforce restraints. Although the decided cases are almost invariably based on unreasonableness between the parties, it is ultimately on the ground of public policy that the court will decline to enforce a restraint as being unreasonable between the parties. And a doctrine based on the general commercial good must always bear in mind the changing face of commerce. There is not, as some cases seem to suggest, a separation between what is reasonable on grounds of public policy and what is reasonable as between the parties. There is one broad question: is it in the interests of the community that this restraint should, as between the parties, be held to be reasonable and enforceable?” </p>

I do not think there is anything in Mr Emmett’s complaint that the contract left it entirely up to Biosol to assess the need for maintenance and to fix the cost of the work: it is fanciful to suppose that there was a realistic prospect that Biosol would seek to operate the agreement in that manner, but in any event there must clearly be implied requirements that the work is reasonably required and that the price charged will be a reasonable price.</p>

But that is bound to be the case where one covenant is removed as being unreasonable.  In my view it is obvious that the removal of clause 3 will not effect any fundamental alteration in the scope and intention of the agreement, so as to turn it into a contract quite different from that which the parties entered.  It will simply mean that R&amp;A is bound not to get woodchip or other fuel for the boilers from any other source for the term of the contract. </p>

Mr Walker may be correct in saying that there is nothing to suggest that Biosol would stop loading the boilers.

The profit margin of 70% was not subject of challenge in the course of evidence.  The figure for loss of profit is accordingly: (a) £7,000 x 0.4 = £2,800; plus (b) £7,175 for year 2; plus (c) £7,350 for year 3: a total of £17,325. </p>
