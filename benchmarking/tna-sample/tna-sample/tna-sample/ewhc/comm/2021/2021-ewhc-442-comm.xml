	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The dispute has arisen because the policy was placed in the marine market in London with subscribing underwriters who were specialists in insuring cargo in warehouses and in transit, and in particular the risk of physical loss and damage to that cargo. However, the policy contained an unusual clause which, as the Bank and Edge contend, was intended to and did widen the cover so as to include risks which were not dependent on physical loss and damage. The clause in question was known as the “Transaction Premium Clause” or “TPC”. The Bank and Edge contend that its effect is to cover certain losses suffered by the Bank arising from the default of its customers, even if there was no physical loss and damage to the cargo.  </p>

They rely upon the fact, which is clear from the evidence at trial, that cover for the risk arising from the default of customers would ordinarily be placed with underwriters who specialised in providing insurance known as trade credit insurance. It is not usually provided by underwriters who provide cargo insurance. They therefore contend that the TPC should not be construed so as to provide, in effect, trade credit insurance and must be read as being only applicable where physical loss and damage is caused to the cargo. </p>

The effect of those conversations, on the underwriters’ case, is to prevent (via rectification, or estoppel or related principles) the Bank from relying on the terms of the policy on their true construction. The underwriters also contend that they are entitled to avoid the policy for non-disclosure or misrepresentation. The inevitable result of the case based on the conversations, and avoidance, is that the court has received a very large volume of evidence which would not ordinarily be admissible on an issue of construction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim arises out of the business of a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, of the Bank called Icestar B.V. (“Icestar”). The business of Icestar involved the provision of structured commodities finance to clients of the Bank. These clients were in the business of buying and selling commodities. The finance provided by Icestar comprised transactions known colloquially as “repo” transactions. They involved the provision by Icestar of working capital by purchasing the client’s commodity for a defined period of time. At the end of that period the client was contractually obliged to buy the commodity back from Icestar. During the course of the trial, the parties and the witnesses sometimes referred to Icestar specifically, but usually simply referred to “the Bank” as being synonymous with or at least encompassing Icestar. In this judgment, I will usually refer simply to “the Bank” since it is generally not necessary to draw any distinction between the Bank and Icestar. From time to time, however, I will refer to “Icestar”, either because there are some occasions on which it is appropriate to draw a distinction, but usually because a witness referred to Icestar rather than simply the Bank. </p>

Icestar was left having to dispose of the cargo at the best prices it could achieve. It was possible for Icestar to find buyers for the cocoa beans, which were generally of good quality, and no relevant losses were suffered by Icestar on the transactions where it held beans. However, the cocoa products proved to be of poor quality, and there was a significant shortfall between what could be recovered under sales to third parties and the amounts owed by Transmar and Euromar. This shortfall is the primary loss for which the Bank claims an indemnity under the policy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The policy was built on a foundation of conventional marine “all risks” terms including the Institute Cargo Clauses ‘A’. However, it also contained a large number of detailed clauses, including extensions to the cover which went beyond ordinary physical loss and damage to the cargo. The TPC, which is at the heart of the present dispute, was a clause initially presented to Mr. Beattie in July 2015. There is a dispute as to whether Mr. Beattie agreed to amend the cover in July 2015 so as to include the TPC for the 2015/2016 policy year, and (if so) whether his agreement bound the other underwriters on risk for that year. But there is no dispute that the TPC was contained in the cover which each insurer agreed to provide in early 2016 in respect of the 2016/2017 year. The slip ultimately “scratched” (ie signed) by Mr. Beattie on behalf of the RSA in January 2016, and also by the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants in February </p>

Other arguments arise from the fact that none of the underwriters, other than Mr. Beattie, recall reading the TPC.

These issues are addressed in Section F below.

Their factual evidence was principally relevant, as it seemed to me, to issues concerning nondisclosure and misrepresentation, and in particular what the reaction of underwriters would have been if Edge had explained the Bank’s purpose and intention in seeking the TPC. But the focus of the arguments of the Bank and Edge was not on that issue. Indeed, in its closing submissions, the Bank said (consistent with the underwriters’ case) that if Edge had told cargo underwriters that the Bank wanted credit risk cover, then on the “evidence before the court, the cargo underwriters would have said “No” (save perhaps Beattie)”.  </p>

The deals concerned a wide range of physical agricultural commodities (such as coffee, cocoa, and grains) and metals. Each deal had a tenor of three months but there were often “rollovers” of the financing. At each “rollover” date the amount of financing was reconsidered and approved by Icestar and as necessary a balancing or netting payment was made by the client in Icestar’s favour, thereby effecting a repayment of part of the outstanding finance.

As shown by an internal Bank credit paper (headed “Loan Syndications Advice”) dated December 2015, prepared at a time when the Bank was considering the renewal of a secured revolving credit facility known as the “borrowing base” facility, Transmar had been a long-standing client of the Bank for over 10 years, dating back to the time of the Bank’s corporate predecessor, Fortis. The document, which recommended the Bank’s continued involvement as lender to Transmar, described Transmar as one of the leading mid-sized independent cocoa merchants. The relationship was described as robust and longstanding, and the financial performance of Transmar as solid. Transmar was, at that time, a major player in the world cocoa market. Their corporate group was founded in 1980. An annex to the December credit paper showed Transmar and its affiliates to constitute a global operation, offering services spanning the entire cocoa supply chain (including sourcing beans from origin, international traders, and/or affiliates; processing of beans and products; and melting).

In such cases, Icestar bought exchange-deliverable cocoa beans from its counterparty, such as Transmar, and simultaneously granted the counterparty a call option to repurchase the beans. The client had no obligation to repurchase the beans, just a “call option” enabling it to do so as and when parcels of the cargo were needed back (for example to sell to a chocolate manufacturer, or to process). If the call option was not exercised, Icestar was able to deliver the goods to the appropriate cocoa exchange in exchange for the agreed price. It is of the nature of commodities that are exchange-deliverable that quality certificates are required as a precondition to delivering to the exchange. Accordingly Icestar always insisted on the provision of quality certification in relation to Type 1 deals.  </p>

As is apparent from numerous cases in the Commercial Court, and as explained in the evidence of Ms. Catherine Jago, an expert witness called by the insurers, a hedging contract enables a party to protect against the risk of an adverse market movement. By purchasing beans under Icestar 1 transactions, the Bank would be exposed to adverse downward movements which might affect the value of the beans that it was holding. This “long” position could be protected by a matching futures contract on the relevant cocoa exchange for the sale of equivalent beans. A downward movement in the value of the physical beans, causing a potential loss to the Bank, would be matched by an equivalent gain under the hedge on the exchange where the Bank would be entitled to receive a price which was above the then market price. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">“Icestar 2” was the mechanism used to finance cocoa products or beans that were not exchange-deliverable. It gave rise to three contracts: (1) a purchase contract whereby Icestar purchased goods from its client; (2) a call option contract in favour of the client, and (3) a swap option in favour of Icestar. The effect of the swap option was that Icestar had the contractual right to require the client to replace the product or beans with exchange-deliverable beans, or to pay their equivalent value in cash. In effect, this was a right to require repurchase. The relevant transactions between Icestar and Transmar in the present case were of the Icestar 2 variety. In due course, Transmar defaulted when Icestar did exercise its swap options in December 2016. An issue raised by insurers, in relation to “sue and labour”, is whether these swap options should have been exercised at an earlier stage, in August 2016, and if so what the consequence would have been: see Section H below. </p>

That hedge would then be transferred back to the counterparty through an EFP at the same time as the repurchase.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">“Icestar 3” was a structure used where there was a tripartite arrangement involving a client of the Bank and another counterparty. It was this structure that was used for the transactions involving Euromar. Euromar was a corporate affiliate of Transmar, and operated a cocoa processing facility in Germany. In this structure, as far as Euromar and Transmar are concerned, the Bank purchased goods from Transmar, and simultaneously entered into a forward sale contract with Euromar. This forward contract required Euromar to repurchase at the end of the financing period for a fixed price. This repurchase price was fixed in advance, because no hedges had been entered into by Euromar. Euromar would have the benefit of a call option, and this permitted it to repurchase quantities of the commodity before the agreed forward sale date. All of the Euromar deals in the present case were Icestar 3 deals. </p>

They were more confident that Endorsement 4 covered the general “market premium” situation, but they pointed out that there were aspects of Endorsement 4 which required clarification.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Three other features of this e-mail should be noted. First, Mr. Mullen described the draft endorsement as a “wish list”. This phrase seems to have originated with Mr. Lee Lockyer, the more junior colleague with whom Mr. Mullen worked, on 24 June. On that day, Mr. Lockyer sent Mr. Mullen an e-mail which said: “Please see the attached “wish list” of Icestar in PDF and Word format”. This followed a request by Mr. Mullen to Ms. Barnes for a Word version of the document that he had been provided, because he was having difficulty with the version that he had scanned into his computer. Mr. Beattie’s evidence was that the expression, “wish list” was used by Mr. Mullen when they met in July 2015. I shall return to the relevance of this when discussing the evidence as to the meeting.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">What is clear, however, is that Mr. Mullen understood that the Bank was seeking a contractually binding change to the terms of the existing policy. The e-mail of 25 June thus refers to the “document “wish list”…”, but also to an “endorsement” which would require the signature of all underwriters. Mr. Mullen was not therefore distinguishing in his own mind between a “wish list” and a contractual endorsement, and in my view he cannot be criticised in that respect. A list of terms which a party wishes to include in a variation of a contract can easily and properly be described as a “wish list”. That expression does not denote that the list of clauses requested is something other than contractual. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Mullen’s e-mail indicated that the document would need to be discussed with the lead Underwriter “point by point”. An important question, relating to the July meeting discussed in Section E, is whether this is what actually happened. However, it is clear that Mr. Mullen anticipated that it would or at least might happen. This was a reason why Mr. Mullen did subsequently (as shown by his e-mail to the Bank on 9 July 2015) go through the document in detail, asking pertinent questions relating to many of the proposed amendments. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Mr. Mullen indicated that “our regulations” required the endorsement to be signed by all underwriters; ie not simply the lead underwriter.

It is fair to say that Mr. Mullen’s oral evidence at trial, in cross-examination over a number of days, indicated a fair amount of woolly thinking about the TPC. For example, he sometimes used the word “delay” when it seemed, perhaps, that he was intending to refer to “default”. However, I have to bear in mind that Mr. Mullen is now 76, and is seeking to recall events, and was being asked about his thoughtprocesses, many years ago. These two contemporaneous documents, which both squarely address the effect of the TPC, provide evidence which assists Edge’s case that it was understood at the time.  </p>

The underwriters suggested that the reason why Mr. Mullen had not seen Mr. Beattie by this stage was that he realised that it would be difficult to obtain his agreement to the amendments which the Bank was seeking. I do not consider that the evidence supports this. Mr. Mullen’s 8 July e-mail indicates that it was only at around this time that Mr. Mullen applied his mind to the detailed terms of the proposed endorsement. The evidence does not support a finding that this was because of some problem which Mr. Mullen recognised. The more likely explanation is that Mr. Mullen was doing other things, and had not got round to examining the endorsement in detail. Perhaps this was because he had thought that the addendum would take him some time to consider and understand (people do sometimes put off things which may be difficult), but I do not consider it necessary to speculate further as to whether this was in fact the reason.  </p>

It is clear, both from his e-mail of 12 July and from what he subsequently did, that he did have in mind that the Bank’s desired changes should take the form of a formal contract endorsement similar to the form of prior endorsements such as Endorsements 3 and 4. The underwriters’ case, at least originally, was that the (alleged) non-binding nature of the document which Mr. Beattie scratched on 28 July 2015 was evidenced by the fact that this was not prepared as a formal endorsement, as it could have been. Mr. Mullen’s oral evidence in cross-examination was that he had originally started to use a template for formal endorsements which was on the Edge computer system. However, he was insufficiently computer-literate to be able to incorporate the lengthy text of the Bank’s proposed endorsement into the standard template. He had therefore decided that he would use an ordinary “Word” document. This evidence led to a request for disclosure, whilst Mr. Mullen was giving evidence, of the relevant computer files which might evidence this work. Disclosure provided by Edge overnight supported Mr. Mullen’s account. The ‘metadata’ for the relevant documents showed that Mr. Mullen had worked on a proposed endorsement, using the standard template, on the morning of 20 July, but had stopped at 11.49 am and had then created a separate </p>

He considered that it was appropriate to put it in Section 2 of the policy, headed “General Conditions”, followed by words which stated that the general conditions applied to all sections of the contract. He then included the TPC as Clause 1.5 which was preceded by the heading “Definitions”. I do not need to set out, at this stage, the terms of the policy, drafted by Mr. Lockyer and then sent to the Bank on 18 January: they are materially identical to the terms to which various underwriters, including Mr. Beattie, subscribed between 20 and 27 January.

It is possible that this placement was because the TPC itself contained various definitions which had been highlighted in bold in the July endorsement. It is likely that Mr. Lockyer considered that he was embarking upon a somewhat mechanical exercise of transferring agreed terms into the new policy, and may have given little thought, at that stage, to the effect of the particular clauses. That this is so is confirmed by his inclusion, at Clause 1.6, of another clause (which had been included in the July endorsement) which was not, and did not contain, any definition: see Section C below. </p>

The TPC was therefore at Clause 1.5 of Section 2. Mr. Beattie scratched the slip on that day, signing it on the front page and also against the clause which increased the limits for oil (to USD 250 million), and against the “Fraudulent documentation” clause, where the USD 5 million sub-limit had been removed. Mr. Beattie’s notes on the RSA file indicate that the increased limit to USD 250 million was discussed.

His evidence was that he wanted to make sure that it was clear that, irrespective of where the clause was placed, it was an add-on and that there was coverage for client default. He did not recall exactly what was discussed, but thought that they had discussed the nature of the main insurance and the need for the cover under the TPC to be clearly seen as a separate add-on.

However, I do not think that Mr. Mullen was here indicating that he intended to mislead Mr. Beattie as and when he came back with “adjustments” on the copy policy, and in that context I bear in mind that no allegation of fraud is made against Edge in these proceedings. Rather, Mr. Mullen was indicating that he thought that he could get Mr. Beattie to agree as and when Mr. Mullen went back to him, notwithstanding Mr. Beattie’s irritation. As Ms. Healy submitted, this unfortunate choice of phrase was simply a broker’s shorthand for seeking to persuade Mr. Beattie to agree to move the TPC from Section 2 to Section 1.  </p>

Secondly, the opening paragraph suggests that the underwriters had made the two recommendations which were then set out.

It was the Bank, following the advice of NRF, which had put the TPC into Section 1, immediately before the Basis of Valuation clause.

The final point was a request to add an additional storage facility in Milford Haven to the list of approved warehouses for oil. Mr. Lockyer replied saying that they would arrange for these amendments to be made, and then sent the Bank a clean copy incorporating the five changes made.  The TPC remained in sections 1 and 4. At this point, however, Mr. Lockyer had not in fact approached Mr. Beattie to obtain agreement on the five changes, including the addition of the additional storage facility. Whilst Mr. Beattie had signed the later policy on the morning of 29 January – the principal change in that policy being the move of the TPC from Section 2 to two locations – none of the following market had been shown the later policy whose wording Mr. Beattie had agreed. </p>

It is also clear from the pagination of the document and the footer that this is an amalgamation of documents. Mr. Lockyer should not have sent a document in this form, at least without explaining to the Bank how the document had been put together. Furthermore, the document incorporated the 5 amendments proposed by Ms. Van de Beek on the afternoon of 29 January, even though none of the underwriters, including Mr. Beattie, had yet seen the amendments. No doubt Mr. Lockyer was anticipating that Mr. Beattie would find the changes acceptable. </p>

I do not understand there to have been any allegation that Mr. Lockyer acted dishonestly, or that he in some way intended to deceive the Bank, or indeed that the Bank has ever (prior to trial) complained about the document. It would seem that Mr. Lockyer, in a misguided way, was seeking to give the Bank a single document which – after the slip had been through many iterations over the previous week – contained in one place the final wording and the security. It was not suggested to Mr. Lockyer in cross-examination that he had acted with a lack of integrity in relation to the preparation of this document. Mr. Lockyer, who was a witness who (as I have said) sought to give truthful evidence to the best of his recollection, was misguided in relation to this document. But this document is a distraction from the issues which I need to resolve – particularly bearing in mind that the real issues in this case involve what Mr. Mullen, who was responsible for broking this risk, said and did, rather than the conduct of Mr. Lockyer who was his assistant. There is no suggestion that the amalgamated document was the work of, or was approved by, Mr. Mullen. </p>

The argument depends upon what documents are being compared to each other. It may be appropriate to describe, as minor, the 5 changes made between (i) the later policy signed by Mr. Beattie on 29 January and (ii) the policy attached to Endorsement 1 scratched by Mr. Vaughan. However, it may not be appropriate to describe, as minor, the changes made when comparing (i) the earlier policy to which they subscribed between 25 and 29 January, and (ii) the policy attached to Endorsement 1 scratched by Mr. Vaughan. When these documents are compared, there was a potentially significant change, namely that the TPC had been moved from Clause 1.5 in Section 2 to the two other locations in the policy. The riposte to this argument, certainly on behalf of Edge, is that this change – although advised upon by NRF – makes no material difference to the interpretation of the cover. </p>

She explained that Icestar had sent “Reservation of Rights” letters to Euromar, and in addition had sent, on the advice of German counsel, what she described as a “no demand” letter confirming that Icestar would not demand payment for the coming 13 weeks. This letter was sent so as to prevent Euromar from having to file for insolvency. She also explained in her email, under a heading “Actions undertaken to mitigate potential losses”, the actions being so taken. These included cooperation with Euromar “in trying to liquidate the stock so that Icestar can be repaid”.

In the earlier policy wording, it was only on page 3, following the “Limits” provision. None of the parties sought to attach any significance to the duplication of the “Basis of Valuation” clause.

These principles have been authoritatively stated in a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions in the past 10 years: <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank </span>[2011] UKSC 50; <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton </span>[2015] UKSC 36; <span style="font-style:italic">Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd. </span>[2017] UKSC 24.

The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision.  </p>

That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning. If there is a specific error in the drafting, it may often have no relevance to the issue of interpretation which the court has to resolve. </p>

The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. Commercial common sense is only relevant to the extent of how matters would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made.

The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party.  </p>

Rather, the lawyer and the judge, when interpreting any contract, can use them as tools to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will vary according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements. Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis, for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they have been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals. The correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater emphasis on the factual matrix, for example because of their informality, brevity or the absence of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of complex formal contracts may often not achieve a logical and coherent text because of, for example, the conflicting aims of the parties, failures of communication, differing drafting practices, or deadlines which require the parties to compromise in order to reach agreement. There may often therefore be provisions in a detailed professionally drawn contract which lack clarity and the lawyer or judge in interpreting such provisions may be particularly helped by considering the factual matrix and the purpose of similar provisions in contracts of the same type. The iterative process, of which Lord Mance JSC spoke in <span style="font-style:italic">Sigma Finance Corpn </span>[2010] 1 ALL ER 571, para 12, assists the lawyer or judge to ascertain the objective meaning of the disputed provisions.” </p>

Neither the policy as a whole, nor the specific clauses relied upon, could be construed as providing cover for what were described as “paper” losses, in contrast to physical loss and damage to actual cargo.

The insurers did not accept that this was so, but in any event argued that insurance policies often contain surplus words and any presumption against surplusage was weak.

And perhaps the most important canon of construction for the purposes of the present case is that, in construing a contract, all parts of it must be given effect where possible, and no part of it should be treated as inoperative or surplus.

There was no suggestion that the Default needed to have anything to do with loss or damage to the cargo. The coverage was tied to a Default, and that was not a concept dependent on the presence of physical loss or damage. Default was not about physical loss or damage. This was clear from, and emphasised by, the words “for any reason” which formed part of the definition of Default. It was apparent on the face of the TPC that this was a carefully drafted contract.

The policy was not on any view a policy which only provided cover against physical loss and damage: there were “add-ons” to be found in the clauses which covered business contingency losses, CEND and fraudulent documentation. These extensions had been provided without any adjustment to the premium ratings under the policy. There was no rule of law which meant that add-ons were not permissible: it was simply an issue of construction. The broking experts had agreed that add-ons were generally available in the London market at the material times. At the time, the Bank was regarded as a good risk: the premiums payable under the policy were high, and there was a good claims record. The policy was oversubscribed with the lines of some underwriters being “signed down”. The market was generally “soft” and difficult from underwriters’ perspective. There were therefore good reasons why the underwriters might have been prepared to provide what was in effect credit risk cover as a free addon. Overall, however, the factual matrix was not and could not be decisive. There were factors which pointed in different directions, and ultimately the question was: what did the parties agree here? </p>

But this fact could not be allowed to have preclusive or dogmatic effect. Add-ons to standard PLOD cover were common in the market, and there is no reason why such an add-on could not give protection for financial default. The cover related to precisely the same cargoes that were already being declared and insured.

Edge emphasised the absence of any express language in the TPC which supported the underwriters’ argument. Ms. Healy also emphasised the “for whatever reason” wording in the definition of Default. In its opening written submissions, Edge also identified a number of different scenarios where there might be loss and damage to the cargo. In none of these situations would the TPC, if construed simply as providing a basis of valuation, add to the existing terms. In the case of destruction of the goods, the TPC would be inapplicable in its entirety.

The fact that a counterparty had committed a default subsequent to the loss and damage would add nothing.

In the present case, he submitted in opening, it was not simply a question of there being a presumption that the policy was limited to physical loss and damage. The policy contained an express provision in the opening section: “This contract is to protect against all risks of physical loss or damage to the Subject Matter Insured from whatsoever cause arising”.

Mr. Parsons submitted that the TPC provided cover for the transaction premium that would have been earned but for a default “following the operation of an insured peril identified elsewhere in the marine cargo and storage policy”. A reasonable person in the marine cargo market would read the words as identifying the “head of loss, measure of indemnity or basis of valuation” (these expressions were interchangeable) “following a peril elsewhere”. The argument therefore accepted that the TPC was not confined to recovery where there had been physical loss and damage, but would also be applicable (for example) if there was a claim arising under the CEND clause or the Business Contingency Cover. The reason for this movement in the underwriters’ position was, at least as I perceived it, that if the TPC was indeed a basis of valuation clause, then it was logical to say that it was a basis of valuation for all of the risks covered under the policy, rather than simply for the risk of physical loss and damage. </p>

In the unamended policy, it appeared at Clause 1.5 under the general heading of “Definitions”. In that context, it could have meaning as a basis of valuation clause. Whilst the submission as to why the TPC was a basis of valuation clause was undeveloped in the underwriters’ written opening, that case was explained to some degree in Mr. Parsons’ oral opening, and ultimately articulated with clarity in his written and oral closings. In summary, the underwriters submitted that if there was physical loss and damage to the goods, and then for whatever reason the counterparty failed or refused or did not exercise the option, then the TPC would provide some additional cover. Specifically, this would provide cover for the “market premium” which had been originally identified in Endorsement No. 3 to the policy signed by Mr. Beattie in February 2015. This was defined in that Endorsement, and subsequently in Endorsement No. 4, as the “difference between the exchange quoted price and the physical market price at purchase as specified on the relevant invoice or in the relevant transaction documents”.

This would encompass this element of “market premium”, but there would still need to be physical loss or damage. The TPC in this way ensured that the Bank would not be out of pocket, and could recover its entire loss, in the event of physical loss of or damage to the goods. Reasonable people in the position of the parties would have understood that the TPC was simply providing clarification in order to dispel any doubt as to whether the “market premium” was within the scope of the Basis of Valuation clause. </p>

It would have been difficult to obtain this cover even from specialist underwriters in the credit risk market. Had it been available, trade credit underwriters would have ensured that terms were imposed which circumscribed their potential liability. If the Bank’s argument succeeded, they would receive a “windfall”; because the only thing that the Bank had really wanted to do was to cover the “market premium” which had been the subject of Endorsements 3 and 4. If the cover was extended by underwriters in the manner suggested by the Bank, then that extension of cover would have been entirely unwitting.

However, no contract should be interpreted in a vacuum, and it would not be appropriate to resolve the construction of the TPC without regard to the admissible and relevant factual matrix. However, in addressing issues of construction, I put aside the views expressed by witnesses, both factual and expert, as to their understanding of the clause or its clarity. Nor is it appropriate to take into account what the Bank, or NRF, was seeking to achieve by the TPC. I therefore do not need to resolve the dispute as to whether (as the underwriters suggested) NRF misunderstood what the Bank was seeking to achieve, or the related argument that the Bank’s case would involve them receiving a windfall. (I will, however, return to that matter below). Furthermore, whilst I consider that the nature of the market in which the parties were operating is relevant and admissible factual matrix evidence, I was not persuaded that Mr. Mullen’s subjective views as to the risk appetite of underwriters, and other aspects of Mr. Mullen’s subjective perception of the risk or the wording, is relevant and admissible.

He did not, however, regard it as his part of his role, unless asked, to provide an explanation of the wording to Mr. Beattie, who could read the wording for himself. I do not consider that evidence, as to the way in which Mr. Mullen was or may have been thinking, was of any relevance to the construction of the TPC.

In my view, the most significant aspect of the factual matrix, against which the policy and the TPC falls to be construed, concerns the nature of the market in which Mr. Beattie and Mr. Mullen were operating. That market was, in broad terms, the London marine market where there were underwriters who specialised in writing insurance on cargo risks. There were other underwriters in that market who specialised in other aspects of marine business, such as hull or war risks. There is no doubt that the core business of the cargo underwriters is the writing of risks concerning physical loss and damage to cargo whilst in transit or in store. However, the underwriting experts agreed that coverages which do not require physical loss or damage were generally available in the London marine cargo market in 2015/16 as an add-on to marine cargo and storage policies.  </p>

Leaving aside the disputed issues as to the interpretation of the TPC, there was ultimately no dispute in the present case that the policy did contain three separate “add-ons” which did not require physical loss or damage. These were the cover for delay under the “Business contingency cover” (or “BCC”) in Clause 20 of Section 2 of the policy, the cover for “Fraudulent documentation” in Clause 17 of the same section, and the CEND cover in Section 3.  </p>

This wording was itself expanded in the July 2015 endorsement, and then incorporated in its expanded form into the policy subscribed by all underwriters in January/February 2016. Its effect, in broad terms, was to provide cover in circumstances where the Bank had been the victim of a fraud. The expansion of the cover in 2015/2016 reflected a widely-known problem at that time, referred to at the trial as Qingdao, where a company deployed fraudulent duplicate warehouse receipts to raise trade finance secured against the same stockpile of cargo. Multiple versions of the warehouse receipts were fraudulently created for the same parcel of goods, leaving numerous insureds suffering loss in the absence of any physical loss or damage or theft of the goods. </p>

The issues arising on the Bank’s claim for damages against Edge meant that there was a considerable volume of expert evidence, from Mr. Hayter and Mr. Hedley, as to the approach taken by these specialist underwriters to the writing of risks. This evidence included both the rating approach and the terms which might typically be included. Whilst participants in the marine cargo market, both on the underwriting and broking side, might know at a very general level of the existence of these specialist underwriters (ie a market for trade credit risks), the evidence suggested that they would not know the detail of the risks that were being written, or the rating or other approach taken by these specialists. Nor would they readily know the materials which would typically be considered by trade credit underwriters in forming a view as to whether a particular risk was acceptable. Information about the trade credit market, including matters relating to the underwriting approach, could no doubt have been obtained by underwriters or brokers, via contacts or colleagues, if they were interested in finding anything out. To that extent, such information was reasonably available to the parties and could be said to form part of the factual matrix. Ordinarily, however, the business of marine cargo underwriters would not require them to do so, since their policies did not ordinarily include risks of that nature. I do not therefore consider that the evidence as to how trade credit insurers approached the writing of these risks is of any real assistance in deciding how the TPC is to be construed. </p>

Indeed, the more obvious conclusion is that the parties, in the TPC, were not aiming at the same target as with Endorsement 4. In particular, the foundation for the argument that the parties simply had in mind the concept of “market premium”, as used in the earlier endorsements, is lacking. If the parties had simply been concerned with “market premium” as previously defined, that definition could have been retained and expanded upon if required. </p>

The definition of “market premium” was again dispensed with, to be replaced by the more general words “any premium or profit element”. The 5 lines of text of the revised Endorsement 3 is again to be contrasted with the 21 lines of text of the TPC, the different terminology there used, and the fact that the TPC is not limited to cases of delay. </p>

For example, the first words of the policy, with the side-heading “Type”, are: “Marine Cargo and Storage Insurance”. The parties incorporated the standard Institute Cargo Clauses ‘A’, and these are standard physical loss and damage terms. The policy contained provisions, such as those in Section 1 with the side headings “Location”, “Per”, “Shipments Clause” and “Storage Risks” which would typically be seen in an ordinary cargo policy covering physical loss and damage. The policy limits (which appeared twice, in the opening provisions and then again in Section 1) were referable to “any one Conveyance” (USD 50,000,000) and “any one individual warehouse, shed or storage facility” (USD 100,000,000). The rating schedule provided for a differential between transit and storage risks. In relation to soft commodities (such as the cocoa and cocoa products with which this case is concerned) the respective rates were 0.16% per voyage, and 0.13% for goods in store.  </p>

However, it did not seem to me that reference to these provisions was of any great assistance in resolving the issue as to the construction of the TPC. The existence of clauses in the policy relating to physical loss and damage explains and provides a firm foundation for the principle, illustrated by <span style="font-style:italic">Engelhart</span>, that the starting point is that the policy covers physical loss and damage to the cargo, unless there are clear words which provide wider cover. However, it does not answer the question of whether a particular clause such as the TPC is to be interpreted as providing that wider cover. That must depend upon the true construction of the relevant clause, and the clarity of the words used. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">This approach is borne out by the terms of the policy in the present case. It was, ultimately, common ground that there were three policy provisions which did indeed provide wider cover; ie cover in the absence of physical loss and damage. These were the Business Contingency Cover, the CEND Cover and the Fraudulent Documentation clause. The insurers argued that an analogy could be drawn between the risks covered by these clauses and physical loss and damage, and that in any event it was not unusual to see these extensions in cargo policies. I agree that it can be said that there is some analogy, certainly in relation to Business Contingency Cover and the CEND Cover, with physical loss and damage. In both cases, the insured is deprived of the physical cargo for a period of time, and in that sense might be said to suffer a physical loss at least pro tem. But even there the analogy is not exact, because the cargo itself may be entirely unharmed. Many cargoes, such as metals, can survive lengthy storage conditions, and the evidence indicated that cocoa beans (as distinct from products) may survive in store for very many years.  </p>

This wording appears to have been added in order to cover the situation in a case such as Qingdao. Furthermore, Clause 17.3 is also not confined to physical loss, but covers “direct financial loss suffered by reason of the impairment of the Insured’s interest in the subject matter insured”.  </p>

He said, however, that the risks covered by these clauses were part of a maritime adventure, and flowed closely from something that was already covered by the policy. This was, he submitted, very different to trade credit or financial guarantee insurance. </p>

Analogies with physical loss and damage may or may not be apt. But even if such an analogy can be drawn in some respects, that does not mean that the relevant provisions do not extend beyond physical loss and damage. Ultimately, I consider that one is driven back to careful consideration of the clarity of the words which the parties have actually used in the clause alleged to provide the relevant extension of cover beyond physical loss and damage. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">In considering this argument, it is sufficient to focus on the storage element of the cover. This provided coverage whilst cargoes were in store at various warehouses around the world. Whilst in those warehouses, those goods would be subject to the usual risks of physical damage, as well as to other risks such as delay or confiscation, covered or potentially covered by the various additional clauses. The effect of the TPC, on the case of the Bank/ Edge, was to provide cover for another risk, or more accurately combination of risks, to which the Bank was exposed in respect of those goods which had been purchased on the basis of repo transactions. That combination involved the risk that (i) the counterparty would default in failing to take back the goods and pay for them, and (ii) the value of the goods would fail to realise the preagreed price which the counterparty had agreed to pay. There was, therefore, a combination of a default risk and a risk as to the value of the collateral which affected the cargoes which were in store and which were already the subject of the ordinary cargo insurance. Ms. Healy said that there was no reason in principle why the cover on goods should not be extended to cover these additional risks. Whether or not the cover was so extended was, ultimately, a question of construction of the relevant clause. But this was not a case where the Bank was alleging that it had some general financial guarantee cover in relation to its counterparties (for example on ordinary unsecured loans that it had made), as opposed to cover which was directly related to goods which had been secured. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I think that these points were correct. Ms. Healy’s argument shows that there is no particular difficulty in applying the extended cover provided by the TPC (if it indeed provides such cover) to the goods which were already covered for loss and damage whilst in store. Indeed, I did not understand Mr. Parsons to submit that there was any such difficulty. His main point was not that it could not be done, but rather that it produced a commercially absurd result, particularly bearing in mind the way in which the premium had been rated (with lower rates for storage than transit) and the fact that no additional premium was charged for this additional substantial risk. The effect of construing the policy in the manner proposed by the Bank/ Edge was therefore to add considerably to the insurer’s potential for loss, but without any commensurate premium. The addition of these risks also, as he correctly said, potentially resulted in more likely scenarios where goods in more than one, possibly many, warehouses could be affected. The policy limit was calculated on a per warehouse basis; ie US$ 100 million per warehouse. A fire or storm or flood might in all likelihood affect only one warehouse, or possibly more but only if they were in reasonably close geographical proximity. By contrast, a default of a counterparty, leading to an inability to realise the relevant price of the goods, could affect goods in numerous and an unlimited number of warehouses across the world. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The word “Default” therefore appears 3 times in the TPC, although one of these times is to provide a wide definition. It is a concept which, ordinarily, is alien to a policy or clause which simply covers the risk of physical loss or damage. Ordinarily, if a person insures goods which he owns or are at his risk, and physical loss or damage occurs to those goods, a claim can be made for the value of the goods lost or for their diminished value. As the underwriters submitted in their written closing, a default is not a pre-requisite for a claim by the Bank where there is physical loss and damage, and it would be entitled to claim that loss by reference to the Basis of Valuation clause in the policy whether or not there had been a default by the Bank’s counterparty. Thus, the repeated use of a term which ordinarily is alien (ie alien to a policy which does no more than to insure against the risk of physical loss or damage) is itself a further indication that the TPC was not so linked. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Fourth, the underwriters’ argument was primarily, or at least very strongly, based not on the language which the parties had actually used in the TPC, but rather upon the proposition that various considerations – factual matrix, the contract as a whole, and commercial consequences – should lead to the ordinary and natural meaning of the words used in the TPC being circumscribed. In my view, however, it is not appropriate, in the context of this carefully drafted clause, to read in words of limitation which are not there, and in so doing to deprive the existing language of its natural and ordinary meaning. There is nothing in the language of the clause which limits its application to default following physical loss or damage, or to default following the operation of other perils such as delay. That is not the natural reading of the operative part of the clause in [1]. The coverage in [1] was expressly for the “Transaction Premium that would otherwise have been earned or received in the absence of a Default”. “Transaction Premium” was itself defined in [6] as being the difference between the Pre-Agreed Price (defined in [4]) and the Actual Sale Price (defined in [3]). The coverage provided is therefore not tied to anything other than (i) Default, and (ii) the Transaction Premium that the insured would otherwise have earned in the absence of Default. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Fifth, the underwriters’ argument has the effect of negating express words which are found in the definition of “Default”. This is a point which the Bank and Edge made repeatedly in their submissions, and I did not think that the underwriters had an effective answer to the point. The definition of Default refers to the client’s failure or refusal “(<span style="text-decoration:underline">for whatever reason</span>) to purchase or repurchase.” There is therefore no suggestion that the Default need have anything to do with loss or physical damage to the cargo, or any of the other non-PLOD perils. The language indicates that Default includes the breach by counterparties (such as Transmar and Euromar in the present case), and that it is not relevant to enquire into how or why the non-performance has come about. The underwriters’ argument therefore requires some event to have occurred which is then followed by a Default. If the parties’ intention had been that </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Sixth, the underwriters’ argument produces the result that the TPC has no application in a situation in which the cargo was destroyed (for example in a warehouse fire) or so damaged that it could not in practice be sold and delivered to an exchange or sold on the open market. It was common ground that the TPC would have no application in such circumstances; because the coverage was referable to the “Actual Sale Price” (see [2]), which was defined as the sum received upon the sale of the Subject Matter Insured to the applicable Exchange or to a third party on the open market. As Ms. Sabben-Clare said in opening, it would be a “curious beast” for a clause which provides a measure of loss or “basis of valuation” to be inapplicable in a situation of loss or damage (ie destruction or extensive damage to goods rendering them unsaleable) which could foreseeably occur and for which the parties would have expected the insurance to provide coverage.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Finally, I consider that the wording of the provision concerning “Sellers Insurance interest” does, marginally, reinforce the case that there is no relevant link in the TPC to physical loss or damage. The Sellers Insurance interest provision does contemplate a situation where the Bank’s buyer, on FOB or CFR terms, fails to pay for “loss of or damage” to goods. It can therefore reasonably be said that if the parties had intended that limitation to be applicable to the TPC, this would have been spelt out. I do not think, however, that too much significance should be attached to the wording of this Sellers Interest clause. None of the parties referred to this clause until closing submissions, and it is doubtful whether the draftsman would have had this clause in mind when drafting the TPC. It is therefore a marginal point, and I regard the other points to which I have referred as more significant. </p>

The argument was somewhat complex, and in order to consider its validity it is convenient to start by setting out the Basis of Valuation clause that was contained in the policy, prior (and indeed subsequent) to the introduction of the TPC.

This clause had appeared in materially identical terms in policies in prior years. If there were shortcomings, and a desire to deal with possible shortcomings in the BOV clause relating to the Bank’s sales, then one would have expected the BOV clause to be changed. One would not expect the BOV clause to be expanded upon by a wholly separate clause, which makes no reference to the BOV clause itself, and uses very different terminology. Furthermore, the heading to a clause may be taken into account in construing a clause, at least as a signpost concerning the topic that is being addressed: see <span style="font-style:italic">Lewison </span>paragraphs 5.108 – 5.110, and <span style="font-style:italic">The Radauti</span> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 276 (per Staughton J at first instance).

The TPC had a simple formula for calculating the Transaction Premium: the difference between the PreAgreed Price and the Actual Sale Price. The Pre-Agreed Price was the amount for which the Bank’s counterparty had agreed to purchase or repurchase the goods: it comprised (see [4]) both the “principal together with any premium or profit element payable to the Insured”. The clause was therefore focused on the total amount which the counterparty would pay, inclusive of premium and profit. It was not therefore simply concerned with the premium or profit element referable to the sale to the counterparty. That was only one part of the overall calculation.  </p>

The evidence in the case showed that such repo transactions were a very usual way in which a bank would advance funds to its customers, with the result that it would acquire the ownership of goods for a temporary period and the customer would repurchase them later. The need for the Bank to insure the goods here arose from its ownership of goods acquired in this way, via transactions involving the purchase of goods and agreements relating to their repurchase. Whilst the insurers may not have known the precise details of the Bank’s contracts with its customers, there was no suggestion that repo transactions, such as those carried out here involving a purchase and resale to a customer, were in any way unusual or outside the scope of the policy.

In fact, there was no evidence that the Bank entered into such contracts. Where repo transactions are concerned, one would more naturally expect that the “call options” would give the counterparty the right to call for goods, and such call options were indeed a feature of the Bank’s transactions with Euromar and Transmar.

It did not seem to me to be right to say that the monetary exposure of underwriters was increased. The existing policy covered every cargo owned by the Bank, and therefore every existing ton of goods in each warehouse was at the risk of the underwriters. Even without the TPC, there was certainly some risk of exposure to common problems across different warehouses. For example, where goods were stored in warehouses which were geographically close, a single event such as a major explosion (such as occurred in 2020 in Beirut) or a tsunami or a hurricane could potentially impact more than one warehouse. In relation to the fraudulent documents cover, there was the potential for the actions of a dishonest counterparty to affect goods stored, or apparently stored, in different warehouses.

Whilst at an early stage they (or at least some individuals within the Bank) had been focusing on the concept of “market premium” – being the difference between the price on a recognised exchange and market price – their thinking then moved on, with the benefit of NRF’s advice. </p>

I have no doubt that the TPC was subjectively intended by the Bank to cover the Bank for precisely the problem which ultimately occurred with Transmar and Euromar. The evidence showed that, after the TPC had been agreed in July 2015, the Bank thought that it had that coverage, and conducted its business on that basis. </p>

The carefully drafted terms were presented initially to Mr. Beattie in July 2015, at a meeting where he was told that the wording was wanted by the Bank’s lawyers. It would have been apparent that the terms had been very carefully drafted. I shall deal with the evidence as to this meeting in more detail in Section E, but it is plain that Mr. Beattie gave the wording nothing which approached the care which the Bank and its lawyers had taken. He can have read it through only once in a meeting which lasted around 15 minutes, before (as I conclude in Section E) signing the document and agreeing to the inclusion of the wording. That would have left precious little time for any discussion, particularly bearing in mind that the July 2015 endorsement contained a series of amendments and additions. As discussed in Section E, I am not satisfied that Mr. Beattie raised any questions about the TPC. But even if I were to accept his evidence, he did not receive </p>

Again, even if I were to accept his evidence, there was an inconclusive discussion with Mr. Mullen about what the TPC meant, with no attempt to amend the clause or to record Mr. Beattie’s alleged understanding.

No point was then taken that the Bank’s potential claim was at odds with commercial common sense. </p>

By contrast, the underwriters considered that its location as Clause 1.5 in the earlier version – where it was not a separate section and appeared immediately after some definitions – was helpful in indicating the relative unimportance of the clause on its true construction; an unimportance which did not change when the same words were moved into two separate locations.  </p>

For reasons discussed in Section E below, the TPC first became contractually binding – at least on RSA – in July 2015. At that stage, it was not tethered to any particular part of the policy wording. Under the July 2015 endorsement, it was expressed to be a replacement of the previous endorsement which had (as discussed above) been concerned with the Business Contingency cover. However, the TPC in the July 2015 endorsement was, clearly, not confined to the BCC element of the coverage. In that regard, there is a contrast between the TPC and the revised wording, in the July endorsement, of Endorsement 3. In addition, as already described, the TPC used new definitions and new language which, in their critical respects, were not related to the risks covered elsewhere in the policy wording. In these circumstances, the TPC was, when first introduced, a standalone provision, with no relevant link to any particular section of the policy or any part of the coverage elsewhere. </p>

There was much argument at the hearing as to whether or not the endorsement was binding on following underwriters. I do not think that the resolution of that debate is of any real significance when considering the factual matrix to the 2016 policy. The evidence shows that none of the following market who had subscribed to the 2015 slip were told about the amendment at that time, or had their attention drawn on renewal in January 2016 to the fact that this amendment had taken place mid-year in 2015. However, all of the following market in 2016 – including the 4 insurers (the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> – 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants) who had not subscribed to the 2015 policy – were shown and subscribed to the slip which contained the TPC. Even though none of them actually knew that the origin of the TPC was the endorsement agreed by the RSA in July, where the TPC was a standalone provision, this was information which was reasonably available to them. If they were interested in the origin of the TPC they only had to ask the broker about it – as did one underwriter, Mr. Shillabeer of Channel (the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendant) after the claim arose.

The 2003 Marine Cargo Schedule to GUA identifies, in Part 3 thereof, those (necessarily significant) contract changes which “may be agreed only by all Underwriters each for its own proportion severally and not jointly”. If a change did not fall within Part 3, then RSA could agree it.

Prior to the TPC, the underwriters were exposed to the potential for loss in relation to every ton of the Bank’s cargo that was in store or in transit, subject to the limits of the policy. The TPC did not effect an increase in those policy limits. The effect of the TPC was that the potential for loss, within the existing policy limits, was increased. There was now coverage, for goods already at risk, in relation to additional perils. Whilst, as previously discussed, a prudent underwriter might consider that there was an increase in his probable maximum loss on his existing exposure, it does not in my view follow that his “monetary exposure” as defined by the GUA was increased.  </p>

Edge submitted that this showed that “monetary exposure” was always intended to denote the limits of liability; a proposition which derived some support from the evidence of the underwriters’ expert underwriting witness, Mrs. Webb. I do not consider that this is a permissible approach to construction of the GUA. At best, it provides a degree of comfort that the conclusion that I have reached in the previous paragraph is not surprising. </p>

The shared understanding may therefore be tacit. It may therefore include understandings that are so obvious as to go without saying, or that were reached without being spelled out in so many words. The Court of Appeal emphasised, however, that the court is concerned with what the parties actually communicated to each other, and not with identifying their presumed intention by means of an “officious bystander” test: see [87].

(iv) That reliance must have occurred in connection with some subsequent mutual dealing between the parties. (v) Some detriment must thereby have been suffered by the person alleging the estoppel, or benefit thereby have been conferred upon the person alleged to be estopped, sufficient to make it unjust or unconscionable for the latter to assert the true legal (or factual) position." </p>

Mr. Mullen told him that he had been to the Netherlands to meet the Bank’s in-house legal team and risk managers, and the in-house lawyers wanted some changes to the policy wording. Mr. Mullen said that the document was a note or “wish list” of the changes that the in-house lawyers wanted to make. Mr. Beattie understood that it had been drafted by lawyers, but he was not given any explanation of why they were interested in making changes to the policy.

Mr. Mullen did not suggest that the wording was intended to include cover for purely financial risks not consequent on physical loss or damage. Mr. Beattie told Mr. Mullen to go back to the Bank and clarify what they were hoping to achieve with the suggested changes. He scratched it for receipt and placed it on the RSA file.

He thought that he had asked: “what do you expect me to do with this”, which implied that he was surprised by the level of changes requested. When he asked Mr. Mullen if he understood what was being asked of him, he did not receive a reply that suggested that Mr. Mullen understood any better than Mr. Beattie did. Mr. Mullen said, basically, that he was unsure. As far as the TPC itself was concerned, he said that he gave his interpretation, and then asked Mr. Mullen if he understood it in the same way, “to which I got no confirmation or denial”. At that point, he told Mr. Mullen to go back to the Bank “and find out from them exactly the intention of the proposed change”.

It was clear to Mr. Beattie that there was not intended to be any extension of cover.

The value of cross-examination is to expose such frailties as may exist. This was graphically illustrated when Mr. Mullen was cross-examined on a passage in his witness statement which addressed the 18/19 June 2015 meeting in Amsterdam, which formed the backdrop to the broking of the July document. It was at that meeting when the Bank’s draft of their desired endorsement was given to Mr. Mullen.

It was, he said, a short routine meeting: he couldn’t recall how long it was, but meetings with Mr. Beattie would usually last around 15 minutes. He agreed that Mr. Beattie would probably spend 10 minutes reading the document. He told Mr. Beattie that it had been drafted by the Bank’s in-house lawyers. He said that sometimes Mr. Beattie asked a lot of questions, and sometimes he would ask none. On this occasion, he saw nothing untoward in the document. He did not recall Mr. Beattie asking any questions. If he had done so, Mr. Mullen would have answered them. Mr. Mullen was not “totally surprised” by the fact that Mr. Beattie did not ask questions, “because of his seniority and knowledge of the business”. In response to one question, Mr. Mullen accepted that he had described the document as a wish list or note of changes that the lawyers wished to make; but later on said that he honestly couldn’t remember whether he had used that term and doubted whether he had done so. He did not wish to dispute what Mr. Beattie said on that score, because “Brian is a good friend of mine”. He disputed that he would have described the document as a “note for discussion”.  </p>

Mr. Mullen did not then suggest that the TPC wording was intended to extend cover for trade credit or any financial risks not consequent on physical loss or damage. The upshot of the meeting was that Mr. Beattie did not agree to the wish list. Instead, he told Mr. Mullen to go back to the Bank and clarify what they were hoping to achieve with the suggested changes.

Both Mr. Beattie and Mr. Mullen understood that each had the subjective intention that the TPC was a “basis of valuation” extension, and did not extend to trade credit or financial guarantee. That understanding was either a binding verbal agreement between them, giving rise to a collateral contract, or the basis of a claim for rectification. Alternatively, if Mr. Mullen did subjectively intend to place cover for trade credit/ financial guarantee risks via the TPC, he nevertheless knew that underwriters were providing cover under the policy on, and only on, the assumption that the policy did not cover such risks. Accordingly, by presenting the written policy without correcting the assumption that he understood was being made by Mr. Beattie, Mr. Mullen acquiesced in it. In those circumstances, the Bank is estopped by convention from relying on the TPC as against RSA as anything other than a basis of valuation clause. </p>

There was an outward expression of accord on this point, operative at the time of the 2016 renewal, such that they each understood each other to share this common intention. The underwriters invited the court to accept the evidence of Mr. Beattie as to the conversations.  </p>

But they also maintained that rectification did not depend upon the court accepting the evidence of Mr. Beattie as to these conversations. They submitted that even if there was no discussion about the clause at all, there would nevertheless have been a tacit understanding between Mr. Mullen and Mr. Beattie of the other’s intention. This was for a number of reasons. It was well understood between them, without words being required, that only cargo risks, not trade credit was being covered. In addition, the contractual background was a number of revisions to the BCC cover which they described as relating to the basis of valuation; so that, even in the absence of discussion, the TPC would have been understood in that vein. It was commercially absurd for either to have any different intention. These various factors would outweigh even clear words to the contrary in the TPC (although underwriters disputed that there were any such clear words). </p>

They knew that the cargo market, in which they were placing the risk, would not knowingly provide credit or financial guarantee cover. They therefore knew that underwriters were signing on the basis of an assumption that the policy did not cover trade credit/ financial guarantee, and also that it was being assumed by Mr. Beattie to be the latest clarification of the basis of valuation clause. Mr. Mullen and Mr. Lockyer therefore conducted themselves by choosing to rely solely on a written presentation of a risk that they knew, if explained, the underwriters would not provide. In such circumstances, their silence amounted to acquiescence in the assumption being made and it would again be unjust for the Bank to be permitted to depart from the assumption. </p>

In those circumstances, the following market was agreeing to what RSA had agreed to do, inclusive of any collateral agreements, accords or estoppels which touched the meaning or proper interpretation of what had been agreed. In addition, the estoppel is (as explained above) not dependent upon there having been any statements made by Mr. Beattie. Alternatively, the implied representation amounted to a promise by the Bank that it would not enforce any rights against the following market which were different to those against RSA; the following market relied upon that promise; and the Bank is estopped by reason of that promise from asserting otherwise. </p>

Mr. Mullen, even on Mr. Beattie’s own account, never provided the confirmation which Mr. Beattie had sought. Mr. Beattie signed the contract anyway. This was a classic situation of risk taking: Mr. Beattie knew that a doubt existed about the effect of the TPC, and this had not been resolved when he bound RSA to the risk. In July 2015, on Mr. Beattie’s evidence, there was no consensus as to the meaning or effect of the TPC. In January 2016, the position remained (on Mr. Beattie’s evidence) a “fudge”. In any event, there was no legal route by which other underwriters could rely on an agreement made only by RSA. There was, therefore, never any shared assumption. </p>

This evidence was treated with some scepticism at the time by counsel for the insurers. However, an overnight search for documents in the light of that evidence led to the disclosure of an electronic folder of documents. This demonstrated that Mr. Mullen’s recollection was correct. He had indeed tried to use the template for endorsements which was on the Edge system. I accept his evidence that he was unable to do so, essentially because of the amount of text that he was seeking to include within the endorsement. This was the reason why, ultimately, the document which Mr. Mullen prepared, and which he presented to Mr. Beattie on 28 July 2015, was an ordinary Microsoft Word document. The fact that the document was not on the MRCE form (ie the standard form for policy endorsements) does not show that Mr. Mullen was not looking to obtain agreement on varied contractual terms.

The underwriters contend that Mr. Mullen was, at this stage, acting dishonestly in the way that he reported back to the Bank, since he knew that (if Mr. Beattie’s evidence were accepted) Mr. Beattie had been unwilling to agree the endorsement and had sent Mr. Mullen away to ask for clarification and further information. I reject this argument. It would have been the most serious dereliction of Mr. Mullen’s obligations to his client, and to his employer, to report that agreement had been reached on the terms of the signed document, and then to send out Edge’s cover note, knowing that the underwriter had refused to agree terms. Even though some time had passed since he had first been requested by the Bank to obtain agreement on the amendments, and Mr. Mullen appears to have acted rather slowly, I do not consider that this would provide a reason or motive for Mr. Mullen dishonestly to mislead his clients into believing that they had cover on the amended terms when he knew that they did not. The documentary record does not contain any assurance from Mr. Mullen that he would be able to obtain the underwriters’ agreement. Indeed, his email of 25 June was (as Mr. Mullen said in evidence) intended to lower expectations, by indicating that agreement by the lead underwriter was not a foregone conclusion: the amendments would need to be discussed point by point. It was also apparent, from the list of questions in the 9 July e-mail to the Bank, that there were a number of potential issues on the amendment which arose: some points were “Accepted” or “Fine no difficulty”, but others required explanation. Mr. Mullen had not, therefore, boxed himself into a corner from which his only escape was to tell his client that the underwriters had agreed to the proposed wording when they had not done so. If Mr. Beattie had declined to agree to the terms of the endorsement, or had raised questions to which he required a response, Mr. Mullen would in my view have reported back to the Bank and obtained answers to the questions that were asked. </p>

The underwriters and the Bank identified a number of instances, where it was said that Mr. Mullen had acted dishonestly, and that this should be taken into account in assessing his credibility and reliability. Both the underwriters and the Bank relied upon a sequence of e-mail exchanges with Mr. Shillabeer of Channel (D9) in July 2017. Mr. Shillabeer asked Mr. Mullen to advise when the TPC was introduced into the policy, as he could see it on the 2016 policy but not on the 2015. In a later e-mail, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I did not consider that this sequence of e-mails contained any dishonest statements. Mr. Mullen did not have his files, and was speaking from memory. In the context of the e-mail exchange as a whole, he was not in my view suggesting to Mr. Shillabeer (as underwriters argued) that the July 2015 endorsement was itself a combination of earlier endorsements. He was in my view indicating, correctly, that the amendments to the 2016 policy (about which Mr. Shillabeer had asked in his first e-mail in the sequence) were a combination of various previously agreed endorsements. It is also important to note that no allegation of fraud was made by underwriters in relation to the placement of the July 2015 document or the 2016 policy, or indeed as to any aspects of the placement of the cover in prior years. Mr. Mullen’s cross-examination involved scrutiny of his dealings with underwriters over many years and many emails, and the e-mail sequence with Mr. Shillabeer was the only instance where it was alleged that he had acted dishonestly towards them. Although Mr. Beattie in his evidence sought to cast doubt on Mr. Mullen’s integrity generally, I was not impressed with that criticism, bearing in mind that Mr. Beattie had dealt with Mr. Mullen very extensively over many years. Other underwriters indicated that they had never had a problem with Mr. Mullen. In these circumstances, the evidence does not support a suggestion that Mr. Mullen acted with a lack of integrity towards underwriters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The Bank (and underwriters) were, however, able to point to various e-mails sent by Mr. Mullen in July 2015 where he did misreport to the Bank the work that was ongoing or which had taken place in order to obtain agreement to the terms of the endorsement. Mr. Mullen was there giving the impression that he was working on obtaining underwriters’ agreement for some time, and that the process was not straightforward. The reality was that Mr. Mullen did not get down to doing the work for some time, and that when he did eventually go to Mr. Beattie there was (on the case of both Edge and RSA) only a short meeting at which Mr. Beattie signed the July 2015 document. Mr. Mullen was seeking through these e-mails to provide false excuses for his delay. Obviously, this conduct is open to criticism. But it does not lead me to the conclusion that Mr. Mullen is a witness whose word generally cannot be trusted. When I consider the documentary evidence of Mr. Mullen’s dealings as whole, there was nothing to suggest that he generally acted with a lack of integrity. In his oral evidence, he sought fairly to answer all the questions that he was asked. Unsurprisingly, he had difficulty in recollecting events many years ago, and there is no doubt that some of his answers were confused. All of this in my view leads back to the need to assess Mr. Mullen’s evidence in the light of the objective evidence and the inherent probabilities. </p>

Mr. Beattie’s evidence is that he was unhappy with the terms of the July document, and asked Mr. Mullen for clarification and information. This was, on his case, the reason that he only signed the document as a record of his receipt. However, Mr. Beattie’s evidence (as summarised above) indicated that he was no further forward in January, in terms of understanding the TPC, than he had been in July 2015. Yet there is no dispute that he signed the quotation slip on 20 January 2016 to indicate his agreement in principle to the terms proposed (ie not simply for </p>

There was no notation on the slip to indicate that there was any outstanding query in relation to the TPC, nor anything to that effect in the notes which were recorded by Mr. Beattie on the RSA file in relation to the renewal. When Mr. Beattie signed the quotation slip, he did so knowing that the quotation slip would then be taken round the market and shown to other underwriters on the basis that the slip had Mr. Beattie’s support as leader. Mr. Beattie was, therefore, willing to agree those terms on 20 January, and he signed again on 25 and then 27 January. If, as Mr. Beattie’s evidence suggests, he was unhappy with the proposed terms in July 2015, he would have been equally unhappy on 20, 25 and 27 January. My conclusion is that he was happy with the proposed terms on all occasions.  </p>

The evidence shows that Mr. Mullen valued the Bank as a client, and I regard it as most improbable that Mr. Mullen would decide to tell the Bank that it had coverage on the amended terms – and then to send Edge’s formal cover note – when he knew that Mr. Beattie had declined to agree the terms. This would be the height of folly and dishonesty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Fourth, I agree that there was no need for Mr. Beattie to sign, stamp and date each page of the document in order to acknowledge receipt. Had this been the intention, it would and should have been clearly stated. The Commercial Court is familiar, particularly in the marine context, with documents which a person (such as a ship’s master) signs for receipt only. The evidence of Mrs. Webb, the insurers’ underwriting expert, was that if she was presented with a document which was simply a discussion document, she would sign it “for receipt only” or in pencil. It seemed to me that this would be the obvious thing to do if, as Mr. Beattie contended, he wished to go no further than acknowledging receipt of a document which was to be discussed subsequently. I did not consider that his explanation for signature was persuasive or convincing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Fifth, I agree that it is surprising that Mr. Beattie should put the document on RSA’s underwriting file. If there had been no more than a preliminary discussion on 28 July 2015, the expectation would be that there would be a further discussion as and when Mr. Mullen received answers to the questions asked. Mr. Beattie would not need to put the document on the file for that purpose. Mr. Beattie saw Mr. Mullen very regularly, sometimes 4 or 5 times a week, and it would be expected that – if discussions were to resume – Mr. Mullen would bring a copy of the proposed wording with him. I was not convinced by the suggestion (Mr. Beattie said “I may be making an assumption here”)  that Mr. Beattie retained the document in case there was a telephone discussion, particularly since Mr. Mullen was seeing Mr. Beattie so regularly. The far more probable explanation is that the document was placed on the file because Mr. Beattie considered that it contained amended terms. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Finally, Ms. Healy relied upon Mr. Mullen’s firm denial that he had been sent away without agreement. In my view, for the reasons explained above, that denial is consistent with the documents and the inherent probabilities.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In reaching that conclusion, I do not consider that Mr. Beattie has deliberately sought to give untruthful evidence about the meeting. As frequently happens, he is a witness who has by now persuaded himself that something happened which did not; ie that the terms presented to him on 28 July 2015 were unacceptable and that he required further clarification and explanation before he could commit the RSA to what was proposed. There is in my view an obvious reason as to how this has happened, bearing in mind the observations of Leggatt J in <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin </span>as to the nature of recollection. It is now very clear to Mr. Beattie, as a result of the issues ventilated in this litigation, that the July document could not easily be read and fully understood in the course of a short meeting between broker and underwriter. The TPC clause itself is detailed, and a number of witnesses commented – quite reasonably – that they needed to read it on a number of occasions in order fully to understand it. Furthermore, the TPC was only one of the clauses which were being added or amended. Amendments were being made to existing clauses. Sometimes these amendments were shown in the July document with the benefit of track changes, but in other cases the full amended clause was reproduced without the changes being tracked. The evidence indicated that, usually, Mr. Beattie is a careful and meticulous underwriter. It is also common ground that he did read through the TPC on 28 July, and I have no doubt that he did. I consider that he failed to appreciate the complexity of the document which he was asked to sign, but that he now recognises both the complexity and the potentially farreaching nature of the terms proposed. Recognising, now, that this was a document which a prudent underwriter should not have signed without a more careful and thorough review, and questioning of the broker, he has persuaded himself that he acted as a prudent underwriter on that occasion and sent Mr. Mullen away in order to provide the explanations for which Mr. Beattie should have asked, but did not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">It follows from this analysis that I do not consider that Mr. Beattie is a reliable witness in relation to a critical aspect of his evidence as to what transpired at the July 2015 meeting; ie whether his signature of the endorsement reflected his agreement to its terms. This does not, however, entirely dispose of the underwriters’ case for rectification or estoppel or collateral contract. It would, at least in theory, be possible for me to reject that important aspect of his evidence, but nevertheless conclude that there was a discussion with Mr. Mullen during which Mr. Beattie expressed the view that the TPC was a “basis of valuation” clause applicable only in the event of physical loss or damage. If said, this might (depending upon the reaction of Mr. Mullen to the suggestion) provide the starting point for these arguments. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">First, it seems to me to be inherently improbable that, as Mr. Beattie’s evidence suggests, there would have been an inconclusive and unsatisfactory discussion about the TPC at the July 2015 meeting, but that Mr. Beattie would nevertheless have signed it on 28 July without any qualification or written suggestion indicating that further clarification was required. That conclusion is reinforced when one takes into account Mr. Beattie’s evidence that a similar, inconclusive, discussion about the clause took place on three separate occasions: 28 July 2015, 20 January 2016 and 29 January 2016, with Mr. Mullen on each occasion being unable to confirm Mr. Beattie’s understanding of the clause. Yet on each occasion Mr. Beattie nevertheless signed important contractual documents. </p>

Mr. Beattie did make, in January 2016, notes on the RSA underwriting file. These were probably made on or shortly after 25 January, when Mr. Beattie entered his line, and possibly before the 29 January meeting. Had the discussion taken place in accordance with Mr. Beattie’s evidence, one might have expected Mr. Beattie to record that discussion, or at least to put a question-mark against the TPC  – particularly bearing in mind that there had, on Mr. Beattie’s evidence, been at least two discussions with Mr. Mullen about this clause, with Mr. Mullen being unable to explain it. </p>

The policy already contained a clause which was headed “Basis of Valuation”, and it would seem strange that it was necessary to include another one.

It is in my view hard to see why a Basis of Valuation clause for physical loss and damage would require its own section, or to see how Mr. Beattie would still have felt comfortable in those circumstances that the TPC went no further than he was telling Mr. Mullen in undocumented verbal discussions. </p>

Mr. Lockyer accepted in his evidence that he could not remember the discussion that took place on 20 January. But he made the point in his witness statement that it would have made no sense, if there had been a discussion on 20 January as suggested by Mr. Beattie, for Mr. Lockyer to ask whether it was underwriters’ understanding that the TPC provided cover regardless of whether there had been any physical loss or damage to the goods.

The sequence of events (described in Section B above) shows that RSA, via their senior claims adjuster Mr. Jones (who later signed the notice of declinature), was aware in October 2016 that the potential claim arose from Euromar’s defaulting on their obligations, and that no physical loss or damage was involved. Mr. North’s e-mail to Mr. Jones on 14 December 2016 made it clear that the claim was for financial loss as a result of Euromar’s default, and that Mr. Jones had agreed to review coverage in respect of that loss. At 11.37 on 15 December, responding to Mr. North’s email, Mr. Jones said that coverage would appear to attach in respect of “this situation”.  </p>

His e-mail sent on 15 December 2016 to Mr. Mullen asked for a chat about ABN Amro, because “it appears that we may have a problem over a recent loss which is effectively a Financial Guarantee not linked to any loss or damage recoverable under ICC “A””. This email was sent at 08.35, and he sent a further e-mail at 08.50 in which he said: “If this is a financial guarantee, it is a no-no within RSA and I will be instructed to change the wording or manage an exit”. There was, here, no reference to the discussions which are alleged to have taken place on three occasions and in which, as the insurers now contend, Mr. Beattie and Mr. Mullen were essentially ad idem that the TPC was a basis of valuation clause applicable only to physical loss or damage.  </p>

After receiving Mr. Beattie’s emails on 15 December, Mr. Mullen then e-mailed Mr. Beattie saying that the incident came under the transaction premium section of the policy, and explaining the steps that the Bank was taking to deal with the Euromar problem.

Nor do I accept (if this is what Mr. Beattie was saying) that Mr. Beattie told Mr. Mullen at this stage that he did not consider that there was any coverage.

I consider that if there were any substance to the claim that there were relevant oral discussions, the point would have surfaced long before then. In my view, these discussions are another aspect of Mr. Beattie’s retrospective rationalisation of his decision-making. He has searched for an explanation as to how he came to write a policy with the TPC (because there is no case that the 2016 policy was not contractually binding), and has persuaded himself that he did so on the basis of the oral discussions which he now asserts. His suggestion that the discussions concerned the basis of valuation is in my view derived from the arguments that have developed as to how the policy is to be interpreted. The culmination of this retrospective rationalisation was an answer which Mr. Beattie gave in response to questions from Ms. Sabben-Clare, when asked what Mr. Mullen had said in response on 29 January 2016: </p>

The evidential foundation for the case of rectification, collateral contract and estoppel therefore does not exist. I consider that the proper conclusion is, quite simply, that Mr. Beattie on behalf of RSA and Mr. Mullen on behalf of the Bank intended to contract on the terms set out in the various documents which Mr. Beattie signed. I cannot conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that there was any side-discussion which is capable of supplementing or negating or qualifying those terms. For the purposes of the rectification case, there is nothing to rebut the presumption that the signed documents represented the parties’ agreement, and there is certainly nothing which amounts to convincing proof to the contrary.

However, there is contemporaneous documentary evidence that Mr. Lockyer did understand it correctly and in particular that it was not confined to the situation where there was physical loss and damage: see Mr. Lockyer’s 8 July 2015 aide-memoire and, later, his e-mail to Mr. Mullen on 28 January 2016 after Ms. Van de Beek had raised her question.

His response (“No you are correct”) was to give Mr. Lockyer assurance on, as I read the e-mail, both points. He was thereby indicating that Mr. Lockyer was reading the clause correctly, and also that it was the understanding of underwriters. As further discussed in Section J below, I am not satisfied that Mr. Mullen had any firm foundation for the statement that it was the understanding of underwriters, since he had never specifically discussed the clause with any of them. But the e-mail does show that, contemporaneously, Mr. Mullen had the same understanding of the clause as Mr. Lockyer: ie that the “insured is covered by this policy for the transaction premium they would have earned if client of the insured defaults, regardless whether there has been any physical loss or damage[d] to goods”. </p>

In any event, looking at the evidence as a whole, the contemporaneous documents and the inherent probabilities do not support the proposition that such a discussion took place at any stage. </p>

This related to representations made to three underwriters (Navigators, Ark and Advent), on renewal in 2016, that the terms of the cover were “as before” or “as expiry”. In relation to a fourth underwriter (Standard) reliance was placed upon a representation that the policy provided cover for loss and damage to products where finance was provided. These representations were primarily relied upon as misrepresentations which entitled those underwriters to avoid the 2016 policy. However, Mr. Parsons in his oral closing advanced an argument that these representations could found an estoppel which prevented the Bank from relying upon the TPC and also the Non Avoidance Clause. Since this argument overlaps with the arguments concerning misrepresentation in relation to these four defendants, I will address it in Section F below.  </p>

They said that over the history of the Bank’s insurance, RSA had acted pursuant to that power to agree numerous changes to the cover by way of endorsement, including changes which amended the scope of cover; eg by clarifying the cover afforded under the Business Contingency Clause, by adding 5 new warehouses as approved storage locations, or covering the transit of materials between warehouses. There was only one occasion on which RSA required the agreement of all underwriters to be obtained. This was when increasing the limit for metals from US$250 million to US$300 million. Responsibility for applying the GUA stamp to an endorsement rested with RSA as lead underwriter rather than with Edge as broker. In these circumstances, it was incumbent upon Mr Beattie to make it clear if he was purporting to agree a contract change on behalf of RSA alone, rather than on behalf of all underwriters. As he did not do so, he purported to exercise authority to bind the following market.  </p>

In my view, there was nothing in the events which took place at the short meeting in Mr. Beattie’s office on 28 July 2015 which evidenced any intention on Mr. Beattie’s part to exercise authority on behalf of the following market. Where an endorsement contains the GUA box, and where that box is then initialled by the underwriter, it will be apparent that the underwriter is intending to implement the GUA terms and hence the authority which has been conferred upon him. The way in which the underwriter is exercising that authority will be clear from the way that he fills in the GUA box. Clause 4.2 of the GUA makes this clear. It provides that the “Slip Leader (and Agreement Parties if appropriate) shall then initial in the appropriate Box the level of authorisation required”. Clause 4.2.3 provides that if the Slip Leader initials Box 1 and initials and dates the endorsement in the customary place, no further agreement shall be required. </p>

Mr. Beattie did no more than sign and apply RSA’s stamp, which was what he was being asked to do. There is nothing to which Edge (who carried the argument on the GUA issues) could point which indicated, whether objectively or subjectively, an intention on Mr. Beattie’s part to sign the July endorsement on behalf of the following market. </p>

The significant point is that this was not done, and that there was therefore nothing which indicated an intention on the part of Mr. Beattie to contract on behalf of the following market. That intention cannot in my view be found by relying on the obligation on the Slip Leader in Clause 4.1 of the GUA in circumstances where there had been no discussion between broker and underwriter as to whether RSA was acting only on its own behalf or on behalf of the following market. </p>

The proceedings were issued in November 2018, and the underwriters’ original defence was served on 22 February 2019. No point on avoidance was then taken, although there had been a generally worded reservation of the right to take such a point in the pre-action correspondence. The avoidance case was first intimated in April 2020 with the amendments taking effect in May 2020. The Bank and Edge did not oppose the amendment, preferring to avoid a contested permission application, but making it clear (at least in Edge’s case) that the case was bad in law and on the facts.

The insurers had also, at that stage, not tendered back the premium.

The non-disclosure case therefore naturally gave rise to arguments concerning the extent to which underwriters, who are subscribing to major commercial risks, could be expected to read the wordings to which they agreed. Edge’s core argument was that it was the underwriter’s responsibility to read and understand the slip he is presented for agreement. If there was something that he does not understand, he may either refuse to agree it or ask the broker questions, which the broker must answer honestly. There was, therefore, no disclosure obligation in relation to the Bank’s subjective purpose or intention behind seeking any contractual provision, including the TPC. If the underwriters were interested in knowing the Bank’s view as to what the TPC meant, or the reason for requesting the clause, then the underwriters had the clause in front of them and could and should have asked.  </p>

Thus, the Bank had sought to introduce cover for credit risks by means of the TPC, but without disclosing that fact to underwriters, and without giving any disclosure in relation to the credit risk that was being introduced. At the same time, the Bank/Edge sought to add the NAC, which was an unusually restrictive clause, to eliminate any non-disclosure or misrepresentation type defence, absent proof of fraud. The Bank could not rely on the NAC as an obstacle to avoidance, because it is itself “vulnerable to being avoided”. It is the sort of unusual clause that must be identified in the broke. It was not expressly mentioned to Mr. Beattie or any of the following underwriters. Some of those underwriters were told that the renewal was on expiring terms, and this was a misrepresentation. Mr. Parsons explained that the way round the NAC was that the NAC was itself not disclosed, and was part of the package with the TPC. The TPC and NAC came in together, and neither of them were brought to the underwriters’ attention. Since there was a nondisclosure in relation to the NAC, that clause “falls away and this allows me to have the non-disclosure in relation to the TPC”. </p>

Unlike the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Springwell</span>, the court is here dealing with an insurance contract where the duty of utmost good faith applies. The ordinary rule that a party who signs a contract is taken to have read it, understood it and agreed to it cannot apply where, as was the case here, there was a duty to disclose the NAC. If the non-disclosure or misrepresentation relates to the clause itself, a party cannot rely on his own breach of duty. Such nondisclosure would have two consequences; it would prevent reliance on the nondisclosure clause itself, and would itself render the contract as a whole void. Mr. Parsons accepted in closing that both consequences would follow, because it was difficult to see how the NAC could be treated as severable from the contract as a whole. Mr. Parsons said that <span style="font-style:italic">Toomey v Eagle Star </span>was distinguishable, because there was no allegation in that case of non-disclosure or misrepresentation directed at the clause itself.  </p>

The underwriters’ argument posits, in effect, that there is a residual category of innocent non-disclosures or misrepresentations which can be relied upon in order to avoid the contract as a whole; ie an innocent nondisclosure affecting the NAC itself, or (in the argument originally advanced) an innocent non-disclosure affecting the NAC when taken together with the innocent non-disclosure or misrepresentation concerning the TPC. I do not accept this approach. The NAC is comprehensive. Its effect is that any non-disclosure or misrepresentation relied upon in support of avoidance must be alleged and shown to be fraudulent. That includes an allegation of non-disclosure relating to the NAC itself, whether taken on its own or in combination with the TPC. </p>

They argued that if there were grounds for avoidance, the clause must go with the avoidance. If a party sought to rely upon the clause, he relies in effect on his own misrepresentation for the purposes of avoiding the impact of that misrepresentation. The insured was therefore pulling itself up by its own bootstraps; because it should not be open to a party to rely upon the clause since the very contract which includes it has gone or is avoidable by virtue of the misrepresentation. Colman J rejected this argument on the basis that it was inconsistent with prior authority. This included a (then) recent decision of the Court of Appeal (<span style="font-style:italic">Pan Atlantic Insurance Ltd. v Pine Top Insurance Co </span>[1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 496) in which Steyn LJ had said that it was conceptually possible to  </p>

One oddity of the insurers’ argument is that the contract could be avoided in its entirety for an innocent non-disclosure or misrepresentation concerning only the NAC, even if the presentation of the risk was fair in all other respects.  </p>

So far as relevant for present purposes (where no estoppel is relied upon by the Bank), the basic principle is that an underwriter is precluded from avoiding the policy if in the meantime he has done something to affirm it. Before there can be an affirmation, the underwriter must have full knowledge of the facts entitling him to avoid the policy. He then has a reasonable time in which to decide what course of action to take, and he cannot be said to have affirmed the policy until after such time. A party will be held to have made an election (for example to determine a contract or alternatively to affirm it) where, with knowledge of the relevant facts, he has acted in a manner which is consistent only with his having chosen one of the two alternative and inconsistent courses then open to him. His election must be communicated either by words or conduct; it will only have effect as a binding election (which is then irrevocable) if it is communicated in clear and unequivocal terms. It is generally a prerequisite to election that the party concerned is aware of the facts which have given rise to his new right. If with knowledge of those facts, he acts in a manner consistent only with treating the contract as still alive, he is taken in law to have exercised his election to affirm the contract. </p>

In his summary of the general principles at p 161, he stated that the party should know sufficient of the facts to know that he has the right to avoid, but it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of the facts. The insurers drew attention to passages at page 163 where the judge considered the nature of the knowledge of material facts relevant to affirmation and the communication of an election to the other party. Mance J said that knowledge was essentially a “jury question”. It was not to be equated with absolute certainty. But for practical purposes it did pre-suppose the truth of the matters known, and a firm belief in their truth, as well as sufficient justification for that belief in terms of experience, information and/or reasoning. As far as the communication is concerned: this must demonstrate objectively or unequivocally that the party affirming is making an informed choice. The communication itself or the surrounding circumstances must therefore demonstrate such knowledge to the other party. </p>

If, on the evidence before the court it is established that either the legal advisers or the client had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right said to have been waived at the time when the affirmatory conduct took place, there must be the further inference that the party has been given legal advice as to his rights arising out of those facts.

It is also potentially extremely difficult for the other party to prove such knowledge – all the more so since any relevant legal advice which may have been received will be protected from disclosure by legal professional privilege.

It is implicit in the basis of avoidance that an insurer who has not avoided a policy despite knowledge of non-disclosure may subsequently do so if he learns of material additional nondisclosure by the insured. The requirement of affirmation that the insurer has knowledge of the facts not disclosed is to the same effect. An insurer may be reluctant to avoid for nondisclosure, for reasons connected with its appreciation of its liability or the effect of non-disclosure on its reputation or some other reason, and decide not to avoid a policy initially, but reasonably wish to do so when additional non-disclosure comes to light. But not every new fact not disclosed will entitle an insurer to avoid after affirmation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The underwriters argued that, on a proper analysis, there was no affirmation. There had been a full reservation of rights in their letter of declinature in August 2017, and this reservation had been maintained in the ensuing pre-action correspondence including in their response, in June 2018, to the Bank’s letter of claim. That reservation had never been withdrawn. At the time that the defence was served, the underwriters only had limited documentation available to them: they did not have the parties’ initial disclosure, extended disclosure or witness evidence. Against that background, the acts of underwriters relied upon in support of affirmation – by which the underwriters denied the Bank’s interpretation of the policy and denied the claim – were not clear and unequivocal affirmatory acts. The necessary act was an unequivocal statement or representation that the insurers were treating the contract as binding on them, made with knowledge of the right to avoid, and with knowledge of the underlying facts giving rise to the right to avoid. The underwriters had never wavered in their denial of the claim, and their position that the policy did not cover credit risks.

The preliminary notification was of a potential claim “due to Euromar defaulting on its obligations to purchase various cocoa products”. Mr. Jones of RSA then asked the question whether there was any known shortage or physical damage to the cocoa in which the Bank had an interest. The answer was: “not to the knowledge of Icestar”. This response was also available on the Xchanging system. Mr. Jones’ entry on 2 November 2016 said that the Bank’s “responses to comments” were noted.  </p>

Mr. North said, in his e-mail of 14 December 2016, that it was “very clear” that the “financial loss as a result of Euromar’s default” fell under Clause 1.5 of Section 2 of the policy: ie the TPC in the earlier policy.  On the following day, 15 December, Mr. Beattie had emailed Mr. Mullen indicating that RSA may have a problem over “a recent loss which is effectively a Financial Guarantee not linked to any loss or damage recoverable under ICC ‘A’”. In an e-mail later that day, Mr. Mullen said that the incident “comes under the transaction premium section of the policy. This section covers the insured in the event of a default on the part of a[n] insured’s client”.  At 11.37, Mr. Jones confirmed by email that Section 2, Clause 1.5 of the policy “would appear to attach in respect of this situation”, and a notification to similar effect was posted on Xchanging. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">At this stage, therefore, it was clear that the Bank and Edge were maintaining that there was coverage under the TPC for the consequences of financial default of Euromar, and RSA agreed that this appeared to be correct. The correspondence at this time did not directly address the question of whether this coverage was what had been subjectively intended by the Bank when it had proposed the TPC, or what the Bank’s purpose had been when seeking agreement to the TPC. It would, however, be a very obvious conclusion that where the Bank’s policy contained a bespoke and carefully drafted clause which, on a natural reading, covered financial default, that the Bank’s intention and purpose would have been to have coverage for that which the clause provided. It is, however, theoretically possible, that the width of the wording and the extent of the coverage were accidental, in the sense that they went further than the Bank intended. This seems somewhat unrealistic in the present context, given the nature of the clause and the repeated reference to “Default”. However, there had not at this stage been any statement on behalf of the Bank as to what its subjective intention or purpose had been. The question had not been asked, no doubt because the underwriters rightly considered that what mattered was what the words used in the policy meant, rather than what the Bank thought they meant. On that important question, both Mr. North and Mr. Jones were at that stage ad idem: it provided the coverage for which the Bank contended. </p>

It became apparent, following Transmar’s default, that the likely claim was very substantial. Investigators, Gray Page, were appointed on behalf of underwriters. Mr. North was advised by Mr. Jones that the purpose of the instruction to Gray Page was “to investigate and liaise with the Insured to provide a comprehensive report on the circumstances of this matter”.  By June 2017, Kennedys Law LLP (a very well-known City law firm with considerable insurance expertise) had been instructed by underwriters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In that letter, RSA rejected the contention that Clause 1.5 of the General Conditions gave coverage for the loss which the Bank had suffered. There was no right to an indemnity in the absence of PLOD to the property insured. The basic argument advanced was that the terms of Clause 1.5 “were intended to extend the <span style="font-style:italic">scope of the indemnity</span> to which the insured would be entitled, upon the occurrence of an insured loss, but were not intended to extend the <span style="font-style:italic">scope of cover</span>”. This is, in essence, the construction argument which I have addressed in Section D above. At this stage, these references, as to what was intended by the policy terms, were confined to the objective intention of the parties derived from their language. No reliance was placed upon the discussions between Mr. Beattie and Mr. Mullen (discussed in Section E above) subsequently relied upon in support of the rectification/ collateral contract/ estoppel case. </p>

The letter referred to Mr. Lockyer’s e-mail of 1 February to the market, following Mr. Vaughan’s signature of the GUA box indicating that the endorsement should be listed to the market.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Edge contended that, at this stage, underwriters had the necessary knowledge to avoid the policy as matters then stood. I consider that there was force in that contention in so far as the grounds for avoidance are based upon non-disclosure or misrepresentation as to the terms of the policy itself. Thus, one of the grounds for avoidance is the Bank’s alleged failure to disclose the NAC. By the time of the August 2017 declinature, underwriters had the various policies in front of them, and could see clearly that they contained a NAC. Another ground of avoidance, related to the terms of the policy, is the alleged misrepresentation to Standard that the policy only covered physical loss and damage to the subject-matter insured. By the time of the August 2017 declinature, Standard could see from the terms of the policy that, on any view, it covered matters other than physical loss and damage to the cargo. The policy contained the CEND, BCC and Fraudulent documentation cover discussed in Section D above, as well as the TPC itself which, as Standard knew, the Bank alleged to apply if there was financial default unrelated to PLOD.  </p>

At the start of this section, Edge set out the TPC, and explained that the “preceding policy had contained identical wording by virtue of the endorsement scratched on 28 July 2015 by Mr. Beattie for RSA as leader and on behalf of the following market”. Accordingly, the existence of the July 2015 endorsement was clearly identified at the start of the letter. In the concluding part of that section, Edge referred back to RSA’s reaction when the claim had been presented, in particular the discussions in December 2016 leading to RSA’s confirmation that coverage appeared to exist. Edge said, therefore, that their interpretation of the TPC, as creating a freestanding insured peril not dependent on physical loss or damage to the cargo, was “entirely consistent with your own understanding of the policy”. </p>

The background was that there had been prior correspondence in which reservations of the right to avoid had been intimated. However, when the defence was served, there was no such reservation let alone any plea of avoidance. Instead, reliance was placed upon the terms of the policy and a positive plea was advanced, by all underwriters, that if necessary the policy should be rectified. That plea therefore sought to invoke the court’s equitable jurisdiction to rectify the instrument which contained the parties’ agreement. In my view, such a plea – unaccompanied by any plea of avoidance or reservation – can only be seen as a positive statement that the contract which the parties have made is binding, albeit that the document containing that contract requires rectification so as to conform with the parties’ mutual expressed intentions. As Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted, a plea of rectification is necessarily affirmatory, since it positively avers that there is an enforceable agreement between the parties and seeks to have the documentary record of the contract rewritten. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I did not consider that there was any force in any of the points made by the underwriters as summarised above. It is true that there had been widely-expressed reservation of rights in the pre-action correspondence, albeit no reservation between 8 June 2018 and the time when the defence was served in February 2019. Even though there had been prior reservations, the significant point in my view is that these were not repeated when the underwriters set out, in considerable detail, the case that they were actually advancing in response to the claim made in litigation, including a specific plea of rectification.  The straightforward conclusion which would be drawn by a recipient of the defence is that the underwriters had decided to defend the case on the basis of the construction and rectification/ estoppel/ collateral contract arguments which featured in their defence and counterclaim. Each of those defences, and the counterclaim, is premised upon the continued existence of the contract between the parties. To adopt the words of Leggatt J in <span style="font-style:italic">Involnert </span>at [161], the insurers in their defence and counterclaim spoke or acted in a way which would reasonably be understood as consistent only with the insurer having made an informed choice to treat the contract as valid. The service of the defence in those terms was therefore an affirmatory act, and – as the brief decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Barber v Imperio Reinsurance Company UK Ltd </span>(15 July 1993, unreported) indicates – it is incumbent on a party to reserve his position if he takes a step which would otherwise constitute affirmation, and if not he does so at the risk of being held to have affirmed. </p>

They are very different defences, with different legal and evidential requirements and different consequences, leaving aside the fact that avoidance will usually require the premium to be tendered or repaid to the insured. Indeed, as Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted, even if the two defences (construction and avoidance) can be equated, in the sense that they both amount to a denial that the underwriters insured credit risks, that does not assist the underwriters. It leads to the conclusion that both points were open to the underwriters when the defence was served, but the underwriters only advanced the construction argument. It therefore reinforces the conclusion that there was an unequivocal election. </p>

In his oral submissions, Mr. Parsons said that in view of the fact that the NAC had been raised, the conclusion to be drawn from reading a defence which does not raise avoidance is that the insurers are considering themselves bound by the NAC at that stage, and not pleading fraud.  </p>

A reasonable person in the position of the Bank, when served with the defence in the context described above, would reasonably conclude that the insurers accepted that there was a binding policy, and had taken the view that arguments about non-disclosure or misrepresentation, previously reserved, were not being pursued. Even if (as Mr. Parsons suggested) the conclusion drawn from reading the defence is that the insurers considered themselves bound by the NAC at that stage, this does not detract from the simple point that the defence and counterclaim unequivocally represented that there was a binding contract. I do not think that the route by which the insurers reached that conclusion, and whether or not it was as a result of the NAC, affects the impact of the relevant communication on the recipient, particularly bearing in mind that the recipient could only speculate as to what that route had been. In any event, I do not think that a reasonable person would think it necessary to try to analyse why the insurers, who are professional underwriters advised by insurance specialists, had decided to take the position that, as the defence and counterclaim represented, there was a binding policy. What matters is that this was the position clearly communicated. </p>

Any reasonable recipient of the defence would conclude that the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> – 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants accepted that there was a binding contract, and were not advancing a case of avoidance, whether that contract was contained in one document or the other. As Ms. Healy submitted, there was no dispute that there was a contract (one contract) between the Bank and each of the underwriters: the dispute was as to its terms. All underwriters, whichever wording they scratched, pleaded a case as to the true meaning of the TPC and to that extent relied upon the policy and also pleaded rectification. The fact that some underwriters did not accept that they were bound by the later policy relied upon by the Bank, but asserted that the binding contract was contained in the earlier policy subscribed between 25 and 29 January, is in my view irrelevant to the question of affirmation. </p>

I have already indicated that it is somewhat unrealistic to suppose that, in intimating its potential claim in 2016 in reliance on the carefully drafted TPC, the Bank was seeking to take advantage of accidental drafting of the TPC; ie drafting which enabled them to contend, contrary to their intention and purpose, that the TPC covered the financial default of Euromar in the absence of PLOD. However, the response of Edge in November 2017 made it clear that, at least from their perspective, the terms of the TPC were no accident and were indeed intended to cover the default risk irrespective of whether there was PLOD to the subject-matter insured. This was reiterated in the Particulars of Claim, where the Bank’s subjective purpose and intention was clearly pleaded in the paragraphs relating to rectification, including with reference to contemporaneous documents. It was also reiterated in the defence served by Edge, and the additional claim on NRF, both of which were available to the underwriters when the defence was served. </p>

It is correct that the underwriters have, to a greater or lesser extent, put in issue the question of whether the Bank or Edge subjectively intended to cover risks of default. Ultimately, their case was that NRF went further than the Bank subjectively wanted, since the Bank was aiming at covering the “market premium” albeit (as I understood the argument) that they might have wanted cover for this element against the default risk.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In my view, however, this is beside the point. If the question of the Bank’s subjective intention and purpose was material for disclosure, then the underwriters had all the material which they needed, by November 2017 and certainly by February 2019, to plead that case on a sound factual footing. The underwriters could rely upon the admission, in Edge’s letter, as to their subjective intention. They could also rely upon the Bank’s plea of rectification, which was necessarily based upon the proposition that the Bank or its broker subjectively intended the TPC to cover the credit risk. They could also rely upon Edge’s pleadings. The fact that the underwriters wished to dispute what Edge and the Bank were saying does not in my view mean that they did not have sufficient knowledge of the relevant facts. In a case where the relevant facts concern the subjective intention of the other party to the contract, and the other party has admitted and averred that subjective intention, it is difficult in my view to see what else an underwriter needs to know in order to plead an avoidance case based on subjective intention.  </p>

Rather, and as reflected in paragraph 122 of the underwriters’ closing submissions and Mr. Parsons’ oral submissions, there seems to have been reconsideration of the question of whether an avoidance case can be successfully advanced in the absence of an allegation of fraud, notwithstanding the NAC.  </p>

In the context, the test is objective. One asks what a reasonable insurer, writing the particular type or class of business concerned, would, or should, know. A reasonable underwriter is presumed to know matters which he should have known from the facts in his possession or matters which he had means of learning from the sources available to him. A reasonable underwriter is presumed to know the ordinary incidents or attributes of any peculiar or specialist risk he undertakes: every underwriter is presumed to be acquainted with the practice of the trade he insures; if he does not know, then he ought to inform himself. Because of these aspects, and absent inquiry by the insurer, only unusual elements affecting the risk have to be disclosed by the proposer.  </p>

There is no need for an intentional act with full knowledge of the facts. If the facts and matters disclosed give a fair presentation of the risk, the underwriter must ask if he wishes to have more information; further, even if the initial presentation was unfair, waiver might arise if the information disclosed was such as to prompt a reasonably careful insurer to make further inquiries. In short, if the insurers receive information, which taken on its own, or in conjunction with other information known to them or presumed to be known to them, would naturally prompt a reasonably careful insurer to make further inquiries, then, if they omit to do so, they waive disclosure of the material facts and matters which such an inquiry would have revealed. A particular case in which insurers may be put upon inquiry is one where the character of the ship to be insured puts them on notice that specific preparations are or may be required before it puts to sea. Finally, an assured is entitled to assume that the insurers are waiving disclosure of matters concerning which they appear to be indifferent or disinterested.  </p>

Were such statements accurate, on the basis that the July 2015 endorsement was an effective contractual variation binding on all subscribers to the 2015 policy, so that there was indeed no material change in terms when the varied terms were incorporated into the 2016 wording? Or were these statements misleading, at least as far as concerns the following market, because the following market had no knowledge of the 2015 endorsement, and would therefore have understood “as expiring” and similar statements to mean that the renewal terms were materially the same as to the terms written in 2015?

Much of the focus of this evidence was whether, and the extent to which, underwriters could and should be expected to read the slips which were presented to them. The heart of the nondisclosure debate did not therefore involve a typical dispute as to materiality, where one expert says that a particular item of information would be important to a prudent underwriter and the other expert disagreed. There was really no dispute that, in a broad sense, both the TPC and the NAC, which were contained in the contracts subscribed by all underwriters, were “material” clauses. But, as Ms. Healy correctly submitted, it was difficult to see which clauses in an insurance contract are not material. Since the terms of the policy contain the basis on which the underwriters have written a risk, it follows that almost any clause would be material in the broad sense that it might influence the underwriter’s decision as to whether to write the risk or not. Indeed, a non-disclosure or misrepresentation argument can scarcely be resolved without reference to the terms on which the contract has written, since a question which arises is whether (absent the non-disclosure or misrepresentation) the contract would have been written on the terms which were in fact agreed.  </p>

There could therefore be no fair presentation of the risk absent the underwriters being told that the risk included credit risks as well as physical risks.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In his oral closing, Mr. Parsons said that his complaint was not so much that the underwriter should have been told the subjective intention of the brokers or the Bank, or the meaning of the clause. Rather, it was the purpose of the clause, or the risk that the underwriter was being asked to run, which should have been disclosed. The TPC was an unusual risk: not simply the wording but the risk itself. Underwriters would not, particularly upon renewal, be looking out for it. An underwriter could not, or could not necessarily, be expected to ask a question about it; because he may have assumed that it was a basis of valuation clause, or may not have focused on it in the context of a very large policy. It should be borne in mind that the practice in the marine market was for there to be relatively short ‘brokes’, and that the market was basically doing the same things over and over again. That was why the market, which was built upon mutual trust, relied on the brokers to draw it to their attention. The market would slow down and grind to a halt if underwriters were expected to read lengthy documents in the detail required to understand each clause. The market did not work on the basis that people would sit and read the policies that they were writing. That might happen in an ideal world, but it was not what happened in practice. Mr. Parsons made clear that the duty to disclose the purpose of a clause in the policy did not apply to every clause: it only applied to something unusual and outwith the contemplation of underwriters. </p>

That contention was wrong for very many reasons and was, as the Bank said in its opening submissions, “frankly bizarre”. There was no obligation to disclose subjective intentions or understandings. Matters of inference or opinion are not material circumstances for disclosure, and the insured is under no duty to offer the insurer advice. The subjective intentions of the Bank, Edge or indeed NRF, as to the meaning of the TPC are matters of opinion or inference. They are irrelevant to the true construction of the policy and not material to the risk being insured. Furthermore, those opinions arose from material which was available to both parties, namely the wording of the policy. Underwriters, in the ordinary course of business, ought to have been familiar with interpreting such material. An insurer is presumed to know its own business and to be able to form its own judgment on the risk as it is presented.  </p>

The meaning or effect of a clause in the policy is a paradigm matter which the underwriter is presumed to know and which, in the absence of enquiry, need not be disclosed under s. 18 (3) (b) of the 1906 Act. The meaning and effect of terms in an insurance contract are matters the insurer ought to know in the ordinary course of his business. The insurer is presumed to be able to form his own judgment of the risk as presented, and the proposer is not required to offer the insurer advice. The subjective view of the broker, the client or others, is plainly a matter of opinion. In her written closing, Ms. Healy referred to the case advanced against Edge as involving the proposition that there was a “duty to nanny” and submitted that there was no such duty. (The expression was used in the context of the Bank’s claim against Edge, but it was clear that Ms. Healy was also addressing the non-disclosure arguments in that context). In her oral submissions, she said that one of the oddities of the case was that Edge was being accused of not disclosing something that they handed to underwriters. </p>

In the case of Mr. Beattie, he saw or had his attention drawn to it (on the basis of his own evidence) on a number of occasions: initially in July 2015; then on presentation of the renewal quotation slip on 20 January; and then again when it was the subject of discussion on 28/29 January leading to its change of position within the policy documentation. Other underwriters were shown the policy which contained the TPC on two occasions prior to making their contractual commitment in January 2016: they first signed the slip without formally entering their lines, and then subsequently saw it again when they entered their lines. Some underwriters may have seen the slip only once before subscribing. All underwriters were given a copy of the slip at around the time that it was subscribed, and many of the underwriters thereafter carried out postplacement “peer review” procedures into the risk that had been written. None of these peer reviews raised any questions about the TPC, or indeed the NAC. It is a remarkable feature of the case that, despite a large number of underwriters writing this risk, and despite a large number of peer reviews, no-one involved on the defendants’ side raised any questions about the two clauses, the TPC or the NAC, which are central to the allegations of non-disclosure. </p>

The terms of the policy that the underwriter subscribes, by scratching the slip containing the policy terms there set out, are clearly either known or presumed to be known to the insurer. The question of what a particular clause means is indeed, as Edge submitted, a paradigm matter on which the underwriter can and should form his own view. The insured is not in my view required to offer his views as to the effect or meaning of the contractual terms proposed. To do so would require the insured to estimate the risk for the underwriter.

But in my view these are not material facts for disclosure. The contractual effect of the clause is a matter on which the underwriter should form his own view. The insured’s subjective view of the contractual effect of the clause is irrelevant to construction of the clause which the underwriter is asked to agree, whether communicated in the course of pre-contractual negotiations or not. The insured’s subjective purpose in wishing to have the clause included is similarly irrelevant to the contractual effect of the written clause which the underwriter is asked to agree and upon which he should form his own view. </p>

Here, underwriters were presented with what was, on the evidence, an unusual clause. It was not only unusual, but it was lengthy. It did not involve a minor tweak to standard wording, which might perhaps go unnoticed. The clause used concepts, in particular “Default” on a number of occasions, which are unfamiliar in the context of ordinary cargo insurance. It does seem to me that the language of the clause as a whole, and in particular the references to Default, was sufficient to disclose its purpose. But even if that were wrong, a reasonably careful underwriter presented with a lengthy and unfamiliar clause of this kind, would be prompted to make further enquiries if interested in the insured’s purpose or intention or understanding in relation to the clause.  </p>

She said that she was “not for one minute suggesting underwriters shouldn’t or don’t read policies”. She said that underwriters who were completely new to a risk had an obligation to go through the slip very thoroughly in order to see “where the coverage was broader than a normal cargo and storage policy”, although she said that the level of scrutiny would not be the same if the risk had been in the market for some time and the underwriter was already familiar with it. She said, however, that she would expect an underwriter already familiar with the risk, but who had not written it in the prior year, to at least go through it, looking at the main clauses and headings to see what was there.  </p>

She said that underwriters might skim the policy to have a look and make sure that they remember it from last year.

It would be impossible to do this without reading the slip. The Navigators underwriting guidelines required that at renewals, the files should have a similar level of detail as new business files and that “Information should be properly updated and re-analysed, as part of the underwriting process”. Mr Gaiger of Navigators agreed that this required him to read the whole of the renewal slip he was being asked to agree. Mr. Butterworth of Swiss Re (one of the new subscribers to the risk) accepted in his evidence the proposition that it was his job and duty to his employer, when committing Swiss Re to a risk for the very first time, to read the terms of the slip carefully and make sure that they accorded with Swiss Re’s rules, guidance and appetite. </p>

They do not necessarily need to do this under pressure of time at the box: a copy of the slip can be taken, and read later during a quiet moment. The evidence also indicates most of the insurers had teams, including those doing peer review, and it may be that the task of doing a detailed review of policy wording could be entrusted by the main underwriter to a more junior colleague. The work does not necessarily involve reading every clause in minute detail. Some clauses may be standard market clauses which are very familiar and do not require significant attention. However, non-standard clauses will obviously require more consideration. </p>

However, I do not consider that the importance of an underwriter reading the terms of the contract that he is writing diminishes as the length of the slip increases.

What was not disclosed to them was the amount of the agency commission that would now also be deducted: however this additional commission was in fact no more than they should have anticipated if they had thought about it. A reasonable underwriter sufficiently experienced to decide on behalf of a reinsurer whether to sign this slip would have appreciated that additional deductions were involved and that they would be of the order that they in fact were. He could also make up his mind whether, in the aggregate, they were going to be more than he was prepared to accept. There was evidence that deductions of this size were likely to doom the contract to loss but that was a matter for the underwriting judgment of the reinsurer: he had sufficient material upon which to make that judgment. Thus, although as I have previously indicated there are criticisms to be made of the brokers and they were certainly morally at fault, the presentation sufficed and if, notwithstanding the terms of the slip, Imperio did not fully appreciate what it meant or did not make further inquiry that was a matter for them and they cannot complain (quite apart from the affirmation point to which I have already referred)”. </p>

At this time, during the war, all cargoes of nitrate were under the control of the UK Government.  When the plaintiffs were informed from time to time that a cargo was destined for one of their warehouses, they would insure their profits. In addition to the ordinary marine and war risks which might prevent the nitrate arriving, there was the risk that the Government might change its mind and divert the goods elsewhere. The plaintiffs wished to obtain cover against all of these risks. The plaintiffs were in touch with a local Liverpool broker, who drafted a slip which would have covered precisely the risk that the plaintiffs wished to insure: ie to pay a total loss if the vessel “does not reach the destination named in policy through any cause arising (ie war, marine, diverted to other ports &amp;c.)”. Unfortunately, the slip that was prepared in London was drafted in more general terms: to pay a total loss “if vessel does not reach destination named in policy through any cause that may arise”. Bailhache J described the words omitted from the slip as “obvious and unfortunate”. There was a dispute as to what if anything had been discussed about diversion. The judge was satisfied that diversion due to a change of mind on the part of the Government, which owned the cargo, was not specifically mentioned in these discussions, and that very little on the subject was said at all. </p>

Either he must procure the insertion in his policy of apt words descriptive of the special risk he wishes to cover, or, if he is content with wide general words, he must be prepared to show that the special risk he was minded to cover was brought to the underwriter’s attention at the time when he initialled the slip or subscribed the policy in such a way that the underwriter had his mind directed to it.

Bailhache J identified two possible courses open to an insured who wished to cover an unusual risk. One of those courses was to include apt words descriptive of the risk, rather than to rely on general words. There is no suggestion that the policy would be voidable for non-disclosure even if apt words descriptive of the special risk were included. Bailhache J did contemplate an alternative course; ie using wide general words but informing the underwriter of the special risk that it was the intention to cover. Since this had not happened, Bailhache J did not analyse the legal basis upon which the wide general words would be sufficient, if the special risk had been identified. Nowadays, no doubt, that case would be put on the basis of arguments (rectification/ estoppel/ collateral contract) similar to those which RSA itself advanced based on the conversations between Mr. Beattie and Mr. Mullen. </p>

This is therefore not a case where the Bank is seeking to rely upon wide general words which, on a literal construction, would cover the risk. If there are apt words descriptive of the special risk, then the insured does not have to go further and spell out to the insurer what those apt words mean. By definition, the apt words are themselves sufficient.

In the present case there was nothing unusual in the nature of the business carried on by the Bank. On the contrary, the financing of stock by way of repo transactions was entirely normal.  </p>

As Edge pointed out, that case was not – directly at least – pleaded by the underwriters. (In my view, it was made, indirectly, via the next nondisclosure considered in Section F7 below). However, given the presence of the TPC in the signed slips, an allegation of non-disclosure of the TPC fails for the same reasons that the claim in respect of the NAC fails. </p>

For those who were followers in 2015 and who continued to follow in 2016, unless the inclusion of these terms was pointed out the underwriter would not be aware of their presence. They had not been told about the wish list when (and if) agreed in July 2015 or subsequently during the 2015 policy year, and therefore needed to be told about the inclusion of its terms including the TPC and NAC in the renewal wording.

What matters to those underwriters invited to subscribe for the 2016 policy are the terms contained in the 2016 policy. I have already considered, in Section F 6 above, the underwriters’ case that there was non-disclosure of the NAC and indeed the TPC. That case fails because there was no non-disclosure of those terms: the underwriters either knew or are presumed to know the terms which they signed and to which they agreed.  Given their knowledge or presumed knowledge of the terms for the 2016/2017 year, there can in my view be no rationale for the suggestion that the 2016/7 policy can be avoided because the underwriters did not know that similar terms had been agreed by Mr. Beattie in mid-2015.  </p>

Mr. Mullen would therefore have seen that Mr. Gaiger was consulting the information that was on Navigators’ system.

Had the endorsement been provided to Navigators, so that both parties were aware that there had been a variation, the context and the reasonable meaning of the representation in context would have been very different.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">First, it is a significant and perhaps unusual feature of the present case that it is possible to see how a very large group of underwriters approached the risk in circumstances where no “as expiry” representation was made. Leaving aside RSA, there were 13 underwriters who wrote the risk in 2016. The majority of those underwriters (10) do not allege that an “as expiry” representation was made to them. Of those underwriters, 6 were renewing the policy and some of the others, who had not subscribed on the 2015 year, said that they had some familiarity with the risk. The 2016 policy was oversubscribed. All of this would suggest that, looking at the matter generally, the policy was attractive to underwriters even in the absence of an “as expiry” representation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">This is not a determinative point against Navigators on inducement. Those other underwriters did not ask the question that Mr. Gaiger did, as part of his standard practice. However, the general position does suggest that it is far from obvious that Navigators or others would not have written the policy, on the same terms, in the counterfactual world of “no representation”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I consider that Mr. Gaiger’s evidence as to his approach to the renewal is significant. Mr. Gaiger was shown Navigators’ underwriting manual, which said that renewal files should have a similar level of detail as new business files, and that information should be properly updated and reanalysed as part of the underwriting process. He agreed when it was put to him that this meant that, on renewal, he did not simply ask what had changed: he looked at the risk overall. He agreed that he needed to read the whole of the slip that he was being asked to subscribe. He said that he would read wordings put in front of him with care, and that he wouldn’t scratch something, particularly something unfamiliar, unless he had read it with care. He said that he would have read through the slip to the end. He said that he would not necessarily have noticed at the time that the TPC was not a standard form of wording. He thought that he would have regarded it as part of the valuation of the subjectmatter insured. When asked about the NAC, he said that he did read through the policy, but “obviously at the time” this did not draw his attention. He also said that if they were told that the risk was “exactly as expiry, we have to take the word of the brokers at that point and then we are happy to renew if we are happy with the results we have seen”. He accepted, however, that to approach the risk in this way “maybe” would not comply with Navigators’ underwriting manual. </p>

I do not consider that their statements contain clear evidence to the effect that the risk would not have been written, on the same terms, if this particular representation had not been made. The focus of those witness statements is, in my view, very much on the non-disclosure case, and how the underwriters would have reacted if certain matters had been pointed out to them.

The statements did not explain to me how the underwriters would have reacted if they had not been told that the risk was as before. I can see that, in theory, an underwriter might say: “if I had not been told this, I would have made sure that I reviewed the policy and asked what changes there had been, and unless satisfied with each and every change, I would not have written the policy”. However, this is not what is said in the statements, and it does not emerge from a fair reading of their evidence as a whole. Furthermore, Mr. Gaiger’s evidence was that he did indeed read through the policy, and that his underwriting guidelines indicated that he should do so. </p>

His note made following the renewal discussion records certain changes (increase in oil, change to the fraudulent documents sub-limit) but then says: “All rates terms and conditions as expiry”. I am satisfied that this was based on what he was told either by Mr. Mullen or Mr. Lockyer. Whatever the precise words used (as to which there was some debate), I am satisfied that their substance was that the only material changes to the prior year’s policy were those which had been specifically discussed, and that this is what Mr. Blewett believed. </p>

I consider that there is. Mr. Blewett, as an ardent note-taker, was concerned to note the changes to the policy. If he had been told no more than was necessary to ensure that there was no misrepresentation, then he would have been informed that there had been a number of changes to the policy which had been agreed during the course of the previous year by the slip leader, Mr. Beattie. This would have led to a discussion as to what those changes were, and the TPC would have been identified in the context of such a discussion. Mr. Blewett’s evidence was that he would have asked why the Bank wanted that clause included, and that he would not have agreed to the wording if he had been shown the terms and the reasons for their inclusion explained. I consider that Mr. Blewett’s evidence, when considered as a whole, is sufficient to establish inducement.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I also consider that Ark’s case on inducement is supported by the fact that the policy was subject to peer review, after subscription, by two underwriters at Ark. Mr. Blewett agreed in cross-examination that it looked as though the peer review was very thorough. The review was carried out in the context of Mr. Blewett’s notes, which identified the changes but which indicated that otherwise the terms were as expiry. The reviewers commented on the CEND cover and its width, and this prompted Mr. Blewett to ask some questions to Mr. Mullen. The reviewers also raised a question as to the removal of the sub-limit on the fraudulent documentation cover. No questions were raised, however, about the TPC or the NAC. Mr. Blewett believed that if the reviewers had thought that the TPC extended beyond physical loss and damage, that would have been picked up; since this would be one of the things which they would be checking. In the counterfactual world where (i) these particular changes to the prior year’s policy had been identified to Mr. Blewett following his questions to the broker, and (ii) the peer review was carried out in the context of Mr. Blewett’s notes which identified all the changes, I consider it likely that the peer reviewers would have picked up on the point that the TPC did extend beyond physical loss and damage. Even if Mr. Blewett had previously missed that point, it would have been brought to his attention and this would in turn have led to Mr. Blewett indicating that he was no longer happy to write the risk. </p>

He said, and I accept, that there was no reason for him to carry out a review of the policy on renewal, in the light of what he had been told. He said in evidence that, in his experience, there was a difference between the underwriting approach when the risk is first written, when an underwriter would “go into it in some depth”, and the position on renewal where he would not do so. 682.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>I thought that Mr. Cooke’s position on inducement was not as strong as Mr. Blewett’s. Although there was a peer review by Advent, it was not of the depth and thoroughness of Ark. Also, Mr. Cooke’s witness statement did not state, as clearly as Mr. Blewett’s, that he would have asked questions about the TPC. Ultimately, however, I consider that the evidence is sufficient to establish inducement in the case of Mr. Cooke and Advent.  On a fair reading of his evidence as a whole, I conclude that had he been told that there had been changes to the policy since the prior year, he would have noted those changes and it is more likely than not that a discussion would then have ensued about the TPC. On the balance of probabilities, this would have led to Mr. Cooke declining to write the risk. Accordingly, Advent succeeds on the issue of inducement.  </p>

Mr. Gaiger, to his credit, did carry out a review of the policy as a whole, and read it with care. It may be that he did this because Navigators was the first Lloyd’s syndicate on the slip, and was to some extent a leader itself, or because Navigators’ underwriting guidelines required a reappraisal of the risk on renewal. But whatever the reason for doing so, the fact is that he did carry out the review, and in my view this should have enabled Mr. Gaiger to ask any questions about the TPC, which was a lengthy and unfamiliar clause (and which Mr. Gaiger believed that he read) or indeed about the NAC. No questions were asked, even though (see Section F5 above) the disclosure made (ie the wording of the slip policy) would naturally prompt a reasonably careful insurer to make further enquiries. In these circumstances, I do not think that it is unjust or unconscionable for the Bank to be able to rely upon the actual terms of the policy which Mr. Gaiger read through, notwithstanding the prior representation that the terms were “all else as before”. </p>

I accept that the issues on inducement consequent upon a misrepresentation and estoppel by convention are not quite the same. The former depends upon whether the policy would still have been written, on the same terms, if the representation had not been made. The latter depends upon whether the requirements set out in paragraph 696 are satisfied. However, where an underwriter has sought to rely upon avoidance based on the same representation that is alleged to give rise to an estoppel, and in that context has failed to establish inducement, it would be surprising to reach the conclusion that there was sufficient injustice to give rise to an estoppel by convention.  </p>

They also contend in their pleadings that the Bank’s failure – to have any independent system in place and/or operating to verify quality on purchase – amounted to conducting its business in a reckless manner and/or refraining to take precautions which it knew it ought to take. This case was introduced by way of amendment in July 2020. The pleaded case did not contain details of the steps that should have been taken, or the independent system that should have been in place. The case advanced at trial focused on the need for the Bank to arrange for physical inspections of the relevant goods in order to verify their quality, or at least to obtain quality certificates.

Notwithstanding that, the Bank deliberately did not verify either quality or age, because it did not care whether it overpaid, wrongfully believing that the collateral was irrelevant as their counterparty would pay the pre-agreed price or presumably that underwriters would pay. </p>

In the context of the TPC, ordinary negligence would suffice. If a higher recklessness standard was applicable, the Bank was indeed reckless in the approach that it took. In particular, it would have been reasonably practical for the Bank to obtain an independent report on quality and market value. The Bank was aware that there was a risk of a mismatch between the assumed quality and true quality, since this risk was considered in both 2014 and 2015 in the context of discussions about the Bank’s insurance arrangements. Thus, knowing of the risk, the Bank deliberately omitted to verify quality at purchase.

Given that the market was rising, the Bank should have been in a position, if the goods were sound, to have sold them for a reasonable profit.

The present argument requires consideration to be given as to how Clause 3 operates in the context of a possible claim under the TPC. As discussed in Section D above, the TPC provides coverage for the “Transaction Premium that the Insured would otherwise have received and/or earned in the absence of a Default on the part of the Insured’s client”. The “Transaction Premium” was itself defined as an amount “equal to the difference in value between the Pre-Agreed Price and the Actual Sale Price”. The TPC covers not the pre-agreed price but rather <span style="font-style:italic">the difference</span> between that price and the actual sale price, so that the value of the collateral is important. Thus, a claim under the TPC would arise if two risks eventuated: (i) the default risk and (ii) the risk on the collateral, namely that the goods, when sold, would not enable the Bank to receive the amount which the client had agreed to pay. If there were no default, then the value of the collateral would not matter. Equally, if the collateral were sufficient, then the default would not matter.  </p>

One policy was an ordinary householder’s policy, which included coverage for legal liabilities to third parties (under Section 11). The other policy was a “Travelwise Insurance” policy. A central issue in the case was whether the clauses required recklessness in order to provide a defence to the insurers, or whether an ordinary negligence standard was to be applied.

This follows from the fact that the condition applies to all sections of the policy; not just section 3. If the clause were to be taken as meaning that the insured must take all reasonable care of the property insured and all reasonable care to avoid accidents, then the insurers could never be liable under section 11, for liability under section 11 pre-supposes that the insured or a member of his family is legally liable to a third party. Legal liability in the great majority of cases depends on want of reasonable care. So a wide construction of General Condition 2, requiring the insured to take all reasonable care, would be altogether repugnant to the cover apparently afforded by section 11 of the policy. Similarly, the insurers would escape all liability under sections 1 and 2 in the very ordinary case of damage to a house or its contents by fire (one of the insured perils) if the fire were caused by the negligence of the insured.

How could the condition have one meaning in relation to section 3 and a different meaning in relation to section 11? How could it have one meaning in relation to section 2 (a) to (f) and a different meaning in relation to section 2(g) which covers the insured's liability as an occupier?  </p>

The insured must take greater care in relation to his own goods than to avoid liability to others. With respect, I find that solution to the problem quite impossible. If that is what the defendants intended, which I do not accept for one moment, then they should have made their meaning a great deal clearer. </p>

The judge in that case was considering a clause in a motor policy which required the insured to take reasonable precautions to maintain the vehicle in an efficient and roadworthy condition. The judge decided that the test of negligence was appropriate in the context of motor policies since that was not repugnant to the commercial object of the contract. He recognised that the courts had adopted different approaches to the construction of words of such clauses depending on the nature of the policies in which they appear. The case does not in my view support the proposition that the clause in the present policy should be generally construed as imposing a negligence standard, notwithstanding that the core coverage is for all risks of property damage. Indeed, the underwriters realistically do not so contend.

However, the evidence also indicates that the Bank did not have (and one would not expect banks generally to have) in-house expertise which enabled them to draw sensible conclusions from such quality certificates as might be provided. Accordingly, the insurers needed to argue that the Bank should therefore have engaged outside experts, such as Chiodo who were eventually engaged after the defaults and the problems that emerged in 2017. There was, however, no evidence to suggest that it would be normal banking practice either to ask for quality certificates, or to engage experts to analyse them. The insurers’ argument in this regard was one that developed at a late stage, and in my view owed much to hindsight. The insurers’ pleaded case was set out in very general terms, without identification of the “reasonable steps” that the Bank should have taken. It is also relevant that the supposed deficiencies of the Bank were not identified by the insurers’ investigators, Gray Page, and were only raised very shortly before trial. </p>

It was therefore submitted that the same could have been done for Icestar 2 and 3 transactions. However, there were material differences between the Icestar 1 transactions and the others. Icestar 1 transactions involved goods which were exchange deliverable, and where the client had no obligation to buy back. The Bank regarded the relevant risk as being on the exchange, to which the beans would be supplied under Icestar 1 transactions if there were a default. In relation to cocoa beans, applicable standards were those laid down by the exchange, and I understood that the quality certificates on Icestar 1 transactions would enable the Bank to ascertain, without difficulty, whether or not the goods were exchange compliant. By contrast, there was, on the evidence before me, no equivalent standard in relation to the non-exchange deliverable cocoa products; ie the goods which were subject to Icestar 2 and 3 transactions. In the absence of a clear standard against which a quality certificate could be compared or judged, the simple provision of a quality certificate would not enable the Bank to draw conclusions as to the quality of the goods. This was why the underwriters were forced to argue that outside experts should have been engaged.  There was no equivalent suggestion that outside experts would be required in order to assess the Icestar 1 quality certificates. In these circumstances, I did not consider that there was any significance to the fact that the Bank obtained quality certificates for Icestar 1 transactions. </p>

Prior to obtaining the TPC, the Bank had not taken the steps to ascertain quality which, on the insurers’ case, should allegedly have been taken. The Bank at that stage, when uninsured, did not see the need to guard, in the manner proposed by underwriters, against the risk of collateral on Icestar 2 and 3 transactions being inadequate.  Subsequent to obtaining the TPC, the Bank carried on its business in the same way, save that there was an increase in the volume of repo transactions. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that the Bank took a more lax approach to the granting of repo facilities than it had done previously, still less that it did so in the light of the insurance that had been obtained. </p>

However, the evidence did not suggest to me that this was a consequence of the Bank lowering its standards or changing its approach to risk. A significant reason for the increase was that the existence of the insurance, with first-class rated insurance companies, lowered the Bank’s capital requirements for its Icestar 2 and 3 transactions, so that Icestar’s return on capital (sometimes called return on equity) would improve. The insurance therefore had the effect of enabling the Bank to expand its business in these respects, since more business could be conducted relative to the same amount of capital.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Thirdly, there is no evidence to suggest that the Bank identified the need to take the steps for which the underwriters now contend, still less that the Bank did so but decided not to take those steps because of the existence of the insurance. It is true that the Bank’s internal documents, and the communications with NRF, indicate (unsurprisingly) that the Bank was aware of a risk that, in a default situation, the collateral might not realise the full amounts owed to the Bank. There is, however, nothing to suggest that anyone identified the possible need, in order to mitigate this risk, to conduct quality checks on collateral or to obtain quality certificates and have them analysed. Ms. Franssen acknowledged in her evidence that, with the benefit of hindsight in the light of the problems which occurred, it would have been better if the Bank had done more. That does not in my view come close to establishing a case of recklessness, and indeed does not even establish negligence. </p>

The factual position is that there had not been prior problems of the type that were ultimately experienced, and the Bank (understandably in my view) did not think that its clients would be trading sub-standard stock. As Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted in closing, the Bank had no reason to think that its clients were running anything other than a normal commercial operation and that it had good reason for holding the stocks which it had purchased. </p>

Ms. Franssen was asked about these documents, and she was asked questions as to whether her team or colleagues should have drawn certain conclusions. It seemed to me that this was a very long way from a case of recklessness. Moreover, recklessness would need to be established against the senior individuals of the Bank. It was common ground that Mr. Stroink would count for that purpose and I am willing to proceed on the basis that Ms. Franssen would count as well. However, Ms. Franssen had not herself reviewed the documents (principally spreadsheets) which were said to contain the red flags, and I did not see how any failure by more junior employees to spot alleged red flags would establish recklessness against the Bank.  </p>

This was provided under cover of an email from Mr. Stroink dated 27 January 2016, and was forwarded to underwriters. Those processes focused on the quality of the warehouses where the goods would be stored, and the steps taken to ensure that the warehouses acted on the Bank’s instructions. The Bank relied upon the fact that the documentation did not indicate that any steps were taken to ascertain the quality of the cargoes, and that the underwriters did not suggest at the time that the procedures described by the Bank were inadequate. I regarded this as a marginal point. If the Bank was indeed reckless in its approach, then there would have been a breach of Clause 3 even though the underwriters did not spot it at the time. </p>

Accordingly, the Bank should have hedged its position by entering into transactions on an exchange. In substance, this meant that the Bank’s “long” position (because it held cocoa products) would be matched by a “short” position created by the hedging transaction (because it had agreed to sell cocoa beans). This would, on the underwriters’ case, have avoided the exposure to market risk. Had this happened, the Bank’s financial position would have improved by £3.4m. The essential reason for this is again the fall in the market after August 2016. The fall would mean that a hedging transaction, whereby the Bank sold cocoa beans at the better prices available in August, would have yielded the Bank a profit when those transactions came to be closed out. </p>

This requires extreme facts to prove. There is no question in the present case of the Bank’s conduct having been so unreasonable as to have broken the chain of causation and amounted to the proximate cause of the losses, displacing Transmar’s and Euromar’s failure to pay as a proximate cause. On the contrary, the Bank acted reasonably. Furthermore, the Bank’s conduct should be judged by the standard of ordinarily competent bankers in their shoes.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">Hence, the only point which had any potential impact on the Bank’s losses was the argument that hedges should have been taken out in relation to the Euromar transactions. That claim was, in relative terms, small. At most, it was worth £ 3.43 million, although that case depended upon the Bank taking out hedges on the very day of default. If the relevant date for taking out a hedge was when the Euromar contracts were terminated, the gain on the hedge would have been £ 2.88 million. If the relevant date took into account a financial buffer which was built in to the repo contracts in order to protect the Bank from loss (essentially because the Bank did not lend based upon the full value of the collateral), the hedging gain would be £ 1.01 million. </p>

He said that it was difficult to conceive that anything less than unreasonable conduct on the part of the claimant would be capable of breaking the chain of causation. Ordinarily, reckless conduct would do so, but there was no rule of law that only recklessness would suffice. The claimant’s state of knowledge at the time of and following the defendant’s breach is likely to be a factor of very great significance. The more the claimant has actual knowledge of the breach, or the dangerousness of the situation which has arisen and the need to take appropriate remedial measures, the greater the likelihood that the chain of causation will be broken. Conversely, the less the claimant knows, the more likely it is that only recklessness will suffice to break the chain of causation. Ultimately, the question of whether there has been a break in the chain of causation is fact sensitive, involving “a practical inquiry into the circumstances of the defendant’s breach of contract and the claimant’s subsequent conduct”.  </p>

It is not a matter of choosing a cause as proximate on the basis of an unguided gut feeling. The starting point for the inquiry is to identify, by interpreting the policy and considering the evidence, whether a peril covered by the policy had any causal involvement in the loss and, if so, whether a peril excluded or excepted from the scope of the cover also had any such involvement. The question whether the occurrence of such a peril was in either case the proximate (or “efficient”) cause of the loss involves making a judgment as to whether it made the loss inevitable - if not, which could seldom if ever be said, in all conceivable circumstances - then in the ordinary course of events. <span style="text-decoration:underline">For this purpose, human actions are</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">not generally regarded as negativing causal connection,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">provided at least that the actions taken were not wholly</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">unreasonable or erratic</span>.

The critical question here was, in the light of that clause, whether the Bank had acted in good faith. Unless there was a lack of good faith, the chain of causation would not be broken.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">As far as timing of steps taken to avert or minimise loss, it was common ground that the duty to sue and labour arose when the peril had arisen or was imminent, a concept often expressed as “in the grip of a peril”. In that context, underwriters referred to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">ICS v BTI</span> [1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 154. That case concerned a claim for the recovery by the insured of expenses incurred as a result of steps allegedly taken in fulfilment of the duty. Eveleigh LJ said at p 158 that s 78(4) imposes a duty to act in circumstances where a reasonable man intent on preserving his property, as opposed to claiming upon insurers, would act. It was therefore not necessary for the assured to show that a loss would “very probably” occur in order to enable costs to be recovered. Rather, the assured could recover where he could demonstrate that a prudent assured person, mindful of an obligation to prevent a loss, would incur expense of an unusual kind.  </p>

Independent inspectors, Control Union, were sent into the warehouses to check the quantity of stock. By September 2016, the inspectors had inspected 7 of the 22 warehouses where Euromar stock was held. The inspections showed that the quantities which should have been there were indeed in place.  Subsequent inspections of other warehouses also showed that the quantities held were between 99 and 100% accurate; ie the goods were there. The Bank also obtained quality certificates for the goods and started speaking to their contacts in the market. At that stage, the Bank was assessing the entire portfolio and checking the positions held by the Bank, focusing on gathering information. </p>

The Bank certainly did not think that Euromar would not be able to comply with its repurchase obligations at all, following its initial default. This was because both Transmar and Euromar were working actively with Euromar’s other lenders to find a solution, and indeed Transmar furnished Euromar with formal letters of support. In the period following Euromar’s default on 17 August, there was no indication that Transmar itself was in any financial difficulty, and no reason to think that it would be unable to perform its obligations or become insolvent.

The Bank believed that Transmar was in a position to assist Euromar.

The initial strategy was to sell all of the stock to a single buyer, and the Bank was hopeful that one of these companies would buy the cargo from them. But it then became clear that the </p>

The Bank had discussions with them for several months, but in the end they decided only to take a portion of the cargo. A sale of cocoa butter was made in October 2016 to Theobroma, and in January 2017 there was a sale to Theobroma of all of the Bank’s cocoa beans. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">One issue that was also discussed with Mr. Johnson in September 2016 was whether Transmar could buy back certain cocoa products rather than rolling those deals. This was done in order to try to reduce the Bank’s overall position in a gradual way. Mr. Johnson said, however, that Transmar did not have any exchange deliverable beans, nor did it have sufficient liquidity at that point in time to pay the cash equivalent. This news was of concern to the Bank. However, the Bank took the view that if the swap options were exercised at this point, it would not have achieved anything positive. It would simply have made it more likely that Transmar would go into immediate default. It made no commercial sense to take that approach. The Bank did not think, however, that the situation at Transmar was so serious that the company would be insolvent three months later. Transmar had not committed any defaults, but in fact was continuing to service its deals with the Bank by making substantial netting payments and repurchasing goods which had been financed. It was not until December 2016 that the Bank discovered the true severity of Transmar’s financial difficulties. </p>

The rationale was to give Transmar the opportunity to improve its liquidity, by trading through what was understood to be a temporary difficulty caused by supporting Euromar. Between 18 August and 2 December 2016, the roll of transactions resulted in £ 8.128 million and USD 6.050 million being paid to the Bank. </p>

The Bank did ask Euromar for quality certificates. This was one way of gathering information. Discussions took place with some of the Bank’s other clients, who knew the market much better and had a much better idea about how to start looking at liquidating a large position. The Bank were not commodity traders, and therefore did not have experience of dealing with the situation in which it found itself. They had suspicions about the quality certificates that were supplied to them by Euromar, because they bore a relatively recent date. But the Bank did not think it appropriate to carry out a full audit of the stock at that stage. They were told that if anyone was going to buy the goods, they would assess the quality themselves. There were a lot of processes that had to be thought about. The Bank was checking the legal position; obtaining warrants; checking the quantity; talking to different parties in the market as to what to do. They sent the quality certificates to some of their trusted counterparties, and none of them suggested that the first thing that needed to be done was to send in an independent quality assessor.  </p>

But they were told that they could not do so: the support which they were providing to Euromar meant that there was a technical default under their borrowing base facility, and they did not have access to any further liquidity. The fact that there was a default by Euromar did not, however, lead automatically to the conclusion that all the swap options with Transmar should be exercised. The position was carefully considered in conjunction with the recovery and restructuring team.

He submitted that since it was a causation point, the actions of the assured can break the chain of causation. The straightforward question was: what had caused the loss? There could be actions of the assured which broke the chain of causation, even if those actions were taken in good faith and therefore did not amount to a breach of Clause 3. </p>

I do not consider that the causation issue can be divorced from the terms of the contract as a whole, as Mr. Parsons’ argument posits. The parties have agreed that the duty to sue and labour should not be the ordinary duty to take reasonable steps, as provided for in s 78(4) and clause 16 of the ICC (A) clauses, but rather a modified and lower threshold of good faith. If there was no failure by the Bank to fulfil its obligations in that regard, then it would in my view be strange and wrong to conclude that the Bank’s conduct was such as to break the chain of causation. </p>

I accept Ms. Franssen’s evidence that the issue was considered, but that it was (reasonably in my view) regarded as unlikely to achieve anything. The Bank’s approach, as described by Ms. Franssen, was to see if solutions could be found in order to address the liquidity problems of Euromar. This approach did have the benefit of the Bank receiving continued co-operation from Transmar in the final months of 2016, with the consequence that the equivalent of US$ 15 million of payments were received when transactions were rolled over. </p>

As Mr. MacLeod explained, if the options were exercised, and then there was a default, that would produce an outcome which was now known; but it was not a desirable outcome. If a default is forced, then that usually eliminates any possibility of the company paying later, and its assets would then be sold on a fire sale basis. It was therefore appropriate to try alternative methods to recover money owed, because (as Mr. MacLeod put it) “often they lead to better outcomes”. If a default was forced, then that would usually be terminal; because typically other borrowings have cross-default provisions, so that all of the company’s debt would immediately go into default.  </p>

Ms. Franssen’s evidence in re-examination was that: “we knew that if we would exercise our swap option, we would put the company in default and likely lose all co-operation we were still having at that point in time”. </p>

I do not think that it is reasonable to criticise the approach taken by the Bank. The most that can be said, as Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted in her written closing, was that the Bank might have acted differently. But this is very different from saying that any prudent uninsured would have done so, or that this was an obvious step to take. She also made the reasonable point that if there really had been some obvious steps which the Bank had failed to take, one would have expected them to have been identified and pleaded long before they were ultimately raised in the spring of 2020; particularly bearing in mind that the underwriters had asked Gray Page to investigate the position in early 2017. </p>

An enormous quantity of beans would have been required in order to enable Transmar to fulfil its obligations, if the swap options were exercised. But Ms. Franssen’s evidence was that she was told by Transmar in September 2016 that it did not have any exchange deliverable beans, nor sufficient liquidity at that point in time to pay the cash equivalent for the beans. In my view, it is more likely than not that, as Mr. MacLeod said, the exercise of swap options by the Bank would simply have accelerated the events of December 2016 when Transmar defaulted and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. </p>

The evidence indicates that the goods were unsound when they were sold, and were not in a materially better condition in August or September 2016.

As summarised by Ms. Franssen in re-examination, the Bank took a number of steps; sending inspectors in to check that all the goods were there; ensuring that the warehouses held the goods to their order; consulting with different law firms in Germany, Holland, Belgium, the US and the UK, to make sure that the contractual framework was in order and that they had the right to sell goods; requesting warrants for the goods; asking for quality certificates; engaging in discussions with Euromar and Transmar, the Chief Restructuring Officer, and other bankers, in relation to Euromar’s liquidity issues and the position generally; speaking to their other clients in relation to the possibility of selling the goods, and accomplishing some sales in late 2016 and early 2017.

Accordingly, the underwriters’ argument posits that the Bank should have taken the “obvious” step of entering into futures transactions of a kind which it had not previously entered; and that this should have been done when, as shown by Ms. Franssen’s evidence summarised above, the Bank was focused on various issues arising from the difficult position in which it found itself.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, if hedges had been taken out for the Euromar financing, they would have been at best “imperfect” and would therefore potentially expose the Bank to further loss. The Transmar hedges transferred to the Bank operated as “perfect” hedges; because the contractual price repayable to the Bank was not fixed but varied according to the futures market price of cocoa beans (which was the subject of the hedge). This meant that if there were market movements, they would operate in the same way in relation to the price payable by Transmar and the pricing of the hedge. The Euromar transactions had never been hedged, because the price payable was a fixed repurchase price. The underwriters’ argument is, therefore, that – for the first time – the Bank should take out a cocoa beans hedge in respect of the cocoa products. This would result in products being hedged by beans. However, the nature of the market was such that there could be significant changes in what was described as the “ratio” between the prices of products and beans. This ratio was not fixed: it could fluctuate, depending for example on whether there were surpluses or shortages of products. In other words, products may be more or less valuable, when compared to beans, depending upon how the market moves. This means that if cocoa products are hedged by reference to cocoa beans, the Bank is potentially exposed to loss caused by adverse changes in the ratio between these two different commodities.  It is difficult to see why the Bank, as a prudent uninsured, should have exposed itself to this potential loss. </p>

However, it may assist in explaining why, as Mr. MacLeod said, it is not standard practice for a lender to hedge illiquid physical collateral upon default of a borrower. Where a bank holds illiquid collateral (eg cocoa products when contrasted to exchange-deliverable beans), it would be important to know the actual quality of the products. The reason is that if there are problems with the quality of the product, the value of the product would not (even leaving aside the question of the ratio described above) move in line with change in the market price of beans. If the products were sound, then a rise in the value of cocoa beans might be expected to produce a rise in the value of the collateral held; although the potential movement in the ratio may mean that this rise is not linear. However, if the products are not sound, then a rise in the market for beans would make the hedge loss-making, but this would not be compensated for by any equivalent rise in the value of the products. </p>

The Euromar deals did not automatically come to an end on the day that Euromar failed to repay the price. The default was a breach, but not a repudiatory breach, and each forward contract sale remained alive. They were not terminated until October or November 2016. It would therefore have been wrong, or not sensible, for the Bank to have hedged on the moment of default. If Euromar had paid late, there would have been an obligation on the part of the Bank to deliver the cargo to them. But the Bank would then be left with an open futures position, and it would suffer a loss if the market price of beans rose. </p>

There was no dispute, subject to issues of quantum, that Edge would indeed be liable in the event that the underwriters’ defences based upon rectification/ estoppel/ collateral contract were to succeed.

The reason is that the 2016/2017 slip was substantially oversubscribed. If Ark and Advent had declined to write the 7.5% share that each of them wrote, the Bank would still have had subscriptions to the cover which exceeded 100%. There is also a potential liability for any costs payable by the Bank to Ark and Advent, or any irrecoverable costs which the Bank has incurred in pursuing those underwriters. Any argument as to the extent of such liability is a matter which can addressed at the “consequentials” hearing in the light of this judgment. </p>

This duty (which was not in dispute) has been recognised in a number of cases; see <span style="font-style:italic">FNCB Ltd v Barnet Devanney (Harrow) Ltd</span> [1999] Lloyd’s Rep IR 459; <span style="font-style:italic">Talbot Underwriting Ltd v Nausch Hogan &amp; Murray Inc</span> [2005] EWHC 2359 (Comm) (Cooke J); <span style="font-style:italic">Standard Life Assurance Ltd v Oak Dedicated Ltd</span> [2008] EWHC 222 (Comm) (Tomlinson J).

In broad summary, Ms. Healy submits that even if the TPC did not provide the coverage which the Bank wanted, this cannot be laid at the door of Edge. This is essentially because the TPC had been drafted by NRF, and it was to NRF (not Edge) that the Bank was looking in order to ensure that its interests were protected. Edge did not fall below the standards to be expected of a reasonably competent broker. In the alternative scenario, where (as I have held) the TPC did provide the coverage which the Bank was seeking, Edge cannot be held responsible for the consequences of the underwriters advancing spurious arguments. </p>

The Bank contended that it would (if the defences had succeeded) have suffered substantial loss as a result of Edge’s breaches. Had Edge performed its duties, the Bank would have sought and purchased alternative insurance cover, from specialist credit underwriters, which would have provided substantial protection against the defaults of Euromar and Transmar. If such cover had not been available for some reason, then the Bank would have taken steps in 2015 and 2016 to ensure that it was no longer exposed to those companies: in effect, the Bank would have wound down its repo transactions with those companies before any default arose. These propositions were disputed by Edge. The arguments gave rise to a debate between two well-qualified experts, with considerable experience of the credit insurance market, as to what cover would have been available at the material times. </p>

He and Mr. Lockyer failed to take any adequate steps to ensure that the effect of the TPC was clear and indisputable. Mr. Mullen had not understood the clause when he had first read it. This was a new clause, not something familiar to the market. It extended cover well beyond the ordinary bounds of cargo cover, as any reasonably competent broker would have appreciated. They should therefore have explained the intended effect to underwriters. They failed to communicate to underwriters that the Bank wanted credit risk insurance. When asked the direct question by Ms. Van de Beek, as to whether it was clear that the cover under the TPC was a separate insuring clause, any reasonably competent broker would have said: “No” in response to this.

There was no substantive discussion with Mr Beattie, but merely a discussion and agreement concerning the relocation of the TPC within the policy wording. These attempts to protect his client’s interests were, again, perfunctory and superficial. Had Mr. Mullen done what he should have done, the dispute in these proceedings could never have come to pass. Mr. Beattie would either have confirmed that the TPC was a freestanding head of cover, in which case underwriters’ case in these proceedings would have been unsustainable. Alternatively, he would have declined to do so, in which case the Bank would have taken steps to protect itself, including by taking out a separate policy of credit risk insurance. </p>

These included the following. The insurer was presumed to know his own business, and to be able to form his own judgment of the risk as presented to him, and should therefore read the proposed policy and ask questions as appropriate. Highly experienced and well paid marine cargo underwriters should read the slip with care, and no duty should be imposed which sanctions a race to the bottom in underwriting practice. The broker’s duty of care must be capable of precise definition, and the factual and expert evidence at trial had revealed different formulations of what the broker would be expected to do. There was also uncertainty as to whose understanding of a clause should be explained to the underwriter: was it the broker’s, or the client’s or the client’s lawyer? If an explanation were proffered, the broker might inadvertently explain the cover in a way that was inconsistent with its true construction. The “duty to nanny” might place a broker in a position of conflict: by flagging an unusual clause, the underwriter might be less likely to agree it. The prospects of litigation would increase. In any controversial case, the underwriters would assert that a particular clause was not flagged and explained to them. The supposed obligation on the broker would create two divergent sets of rules on what a broker would need to disclose: one under the 1906 Act (or the subsequent 2015 Act), and another under the duty of care in tort. </p>

The wording was given to Mr. Mullen. Both he and Mr. Lockyer knew that they needed to consider it carefully and to understand what it was seeking to achieve. Thus, on 9 July 2015, Mr. Mullen sent a series of questions and observations on the proposed wording, indicating that there might be the need for “further discussion either in London or the Netherlands”. The reason for this e-mail was, in my view, that Mr. Mullen considered that he needed to understand what was being proposed, not only because he might have to answer questions from underwriters, but also because it was possible that the Bank’s answers would give rise to further discussion and possible amendment. Ms. Barnes, unsurprisingly, gave a detailed response. She did not brush off Mr. Mullen’s questions on the basis that the issues raised were no concern of his, because the Bank was not looking for Edge’s professional assistance in connection with what was proposed. There was, therefore, on this occasion a correct appreciation by Edge that it had obligations to understand and broke the clauses properly, notwithstanding that the endorsement, including the TPC, was a draft emanating from the client.

Although Ms. Healy raised questions as to the adequacy of the Bank’s pleadings, when compared to the case ultimately advanced, I did not consider that there was any substance in that point. The critical issues, concerning what Edge should have done in order to fulfil its duties to the Bank, were in my view fully ventilated in the expert evidence and I do not consider that Edge can have been taken by surprise in relation to the case advanced. Both experts therefore expressed their views as to what, in practical terms, the admitted duties required of Edge. </p>

He could and should have mentioned specifically to Mr. Beattie that the purpose of the TPC was to introduce credit risk cover. There was an onus on Mr. Mullen to explain the coverage being sought by his client. This was even more so where a new clause was being added to the policy, for which there was no precedent in past dealings with the underwriters. The TPC was not a general market clause and was not a risk that marine cargo underwriters regularly insure. Similarly, in January 2016, Mr. Meldrum’s view was that Edge should have drawn underwriters’ attention to the fact that the TPC was credit/financial risk cover. Even if Edge considered the endorsement wording to be clear, and that the 2015/16 policy provided the cover sought, there was no good reason not to remind underwriters of the scope of cover, to ensure that they were all happy to write the risk for another year. It was routine for a broker to seek specific confirmation from an underwriter when the scope of cover is increasing. This was “to ensure that there are no nasty surprises: it avoids doubt or uncertainty”. </p>

In his first report, he said that an underwriter was expected to read and understand an endorsement or policy wording presented to him/her for consideration, in order to decide whether to underwrite the cover on the terms presented. That was the essence of the underwriter’s role. If the broker was required to provide an explanation of a clause, it could place the broker in a difficult position. It would not be practical to explain every clause. A broker would be put in the position of having to select which clauses he needed to explain. If required to volunteer an explanation, the broker might be in a position of conflict with its client, if the explanation differed from the client’s understanding of the clause concerned. The broker was therefore obliged to answer an underwriter’s questions honestly, but absent enquiry is not obliged to volunteer an explanation of the intended meaning or effect of any clause. In his second report, he said that it did not make any difference if a clause is not customarily included in the type of policy being broked: the broker still did not have a duty to volunteer an explanation of its meaning or effect. </p>

The admitted duties did require Mr. Mullen to tell the Bank, at the outset, that the credit risk market was the appropriate market in which to place the cover which the Bank was seeking, and (since Mr. Mullen did not have the relevant expertise in that area) specialist brokers within Edge should become involved. Such advice would have enabled the Bank to take an informed decision as to how to proceed, and I see nothing in the evidence which suggests that (having been so advised) they would have pressed forward with an attempt to obtain the cover from cargo underwriters.  </p>

In my view, however, the Bank was simply proceeding on the assumption that this was a possible change to which cargo underwriters might be willing to agree, and were doing so in the absence of any advice from Edge as to where such cover would normally be placed. This is not, therefore, a situation where the Bank was insistent on the cargo market being approached. If cover was to be placed which clearly and indisputably met the Bank’s requirements, and did not expose it to an unnecessary risk of litigation, then in my view the starting point was for Edge to identify to its client the underwriters who provided the cover that was being requested. As Mr. Russell rightly said in his supplemental report, Edge should have known that cover in respect of credit risks and/or financial defaults would have constituted a separate line of insurance business. If, therefore, Edge was to approach underwriters who did not specialise in that line of business, and did not ordinarily write it, then in my view that should only have happened (as Mr. Meldrum said in his evidence) after appropriate advice had been given to the client and the client had taken an informed decision to pursue this course. Ordinarily, one would not expect a sensible client to take this course. </p>

This question encapsulated the views expressed by Mr. Meldrum. I accept his evidence that – on the facts of the present case – the fulfilment of the relevant duty owed by Edge to its client (to arrange cover which clearly and indisputably met the client’s requirements, and did not expose the client to an unnecessary risk of litigation) did require Edge to discuss with the underwriters the nature of the cover which was being </p>

This was in my view necessary in order to avoid the potential for future dispute in circumstances where: the new cover sought was of considerable importance to the client; the cover had no precedent in the marine cargo market; there did exist an established and different market in which such risks would usually be placed; the underwriters were being asked to write a risk which would materially increase the potential for losses; and where the relevant clause, the TPC, was long and tightly drafted and its full import would not necessarily be grasped by an underwriter on a first reading.  I consider that there was a clear rationale for doing so, as explained by Mr. Meldrum, namely to avoid the scope for dispute later, and to ensure beyond all reasonable doubt that the cover was in place. Mr. Meldrum’s rhetorical questions are in my view pertinent: why take the chance, why not just do it? </p>

The clause did not, in my view, lack clarity when carefully read and understood. However, the careful drafting of a clause, in circumstances where that clause is unusual and indeed unprecedented in the market in which the cover was being placed, could not reasonably be relied upon by the broker as providing protection against the unnecessary risk of litigation. This is because the door can, and does in a case such as the present, remain open for the very arguments that the underwriters have advanced in the present case. Those arguments, as Ms. Sabben-Clare pointed out, are essentially focused not upon the language of the clause, but other matters which are potentially relevant to the construction of the contract: in particular, the factual matrix relating to the nature of the market in which the cover was placed and the existence of a specialist market for risks of the present kind, and the commercial consequences of the rival constructions for which the parties contend.

As Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted, the underwriters’ points on construction were all about the market and specifically about facts known to underwriters and brokers, not the Bank. That was also the basis of the “commercial sense” case advanced by underwriters. In those regards, NRF was not a mirror to Edge. Edge were the market experts.

The consequence of that simple discussion would either have been that the underwriters were comfortable with what was proposed, so that everyone was (in Mr. Meldrum’s phrase) singing from the same hymn-sheet; or they were not, so that the Bank could be told that, since this cover was important to them, the credit insurance market should be approached. Mr. Russell accepted that, in the context of Ms. Van de Beek’s question on 28 January, a reasonably competent broker should have a discussion with the underwriter if there was doubt as to the effect of the clause. I consider that such a conversation was appropriate even if Mr. Mullen were of the view that the clause was sufficiently clear.

Here, the contemporaneous documents show that Mr. Mullen had not initially understood the clause. His question about the TPC to Mr. Lockyer on 8 July 2015, after Mr. Mullen had carried out a review of the endorsement, was: “do not understand this – have you seen this before Lee”?  He then asked the Bank, on 9 July 2015, to explain the “relevance of the “transaction premium” contained under 1-2-3”. Given those questions, there was clearly a risk that the underwriters and the Bank would not have the same understanding of the clause, with the client thereby being exposed (unless the position was clarified with underwriters) to an unnecessary risk of litigation. The lengthy clause was clearly of considerable importance to the Bank, as Mr. Mullen did or at least should have appreciated at the time. The need to explain the position to underwriters is, therefore, not a matter borne of hindsight. Indeed, as discussed below, Mr. Lockyer asked a pertinent question in January 2016 (“ … is this the understanding of underwriters”), and so the issue was identified at the time. </p>

His evidence was (as the Bank submitted) direct, clear, pragmatic and sensible. I thought that Mr. Russell gave his evidence fairly and conscientiously, and sought to assist the court. Nevertheless, I thought that Mr. Meldrum’s approach, rather than the narrower approach which Mr. Russell put forward, better reflected what was required in order to protect the Bank from an unnecessary risk of litigation in the circumstances which I have described. As discussed in the previous paragraph, Mr. Russell’s evidence acknowledged that, in certain circumstances, the underwriters should be given an explanation. In addition, Mr. Russell also accepted, when asked about Ms. Van de Beek’s 28 January e-mail, that a reasonably competent broker would have had a discussion with the underwriter if he considered that the TPC was not sufficiently clear. There is, therefore, no reason in principle why a broker’s obligation to its client should not require a discussion as to the effect of a clause to take place.

As his evidence (set out above) shows, if he had not received Mr. Mullen’s assurance, he would have considered it appropriate to go back to the underwriters and made sure that they were happy and that they clearly understood what they were covering.

There was also no evidence of any discussion with any other underwriter. Since the issue of the underwriters’ understanding had been directly raised by Mr. Lockyer as a result of reading Ms. Van de Beek’s question, I consider that fulfilment of the relevant duty did require steps to be taken at that stage to check that the underwriters did indeed have the same understanding as the Bank, particularly in circumstances where Edge had not yet had a positive discussion with the underwriters on that topic. Otherwise, the Bank would be exposed to the risk of unnecessary litigation, which it was the broker’s duty to take reasonable care to avoid. </p>

But the message continued the theme of the need for discussion with underwriters. On 28 July, he said to Ms. Barnes (when chased) that he was “nearly finished”. Again, he had not in fact started to discuss matters with Mr. Beattie. Following the meeting, Mr. Mullen apologised for the time that it had taken to review, but reported (again incorrectly) that there were: “Bits that needed no discussion and others that needed some explanation”. Whilst these answers were not specific to the TPC, and whilst there was an element of Mr. Mullen seeking to explain away his delay in dealing with things, they are in my view also consistent with Mr. Meldrum’s evidence: the TPC was something that did need to be discussed. </p>

In the event, it has not been argued by underwriters that lack of authority provides a defence to the claim, although the limits of authority were referred to in the context of arguments as to the factual matrix and related matters. The significant point, however, is that if there was a risk that the writing of credit risk insurance lay outside the authority of the subscribing underwriters, there was potential scope for a future dispute on the cover if the nature of the TPC was not discussed with subscribing underwriters. The placement of cover, without any discussion with subscribing underwriters, therefore exposed the Bank to the risk of unnecessary litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">I do not consider that these conclusions result from the imposition of an unprincipled “duty to nanny”. There is nothing in my reasoning or conclusions which is intended to suggest that brokers generally owe duties to their clients to explain particular clauses, including unusual clauses, to underwriters. Ultimately, the question is what was required on the facts of the present case in order to fulfil the duties which Edge rightly admitted: ie obtaining the cover that was sought, and procuring cover that clearly and indisputably met the Bank’s requirements, and so did not expose it to an unnecessary risk of litigation. That question may, and does on the facts of the present case, require brokers – in order to protect the position of their clients – to give information to underwriters, or to discuss the implications of that information, even though the underwriters could not succeed on an avoidance case. That is illustrated by Ms. Van de Beek’s comment, and Mr. Lockyer’s response which identified the need, in the interests of the client, to check whether the underwriters had the same understanding as the Bank in relation to the effect of the TPC. The reason was to avoid problems which would potentially arise in the future, including the possibility of litigation, if the underwriters did not share the Bank’s understanding of the unusual clause with which I am concerned. That is in my view a different question to that which arises in the context of the non-disclosure arguments. The latter question is significantly impacted by the Marine Insurance Act 1906, section 18, which I have considered above. The former question is not. Thus, Ms. Sabben-Clare’s response to the “nanny” point emphasised the importance of identifying the right protégé. As she said: “it’s not about the duty to protect underwriters, it’s about the duty to protect your own client”. </p>

But she submitted that it would require an express instruction from the client to raise the particular matter with underwriters. There was, she submitted in her oral closing, no duty to explain anything in the absence of an express instruction or an enquiry from underwriters. I disagree. I see no reason why a broker should not be obliged to raise a matter with underwriters, in order to fulfil the duties owed to the client, in circumstances where there has not been an express instruction. There are in my view no fixed rules which delineate what the broker should or should not do in order to procure cover that clearly and indisputably meet its client’s requirements, and so does not expose it to an unnecessary risk of litigation. This must in my view depend upon the circumstances and the particular facts of the case. </p>

The argument largely focused on causation and quantum in the context of the situation where the TPC did not provide the coverage that the Bank was seeking, and Edge’s breach of duties in that respect as discussed in Section J2 above. It was not suggested, however, that the position on causation and quantum would be any different if the cover was completely ineffective in the event that all underwriters had succeeded in their defences based on rectification/estoppel/ collateral contract or avoidance. I shall address the issues that would have arisen in the event that the claim against underwriters had failed on any of those grounds. I will then consider the issues of causation and quantum which arise in the context of my actual conclusion that the Bank’s claim against the majority of the underwriters succeeds, where there is nevertheless (leaving aside the consequences of the failure of the claim against Ark and Advent) a small potential claim (Ms. SabbenClare described it as a ‘sliver’ of a claim) against Edge for irrecoverable costs. Finally, I will briefly address the possible claim, which I have not hitherto addressed, as to what the position would have been if the claim had failed, or been substantially reduced, because the Bank was in breach of Clause 3 of the policy. </p>

Nevertheless, Mr. Stroink did seek to explain what he considered would have happened in different circumstances.

He would have wanted to cover transactions where there was a client repayment risk. He would not, however, have been interested in insuring transactions where Icestar only had an exchange risk: ie the Icestar 1 transactions. He would have considered which particular clients to cover. He would not have considered it necessary to have credit risk cover in respect of clients with significant size and access to liquidity, such as Trafigura or Louis Dreyfus. However, he would have “considered” credit risk cover for clients with a smaller balance sheet. He identified 6 such clients, including Transmar and Euromar. </p>

Icestar was making a margin of 3.25% on Transmar and Euromar transactions, and the cost of credit risk insurance would still leave a decent margin. The return after buying the insurance would be a good return on what would have been an investment grade risk. Whilst the Bank did not take out insurance in 2017/18, after being told at short notice that underwriters were no longer willing to include the TPC, that was because there was then no longer any need to do so. That was a consequence of all the problems that the Euromar and Transmar defaults had created. Icestar therefore changed the profile of its portfolio substantially, so that its exposure to clients with smaller balance sheets was reduced and in some cases terminated. </p>

The Bank’s income from Transmar was going to rise from February 2016 anyway, since ABN was replacing another bank under Transmar’s revolving credit facility. Any additional income from Icestar was a positive cross-selling opportunity for the Bank, even if the margin was reduced from 3.25%, which was one of the highest margins for any client. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">In his third statement, Mr. Stroink said that he would have sought cover on the widest possible terms to mirror the cover that was available under the TPC. He addressed the question, following exchange of the credit risk experts’ reports, as to what would have happened if the policy had contained terms which restricted cover, such as those suggested by Edge’s expert: for example, terms concerning the maximum period of financing or maximum risk duration, the maximum number of rollovers, a limit on the age of the cargo financed, the time when the financing had to be advanced, or a requirement to obtain independent quality certificates. He said that he could say with certainty that Icestar would have made sure that it complied with any terms that the credit risk underwriters would have imposed. The cover was important to Icestar, and it was a part of its approach to risk and portfolio management that Icestar had already decided to pursue. Having obtained such cover, they would not have done anything to endanger the insurance by not complying with the terms that credit risk underwriters required. This meant that, from the beginning of August 2015 (when the TPC was first agreed), the Bank would have ensured that all future transactions with Transmar and Euromar complied with any relevant limitations or requirements that were imposed. Accordingly, since transactions had a maximum duration of 3 months, the Bank would only have rolled over a deal upon its expiry if doing so would still have meant that the coverage was still in place. If quality checks were required, they would have been carried out and the cost passed on to Euromar and Transmar as part of the cost of financing. </p>

This would have meant that Euromar and Transmar were obliged to make repayment. He expressed the view that if that had happened at any time in the period beginning from August 2015, the Bank would have been repaid by Transmar and Euromar. He exhibited a table showing that significant financing repayments were made from August 2015 onwards. For example, repayments by Transmar and Euromar in the last months of 2015 were: £ 2.9 million (August), £ 6.3 million (September), £ 5.1 million (October), £ 458,000 (November) and £ 641,000 (December). </p>

This deep-dive considered Icestar’s set-up, products and procedures in February 2015.  </p>

First, it provided a second line of defence or an additional layer of protection. Secondly, it lowered the Bank’s assessment of the probability of default. The Bank could therefore, for capital allocation purposes, allocate the exposure to the insurance companies rather than the client. The insurance companies had a better credit rating than most of the Bank’s clients. This would have the effect that the Bank’s capital requirements for that part of the portfolio would reduce, and therefore the return on capital would be better.  </p>

The Bank knew what it wanted to achieve with its insurance programme, and asked NRF to look at it not only in 2015, but also at renewal in January 2016, in order to ensure that appropriate cover was in place. The Bank was therefore taking a thoughtful and thorough approach to risk management and the role of insurance in that context.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that the same thoughtful and careful approach would have been taken if the Bank had received advice to the effect that the desired cover could or should not be obtained by way of an add-on to the cargo policy, but that it was advisable or necessary to seek it in the specialist credit market albeit at extra cost. There is nothing in the documents in 2015 and 2016 which suggests that the Bank was only interested in this cover if it were provided as a free add-on, or that the requirement to pay for the cover would have deterred the Bank from seeking it. The fact is that the Bank was not advised by Edge that there was any additional cost involved, and therefore the Bank had no reason to give consideration to the question of whether or not they should pay for it. Had that issue arisen, I have no doubt that the Bank would have decided to buy the cover. It made economic and commercial sense to do so, even at levels of 2%, for the reasons given by Mr. Stroink. It still allowed Icestar a healthy margin on Transmar and Euromar transactions, and would then provide an additional layer of protection as well as increasing the return on capital. Given that the Icestar business was an ancillary product to the Bank’s main business, or a cross-selling opportunity, there was no reason for the Bank to carry a risk of default which could be covered by insurance at a reasonable cost which would still leave a reasonable profit.  Mr. Stroink’s evidence (which I accept) was that insurance was a “necessary”, not simply a “nice to have” (as was put to him in cross-examination).  Having reviewed his written and oral evidence, I do not accept Edge’s submission that his evidence stopped short of saying that Icestar would have gone no further than merely “considering” cover for Transmar and Euromar. Nor do I accept that his evidence was vague, non-committal or fudged. </p>

Ms. Sabben-Clare made the fair point in that regard that Mr. Stroink had not really been challenged on that aspect of his evidence: cross-examination was essentially directed towards the question of whether alternative cover would have been taken out. The point is important because the potential need to obtain cover in the credit risk market would have arisen in June/ July 2015, which was a full year before the first default of Euromar. There was, therefore, a considerable amount of time to unwind transactions which only had a 90-day tenor. </p>

It is also consistent with his evidence that the Bank changed the Icestar portfolio after the problems arose with Euromar and Transmar. That evidence also explains why no significance is to be attached to the fact that, when underwriters declined to include the TPC in 2017, the Bank did not seek alternative credit insurance at that stage. </p>

It was clear from Mr. Stroink’s evidence as a whole that he was saying that he would have taken out cover for Transmar and Euromar. For example, his evidence specifically compared the Bank’s margin on those clients with the cost of insurance. The question arose, however, as to whether Mr. Stroink was saying that he would have taken out cover for all of these smaller clients, or only that he would have thought about it. In so far as he was saying that the cover would have been taken out, the question arose as to whether that was consistent with the Bank’s pleaded case that it would have sought cover for Euromar and Transmar alone.  </p>

The question which I am addressing is whether the Bank would, on the balance of probabilities, have acted so as to obtain the relevant benefit or avoid the risk. The relevant benefit or risk in that context related to the taking out of insurance which would have covered the risk of losses in relation to Transmar and Euromar. In terms of causation, I consider that the Bank’s case on causation succeeds whether or not the insurance sought would have covered Euromar and Transmar alone, or insurance for those companies as part of a package with some other companies. Either basis is sufficient to establish causation. I do not see why the Bank’s case on causation should fail because the evidence indicates that the Bank would have sought insurance for a wider group of companies than Transmar and Euromar alone, provided that (as the evidence clearly shows) the insurance sought would have included Transmar and Euromar.  </p>

There was nothing in that evidence which suggested that the chance of obtaining that insurance would diminish in the event that cover was sought for the wider category of companies referred to in Mr. Stroink’s first statement.

The overall premium therefore depended upon the volume of business being transacted. Mr. Hedley said that there would in effect be a discount for volume. He said that if you treated Euromar and Transmar as one customer, and added another five, the premium would not go up proportionally; but it may be three times as much. I take this evidence into account when assessing the quantification of loss.  </p>

The expert evidence also indicated that there were no relevant capacity constraints at the time: there was a soft market with underwriters looking for good business to write. There is nothing in Mr. Hedley’s report, or in any of the expert evidence, which suggests that there would have been any difficulty in obtaining cover for the wider portfolio, and in his oral evidence Mr. Hedley gave an estimate of what the additional premium would have been. Mr. Stroink’s first statement, in which he refers to the 6 companies where cover would have been “considered”, was served in February 2020, some time before the expert evidence was served. If a point were to be raised, along the lines that cover would only have been potentially available for the whole portfolio of smaller companies but that there was no real or substantial chance of such cover actually being available, I would have expected such a case to have been articulated in Mr. Hedley’s evidence.  </p>

The cover for Transmar and Euromar would, however, remain. It would also have been apparent, from the Bank’s attempt to obtain coverage for the portfolio, that there was no question of adverse selection. The exclusion of cover for one or more of the other companies would, on this hypothesis, have been the consequence of an underwriting decision not to insure those companies.  </p>

Ultimately, the existence of the second line of defence (the insurance) was regarded as necessary by the Bank. If the client was not willing to assist in ensuring that the terms of that insurance were complied with, by paying for quality certificates, then it would not have obtained the repo finance. </p>

The market was soft, with underwriters generally looking for business. The risk to be insured fell squarely within the bounds of standard trade credit insurance. Underwriters would have welcomed the Bank as an insured: ABN Amro was an internationally well regarded corporation whose business underwriters would have sought to secure. There were also other features of the risk that made it attractive. It had a short duration: each repo transaction was 3 months, at the end of which the Bank could decide whether or not to roll over. The security structure was good, because the Bank had legal title to the goods, not merely a security interest. The countries where the risks were situated were attractive. The most recent financial statements of Transmar showed a picture of increased income and profit. As Mr. Hedley said, the financial statements would justify secured repo-type borrowing, or a secured borrowing base facility. </p>

Mr. Hayter’s view was, in substance, that there would have been no difficulty in the Bank securing the coverage for Transmar and Euromar that it wanted. I consider that this evidence was more plausible, given the background summarised above, than the contrary view in so far as that was expressed by Mr. Hedley. It is supported by the fact that Mr. Hedley himself wrote a credit risk for Natixis, a financial institution, in respect of its exposure on Transmar’s revolving credit facility. He did this because, as he explained in his first report, Transmar was a well-established firm which had been in business since the 1980s and had never reported a loss. It was also one of the largest players in its particular field. Their figures, as Mr. Hedley said, looked good – albeit that later on it </p>

Mr. Hayter disagreed with that. He said that it was entirely normal for an insured to select a certain risk or group of risks from its portfolio to insure due to its/ their credit profile or other concerns. I accept that this is so, and I did not understand Mr. Hedley to dispute it as a general proposition. Indeed, he had himself written risks relating to a particular exposure to Transmar and Euromar as described above, and I did not understand those risks to have been part of a wider portfolio. Mr. Hedley also accepted in his report that there could be legitimate reasons for selecting an exposure to a particular counterparty for “singleton” insurance. The normality of “singleton” policies is illustrated by the fact that, as Mr. Hayter explained, there would have been a series of such policies, in respect of each insured, if the Bank had decided to insure its portfolio of smaller clients who were doing Icestar 2 and 3 transactions.</p>

For reasons already given, it is more likely than not that the Bank would have sought credit risk insurance for its portfolio of smaller Icestar 2 and 3 clients. There was therefore no intention adversely to select against credit risk insurers. But even if this were wrong, and a decision were taken to seek insurance for Transmar and Euromar alone, this would not in my view have led credit insurers to decline to write the risk (still less that there would have been no real or substantial chance of the risk being written). Rather, as Mr. Hedley’s evidence indicated, it might have led at most to a discussion as to why it was that coverage was sought for those companies alone. There could be legitimate grounds for doing so, and I have no doubt that a legitimate and satisfactory explanation could have been given. This is particularly so when one bears in mind – as Edge emphasised in their closing submissions in the context of their argument that the Bank would not have sought credit risk insurance at all in the counterfactual world – that: the Bank had a longstanding and robust relationship with the two companies; the companies had never defaulted on any repo deal with anybody, or committed any other kind of default; and the Bank was “comfortable with the credit risk” presented by Transmar and Euromar.  </p>

It is not possible or necessary to work out exactly what explanation the Bank would have given for seeking cover on these two companies alone, if that is what they had decided to do. The Bank never had to give an explanation, because they believed that they were covered under the TPC and therefore no question arose of needing to approach the credit risk insurance market. But if there had been a conversation where they were asked to explain why cover was sought for those companies alone, the Bank would either have provided an acceptable explanation, or would simply have said that they </p>

They submitted that credit risk underwriters would have been concerned that this indicated or would give rise to a concern that the counterparties could not repurchase the goods. Mr. Hayter’s evidence was that there were advantages to this way in which the business was being operated. The 90 days term for the repo transactions gave the obligor the opportunity to close out the deal and on-sell the goods, and also gave the Bank the opportunity not to renew. He said that underwriters would understand that rollovers were integral to the way in which Transmar/Euromar needed to finance its stock, and that the companies would buy back when one of their clients wanted to purchase the goods. That was how stock financing worked. Credit risk underwriters would not have been concerned, particularly bearing in mind the overall record of the companies and that the stock financing deals were, as Mr. Hayter said, “very much a small part of a larger relationship that ABN had with Transmar and there is no evidence that I have seen that would suggest that credit risk underwriters would have been concerned about Transmar in January 2016”.  </p>

His experience of working with hard and soft commodity traders and related entities was that rollovers are a common feature of their business. I accept this evidence, which is consistent with the Bank’s evidence. I am willing to accept that it is possible that some credit risk underwriters might have asked questions about the rollovers. Had they done so, as Mr. Hayter said, it would have been a matter of concern if the Bank could not give a good reason. Had the conversation happened, it seems to me likely that the Bank would have given an explanation which was consistent with the fact that the Bank itself was not concerned about the rollovers; for example, that they are a well-known feature of the business, and that there had never been any difficulties with either company. I was unpersuaded that this would have led to the risk being declined, particularly bearing in mind that there was a potential market of at least 60 underwriters in a soft market. At worst, from the Bank’s perspective, it might have led to terms which limited the extent of rollovers or the coverage for transactions which had been rolled over for a period which the underwriters considered to be too long. But even if that had happened, the Bank would still have obtained some insurance coverage. It would also have been in a position to shape its response to the absence or potential absence of coverage for any uninsured transactions, by closing out or not entering into transactions which would not be insured.  </p>

Mr. Hedley’s first report did not suggest that this was something which credit risk underwriters would be interested in, and the sample policies provided to the court did not contain terms which supported Mr. Hedley’s argument. I thought that Mr. Hedley’s evidence in this respect was rooted in hindsight. I was more impressed by Mr. Hayter’s point that the real focus of underwriters would be the risk of default, rather than the risk that the collateral would or would not prove adequate. The former was the real risk. A prudent credit risk underwriter would not expect or rely upon the collateral to provide salvation if the default risk went south.  </p>

Mr. Hayter said that 75-80% of all policies issued in the credit and political risks market are at 90% indemnity. This includes credit risks that are entirely unsecured and in many cases have a far worse credit and performance profile than Transmar and Euromar displayed in early 2016. Mr. Hedley’s justification for a 50% retention was, as Edge made clear in its opening submissions, based upon the appearance of adverse selection, rather than his points on rollovers. For reasons already explained, I do not consider that the adverse selection argument has any substance on the facts of the present case. In my view, the evaluation of the relevant chance should not take into account the possibility that cover would be below the standard 90% indemnity level. </p>

As far as the latter point is concerned, I do not consider that the evaluation of the relevant chance should take into account the possibility that the insurers would have imposed terms, and that the Bank would then have failed to comply with them. If the Bank had taken the step of paying substantial premium for trade credit cover which imposed certain obligations, then it is not difficult to conclude that a professional organisation such as the Bank would (as Mr. Stroink said) have complied with those terms. There is no point paying premium for cover and then declining to abide by the terms of the contract. </p>

In my view, however, it is overwhelmingly likely that a substantial and sufficient number of underwriters would not have imposed the terms proposed by Mr. Hedley. I have already described important features of that market in reaching the conclusion that the cover would have been available, in particular: the soft market conditions in 2015 and early 2016 with underwriters seeking good business; the large number of underwriting players; the attraction of the Bank as an insured; the apparently good financial position of Transmar, which was a substantial and well-established trader. All of these various factors would have meant that the chances of underwriters requiring or insisting on Mr. Hedley’s proposed terms were relatively small. It is also important in my view that the Bank has been able to call (in Mr. Hayter) a very experienced and competent credit risk underwriter, who was clearly of the genuine view that he personally would have written this risk and that many others would do so. This reinforces my conclusion that the chances of obtaining the relevant cover were very strong. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, an unusual feature of the present case is that the evaluation of the Bank’s chance does not simply depend upon the chance of obtaining an insurance policy with satisfactory terms. That is because if special terms were imposed, in particular terms which had the effect of excluding certain transactions from cover, the Bank would still be able to protect itself. It could in those circumstances have unwound uncovered transactions or declined to enter into new transactions which would not be covered. In her opening submissions, Ms. Sabben-Clare submitted that Mr. Hedley’s points on applicable restrictions are “sterile” even if they are correct. This was because if the Bank had been advised of limitations on or terms of cover, it would have closed out or not entered non-complying transactions. Thus, whether through insurance or alternative action, the Bank would have avoided the losses that it actually suffered. That case was supported by Mr. Stroink’s evidence. I did not consider that Edge had any, or at least any effective, answer to this point. </p>

If one treats Euromar and Transmar as one customer, there were four such other customers (rather than the 5 to whom Mr. Hedley referred in his evidence concerning the amount of premium increase in the event of coverage of more counterparties). I consider that the appropriate allowance for these factors would be to take the relevant figures for rating at 1.6%, which Mr. MacLeod worked out to be £ 594,382 plus USD 14,681. Those figures should then be doubled so as to reflect the premium that would have been payable in respect of the other companies within the portfolio.  </p>

Edge argued that the <span style="font-style:italic">FNCB </span>duty is concerned with whether the cover is sufficiently clear. If the cover is unclear and there is an unnecessary dispute over construction, then the broker may be liable for the costs of that dispute. But it did not follow that if underwriters took a (bad) point on construction, and then threw in every other conceivable point – giving rise to wide-ranging and expensive litigation – the broker should then pick up the whole tab for the insured’s irrecoverable costs. Aside from the costs of the construction dispute, the broker cannot be liable, because those costs were not caused by a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">FNCB</span> duty.

This is because the Bank accepts that any claim for damages would need to give credit for the substantial additional premium that would have been payable, and the retention that would have been applicable, if the Bank had not obtained cover from the cargo underwriters under the TPC, but instead had obtained it in the trade credit insurance market.

The construction argument was the point which RSA first took when the claim was declined, and it remained at the heart of their defence. At a comparatively late stage, it was supplemented by the other defences which I have rejected (avoidance, due diligence and sue and labour), but the construction argument remained a central point. When an insured, in consequence of a broker’s breach has to litigate on a central issue as to the construction of the policy, it is far from unusual for other possible defences to be added into the mix, including defences (such as rectification and estoppel in the present case) which are closely related to the construction issue. It is therefore not at all clear why Edge should not pay for all consequences of the Bank having become embroiled in litigation, even though the underwriters’ defences were ultimately not confined to issues of construction but where those issues remained of prime importance.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I have not previously considered the question of whether Edge would be liable to the Bank in the event that all of the underwriters’ defences failed, except for the argument concerning Clause 3 addressed in Section G above. That argument concerned the Bank’s allegedly reckless or negligent conduct concerning its failure to check the age and quality of the collateral. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">The Bank submitted that if the case had failed as a result of the Bank’s failure to check the age and quality of the collateral, then by definition the age of the cargo and the Bank’s procedures will be matters material to the risk. Edge failed to take any steps to elicit information material to the risk under the TPC from the Bank and to communicate that to underwriters. If it had done, underwriters would have been aware of the age of the cargo and the procedures followed and would either have declined the risk, in which case the Bank would have changed its procedures and/or discontinued these transactions, or would have had no avoidance defence (and would be estopped from suggesting that Icestar had failed to act with due diligence). They referred to Edge’s case, through Mr. Hedley’s evidence, that seeking cover in the credit market would inexorably have led to a discussion about the quality of the cargo and elicited the information that the Bank was not carrying out quality checks. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">I am doubtful as to whether any liability on the part of Edge would flow, in the manner described, from its failure to elicit information material to the risk and to provide it to cargo underwriters. Those underwriters have not relied, by way of defence, upon an allegation of non-disclosure concerning the age and quality of the collateral. Their avoidance case, in essence, is that they would not have written the policy if the TPC had been pointed out to them or the Bank’s intention and purpose in seeking that cover had been explained. They were not saying that they would in principle have written the policy, but would have declined to do so if they were told about the Bank’s approach to collateral. Moreover, I have held that the avoidance case fails because of the NAC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I consider that the Bank’s case is more powerful if the relevant focus is not upon what the cargo underwriters would have done, but how matters would have proceeded if Edge had gone to credit risk insurers. (The Bank’s argument, as summarised above, looks at both sets of insurers). On the basis of my earlier findings, this would have happened if the Bank had been correctly advised at the outset. For the reasons discussed in Section J3 above, an approach to the credit insurance market would, by one route or another, have resulted in the Bank being protected as to 90% of their losses. Any problems created by Clause 3 of the cargo policy would not therefore have arisen. I therefore conclude that the Bank would be entitled to recover against Edge if their claim against underwriters had failed as a result of Clause 3 of the policy. </p>
