	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimant, Property Alliance Group Limited (“PAG”), is a property investment and development business operating primarily in the North West of England with a portfolio including industrial sites, offices, retail and leisure property. The Defendant, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (“RBS”), was at all relevant times the principal provider of PAG’s commercial banking services. These proceedings arise primarily out of four interest rate derivative products (together referred to as the “Swaps”) which RBS sold to PAG between 2004 and 2008.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">PAG’s claims fall into three distinct categories. First, PAG claims that the Swaps were mis-sold to it by RBS, in that they did not provide a solution to, or protect PAG from, its interest rate risk. In fact, it is alleged that PAG was ultimately left in a worse financial position than if it had not entered the Swaps. PAG claims, therefore, that the Swaps cannot properly be said to have been hedging instruments, and claims for rescission and/or damages arising out of RBS’ representations and/or breaches of contract in connection with the sale of the Swaps (the “Swaps Claims”). Secondly, PAG claims damages for breach of contract arising out of its transfer from the RBS management team in Manchester to the RBS division in London known as the “Global Restructuring Group” or “GRG”, and its subsequent management within GRG (the “GRG Claims”). Thirdly, PAG claims for rescission of the Swaps and/or damages for misrepresentation (including fraudulent misrepresentation) and/or breach of contract arising out of RBS’ alleged participation in and knowledge of the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) rates by both RBS and other LIBOR panel banks (the “LIBOR Claims”).  I will deal with each category of claim in turn.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">PAG was formed by Mr David Russell in 2002 as an entity into which various of his existing property investment and development businesses were “hived up” and operated together. Mr Russell’s businesses had historically banked with National Westminster Bank plc (“NatWest”) at its Macclesfield branch. However, in or around September 2002 Mr Russell was informed that the Macclesfield branch was under pressure to transfer Mr Russell’s business banking affairs to RBS in Manchester, RBS having acquired NatWest several years earlier. Accordingly, PAG and its principal officers, namely Mr Russell, PAG’s managing director and majority shareholder, and Mr Ewan Wyse, PAG’s finance director, were introduced to RBS personnel from around September 2002. From late 2002, PAG’s banking affairs were gradually transferred over to RBS’ Manchester real estate team, and by May 2003 RBS had become PAG’s principal provider of commercial banking services. Mr Anthony Goldrick became PAG’s relationship manager until Mr Matthew Jones took over that role in January 2004. Messrs Russell and Wyse were also introduced to Mr Andy Mannix of RBS’s Treasury Division in 2003 and thereafter, to Mr Anthony Bescoby who was principally responsible for the sale of the Swaps.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Between October 2004 and April 2008, PAG entered into the four Swaps. The details of each of the Swaps are set out in an annexe to this judgment and the description of them below is intended only as an outline. The first Swap was entered into on 6 October 2004 in a notional amount of £10m. It had a maximum duration of ten years although it was cancellable at the behest of RBS on a quarterly basis after the first five years. It also had an upper cap of 6.25% and a lower cap of 5.25%. It is also described as having a floor of 5.25% and a lower floor of 3.30% (the “First Swap”). In October 2004, PAG had total facilities with RBS of around £32 million, comprising a development facility of approximately £13.5 million and an investment facility of approximately £18.5 million. Of that £32 million, approximately £20.6 million was actually drawn down.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">PAG entered into a second Swap on 25 September 2007 with an effective date of 28 September 2007 in the notional amount of £15m rising to £30m four years into the term. It operated at 5% and was cancellable by RBS annually in years five to ten (the “Second Swap”). The third Swap was transacted on 14 January 2008 with an effective date of the 16 January 2008 in the notional amount of £20m. It was for a potential period of five years but was cancellable by RBS after the end of year three. Its terms as to interest rates were complex and are set out in the Annexe to this judgment (the “Third Swap”). At the time it entered into the Third Swap, PAG had total facilities with RBS of around £85 million, comprising a development facility of £50 million and an investment facility of approximately £35 million. Of that £85 million, approximately £70.9 million was actually drawn down. The fourth and final Swap was entered into on 16 April 2008 in the notional amount of £15m. The applicable rate was 4.8% and it was potentially for a period of five years. However, RBS had a right to cancel the Swap quarterly from year two. If cancelled PAG was required to pay Base Rate and RBS 3m GBP LIBOR (the “Fourth Swap”).  </p>

GRG managed the PAG relationship from that time until PAG’s debt was refinanced in 2015. PAG alleges that it was mistreated by GRG, including on the basis that GRG engineered breaches of covenant in PAG’s facility agreements and threatened to exercise powers under those agreements to impose unreasonable terms on PAG under a refinancing facility entered into in 2011. </p>

Concurrently, PAG agreed refinancing terms with RBS and entered into a composite facility on 7 June 2011 (the “2011 Facility”). As with the previous facilities, the 2011 Facility included two distinct “development” and “investment” tranches. However, it also comprised a third tranche, in respect of the MTM break cost incurred by PAG on termination of the Swaps.  </p>

At times I found him to be evasive. He often failed to answer questions put to him and was prone to repeat a prepared view of events rather than give his evidence. On a number of occasions, in cross-examination he provided a new explanation for events which had not been mentioned in his witness statement, which was not evidenced in any way and which was not put to the RBS witnesses who allegedly provided the reassurances to which Mr Russell had referred. I also take into account his unabashed willingness to deceive the former RBS employees whose conversations he taped clandestinely and during which he stated that he was prepared to employ them which was untrue but which he considered to be a means to an end. I treat Mr Russell’s evidence therefore, with some caution and do not accept it unless it is corroborated by other reliable witness evidence and/or contemporary documentation. Unfortunately, some of Mr Wyse’s evidence was also unsatisfactory. He sought to repeat many of the first time explanations which Mr Russell had put forward during his cross-examination. He also provided some of his own which were neither in his witness statement, supported by contemporaneous documentation or put to the relevant RBS witness. As a result, I also treat Mr Wyse’s evidence with a degree of caution. I will refer to the quality of the evidence given by other “PAG witnesses” where relevant.  </p>

The note of that conversation taken by Mr Buxton records that his view was that at least 50% of the debt should be hedged preferably via a fixed rate, for 5 years but that “David Russell, the main principal, is a little less keen on hedging. Caps have been traded in the past via NMR”, NMR being a reference to N.M. Rothschilds &amp; Sons Ltd. Amongst other things, the note also records that it became clear that Mr Barlow was not familiar with the mechanics of hedging instruments and that Mr Buxton gave him a brief presentation on swaps, collars and caps which he appreciated.   </p>

Following the meeting, Rathbones confirmed their ability to provide advice on hedging strategy and set out their charges for providing an advisory service in a letter dated 12 February 2002. They noted that Mr Russell’s group of companies had around £30m of debt with a number of banks including RBS and Allied Irish Bank (“AIB”) but that none of it was hedged and the group “has been considering putting a 5 year swap into place to cover a proportion of the loans.” In that context, it was noted that: “we also understand that David Russell and Paul Wardle are of the opinion that the current level of circa 5.50% is high in comparison with prevailing short term rates.” Rathbones went on to advise against a “vanilla” swap in all the circumstances and offered to produce a report. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In cross-examination, Mr Russell dismissed Mr Barlow as a bookkeeper and stated that he himself was not interested in hedging at the time and did not understand it. He said that he encouraged his staff to explore ideas of their own and the meeting with Rathbones must have been Mr Barlow’s idea and arranged merely as a matter of respect and to promote networking. He added that he did not want to enter into any derivatives at the time. Despite the reference in Rathbones’ letter and Mr Buxton’s note to his views on rates, he maintained that he had not been looking at rates and did not want to enter into a swap.  He also stated that the advice against a “vanilla” swap contained in Rathbones’ letter had not been discussed with him. In the light of the content of Mr Buxton’s note and Rathbones’ letter, I am unable to accept Mr Russell’s evidence that there had been no discussion of swaps at this stage and that he had not expressed any views about interest rates, nor I am able to accept his evidence that Mr Barlow and his staff in general, pursued their own ideas without reference to him. It seems to me that on the balance of probabilities that in the light of the content of the letter and the note, it is more likely than not that Mr Russell had expressed such views about rates and had considered swaps at this stage.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is borne out in part by the fact that Mr Wyse attended a meeting with Rathbones on 11 September 2002, at which the development of a hedging strategy by the Russell Group companies was discussed. In their letter addressed to Mr Barlow at PAG of the following day, Rathbones explained how PAG might start to develop a hedging strategy and how Rathbones could assist in doing so by producing a report, addressing both “fixing” and more flexible strategies. Reference was also made to avoiding “unacceptable termination costs”. Mr Wyse’s evidence was that hedging strategy was discussed at the meeting. This is consistent with his contemporaneous note. However, despite having been noted by Mr Wyse as having attended, in cross-examination, Mr Russell did not accept that he was at the meeting. He maintained that he had no experience or knowledge of interest rate hedging products at this time nor when he and Mr Wyse attended a meeting on 24 September 2002 with Mr Andy Mannix from RBS’s Financial Markets’ division and Mr Schofield who was the relationship manager for Mr Russell’s businesses at NatWest in Macclesfield. Mr Russell also stated in cross-examination that although he trusted Mr Wyse he was not “high powered” and did a good job “to a level” but “got out of his depth.” In my judgment, given Mr Wyse’s note, it is more likely than not that Mr Russell attended the meeting at Rathbones with Mr Wyse on 11 September 2002 and therefore, had at least some knowledge of interest rate hedging products at that time. Furthermore, in the light of Mr Wyse’s level of involvement in arranging the Swaps and the detail contained in his notes, to which I shall refer below, I am not able to accept Mr Russell’s attempt to downgrade Mr Wyse’s contribution.  </p>

Mr Wyse’s notes of this meeting cover a very wide range of different alternative instruments which could be used to hedge, including “swaps”, “caps” and “collars”. Reference is also made to cancellable trades where RBS would have the option to cancel, value collars, where in addition to a cap and a floor, if the rate fell below the floor a higher fixed rate would be payable and trigger swaps which involved a fixed rate for a fixed period but if rates exceeded the “trigger”, a higher interest rate would apply. Mr Wyse says that it was a note taking exercise for him because he had not come across these types of product before and that, in fact, he had no experience of hedging at all. I accept Mr Wyse’s evidence that the range of products were new to him and that he was recording their features. However, in the light of his meeting with Rathbones earlier in September 2002 to which I have referred, I am unable to accept his evidence that he had no knowledge of hedging at all.  </p>

Last, it contained a number of bullet points under the heading “Please note:” in which it was explained amongst other things that hedging was separate from the underlying debt, that early repayment of the debt would not automatically cancel the hedging contract and that early surrender might involve exit costs or benefits which were dependent upon prevailing market conditions at the time of surrender.

However, he denied that the reference to “10 caplets and 20 fixings” was misleading on the basis that the instrument would only continue for a second term of 5 years at RBS’ option. He did accept, however, that the reference to protecting a worst case under “Advantages” was only true if there were a second term of 5 years. In addition, he accepted that the presentation makes no reference to MTM although he was able to calculate it within minutes whereas PAG did not possess the sophisticated software necessary for the task.

In crossexamination, Mr Bescoby stated that he considered the product suitable because it provided protection for the first 5 years on a basis which was better than “vanilla” 5 year products and avoided a premium. He accepted that PAG would be paying by taking the risk that RBS would cancel the instrument if rates were above the collar in the second 5 year term, leaving PAG unhedged, or would continue the instrument if rates were low, in which case, PAG would only be able to break the agreement at a cost, the scale of which was not mentioned. Mr Russell stated that despite Mr Wyse’s note that the instrument was “only” callable by RBS, he believed that it would only be called in the second five year period in partnership with PAG and that if rates dropped they would be able to restructure the arrangements. </p>

Contemporaneous internal RBS documentation setting out a review of PAG’s position, recorded that the 100% hedging requirement on the investment borrowing would require an increase in the hedging line (in the sense of an internal credit facility) from £750,000 to £2.25m.

This is all the more so in the light of the advice paper dated 16 September 2004 which was produced by Rathbones setting out their recommendations including that PAG should increase its hedging by £10 million and should cancel the 2003 Collar and implement two £10 million tranches of hedging, in the form of a 3-year swap with a 3-year embedded floor and a 5-year swap with a 3-year embedded floor (the “Rathbones 2004 Paper”) and the fact that Mr Russell utilised it at a meeting with RBS on 1 October 2004.    </p>

Mr Bescoby had sent an email to Mr Wyse “refreshing” the idea and explained that he had managed to reduce the floor below 4.00%. The trade was based upon a £14m notional and a 10 year term subject to RBS’s right to cancel. The rate structure was such that PAG’s “best case” rate was just above 3.90% and its “worst case” rate of 6.25%. Mr Bescoby stated that the trade was for 10 years but was cancellable by RBS after 5 years and quarterly thereafter, so that the “company has guaranteed protection for 5 years although this could run for 10 years”. He also added: “The key question is- do you think that 3 month LIBOR will fix outside of the 6.24%-3.91% range in the next 5/10 years?” In cross-examination, Mr Bescoby accepted that PAG would be locked into such a structure potentially for ten years at the rates set out and that he had not told them about the MTM at the outset, the potential scale of, the break costs or the extent of the hedging credit line which had been put in place. Nevertheless, he considered that matters were clearly set out and that had he told PAG about the extent of the credit line, they would still have gone ahead.   </p>

Although Mr Bescoby had no recollection of the phrase or of having used it and denied having sought to re-assure PAG, both Mr Wyse and Mr Russell stated that the cancellation rights were not an issue because it was understood that hedging would be re-visited in five years, that re-structuring would be negotiated and that this was against a background of an expectation by all that PAG’s borrowing would increase. However, Mr Russell went further to say that he understood that the derivative would only be cancelled in the joint interests of PAG and RBS to be decided by him and Mr Goldrick and that he would not have entered the trade if the cancellation rights had been solely vested in RBS. It seems to me that the “not an issue” note together with the tick is consistent with the evidence of both Mr Russell and Mr Wyse that Mr Russell was not concerned about the prospect of cancellation because he believed that there would be restructuring in the light of increased borrowing in the future. There is no documentary or other evidence to corroborate Mr Russell’s further evidence that the derivative would only be cancelled in the joint interests of PAG and RBS and I am unable to accept his evidence in that regard.  </p>

It also identified considerations relevant to PAG’s decision whether to enter into the trade, including that if 3-month GBP LIBOR fell below the floor of 3.30%, PAG would pay 5.25% for that quarter. In addition, it contained a graph showing projected LIBOR rates over the 10 year term under which it was stated that it was forecast that LIBOR would remain within the collar rates for the full term but that it could not be guaranteed.

Mr Jones confirmed that it would as the investment loans at that stage totalled £20 million, PAG having already hedged £10m with RBS.

The first is a question of value for money. The complexity of the structure makes accurately assessing its value extremely difficult as it involves the purchase from and sale to RBS of a number of options. In addition the structure is skewed in the favour of the bank as the options purchased by the Group are done so on the offered side of the market, while those sold by the Group are on the bid side of the market. As this structure has been 'generated' by the treasury it also eliminated the possibility of entering into a competitive pricing situation between RBS and Allied Irish to ensure best pricing of the hedging.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">The floor component of the structure requires the Group to speculate on the movement of floating rates, the Group having to take the view that floating rates will remain above 3.30% for the full 10 year term of the structure, as RBS will not cancel it in a low rate environment. Should the floor be 'exercised' the additional cost of at least 1.95% would be unpleasant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">The structure only provides protection for 5 years. The bank having the option to cancel the structure at any point over the final 5 years poses a problem when it comes to compiling a future hedging strategy as it is impossible to determine whether the structure would be in place or not. Furthermore, the protection will disappear if rates rise, a situation where it would be most needed. </p>

Normally it is possible to novate hedging from one lender to another, eliminating the need to cancel and re-implement hedging and so avoiding the bid/offer spread. However the opaque nature of the structure makes novation almost impossible, the only alternative being to cancel. The costs associated with cancellation are again skewed in the favour of the bank as any value to the Group is reduced being calculated of the bid side of the market, while that due to the bank is inflated being calculated on the offer side. </p>

Mr Bescoby suggested that PAG consider some different structures, including a cancellable dual rate swap, which he explained to Mr Wyse, including the fact that it was only guaranteed for the period prior to the cancellation right being exercisable.

During the telephone call Mr Bescoby explained that a significant credit line would be needed for such a trade and that there was a chance that Mr Jones might wish to take that exposure into account for the purposes of loan-to-value (“LTV”) calculations. On 21 May 2007, Mr Wyse emailed E&amp;Y, reporting back on his conversation with Mr Bescoby and referred to the need for RBS to calculate a contingent liability figure. Thereafter, on 22 May 2007 he provided PAG with a detailed term sheet explaining how the cross-currency swap would work and a presentation. The presentation included reference to the credit line needed for the swap and stated: </p>

It did not provide any indication of the possible extent of such costs or any modelling of break costs in different interest rate scenarios. Mr Wyse forwarded the Presentation to E&amp;Y, and referred expressly to the contingent liability which RBS needed to factor in. That afternoon, Mr Bescoby also spoke to Mr Wyse. His email to Mr Jones in which he refers to the conversation is consistent with credit lines having been discussed. In particular, Mr Bescoby wrote that Mr Wyse had been “slightly taken aback” by the size of the credit line necessary for the currency swaps but that he had explained. Mr Bescoby added: “I think he understands(!)” However, in cross-examination, Mr Wyse said that he did not understand the credit line point and would not have thought it affected PAG’s position with the bank. </p>

Yet further discussions took place with Mr Bescoby on 8 June 2007 which ended in Mr Wyse stating that further discussion with E&amp;Y would be necessary after which he would revert back. </p>

Mr Bescoby proceeded to discuss a possible trade, in the form of a complex extendible value collar plus a cap, which he followed up with an email later that day in which he mentioned breaking one of the existing trades, with reference to payment being made by RBS to PAG. The email also included quotes for 5-year and 10-year swaps and premiums for 5-year and 10-year caps at 7.00%.

He then sought to put clients in touch with hedging experts/advisers, such as Rathbones.  Although he stated that he would not describe himself as a specialist, he was willing to express a view on hedging and in his initial letter to PAG he stated that one of the services he was offering was “Finance advice to include interest rate hedging advice where appropriate”. His CV which was attached, included reference to having “…advised on business strategy, interest rate management, and financial structures” since 1995.

However, Mr Wyse’s evidence was that the reference to hedging in the description of Mr Malin’s role was “a simple error”. However, he accepted in cross-examination that it “wasn’t necessarily an error”, but that Mr Malin “didn’t turn out to be the person that we wanted . .” Mr Russell also stated in cross-examination that it soon became clear that Mr Malin “did not have a clue about hedging”. However, in the light of Mr Malin’s heavy involvement in PAG’s hedging strategy referred to below and his explanation of his experience, I am unable to accept Mr Russell’s estimation of Mr Malin which appears to be another example of his attempting to downplay the assistance received by PAG in relation to hedging generally.

Mr Bescoby spoke to Mr Wyse, who expressed concerns about the proposed extendible value collar on the grounds that PAG feared that the floor would be breached (and that PAG would therefore have to pay the higher fixed rate). Mr Bescoby and Mr Wyse then discussed expectations as to 3M GBP LIBOR, with Mr Bescoby explaining that whilst there could be no guarantees, market expectations were that 3M GBP LIBOR would not fall below 5.25% (when compared to a floor of 4.75%). To illustrate current expectations, Mr Bescoby then sent an email attaching a spreadsheet with the current forward curve as well as swap and cap pricing. Following this conversation Mr Wyse sought further advice from Mr Malin who then telephoned Mr Bescoby himself on 20 July 2007. Mr Bescoby’s note of the telephone call records amongst other things that: “Richard Malin now acting as advisor – he has taken a view on the structure we have shown – he hates it!”. The note also records that Mr Malin felt that the market view reflected in the forward curve was too pessimistic and that 3M GBP LIBOR might well fall below 4.75% over the next 10 years and that he considered the extendible collar to be too risky and could be costly if rates fell. Mr Malin confirmed in cross-examination that those were his personal views but that he was not an expert and that he was only putting forward to PAG what was on offer and stating what he would do.  </p>

Mr Wyse’s note of the meeting records that there was discussion of a callable structure which RBS could extend to a full 10 year term. Mr Wyse also accepted that he had indicated that Mr Russell had a “target rate” of 5.00% in mind and asked Mr Bescoby whether he could offer a trade at that level. Mr Russell stated in cross-examination that he regarded 5% as a fair rate. However, he accepted that he had no recollection of the meeting. In any event on 20 September 2007, Mr Bescoby sent an email to Mr Wyse and Mr Malin headed “structured hedging idea to achieve 5%!”. In the body of the email Mr Bescoby explained that following the meeting he had been looking at ways to “achieve David’s target swap rate of 5%” and added that “by putting a twist on the extendable structures  ... discussed” he had come up with such a structure which he set out. The terms of the proposed trade were that: it would commence on 30 September 2007 in relation to a notional sum of £10 million; PAG would pay 5.00% fixed and receive 3M GBP LIBOR; and after four years on 30 September 2011 RBS would have the right to extend the trade for a further 12 months on a notional of £20 million and at yearly intervals thereafter, until 30 September 2017.  In the email the advantages of the structure were highlighted when compared to current market rates, with 3-month LIBOR at 6.55%, 4-year swaps at 5.75% and 10-year swaps at 5.49%. It was also noted that the contract involved the risk that PAG could pay 5.00% on £20 million until September 2017, and that if RBS did not extend the contract, PAG would return to a floating rate.  </p>

Mr Russell added that his understanding was that the arrangements with RBS would be restructured and that he never thought that the break costs would be in the region of £2m. In cross-examination, Mr Bescoby said that he could not recall any discussion about restructuring in PAG’s favour. He also stated that he had only discussed structured products because the pricing for vanilla swaps had already been provided and did not achieve the 5% rate which Mr Russell required and about which he had strong views. He also accepted that he had neither informed PAG of the possible scale of any potential break cost or the mark to market cost of the contract. Nor did he inform PAG of the extent of the credit line put in place in the bank’s internal records in relation to the potential trade. It was for £2.5 million.

He said that it was a way of showing faith in RBS and keeping “aligned.” Mr Russell’s instructions to trade on that basis when the rate dropped back to 5% was communicated in an email to Mr Bescoby from Mr Wyse of 21 September 2007 which was also copied to Mr Malin who replied: “understood and agreed”. </p>

The Second Swap was on the terms set out in the Annexe to this judgment. RBS sent PAG a Post Transaction Acknowledgment (the PTA) the same day. It was signed by Mr Wyse and returned that day. A formal confirmation of the Second Swap was signed by Mr Russell and faxed back to RBS on 5 November 2007. The PTA contained notes including the following:  </p>

Mr Malin drew attention to the “conditionality” of the terms and the MTM, pointing out that as a result, it would not have appealed to his former employers.

He added that there was some comfort in the fact that RBS was pushing the relationship with PAG forward and that the risk was one which was worth running. Mr Bescoby’s evidence in cross-examination was that he considered the Second Swap to be a hedge for the first four years during which it would reduce interest rate risk. He added that PAG was looking for protection for the first four years at rates which were below those in the market, that the remainder of the contract was a quid pro quo and that he had highlighted the risks.  </p>

Mr Wyse sent the email on to Mr Malin who responded saying that compared to 3M GBP LIBOR these were “attractive rates” and recommended the first option, before cautioning that RBS were forecasting a Base Rate reduction the following week so it might be worth holding off, or putting in a firm order at 4.85% for the first option or 4.7%/4.9% for the second.

The transcript of the conversation records Mr Wyse as responding: “Fair enough. I think we’re just looking on a very short-term basis”. It also records that Mr Bescoby mentioned that it would be necessary to “review the hedging line again” and stating that it was “fantastic” and “a great trade”. In cross-examination, Mr Wyse accepted that the conversation was concerned with the trades in which he was interested but stated that he viewed the credit line merely as a bank issue which he did not understand. Mr Bescoby stated that it was his personal view that the proposed trade was attractive in comparison with market rates.

The email described the trade (which was for 10 years but with RBS having a right to cancel after 2 years and quarterly thereafter), with an initial notional of £10 million for two years, then £20 million for the remaining 8 years (subject to calls); noted the fact that the proposed trade had a “2 year guaranteed period” and could therefore be included for the purposes of calculating interest rate covenants; noted that total hedging with RBS if implemented could be a maximum of £60 million (i.e. up to £20 million for that trade, plus £10 million on the First Swap and up to £30 million on the Second Swap). The considerations listed included: “If not called you could be paying 4.27% on £20m (how far do you think 3[M] rates will fall)”. Mr Bescoby also stated that once Mr Wyse had spoken to Mr Russell he should let Mr Bescoby know as he would need to “run [the trade] past credit.” Mr Wyse immediately forwarded the email to Mr Malin, asking for his thoughts and added “AIB came back with<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>4.35% against the 4.45% deal from HSBC<span style="font-style:italic">”</span>. Later in the day, Mr Wyse responded saying “this seems to be the favourite now. What would the cap be<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>if the floor was 3.75%?”. He sent the response on to Mr Malin. In fact, Mr Russell decided not to go ahead.   </p>

Mr Wyse confirmed that the trade was the same as that discussed previously but for a 3.9% rather than a 4% floor which Mr Bescoby confirmed. Mr Wyse then forwarded the email to Mr Malin, discussed the matter with Mr Russell and then emailed Mr Bescoby confirming that PAG wished to proceed with the trade for £20 million, with a cap at 5.25% and a floor at 3.90% and with the other terms as set out in the email of 11 January and the Third Swap was entered into. Its precise terms are set out in Annexe to this judgment. A Post Transaction Acknowledgment was sent the same day and subsequently signed by Mr Russell.

At the meeting of the credit committee on 27 February 2008 Mr Jones explained that he was seeking: (a) a £1.3 million increase in the investment facility (in order to accommodate transfers from the development facility), plus a 5-year renewal of the facility (including 2 year capital repayment holiday); (b) a reduction in the development facility from £50 million to £36 million (to remove existing headroom – i.e. undrawn facility); and (c) to hold the LTV covenant at 75% (rather than ratcheting down to 70%), plus an ICR covenant at 1.25. The committee asked whether Mr Jones was happy with the recommendation of credit that there be a rolling property revaluation programme, to bring the valuations up to date. Mr Jones said he had agreed this with credit, with 20% of properties being revalued each year. The committee asked where surplus cash was going and why this cash was not being used to pay down some of the facilities with RBS. Whilst Mr Goldrick explained that surplus cash tended to be reinvested, the committee advised that it had concerns about PAG incurring significant costs on its own private jet and very high entertainment costs when PAG had a very high LTV, especially given that market conditions (and the commercial property market in particular) were getting tougher. The committee stated their view that the 1% margin over Base Rate for the development facility was “off market” (i.e. lower than the market) and suggested the relationship team look to increase this in the future, and to move £30 million of the development loan over to LIBOR (rather than Base Rate). The committee expressed the view that PAG needed close supervision and that further breaches of covenant might well trigger the need for a renegotiation. </p>

Amongst other things he mentioned the fact that 20% of the properties would need to be revalued each year and that £30 million of the development loan would be moved to LIBOR. In relation to the latter, Mr Wyse expressed concern and Mr Jones said that he could speak to Mr Bescoby about possible ways in which hedging might be used to ameliorate the change. A telephone discussion ensued that day between Mr Wyse and Mr Bescoby during which Mr Wyse described market conditions as “a bit strange…five year rates seem to be up and down at the moment” and having stated that he was not looking for anything specific, noted that PAG’s 2003 Swap with AIB was about to expire and that he wondered “where things are up to”.  </p>

Mr Bescoby explained that the trade set out above would eliminate the risk of paying floating LIBOR for 6 months but that if the swap were called by RBS PAG would revert to paying LIBOR which might still be higher than Base Rate. He suggested therefore, that PAG consider a variation on the callable swap which would allow it to continue to pay Base Rate in such a situation. The terms of the trade proposed were: a 5 year term; PAG pays 4.75% guaranteed for the first 12 months; PAG receives 3M GBP LIBOR; after 12 months, and quarterly thereafter, RBS has the right to cancel the swap; and if RBS cancels the swap RBS pays 3 month LIBOR and PAG pays RBS average Base Rate for the remainder of the life of the trade. Mr Bescoby further explained that the effect of this second proposed trade would be that PAG would receive 3M GBP LIBOR throughout thereby negating its exposure to 3M GBP LIBOR under its loans and would either have to pay 4.75% fixed (if not cancelled by RBS) or (if cancelled) average Base Rate. He stated that the “<span style="font-style:italic">cost</span>” of that additional feature was reflected in the 4.75% payable (which was higher than the rate quoted for the first callable swap quoted in his email). Mr Bescoby accepted in crossexamination that this was the first time that RBS had devised a product of this kind to ameliorate the effect of having to move borrowing to the LIBOR rate and that as far as he was aware only PAG took it up.  </p>

There are now however additional cost implications to the Bank if funding is held on Base Rate, where the related position within the Bank’s capital requirements are held in Libor. Therefore for facilities where there is a significant element of Base rate related debt, there would need to be a natural consequence to the margin charged to take account of this.” </p>

The re-negotiation took place over a number of months and included an informal valuation of PAG’s properties carried out by a specialist member of RBS staff. PAG’s portfolio was valued at £79.7m. On 21 April 2009, Mr Russell wrote to Mr Jones criticising the valuation suggesting that it ought to be in the order of £83m.  PAG went before the RBS Watch Committee on 8 May 2009, Mr Jones having prepared a paper in which the reason for appearance was noted as “Forecast LTV covenant breach”.  Under the heading “Risk Analysis” he also noted: “Leverage – overarching test at 73% against 75% covenant, although against mainly historic values. PFG desktop exercise undertaken which views this could have moved out to 90% (customer estimates 80%). Under “Bank Strategy” he also noted:  “… Customer reluctant to formally re-value assets in current market, thereby resetting loan over a term against reduced values. . . Retaining PFG’s values for the “development” assets, although agreeing to “meet the customer half way” on the Investment Assets at an 8% yield, produces an overall LTV position of 80%, and we therefore propose a 12/18 month facility of £66.7m.” Very shortly afterwards, on 12 May 2009, it was agreed that the existing lending facility be extended to the end of May 2009.   </p>

D Meppem explained that the client’s concern was the position could come out being much worse than expected, and he went on to explain the reasoning behind this. With difficult market conditions now being seen, there would be few appropriate comparables available and those transactions that were being seen in the market would tend to be forced sales, and that resulted in values being impacted. In addition, some valuers would use these poor market driven values as a basis for revaluing the PAG assets, whereas other valuers would take a longer term market view in providing fresh valuations. In PFG’s eyes, PAG’s were good assets which would bear up and provide strong values, as and when the market recovered. Given the reasons outlined, there was therefore comfort with not obtaining new valuations at this stage. </p>

Mr Russell described it as the worst day of his business life and added that he could not overstate the shock and devastation.

In any event, as Mr Wyse accepted in cross-examination, he had already been advised in January 2009 that the break cost for two of the Swaps would be almost £3 million and PAG had been advised by Rathbones in August 2009 that it would cost in the region of £9 million to break all four Swaps.

Reference was made in the paper to PAG closing out some of the hedging at a cost of £1.065 million and £1.33m respectively, whilst noting that the Global Banking and Markets division of RBS (for which Mr Bescoby worked) would need to discuss with Credit whether this was acceptable and that “any re-structure would need to be executed within existing hedging lines”. The paper (which included a chart of the LIBOR yield curve showing swap rates) noted that the proposed strategy suited a view that LIBOR would not increase as much as the implied forward levels were suggesting, and stated that: “The company needs to consider its views on the future path of interest rates before making a decision on whether to restructure using this method.”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Mr Wyse responded to Mr Bescoby on 5 February 2010 noting that PAG’s assessment was that interest rates were going to rise to over 4% within two years and that as a result, PAG had decided to leave hedging for a while. However, the following day Mr Wyse emailed Mr Zwicky-Ross attaching a completion statement for one of PAG’s properties at Chorley and suggested once more the possibility of using part of the proceeds of sale to meet the break costs of one of the Swaps. The Chorley issue was discussed again during a teleconference on 9 March 2010 in which Mr Goldrick participated. Mr Wyse’s note records the requirement for PAG to “Send AIB facility to RBS” and, in relation to the proceeds of the Chorley property, records PAG retaining £500,000 “re tax &amp; fees”, applying the majority of the remainder “say £2.5m” against its debt, but retaining a “Balance of approx £1m to be offset against hedging”. Further on 10 March 2010 Mr Bescoby sent Mr Wyse updated break costs for the Swaps which totalled in the region of £8m. Mr Wyse responded stating merely that he noted that the costs had increased substantially since they had met in January and that it was no doubt down to market rates.  </p>

He also asked for Rathbones' advice as to how to utilise £1,182,000 against hedging, including which swaps to break or whether to keep the money on deposit and see if break costs reduced. On 16 March 2010 Rathbones sent a “proposal letter” addressed to Mr Russell in which PAG’s position was described as “very fully hedged” and likely to become over-hedged at high cost at a time when floating rates had plummeted. It was suggested that RBS be persuaded to extend their hedging line by £2.5 million. It was noted that “pressure could<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>be brought to bear” by a number of techniques including making allegations of mis-selling based on the sale of derivatives without third party advice which would be <span style="font-style:italic">“</span>impossible to prove<span style="font-style:italic">”</span> but would “prove very embarrassing”. On 16 April 2010, Mr Wyse emailed Rathbones to confirm that it intended to proceed with their proposal. At this time, a draft letter was also produced for Mr Russell to send to HSBC dated 21 April 2010. It referred to alignment between PAG’s interests and that of the bank and contained complaints about the derivatives taken out with HSBC on its advice. In crossexamination, Mr Russell accepted that this had arisen during restructuring discussions and that ultimately HSBC agreed to write off their hedge.   </p>

A further email also of 28 April 2010 from Philip Holland to Alan Cocking states: “Things not as simple as portrayed to GRG” upon which Mr McCoy was unable to shed any light. Neither Mr Holland nor Mr Cocking gave evidence.   </p>

In particular, on 1 June 2010 Mr Wyse emailed Mr Walsh asking if he could further amend the letter by including an additional sentence in relation to the cost of removing RBS’s right to extend the Third Swap beyond January 2011, which read: “This appears quite expensive and perhaps an area RBS may want to resolve internally”. He also asked Mr Walsh why the cost of removing RBS’s option to extend the Third Swap was so expensive, particularly when compared with the cost of cancelling the bank’s option to increase the notional of the Second Swap. In his response, Mr Walsh explained that: “In a low rate environment the option to extend a hedge is in the money and therefore more expensive, whereas an option to cancel the hedge is out of the money and unlikely to happen resulting in the lower cost to buy it back.”  </p>

Mr Whatham explained that RBS had hedged its own position under the Swaps in the market, such that terminating the Swaps at zero cost to PAG would result in its bearing a loss of approximately £9 million. Mr Whatham stated that RBS was not prepared to do this as PAG had willingly entered into the Swaps.

Mr Rathbone discussed the Swaps and stated that they were not appropriate for PAG, making particular reference to RBS’ cancellation rights. Mr Didier’s note records that Mr Whatham noted that vanilla swaps with the same notional amounts would also have had an MTM cost at that point, such that PAG’s concern appeared to relate to the <span style="font-style:italic">additional</span> MTM created by the cancellation rights versus a vanilla swap, and that Mr Priest and Rathbone confirmed this was so.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">After further meetings in January, a yet further meeting was scheduled for 16 February 2011 at which RBS proposed an approach to the negotiations using a “Mid Point Scenario”, whereby the terms proposed to PAG would fall between: (1) the “market-facing” terms upon which RBS would have entered into the same facility with a new customer, and (2) the terms proposed by PAG in its January 2011 proposal. A spreadsheet was put forward setting out its view of (1) “market terms”; (2) PAG’s proposal from January 2011; and (3) RBS’s proposal in the form of the “mid point”. Mr Wyse’s note in preparation for that meeting makes reference to “no revaluations” and his evidence was that PAG was reassured that there would only be a revaluation of PAG’s property portfolio if the outcome was likely to be positive which Mr Didier refuted in cross-examination.  He also stated that he considered that PAG would not pursue its Swaps complaint if the re-structuring of the debt took place.  </p>

The good news is that they accepted that there is merit in our arguments on the derivatives at least from a moral perspective and that the bank is willing to meet us part way therefore. The way they have done so is to compare the proposal we made in January to where a new 3 year facility for Alliance would be today and to pick a point between these two. The bottom line is that the Bank is offering an incentive of £2.648 million and we in the meeting said we would settle at £3.3 million. . .” </p>

He also accepted that an element of the proposals being made may have been to settle potential litigation in relation to the Swaps. Mr Didier however, stated that he had not stated that there was merit in PAG’s arguments in relation to derivatives and considered them solely to be a negotiating ploy. However, he believed that the terms on offer were better than those available in the market and believed that PAG would not progress their derivatives claims. The following day, 17 February 2011, Mr Didier sent an email which attached an amended version of the “mid-point analysis”, showing the updated RBS proposal. This crossed with a further proposal contained in a further spreadsheet, sent by Mr Priest both of which were discussed at a further meeting on 18 February 2011.  </p>

He reiterated that in his view once the re-financing was agreed PAG would have preserved its options and would “live to fight another day.” He added that there was nothing which indicated that it was a full and final settlement, that PAG was not able to agree the five year period for funding which it had required and that although the liability on the Swaps was crystallised at £8.2m none of that sum was borne by RBS.

Mr Northcott responded on 12 December 2012 confirming Credit approval of the annual review but stating:  </p>

Richard Moor of Knight Frank emailed on 14 February 2013 Mr Antoci to “confirm” his valuation of the two properties against which the first (and larger) of the Settlement Trust Loans (the No. 1 Loan) was secured. The total value for the two properties was £900,000, which as against a loan of £1,150,133 gave an LTV of 128%, as Mr Antoci confirmed to Mr Thomson. Thereafter, a meeting took place the following day (15 February 2013) at which Mr Thomson explained that PAG could not be returned to the frontline until the Settlement Trust Loans were resolved, and that the No. 1 Loan could not be renewed given the high LTV. On 22 February 2013 Mr Russell wrote to Mr Thomson complaining about the refinancing options for the No. 1 Loan presented at the meeting and GRG’s stance on PAG’s return to the frontline, as well as disputing Knight Frank’s valuations.

Mr Thomson also noted that (1) RBS had a right to call for a revaluation under the 2011 Facility; and (2) at the last revaluation (in 2010), the LTV was 79.5% (against a covenant of 80%) and that since then rents had dropped from £6 million to £5.5 million.

He also stated that due to the swap mis-selling complaint, RBS had offered better terms for the 2011 Facility. However, Mr Thomson pointed to the presence of the revaluation clause in the 2011 Facility.

The following morning, he emailed a spreadsheet entitled “Final Values-2013 (with<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>comments)” to Mr Wyse but not to RBS. The spreadsheet showed a total value for the properties of £82,240,000. Once the further four valuations were available, a spreadsheet produced by RBS recorded the total value of PAG’s portfolio at £81,915,000 resulting in an LTV of 81.91%, on the basis of a loan balance of £67,098,862. Mr Innocent having provided comments on the Lambert Smith Hampton draft valuations, on 5 November 2013 Mr Sefton of RBS emailed Mr Davies with queries in respect of nine properties. Having responded to the queries, Mr Davies reaffirmed his opinion on seven of the nine properties but reduced his value on two. RBS forwarded further queries about a particular property at Freetrade Exchange. On 28 November 2013 Lambert Smith Hampton issued its final valuation report which was sent to PAG on 5 December 2013. It contained a total market value for the portfolio of £81,680,000. Thereafter, on 20 December 2013 Mr Thomson sent PAG a Reservation of Rights letter in respect of the breach of PAG’s LTV covenant under the 2011 Facility. After some confusion, a hard copy having been sent out which included a final figure of £81,915,000, on 3 January 2014 Lambert Smith Hampton sent a letter formally confirming that the correct total value was £81,680,000. Mr Davies stated in cross-examination that it was not unusual to receive queries from a bank but that he had been surprised that RBS raised nine queries in relation to his draft valuation and the further queries in relation to Freetrade Exchange.   </p>

In late May 2014, however, PAG requested a 6week extension of time to repay the 2011 Facility and the 2011 Facility was extended until 18 July 2014 on the basis that PAG would pay a margin equivalent to the default interest which would otherwise be due under the 2011 Facility and payment of a fee. In the event, RBS agreed to an extension until 31 July 2014 and agreed not to require an extension fee. The repayment of PAG’s RBS loan was completed on 25 July 2014. Thereafter, on 30 July 2014, despite the lack of any obligation to do so, PAG entered into a cap with HSBC (with a notional of £27.3 million).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Virji gave his evidence clearly and confidently. In summary, first, in his opinion, an “interest rate hedge” is “a product which if transacted mitigates the adverse consequences of changes in interest rates” and “will reduce the risk of loss should interest rates change.” Where the product eliminates some interest rate risk but assumes others, he also considers that “products in which the assumed additional risk cannot be understood, monitored, controlled, valued or where they outweigh its risk mitigation element should not be considered as hedges.” He gives as examples of such instruments those in which there may be a mis-match in the amount being hedged; a mis-match in the maturity of the hedge when compared to the tenor of the risk that is being hedged (loan repayment date, for example); or where the risk of increasing interest rates is mitigated but other risks are assumed such as the risk of interest rates falling or the risk that the counterparty may at its discretion only increase the amount being hedged or extend or cancel the tenor of the hedge at no cost to itself. He is also of the opinion that an instrument must be judged at the outset and that it must be viewed as a whole rather than dissected into parts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the First Swap, Mr Virji considered the advantages to be minimal and to be far outweighed by the disadvantages. In any event, he considered the mismatch of maturity of the First Swap and the facility and the cancellation options in RBS’s favour to be determinative. In his opinion, therefore, the First Swap was not a hedge. For the same reasons, he considers it to be a speculation rather than a hedge and therefore, not suitable for PAG. As to the Second Swap, he also concluded that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages and accordingly was not a hedge nor was it suitable. He accepted however, that he had not set out any quantification of those elements. The same was true in relation to the Third and the Fourth Swaps. Instead, of the Swaps, Mr Virji considers that derivative contracts in the form of caps would have been the appropriate product for PAG although he accepts that those products required payment of a premium of somewhere in the region of £200,000.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In her report, Ms Robbins approaches the Swaps from a regulatory perspective. However, she stated that in her opinion a hedge was “a transaction or strategy that in some way contains or mitigates a party’s exposure to risk” and that all the Swaps operated in that way. She also stated that she did not consider that whether an instrument was a hedge or not turned on whether there was an exact match between the Swap’s effective and maturity dates and the effective and maturity dates of the loan facilities in question and considered that such mismatching could be part of a hedging strategy and whether it was a hedge would depend upon PAG’s commercial and investment objectives. She also did not consider that the cancellation and extension features contained in the Swaps had the effect of preventing them from being hedges. She considered that they were plainly hedges during the guaranteed period and that the counterparty had accepted the risk that they would be cancelled; that during the periods between rights of cancellation, which operated on an annual basis, (as in the case of the Second Swap) or after the right of extension passed, the Second and Third Swaps continued to be hedges; that where the cancellation right arose on a quarterly basis after the guaranteed period, the effectiveness of the Swaps as hedges was limited; and that the extension and cancellation rights are the corollary of a reduction in the headline interest rate achieved and part of the overall pricing package of the hedge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">She also stated in cross-examination that it would be rare that a bank would assume an advisory relationship and therefore, would be unlikely to discuss break costs or MTM in relation to a derivative with a client and otherwise that there was no obligation to do so. In fact, she stated that it was not industry practice to do so at the time. She was also of the opinion that the question of whether the advantages outweighed the disadvantages of a swap was irrelevant to the question of whether they were hedges. As to suitability, Ms Robbins set out a detailed consideration of the relevant FSA rules and considered whether personal recommendations or advice was being given. She concluded that the Swaps were appropriate and suitable investment products for PAG.   </p>

But before recognising any such duty the court must consider the well-recognised, overlapping criteria of (a) foreseeability (b) proximity and (c) fairness, justice and reasonableness in the context of the particular relationship and situation and in the light of the type of harm (here financial loss) against which protection is sought.

The fact remains that this is not information of a nature which anyone at the time would have expected to be disclosed before such a transaction. DSS in particular never sought any information or assurances about BTCo's or BTI's profit or about the possibility or cost of reversal of either swap before entering into either. Each swap was entered into as a longer term speculation, and with a view to awaiting events and profiting (or, if the worst occurred, losing) according to the actual movements of rates over the next year. Neither swap was entered into with a view to reversing or trading the transaction on the current market at an earlier stage. I would add that the swaps were also based both on Dr Williams' forecasts and on such views as DSS itself had about the future market. They were not based on any representation about general market expectations, which were probably also one reason for the adverse current market value of swap 2 in mid-February 1994. In all these circumstances it is not, in my judgment, appropriate to treat BTCo or BTI as having assumed or incurred a duty to explain the adverse current market value.”  </p>

The product was cancellable during the last four and half years of its duration. The loan was for £3.45m for five years. Amongst other things, the derivative contract gave NatWest cancellation rights after 5.5 years and every three months thereafter. At [41] of his judgment, the Deputy High Court Judge, Mr Kerr QC (as he then was) found that Mr Parker on behalf of Crestsign had the impression that there would be a penalty if Crestsign wished to terminate the derivative contract early and that there was some mention of exit or break costs but no attempt to explain or quantify them beyond a vague explanation that it would depend upon variables in the market place at the time of termination. In addition, the bank had produced a “Risk Management Paper” in which it was stated that break costs could be “substantial”, that the notes were important and that time should be taken to read them.  </p>

When the proposed trade was discussed on the telephone on 14 January 2008, no reference was made to the MTM when Mr Wyse noted that the deal was “pretty attractive.” Lastly, in relation to the Fourth Swap, Mr Lord points to the fact that it was described as “pretty attractive” and that no reference was made to break costs under the heading “How it Works” in Mr Bescoby’s email of 5 March 2008 and in his further email of 11 April 2008. </p>

No indication at all was given of the potential scale of break costs and when Mr Wyse and Mr Malin raised issues about being tied in to the swaps for a long time at RBS’ option, RBS either ignored the point or said that PAG should not be concerned. It also concealed the extent of the MTM at the outset and credit line on its books being Facility G2. He says therefore, that it is quite clear that but for the breach, PAG would not have entered the Swaps which he says is a matter of common sense. He also points out that it was not put to PAG’s witnesses that they would have gone ahead even if they had known the scale of the break costs and therefore, it is not open to RBS to rely upon such a case.  </p>

He also submits that there is no magic in the term “substantial” used in the<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Crestsign</span> case in relation to break costs. Mr Handyside submits that a generic warning that there may be break costs is sufficient particularly because PAG was always aware of break costs and had been advised by Rathbones in 2003 that such costs would be substantial in relation to a contract proposed at that time. He points to the conclusion of the Deputy Judge in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crestsign</span> at [165-167] that in that case the generic warning that they might be substantial was sufficient and that there was no duty to provide further information in the absence of enquiries. He also points to the unchallenged evidence of Ms Robbins that it was not market practice at the time to provide details of potential break costs. He also submits that PAG had in-house advisers in relation to the swaps who were fully aware that they could obtain advice from Rathbones, who were in a position to calculate break costs if asked or that they could have asked RBS to do so but did not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In this regard, Mr Handyside referred me to: the paper prepared in 2002, which contained notes which warned that the early surrender of the contract might involve exit costs (or benefits); the 6 February 2003 presentation on the 5 year collar which stated: “In the event the market has moved against a transaction you have undertaken, you may incur substantial costs if you wish to close out your position”; the Presentation Notes to the June 2004 “Structured Hedging Solution” Paper; the Presentation Notes in the October 2004 Paper; Mr Bescoby’s about discussion the risk of break costs on a call with Mr Wyse on 6 October 2004, during which Mr Wyse confirmed that he was aware of that risk; Mr Wyse accepted in cross-examination that he “clearly understood” that if RBS did not exercise its option and PAG wanted to break the trade early it would have to pay break costs but that he did not anticipate wishing to cancel early; each of the signed PTAs for each of the Swaps contained specific warnings about breakage costs; and in oral evidence Mr Russell accepted that he knew of the risk of break costs. Mr Handyside submits therefore, that PAG was fully aware of the position in relation to break costs and therefore, even if there were a duty in the form alleged by PAG and even if RBS was in breach, any loss was not caused by it because PAG would have entered into the Swaps in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, it is clear from the passage in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span> at 533D-E itself if read as a whole, that the allegations in that case were of the existence of a duty going beyond the duty to take reasonable care not to misstate facts and that the existence of a broader duty and, if so, its scope, are entirely fact sensitive and turn upon the “precise nature of the circumstances and of the explanation or advice which is tendered”: [533D]. It should also be borne in mind that Mance J’s conclusions arose in circumstances in which although a general advisory duty was not alleged, “the advisory duties and breaches [which were] alleged are effectively comprehensive so far as the subject-matter of this case goes. But it will be necessary to consider the possibility that more limited duties were assumed or arose.” [529A] However, having considered the relevant facts Mance J decided that no more wide ranging duty arose. He rejected such a duty in relation to the first swap.  In relation to the second swap, his conclusion at 573H that the bank was obliged to provide a properly constructed graph and letter setting out the financial implications of the proposal arose in the context of a duty not carelessly to misstate facts and his conclusion that the information which had been provided had been misleading and partial: 561G-562E. He went on to consider the “broader duty to explain fully and properly the operation, terms, meaning and effect of swap 2” at 574 and considered a number of factors before noting that the court must consider the well recognised criteria when imposing a duty of care and noted that the ultimate decision is a pragmatic one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It seems to me therefore, without falling into the trap of construing Mance J’s judgment as if it were a statute, that the potential duty of care under consideration is wider than a duty not to misstate, is fact dependent and as HHJ Moulder pointed out was being contemplated as a duty falling on the advisory spectrum. Accordingly, if the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crestsign</span> was intended to go further, and to suggest that once information is provided by a bank, a salesman is always under a duty to explain fully the products he wishes to sell without a broader advisory relationship having arisen, I decline to follow it. As HHJ Moulder pointed out, to take such an approach is to blur the line between a salesman and an advisor. In my judgment, such a conclusion is also consistent with the observations of Tomlinson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Green &amp; Rowley v RBS</span>.  </p>

In additional written submissions in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span> case, PAG submits that the factors in this case are much stronger than those in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span> itself. Reliance is placed upon: (i) the fact that contrary to the circumstances in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span>, the Swaps were transacted pursuant to the hedging requirement in order to hedge exposure to interest rates rather as a form of speculation; (ii) PAG was much less sophisticated than DSS in Bankers Trust and was at a considerable information disadvantage and did not have the ability properly to assess the implications of the Swaps and in particular, was unable to assess the break costs; (iii) in comparison with one written and one oral presentation in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span>, the explanation given was extensive and purported to set out both the advantages and “considerations” of the transactions; (iv) unlike in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers Trust</span>, numerous enquiries were made about the implications of being tied into the Swaps and the extent of break costs; and (v) RBS’s policy of not revealing information about the potential scale of break costs to counterparties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">RBS also draws attention to five factors: (i) it was Mr Virji’s evidence at paragraph 33 of his report that the MTM of the Swaps on entry was relatively low being essentially RBS’ AV (“added value” which in effect represented RBS’s margin); (ii) the MTM, unlike in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bankers’ Trust</span> was not a surprising feature but was perfectly normal; (iii) PAG never proactively sought information about the amount of RBS’ margin; (iv) PAG never sought information about the amount of MTM on entry into the Swaps or any quantified analysis of it during the lifetime of the Swaps; and (v) none of the Swaps were entered into with a view to reversing or trading them but were expected to remain in place until their expiry. It was also pointed out that Ms Robbins’ unchallenged evidence was that it was not usual at the time to provide details of potential break costs or initial MTM.  </p>

PAG is a substantial property company, was a professional and not a retail client of the bank, and its officers and professional staff are not unsophisticated by any means. They had entered into numerous derivative products with other banks and had contemplated entering into complex foreign currency structures which required a very considerable credit line. Mr Russell also had his own very strong views about interest rates and the kind of products he was interested in and through Mr Wyse actively sought trades of particular kinds.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, at all material times, PAG had a series of banking advisers who may not have been derivatives specialists or able to compute potential break costs or MTM but were aware of the potential for such costs to arise, to consider the potential consequences of terms being proposed and to point PAG in the direction of those able to calculate MTM/break costs. It was quite clear for example, from the discussion between Mr Bescoby and Mr Malin on 27 September 2007, that Mr Malin well understood the effect of RBS’ ability to continue or cancel the Second Swap including the potential for considerable potential break costs. I also take into account, in this regard, the advice received from Rathbones in 2002/3 and on subsequent occasions which made reference to break costs, and, in particular, the concerns voiced by Rathbones about the terms of the First Swap, albeit after it had been entered into, which were ignored in relation to the subsequent Swaps. Thirdly, PAG never sought information about the amount of MTM on entry into the Swaps or thereafter. Fourthly, I consider it relevant that unlike the claimant in<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Crestsign</span>, PAG was under no time pressure to speak of.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also relevant that it was not general market practice to give information about potential break costs and the MTM at the outset at the time. In this regard, I reject Mr Lord’s formulation of this factor which involves seeking to imply some wrongdoing on the part of RBS in following a policy which was market practice.  I also take into account the specific warnings about break costs, mismatch and other matters which were first voiced by Rathbones in September 2002 and were mentioned in the first RBS paper provided to Mr Russell that month and repeated in the presentations of June and October 2004 entitled “Structured Hedging Solution”, the specific reference for such costs to be “substantial” and the warnings in each of the PTAs. I also consider it relevant that PAG was made aware of the existence of a hedging credit line on numerous occasions including, for example, the presentation in relation to cross currency swaps in May 2007. Further, as the Deputy Judge observed in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crestsign,</span> the credit line figure was produced for internal purposes on a worst case scenario and could not be expected to have been revealed. It is also relevant that it was not envisaged that it would be necessary to break the Swaps because it was expected that PAG’s borrowing would continue to increase and the unprecedented drop in interest rates could not have been forecast.  </p>

All in all, therefore, in my judgment, taking into account foreseeability, proximity and fairness, justice and reasonableness in the context of the PAG/RBS relationship and in the light of the type of loss which it is sought to recover, there was no duty of care in this circumstance of the kind contended for.  </p>

In my judgment therefore, not only was there no duty to reveal the extent of the break costs, the MTM at the outset or from time to time throughout the life of the Swaps but in any event, PAG did not enter into the Swaps as a result of the information having been withheld.

Therefore, reliance should be placed upon the evidence of Mr Virji who stated that none of the Swaps was a hedge because of the cancellation/extension options in favour of RBS, the increased risk to which PAG was exposed and the mismatch between notional amounts and duration of swap and loan. He also submits that each of the Swaps was a single indivisible instrument and must be considered as such, in the light of its overall effect. He submits that RBS’ use of the term “partial-hedge” is an oxymoron. </p>

He says that it is equally clear that RBS’ representations induced PAG to enter into the Swaps. In fact, he says that there is a presumption of inducement which arises because it is inherently likely that a representation that a product is a hedge would be material to a person entering into a hedging instrument, the presumption being particularly strong if fraud or recklessness is proved. Further, he says that RBS failed to put to PAG’s witnesses that if they had been told that the Swaps in substantial part were not hedges that they would still have entered into them and thus is fixed with PAG’s unchallenged evidence on reliance.  </p>

He submits that Messrs Jones, Bescoby and Goldrick appreciated that PAG might reasonably understand the Hedging Representations as meaning that each was a hedge, knew that none of them were but at best were partial hedges and intended PAG to rely upon the representations. In this regard, Mr Lord also relies upon Mr Bescoby’s email to Messrs Jones and Goldrick of 3 October 2007 which they accepted they read at the time, in which Mr Bescoby stated that short callable structures were not hedges.      </p>

RBS submits that the use of the word “hedge” would not have been understood in isolation by a reasonable representee as a representation as to the quality of the transactions. Reliance is placed upon what is said to be the generic nature of the word and the contractual context of a non-advisory relationship.  Mr Handyside also submits that the mere fact that a hedging product has a cancellation option does not render it no longer a hedge.

Moreover, he says that Mr Virji’s views are extreme. His view that any product where there is a mismatch between the amount or length of the swap and the loan cannot be a hedge, Mr Handyside says cannot be maintained. He says that Mr Virji elides the question of what is a “hedge” and what is an “appropriate hedge” and notes that the product under consideration in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crestsign</span> case was cancellable and was entered into subject to a hedging requirement in the loan documentation. He also submits that any statement about a “hedge” in the sense alleged by PAG was not a statement of fact but of belief which could only be falsified by dishonesty.

In that case the defendant had sought to protect itself from the rise in oil prices by entering into oil derivative transactions with the claimant bank. One of the claims was based on alleged implied misrepresentations that the transactions were a “a true hedge”, amounted to “a proper hedging strategy” and were consistent with the justification for hedging stated in a report. It was alleged that the implied representations arose from the term sheets which stated that the transactions in question were a “hedge” for the Defendant’s exposures and could provide “protection” against further rises in oil prices and contained references to “full hedge” and “limited hedge.” Having considered how to distinguish a hedge from speculation, and noting the difficulty in doing so at [339], at [562] Hamblen J (as he then was) found that there was no basis in the term sheets when read as a whole for the alleged implied representations.

The vague and uncertain nature of the statements mean that they are ill-suited to constitute actionable statements. What, for example, is meant by a “true hedge”, a “proper hedging strategy” and how, precisely, is a bank meant to judge whether the benefits for its counterparty of any transaction outweigh the risks?

PAG’s witnesses did not understand “hedge” in the way argued for by PAG at the trial and Mr Russell claims that he never read any of the documents in any event. Further, RBS expected PAG to make its decisions based upon its own assessment and those of its advisers. Further, PAG was well aware of the cancellable nature of the Swaps and accordingly, it cannot have relied upon the term “hedge” and claim that it negated that very characteristic. </p>

None of the Swaps, it is said, were suitable for PAG in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk. In summary, the reasons expounded by Mr Virji were the extensive cancellation rights in favour of RBS, the increased risks to which PAG was exposed by the Swaps and the mismatches of notional amount and duration.

Mr Handyside points out that until July 2009, PAG was a beneficiary under the Swaps and had it not been for the unprecedented and unforeseen collapse in interest rates the Swaps would have been a success for PAG. Further, he says that the mere fact that the Swaps were cancellable did not render them unsuitable; it was the corollary of the reduction in the headline rate and was well understood by PAG. Further he says that the fact that the Swaps were heavily structured did not render them unsuitable. They were understood by Mr Wyse, Mr Russell and their advisers. Lastly, he says that the possibility of having to pay break costs did not render them unsuitable. That is a feature of almost all hedging products and was well understood by PAG.   </p>

In cross-examination, Mr Goldrick stated that he knew that the First and Second Swaps were being put forward pursuant to the Hedging Requirement and appeared to understand the risks involved in the structures being offered in the sense that Mr Jones reported to him and he would have been made aware of central issues. Mr Bescoby stated in crossexamination that he only believed that the proposals provided to PAG were suitable on the basis of the information which had been provided to the bank although he did accept that it was reasonable for Mr Wyse to assume that by sending out proposals he (Mr Bescoby) was representing the content to be a suitable hedging instrument. Mr Jones on the other hand had no hesitation in accepting that PAG would rely on presentations sent out and that the presentation of October 2004 was intended to communicate that the instrument referred to was a hedge. He also accepted that in terms of credit analysis the First Swap would not be a hedge after year 5.  In any event, Mr Bescoby was the author of the email of 3 October 2007 which was read by both Mr Jones and Mr Goldrick. In that email Mr Bescoby stated that the type of structures of the kind being put forward were not hedges.

In cross-examination, Mr Jones stated that he could not recall the conversation but had answered, “yeah” when the conversation was referred to during the discussions in November 2013 which were recorded clandestinely.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">RBS contends therefore, that PAG is precluded from reliance on the representations or statements that the Swaps were or were not hedges. Mr Handyside points out that Mr Russell’s claim in cross-examination that Mr Goldrick and Mr Jones had told him that the documentation was merely standard banking documentation which could be ignored was not the pleaded case, did not appear in any of the witness statements and was not put to the RBS witnesses. Furthermore, he pointed out that Hamblen J considered similar clauses in some detail in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">CRSM v Barclays</span> at [510] – [532] and decided that: the non-reliance clause was focussed on investment advice and recommendations; the second sentence precludes reliance upon any communication as investment advice or as a recommendation; whilst the third sentence prevents a communication received from being an assurance or guarantee of results of the transaction. Accordingly, Mr Handyside submits that PAG is precluded from advancing its claims based upon the Complement/Support Representation, the Hedge Representation, the Protection Representation, the Solution Representation, the Suitability Representation, the Acceptability Representation and the Termination Right Representation. Further, in summary it is said that the effect of the clauses is that PAG agreed that it understood the risks of the Swaps and accepted those risks. Therefore, any claim based upon a contention that PAG misunderstood the terms, the conditions or the risks is precluded. Mr Handyside also relies upon <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">UBS AG v Kommunale Wasserwerke</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Leipzig GmbH</span> [2014] EWHC 3615 (Comm) and draws attention to paragraphs [780] – [782] at which an identical clause to that considered by Hamblen J in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">San Marino</span> case was considered by Males J. </p>

In response, Mr Lord points out that such a defence could not apply to claims in fraud or deceit.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to each of the alleged representations, it is important to consider them in their factual context and in the light of the contractual relationship between the parties. The Swaps were entered into and the statements as to “hedge” and “protection” made in the context of the Hedging Requirement in the Facility Agreements which also contained express provisions excluding any advisory duties or fiduciary relationship. The representations were also made in the context of emails setting out the detailed provisions of each of the proposed trades and the PTAs which followed. Those PTAs made clear that PAG was acting on its own account and stated that it would be exposed to interest rate risk if:<span style="font-size:10pt"> </span>there was a mismatch between the start dates or end dates of the underlying borrowing and any interest rate protection; there was a difference between the value of the borrowing and the notional principal under the Swap; and that break costs would be incurred if the Swaps were closed before their maturity (including a short explanation of the way in which such costs might arise). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also clear that at least from 3 October 2007, when Mr Bescoby sent his email, Messrs Bescoby, Jones and Goldrick did not consider short callable structures to be hedges but did consider that they could form “part of an overall risk management strategy” and “satisfy a desire for lower rate funding for a pre-determined period.” Further, Mr Bescoby, in cross-examination, accepted Mr Virji’s definition of a hedge. However, it seems to me that in the context to which I have referred, the reasonable representee would not have understood the references to “hedge” in the way for which PAG contends. In those circumstances, including, in particular, the non-advisory relationship arising from express contractual terms, in my judgment a reasonable representee would have considered the term to be generic and would not have understood the phrases used as a representation as to the quality of the transaction upon which they could rely.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is the more so because of the terms set out in the schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and in each of the Confirmations/PTAs. The terms set out under the heading “Non-Reliance” make clear amongst other things that PAG in this case was “making its own independent decisions to enter into” each Swap and as to whether it was “appropriate or “proper’, was not “relying on a communication written or oral . . . as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into” the Swaps and that “information and explanations related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction” were not “investment advice” or “a recommendation to enter into” the Swap. The clause is similar to the one considered in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">CRSM</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">KWL</span> cases in which the wording was held to be focussing on investment advice and recommendations. The reasoning applies equally here. In my judgment, these are clear words which should be construed to mean that explanations of the terms of the Swaps and oral statements made about them could not be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations. It seems to me therefore, that even if the use of the term “hedge” was sufficiently clear to be relied upon by a reasonable representee to mean what Mr Virji suggests, reliance upon it has been excluded by means of contractual terms. I accept that such a defence does not affect claims in fraud. I have also found that the duty not to misstate was not breached and that a “mezzanine” duty did not arise in this case. However, had it arisen, I accept that it would not have fallen naturally within the Non-Reliance clause.     </p>

In cross-examination, it was clear that neither gentleman understood a hedge in the way described by Mr Virji and relied upon for the purposes of this aspect of the claim. Accordingly, neither Mr Russell, PAG’s ultimate decision maker, nor Mr Wyse its Finance Director could have relied upon the “Hedge </p>

This was revealed, for example, in the discussion between Mr Malin and Mr Bescoby on the telephone.  Therefore, PAG cannot have understood the reference to a “hedge” to mean as Mr Virji suggests and to have relied upon it in that way. Furthermore, it seems to me that the appetite and eagerness for derivatives shown by PAG which sought quotations on numerous occasions in relation to various structures, rates and amounts, both from RBS and other banks, also weighs against reliance upon a representation that the Swaps were “hedges” in the narrow sense. In my judgment, Mr Russell’s conduct was much closer to speculation upon interest rates. The same reasoning applies in relation to the use of the word “protect”.  </p>

In the circumstances, including the contractual context, it seems to me that a reasonable representee would not have understood the representations in the way in which PAG contends.

In relation to the alleged implied term not to provide unclear, unfair and misleading communications, Mr Lord puts the claim in two ways. First, he submits that the Facilities contained an implied term of the nature described by Thomas J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Larussa –Chigi v CS First Boston Ltd</span> [1998] CLC 277 and/or alternatively, by incorporation by reference of the rules in the FSA Handbook. The Pre-MiFID Terms of Business provide at cl. 1.5 that “All business we conduct with or for you shall be governed by these Terms of Business and applicable law” and “Applicable law” is defined as “… including without limitation the FSA Rules…” The “FSA Rules” are in turn defined as meaning the rules in the FSA Handbook. The Post-MiFID Terms of Business provide at cl. 2.3 that “For the purposes of these Terms, applicable regulations shall include the FSA Rules, the rules of any other relevant regulatory authority or exchange and any applicable law and regulations in force from time to time (“Applicable Regulations”). Where these Terms conflict with Applicable Regulations, the latter shall prevail”.

In fact, it is said that if they were to be implied, the result would be revolutionary. In particular, RBS says that the Good Faith term would not be implied there being no general doctrine of good faith in English contract law, this case not falling within the limited exceptions. Further, the contractual documentation is standard including the ISDA Master Agreement. Secondly, it is submitted that the discretion/power implied term will not be implied because there is no true contractual discretion upon which a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Socimer</span> type implied term could bite. Further, it is submitted that the alleged information sharing term would not be implied. It is described as being in reality a pre-contractual duty to disclose or a duty to inform. This it is said, runs contrary to the express provisions of clause 4.7 of the Pre-MiFID Terms of Business, clause 4.2 of the MiFID Terms of Business and clause 5(c)(iii) of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, each of which provides that RBS was not advising PAG.  It is also said to be contrary to clause 4.4 of the MiFID Terms of Business which provide that whilst the content of any opinion, research or analysis was believed to be reliable RBS did not represent that it was accurate or complete, and clause 6.5 which provided that any information provided by RBS was believed to the best of RBS’s knowledge and belief to be accurate and reliable but no further representation was made, warranty given, or liability accepted as to its completeness.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It seems to me quite clear that no agreement was reached to compromise the claims arising from the Swaps. I come to this conclusion having considered the evidence both on PAG’s behalf and on that of RBS and bearing in mind the passage from the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">RTS Systems</span> case to which I have referred. In my judgment there is no evidence from which to conclude that the parties intended to create legal relations and agreed upon the essential terms in relation to such a compromise. I accept the evidence of Messrs Russell, Wyse and Priest in this regard. Further, had such an agreement been reached it seems to me that it would have been more likely than not that it would be reflected somewhere in the copious documentation before the court. No reference to a compromise is made. In addition, in my judgment, the evidence of Mr Didier and Mr Whatham in cross-examination is fatal to the existence of a compromise. In summary, Mr Didier accepted that he had discussed with his colleague whether there should be a written compromise and was aware of the issue.  He also accepted that he did not countenance it at the time and did not consider that PAG would enter into such an agreement. Mr Whatham accepted that there was no compromise agreement. It seems to me therefore, that there was no intention to create legal relations in this regard and the parties were not ad idem. In addition, of course, at that stage there were only customer complaints and the litigation had not been commenced. Although that it is not definitive, it seems to me that it provides an important context for the evidence to which I have referred.  </p>

There is no express power or discretion in either of the Facilities or any of the documentation between the parties which governed the individuals, team or department which would manage PAG, nor do they contain an express power in relation to a security review. The review was undertaken as a precursor to agreeing the terms of the 2011 Facility. It was first mooted at a meeting between Mr Goldrick, Mr McCoy, Mr Russell and Mr Wyse on 2 June 2010 and subsequently a quote was obtained from Berwin Leighton Paisner of £9-12,000.   </p>

Nevertheless, the party who is charged with making decisions which affect the rights of both parties to the contract has a clear conflict of interest. That conflict is heightened where there is a significant imbalance of power between the contracting parties as there often will be in an employment contract. The courts have therefore sought to ensure that such contractual powers are not abused. They have done so by implying a term as to the manner in which such powers may be exercised, a term which may vary according to the terms of the contract and the context in which the decision- making power is given.” </p>

RBS was the stronger party upon which PAG was dependant and could not re-finance without great difficulty.   In his oral closing Mr Lord also took me to the judgment of Dyson LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Paragon Finance v Nash </span>[2002] 1 WLR 685 in which he held at [30] and following, that he could not accept the submission that the power given to the claimant under the loan agreements to set interest rates from time to time was completely unfettered.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“If that were so, it would mean that the claimant would be completely free, in theory at least, to specify interest rates at the most exorbitant level. It is true that in the case of the Nash agreement clause 3.3 provides that the rate charged is that which applies to the category of business to which the claimant considers the mortgage belongs. That prevents the claimant from treating the Nashes differently from other borrowers in the same category. But it does not protect borrowers in that category from being treated in a capricious manner, or, for example, being subjected to very high rates of interest in order to force them into arrears with a view to obtaining possession of their properties.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Lord says that by parity of reasoning this applies quite clearly to RBS’s revaluation power and the power to call for a security review. A security review or a revaluation of the property portfolio could be demanded every month, for example, whatever the prevailing circumstances, and the protection afforded by the limit upon the number of valuations for which PAG was required to pay is insufficient to protect from all vices. Equally in relation to the general management of the borrowing relationship, Mr Lord submits that if there were no implied terms of the kind for which PAG contends RBS, for example, could have managed PAG from Tokyo or changed the relationship manager every week. He says that such a power obviously arises under the contract. Furthermore, he emphasises that the fact that RBS had a power, for example, to call for a revaluation does not render it truly a binary choice and that the existence of a binary choice is not necessarily a bar to the implication of terms.

In relation to the Revaluation power he submits that it gave RBS a right to appoint a valuer to prepare a valuation and that the power was absolute. There was no range of options and PAG was protected from repeated valuations which the bank would have to pay for. The parties had agreed an express control mechanism and therefore, there is no room for necessary implication. In relation to the “Relationship Team Implied Power” Mr Handyside says that the insurmountable difficulty for PAG is that no such contractual power or discretion exists. He says that the management of PAG within RBS was an internal matter which did not affect the parties’ contractual rights and that Mr Lord’s examples of management from Tokyo are far-fetched. In relation to the Revaluation Power he submits that the power is absolute and is not subject to any assessment.  </p>

Once the holders of the discounted loan notes had resolved to amend the discounted loan note 1, under clauses 2.3 and 2.4 Kestrel was obliged to modify that loan note. It did so, if the holders of the vendor loan notes did not do so pursuant to a provision drafted as a power to modify. However, he held that the power was not a discretion involving a choice from a range of options but the exercise of a contractual right whether or not to modify the loan note without the consent of the holders. Mr Handyside also drew my attention to Sir William Blackburne’s judgment at [50] at which he notes that there is no power to imply terms in order to make a contract fairer or more reasonable.  </p>

She concluded that precisely the same reasoning applied in the context of an unqualified option or right of one contracting party to extend the contract at the end of its initial term.

First, is it to be implied that RBS would “perform the agreement in good faith and would not perform it in a commercially unacceptable or unconscionable way” (the “Good Faith Implied Term”)? In this regard, I remind myself of the passage in the judgment of Jackson LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mid Essex</span> case at [105] that there is no general duty of good faith in English contract law, although it may be implied in certain categories of contract such contracts of employment. However, as Leggatt J stated in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Yam Seng</span> at [131] in a passage cited by Jackson LJ, following the established methodology of English law for the implication of terms, such a term may be implied based on the presumed intention of the parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, applying that established methodology, such a term cannot be implied in the 2009 and 2011 Facility Agreements which were contracts between sophisticated commercial parties negotiated at arm’s length. In this regard, I take into account that the contracts do not fall within any of the recognised categories in which good faith is to be implied and their express terms and standard terms excluding any fiduciary or equitable duties arising in the provision of the services by RBS, militate against such an implication. In the circumstances, it seems to me that such an implied term cannot have reflected the presumed intention of the parties nor is necessary for the proper functioning of the contracts. Accordingly, I agree with Mr Handyside that such a term should not be implied in what is standard banking documentation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">to the contract is required to exercise a discretion, conduct an assessment or arrive at an opinion in relation to an issue which affects the contractual rights of both parties. It seems to me that this is clear from all of the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Socimer</span> line of cases to which I have been referred and is inherent in the analysis of those cases conducted by Jackson LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mid Essex</span> case at [78] – [82] and his conclusion at [83]. Such a conclusion is also consistent with the Supreme Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Braganza</span> in which the contracting party was required to form an opinion as to the cause of death in the context of an employment contract. It is also consistent with: the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mid Essex</span> case itself in which it was held that it was unnecessary to imply a term because the contractual provisions created an absolute contractual right as to the imposition of default points in certain circumstances; and the decision of Sir William Blackburne in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Myers v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Kestrel</span> in which he also decided that the contractual provision did not create a discretion and accordingly, refused to imply a term.  I agree that reliance on the question of whether the decision is binary, to which reference has been made in the authorities, is not of much assistance. It seems to me that as Jackson LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mid Essex</span> at [83], what is relevant is whether the decision requires the contracting party to make some kind of assessment or to choose from a range of options. It is the exercise of that power which renders the implication of a term that it should not be exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or in an irrational manner, necessary.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">What of the valuation clause? In my judgment, no element of discretion, assessment, or formulation of opinion arises under clause 10.9 of the 2009 Facility. RBS is authorised to obtain an up to date professional valuation from time to time. Any elements of assessment or opinion are those of the professional valuer and not the bank. It seems to me quite clear that it has an absolute right to call for the valuation and accordingly, that the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Socimer</span> line of authorities and the necessary implication of terms in order to control the otherwise unfettered exercise of a discretion/assessment or formulation of opinion does not arise.   To put the matter another way, in my judgment it is neither necessary to imply such a term in relation to the valuation power in order to make sense of the contract nor can it have reflected the presumed intention of the parties. It seems to me that sophisticated commercial parties who were advised and were at arm’s length, contracted on the basis of standard terms and provided some protection to the borrower by the inclusion of the provision in relation to payment for the valuation. Furthermore, it seems to me that it is relevant that in the absence of a general implied term as to good faith, the lender is entitled to take into account its own interests when exercising the valuation power provision in order to determine whether the borrower is in breach of covenant and the loan should be repaid. Further, although clause 21.5.1 in the 2011 Facility includes the word “may”, in my judgment the position is the same. If the clause is read as a whole, it does not include a discretion, assessment or formulation of an opinion any more than the use of “may” did in the circumstances considered in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Myers v Kestrel</span>. It entitles RBS, the Lender, to instruct a valuer.   </p>

In the circumstances, there is no room for the implication of a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Socimer</span> style implied term and even if there were, in my judgment, it was not breached.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Lastly, what of the alleged Relationship Team Term? In my judgment, Mr Lord’s argument suffers from a number of fatal flaws in this regard. The banking services are obviously rendered as a result of and under the 2009 and 2011 Facilities respectively. However, there is no express term as to the identity of the personnel who will provide those services or their location. It seems to me that it would be surprising if there were. They are perfectly properly matters of internal arrangement. The absence of an express term leads to two conclusions which are adverse to PAG’s case. The first is that there is no contractual right to be managed by particular individuals in a particular division of the bank or in a particular location in the first place. The second is that there is no express term in relation to which it is necessary to imply a term for the purposes of business efficacy. Even if one takes a broader view of the services rendered under the Facilities, it seems to me that it is not necessary to imply a term of the nature advocated by PAG. It cannot have been the intention of the parties viewed objectively. If Mr Lord were right, questions as to reasonableness would arise whenever a customer’s relationship manager was changed or when the bank chose for its own reasons to transfer a borrower’s key contact to a different branch of the bank. In addition, it seems to me that not only is there no foundation for such an implication but even if there were, Mr Lord’s formulation is too uncertain and vague. Which key individuals or members of the team does he say are affected by the implied term and which geographical locations are acceptable or unacceptable?  </p>

First, PAG alleges that its transfer to GRG was both irrational and in bad faith. It is said that PAG was a conspicuously weak case for restructuring, there was no risk of default, PAG having an excellent cash flow given market conditions, none of the mandatory triggers applied and none of RBS’s reasons stood up to scrutiny. For example, PAG relies upon the percentage placed upon PAG’s probability of default by RBS which was between 1.28 and 1.81% whereas mandatory transfer to GRG required a percentage of 24.48%, that PAG was a “core client” and had never been in breach of covenant despite the global recession. Furthermore, Mr Lord describes RBS’ three stated reasons as trivial: the provision of a signed copy of a facility agreement with AIB which had in fact, been provided; the aggregation of PAG’s lending with that of Russells of which PAG owned 50% of the shares despite the lack of an crosscollateralisation or guarantee; and PAG’s ICR which was within covenant.  </p>

In this regard, he also points to the fact that none of the relevant members of the Credit team on the frontline at the time, including Messrs Cocking, Holland, Hunter, Zwicky-Ross and McNicholas were called to give evidence and invites the court to draw adverse inferences from their failure to be called. Although it is not known whether they are still employed by RBS, Mr Lord points out that other former employees have given evidence in this matter.  </p>

Furthermore, it is said that objective consideration of PAG’s LTV did not warrant a transfer and it was acknowledged in RBS’s own internal documents that LTV was highly unreliable in the relevant period. Further, the only way in which the LTV would exceed the levels prescribed by RBS would be if the MTM in relation to the Swaps was taken into account, which Mr Whatham accepted. This is characterised as unreasonable and/or an act of bad faith because they were not part of PAG’s lending covenants.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">PAG contends that the real reasons for its transfer were two-fold and in bad faith. First, it is said that it was intended to stifle complaints about the Swaps and contemplated litigation and secondly, to extract as much revenue from PAG as possible. As to the first, Mr Lord points out that one of the mandatory triggers for transfer to GRG was “Customer litigates against Bank”. Mr Lord submits that the purpose of the litigation trigger was to pressure customers into dropping their litigation through GRG’s “tougher” approach, and specifically the imposition of a 100% sweep of free cash, which would deprive a borrower of funds for litigation. In this regard, Mr Russell stated that PAG had been complaining about mis-selling of the Swaps prior to its transfer. Mr McCoy accepted that PAG’s concerns about its MTM were figuring in GRG’s discussions about PAG at the time and Mr Lord says it is implausible these did not extend to PAG’s complaints about its hedging. In any event, he points to Mr Thomson’s acceptance that an email between Mr McCoy and Mr McNicholas of 28 April 2010 in which Mr McNicholas had stated: “As I indicated the discussion with the client regarding the interest rate strategy is proving interesting” indicated that PAG was complaining about the selling of the Swaps.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the second, it is said that Mr Thomson’s evidence revealed that he had West Register in mind for PAG. Where the property of RBS clients was sold to West Register, on an insolvency, GRG benefited. This, it is said, was clearly in bad faith. Once this strategy was abandoned it is said that monies were extracted from PAG via increased rates and one off charges. It is said that Mr Thomson accepted that the amount of value extracted from a borrower was independent of the actual risk it posed to RBS. Accordingly, it is said that such extraction is irrational and in bad faith.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the transfer of PAG to GRG, Mr Handyside says that RBS focused on PAG’s high LTV and low ICR which led to a significant “refinance risk” in relation to a Facility which expired at the end of 2010. PAG’s LTV was understood to be 82% and 90% if the MTM was taken into account whereas RBS’ standard lending criteria at the time were 65% LTV and 1.75 ICR. Accordingly, there was a real risk that unless PAG deleveraged it would not be able to re-finance its borrowings whether with RBS or another lender when the facilities came to an end at the end of 2010.  Furthermore, it was Mr Whatham’s unchallenged evidence that RBS’s lending criteria had changed and the frontline bank did not have authority to lend at levels outside those criteria.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the first of the two reasons which PAG say lay behind the transfer, namely the extraction of value, Mr Handyside says that there is no evidence of this at all and that PAG can only rely upon inferences from the Tomlinson Report. As to the second alleged real reason being a desire to stifle alleged complaints about the Swaps, RBS says that PAG had not complained at the time and therefore, there was nothing to stifle, there is no documentary evidence of any complaint and Mr Russell’s vague claims of repeated complaints to Mr Goldrick were never put to Mr Goldrick himself.  In relation to what he describes as PAG’s conspiracy theory, Mr Handyside submits that they are highly implausible in that they would have involved dozens of people and required them all to lay a false paper trail. In particular, in relation to the Watch Committee minutes, he says that Mr Cocking’s email of the same day stating that the decision was made to transfer PAG to GRG must bring to an end any conspiracy theory in relation to the minutes and also points out that it was not put to Mr Goldrick that the minutes had been “doctored”.  </p>

The three reasons given are said to be without foundation. They are first, the need for information from Russells, secondly, issues in relation to two family settlements and thirdly, the need to complete the 2013 Valuation. In relation to Russells, it is said that there was no need for aggregation of the debt and therefore, for the information. In relation to the family settlements the issues were not raised until July 2012 despite RBS having been aware for a considerable time. Mr Whatham stated in cross-examination that they were not a good reason to keep PAG in GRG. As to the 2013 Valuation, it was wholly unnecessary for the reasons explored below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">RBS on the other hand points out that there is no documentary evidence of any kind to support the alleged true reasons for retaining PAG in GRG, something which Mr Lord counters by reference to a policy of avoiding the production of documents where there might be litigation and RBS’ very poor response to its disclosure obligations in this case. In any event, Mr Handyside says that the allegations also require the court to believe that numerous individuals at RBS both in GRG and Credit produced a large amount of documentation in order to cover up the “true” reasons, something which he says is at best, highly implausible.  He submits that the answer was more prosaic in that RBS procedures, including RBS’ standard aggregation policy required not only PAG but also Russells and the family settlements controlled by Mr Russell to be returned to satisfactory. (He also points out that the aggregation had taken place a number of years earlier.) Delays by Mr Russell in dealing with the long expired loan and inefficiency by RBS resulted in a failure to return PAG to the “front line.”  Further, it was the front line and not GRG which required the 2013 valuation to take place before PAG could be returned. Mr Handyside submits that Mr Thomson’s evidence about a decision not to re-finance PAG in mid 2013 was confused and the evidence of Mr Whatham should be preferred. </p>

He wishes to put before the jury as hearsay evidence on his client's behalf the evidence of a man which he wishes to say, straight away, is to a very substantial extent untrue. When I asked him whether he would accept that Mr. Abernethy, who is not a party to the proceedings, should be allowed to be called and cross- examined by Mr. Caldecott, he said "No." He regarded this as a very unfair suggestion on the basis that, if Mr. Caldecott decided not to call him, he should not be in a better position by being able to have more scope in crossexamination than he would with one of his own witnesses in evidence-in-chief. However, I know of no principle of the law of evidence by which a party may put in evidence a written statement of a witness knowing that his evidence conflicts to a substantial degree with the case he is seeking to place before the jury, on the basis that he will say straight away in the witness's absence that the jury should disbelieve as untrue a substantial part of that evidence.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, CPR r 32.5(5) is quite clear. It refers to a witness statement and not to part or parts of it. Furthermore, it seems to me that by seeking to put in only those parts of Mr Sefton’s witness statement upon which PAG seeks to rely, Mr Lord is attempting to avoid the very iniquity which was being addressed by Brooke LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">McPhilemy</span> case. If he sought to rely on the entirety of the statement, which conflicts to a substantial degree with PAG’s case, he would have to say straight away that a large part of it is untrue.   Further it seems to me that if Mr Lord were right, there would be real concern that cherry picking out of context would arise. It seems to me that it is no answer to say that the party who originally had chosen not to call the witness could seek to put in the remainder of the statement under a cover of a hearsay notice. Apart from anything else, there might not be any ground upon which such a notice could be relied upon. Accordingly, I refuse the application to admit the paragraphs of Mr Sefton’s witness statement to which Mr Lord has referred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Of the further eleven alleged breaches, Mr Lord focussed on five. First, it is said that RBS committed a breach of confidence by disclosing PAG’s transfer to GRG to Russells without authorisation. Mr Lord submits that Mr Russell’s evidence on this point was clear and convincing, and Mr Goldrick did not deny this allegation. Second, it is said that RBS demanded an unnecessary and onerous ‘Security Review’ at PAG’s expense which was capricious. It is submitted that Mr McCoy, who ordered the review, was unable to defend it. Third, RBS wrongly called for revaluations of PAG’s portfolio in both 2010 and 2013. As to 2013, Mr Lord submits that Mr Thomson’s evidence was that he had, in fact, taken the decision not to refinance PAG by May 2013 and Mr Whatham accepted that, in those circumstances, there was no good reason to call a valuation and the assertion that the decision was not taken until November is unsustainable. In addition, Mr Lord relies upon the fact when negotiating the 2011 Facility, Mr Didier had assured PAG that no such valuation would be called. Fourth, it is alleged that RBS manipulated the result of the 2013 Valuation downwards by applying improper pressure on the valuers (Lambert Smith Hampton) in order to increase the size of the default payment PAG had to make to RBS and place as much pressure on it as possible after it had begun its litigation against RBS. Fifth, it is said that Mr Whatham threatened to appoint receivers over PAG’s assets unjustifiably flinging a set of keys on the table in a threatening manner, something which in cross-examination he accepted he “may well have” done.  </p>

The suggestion that aggregation policies generally were irrational, is said to be absurd. In relation to the alleged breach of confidentiality, RBS relies upon the contemporaneous email from Mr Goldrick following a conversation with Mr Russell which is said to evidence Mr Russell’s express permission for RBS to contact Russells. Mr Handyside also points out that despite the fact that Mr Russell now says that he told Mr Goldrick not to contact Russells, he made no complaint at the time, which is described as inconceivable and the very serious allegation was not put to Mr Goldrick in cross-examination.   </p>

He says that there is no basis to suggest that it was capricious or irrational to require a security review, to which PAG agreed, as a condition of new lending. Further, it was Mr Priest’s evidence in cross-examination that looking back the desire for a security review and a valuation reflected RBS’ nervousness about what would happen if PAG ended upon in administration or receivership and its desire overall, to sort out the re-financing and the Swaps issues and return PAG to the frontline.  </p>

In addition, no meaningful discussion about re-financing could take place without knowing the value of the security, something which Mr Priest readily accepted. As to the 2013 Valuation RBS submits: that Mr Didier made no promise that RBS would not call a valuation. He relies in this regard upon Mr Priest’s evidence in crossexamination that Mr Didier had said that the valuation clause had to be in the agreement and that PAG would have to accept that the bank would not abuse the clause and that Mr Russell may have assumed from this that the position would be the same as with AIB which had waived the right to call for a valuation; and secondly, that the impetus for the 2013 valuation had come from the front line; and that the decision not to refinance came about in November 2013 as evidenced by amongst other things, an entry in an internal credit record made by Gary Jessop and dated 12 December 2013 as follows: </p>

As to the threat to appoint receivers, Mr Handyside says that the evidence of Mr Whatham is to be preferred namely that he may have said the words but not in a threatening manner, particularly in the light of Mr Wyse’s own note of the 10 April 2013 meeting in which he recorded “not what he wants” after the reference to taking the keys back which Mr Russell accepted was said.  </p>

Furthermore, the fact that the witnesses referred to a variety of reasons for transfer, does not seem to me to be enough to found a claim of bad faith, arbitrariness or capriciousness. Equally, the fact that PAG’s LTV was much lower than the level justifying mandatory transfer when viewed in isolation, is neither here nor there.

It is said that there was no need for the aggregation of PAG and Russells lending and therefore, the need for information from Russells should not have arisen. In fact, it is not in dispute that the aggregation of the debt had occurred some years earlier and was not a decision made by or with reference to GRG. In those circumstances, it seems to me that it cannot be said that the need for information about Russells debt before any return of PAG to the frontline was capricious or arbitrary in any way. Further, it seems to me that the fact that the issues in relation to the Russell Family Settlements were not raised until 2012 is not a firm basis for the allegations made although I accept that as Mr Whatham said in evidence, they were not sufficient on their own to keep PAG in GRG. I agree with Mr Handyside that as Mr Whatham and Mr Thomson explained, the delay was for a more prosaic reason, namely overwork.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the alleged breach of confidence in revealing PAG’s transfer to GRG to Russells, in the light of the contemporaneous email from Mr Goldrick and Mr Russell’s failure to complain at the time, I am unable to accept his evidence. It seems to me that on the balance of probabilities, the contact was authorised. As to the security review, in my judgment, there is insufficient evidence to support the contention of capriciousness, arbitrariness or bad faith in this regard. The review was agreed to as a condition for new lending. What of the two valuations? As to the 2010 Valuation, once again, I consider that there is no ground for the allegation that it was required in bad faith or capriciously. As Mr Priest accepted in cross-examination, it was not possible to conduct a meaningful discussion about re-financing without an up to date valuation. In relation to the 2013 Valuation, I accept Mr Priest’s evidence that Mr Didier had said that the valuation clause had to be in the 2011 Facility, that PAG would have to accept that the power would not be abused rather than there having been any waiver of the right to call for a valuation. Further, it seems to me that the documentary evidence all points to the valuation having been a requirement of the front line before they would accept PAG back.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The last question therefore, is whether the 2013 Valuation was pointless and therefore, ordered in bad faith because it had already been decided that RBS would not re-finance PAG’s borrowing. In this regard, I prefer the clear evidence of Mr Whatham that to the extent that Mr Thomson stated that a decision had been taken by May 2013 not to re-finance PAG’s borrowing but also stated that he was coming to that view in August of that year, he was confused. Mr Whatham was quite clear that he had told Mr Thomson who worked for him to tell PAG that the borrowing would have to be repaid in the light of the creation of RCR which did not occur until November 2013. As to the reduction in the value placed on the portfolio, in my judgment, there was nothing in Mr Davies’ evidence to suggest that he had been placed under improper pressure to reduce his figures which could be construed as bad faith towards PAG. He stated that he did not question the legitimacy of the questions posed. Lastly, however, I do consider that, as he accepted, Mr Whatham did threaten to appoint receivers, albeit that the note of the meeting taken by Mr Wyse states that he did not want to do so.  It seems to me on the balance of probabilities and taking into account the interpretation placed upon the incident by Messrs Russell and Wyse which I accept, that the incident amounted to an improper threat. However, it is unclear to me where that leads. It does not seem to me that one incident of that kind can be sufficient basis for a conclusion that the alleged implied duties were breached.  </p>

It is not in dispute that at the relevant times, LIBOR was calculated daily on behalf of the British Banking Association (the “BBA”) by Thomson Reuters, and was published for 10 different currencies including pound Sterling, US dollars, Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs and for fifteen different maturities or “tenors” ranging from overnight to 1 year. Equally, the way in which BBA LIBOR was arrived at at the relevant times is common ground. The BBA chose a panel of banks for each LIBOR currency. In fact, RBS was a member of the panel for each of the ten currencies for which LIBOR was published. At all material times there were sixteen members of the panel for the purposes of setting GBP LIBOR. Each London business day, each member of the relevant panel made a submission to Reuters in respect of each tenor of the relevant currency.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second key area of disagreement is as to whether a member of the panel is obliged to make a LIBOR submission the same as the rate at which it has borrowed in the relevant currency/tenor on a particular day. Mr Handyside on behalf of RBS submits that that is not the case, the process being more nuanced than a direct reflection of the most recent trade, whereas it is PAG’s case that a submission which was materially different from the rate at which such a transaction took place if it were around the time of the LIBOR submission and in reasonable market size would necessarily be non-compliant. RBS submits that actual trades might not, in the expert judgement of the submitter, be considered the appropriate rate to submit because for example: the most recent transaction may not be considered reflective of other trading and the market price; the transaction may have been particularly large, or particularly small; or might reflect bespoke, non-market terms. In this regard, Mr Handyside referred me to the following extract from the BBA Guidelines: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.88in">“Under certain circumstances, contributor banks will take funds at levels above or below LIBOR, for example when dealing in particularly large or particularly small size. However, this does not necessarily mean that they should raise or drop their rates to these levels. LIBOR is the rate at which an individual Contributor Panel bank could borrow funds were it to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in reasonable market size, just prior to 11:00am London time. That is, it is the rate a bank could take funds at an arbitrary time in the market, not the rate that one institution will show money to a contributor whose name they are specifically looking for at a particular moment. </p>

In the current market, which is still stressed and volatile, bid-offer spread is still very wide. Flows come and go.

In fact, market conditions were even liable to change over the course of a day as well as overnight with the effect that trades were liable to be conducted at very different levels at different points in a day.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">as a senior money market trader he set a number of pricing “curves”, which formed the basis of pricing across the bank. There were four main curves of particular relevance. They were: the Master Curve; the “Standard” Bid and Offer Curves; the Sales Curve; and the “LIBOR” Curve. The Master Curve was in effect one set of values for each tenor and currency. These rates would be based upon manual input from money markets traders together with information received via live feeds from external sources. Both the Standard Bid and Offer Curves and the LIBOR Curve were derived from the Master Curve. The “Standard” Bid and Offer Curves generally moved in tandem with movements in the Master Curve. The “LIBOR” Curve, was itself derived from the offer price on the Standard Curve. It could be amended manually although Mr Thomasson stated that he did so very rarely. Mr Thomasson described the LIBOR curve as a snapshot of the offer price on the Standard Curve taken just before 11am each day. I accept his evidence in this regard. </p>

He was responsible for RBS’s GBP LIBOR submission at around 11 am each morning. The LIBOR Curve would always be in a ‘frozen’ state before the LIBOR submission was made, in order that it could be published directly to the BBA via Thomson Reuters. Having ‘frozen’ the LIBOR Curve, Mr Thomasson would either leave the LIBOR Curve as it was or manually amend it, if necessary. Mr Thomasson explained, for example, that he would adjust RBS’s LIBOR Curve for short-term rates where the standard pricing for those rates was set with wider spreads than the underlying market. However, he stated that he did so rarely. He also stated that during the relevant period no requests were ever made to him improperly to influence GBP submissions and if they had been, he would not have acceded to them.  </p>

It was not until 2012 that a different system was put in place for LIBOR setting. He also accepted that: the effect of funds from corporate sources and government sources and small deposits fed into the Master Curve; and that the RBS bid rate was informed by its demand for currency and that there was a link between funding from non-interbank sources and the bid rate which was extrapolated from the Standard Curve. In addition, he accepted that a bank’s offer rate is higher than its bid rate or passive rate which is the bank’s quoted rate for customers or institutions which offered money to it and that the offer rate, in part, reflects the credit risk of that bank although he added that it might also reflect lack of liquidity in the market.  </p>

However, he said that he had never been aware of the improper requests which were made in relation to submissions to be made in relation to JPY and CHF LIBOR and that he did not take account of the preferences of any of the traders relating to profit on their trades.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">He was asked about a passage in a Bloomberg instant messaging chat between Nicholas Foo and Lin Min Hong on 24 May 2011, in which Mr Foo had stated that “the GBP Swaps desk” came to his side from time to time to ask for help on their positions although he added that they usually said “no”. Mr Foo joined RBS as a graduate trainee in August 2010 and left in May 2012. He was on the money markets desk. Mr Thomasson accepted that he would have given Mr Foo training in the basics of how the money market desk functioned and that Mr Foo would have had discussions about LIBOR and the LIBOR submission process with other members of the team. Mr Thomasson’s response in cross-examination was that the conversations had been misunderstood, that there were no requests and he did not take the positions of Swaps traders into account when making LIBOR submissions. In this regard, he referred to another Bloomberg chat between Mr Foo and Miss Hong on 1 May 2011 when Mr Foo had stated: “im just wondering why when my desk sets libor, we dont find out whats the exposure of other desks to libor ..” which Mr Thomasson said illustrated Mr Foo’s confusion and that whether a profit or loss would be made on trades was not taken into account. I have to say that on the balance of probabilities and taking into account that neither Mr Foo nor Ms Hong were called to give evidence, when the two extracts are read together, in my judgment, it is more likely than not that Mr Foo was confused and they do not form a basis for a conclusion that LIBOR submitters took account of trading positions in an improper manner.  </p>

He'd take into account his fixings, both on and off the balance sheet on the day. He would also take into account the positions of close-by colleagues on the swaps desk.” Mr Davies worked as a GBP money markets trader at RBS from August 2008 until July 2009 and had been a money market trader since 2006. Mr Thomasson maintained that he had not taken account of individual positions. The conclusion of the relevant passage of cross-examination is as follows:  </p>

Numerous communications from various individuals including Mr Tom Hayes of UBS to Mr Davies asking for manipulation of the rate in JPY LIBOR were put to Mr Thomasson who stated that he had not been aware of them and that the LPY desks were some fifty feet away across a noisy trading floor. He also stated that although Mr Davies had sat within feet of him for part of this time at RBS, he (Mr Thomasson) was not aware of any improper requests having been made.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In this context, Mr Thomasson was asked about two digital diary/calendar entries he made on 18 August 2009 and 11 September 2009. The first was made as a reminder for 21 August 2009 and the second as a reminder for 16 September 2009. The entries read, respectively, “<span style="font-style:italic">3mth fix low</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">LOW 6 MTNHS</span>”. He was questioned about them during his interview with the FSA but it made no findings in relation to them against RBS in its Final Notice. Mr Thomasson explained in his witness statement that he does not remember making the entries and cannot recall what they meant. However, he refuted any suggestion that they were reminders to set LIBOR in a particular way on the days in question. He says that he could not decide on a submission until the day in question and that in order to alter his submissions in some way in order to make a profit on a particular transaction he would have had to change the entirety of RBS’ pricing model. He points out that the RBS standard pricing curve for GBP was subject to intense scrutiny and unusual movements would have been readily identifiable. Furthermore, he refuted any suggestion that they were set to alert him in relation to LIBOR setting rather than as part of a general recognisance when he arrived at the office at around 6.30am. He explained that he would have seen them early in the morning and certainly long before the LIBOR setting process which did not occur until 11am. His best guess as to the purpose of the entries was that they were observations or queries about something he may have observed in the market of which he wanted to remind himself, or that RBS might have been expecting to receive a large amount of money on a particular date. He accepted that the LIBOR submissions actually moved lower on each occasion but a comparison with the submissions of the other panel banks shows that his submissions on those dates were in line with the overall trend. In cross-examination he refuted strongly any suggestion that they had been a reminder to make LIBOR submissions to benefit trading positions.   </p>

We would start the day earlier than that and would then fix our master curve which would drive the pricing aligned to the 8 basis point spread between bid and offer and, from then on, as the day evolved, I would take into account everything that was going on.  Those observations may have caused me to question something about our requirement for funding.  I notice particularly in this period, in -- well, in both of these, we had seen dramatic moves in our rates for the month of August, which was the three months, our rates had gone from the start of the month, 93 basis points down to 71 by the end of the month and on the month of the six-month entry our rate had gone from 103 down to 77 basis points.  So we were seeing a market that was moving quite aggressively and there was clearly a changing funding requirement. Sorry to go on, but I've looked through the trades around this time, particularly three months was a much more liquid market and we have both trades where we have issued certificates of deposit and taken cash and we've also been buying other banks' certificates of deposits, so there was liquidity in the markets and the rates we have set are completely appropriate. </p>

He also stated that the RBS pricing curve reflected its position in the market, was based on an offer rate and “was essentially equivalent” to a LIBOR setting.

However, it was put to him that an email exchange with Andrew Smoler, a derivatives trader in Singapore dated 17 September 2008 was evidence to the contrary. Mr Smoler had informed Mr Nygaard of his position and that Mr Walker was intending to set at a particular level. Mr Nygaard had responded: “I understand. Jimmy is also running very short usd vs jpy day to day I believe.” In crossexamination, Mr Nygaard stated that it would not have crossed his mind that there was any attempt to feed into the LIBOR setting process and that the communication was entirely legitimate because Mr Smoler was informing him that he might lose money on the transaction.

Hahahaha” it was suggested in crossexamination that Mr Tan was indicating that RBS's own positions meant that it wanted a high fix for three-month LIBORs. Mr Nygaard responded: “I don't believe that is how I interpreted it at that point.” When asked about the "go Neil!  Hahahaha" comment he explained: “. . . My response is that this is a sort of a release of a build-up of stress that instead of bowing to Brevan Howard's supposed pressure, we are going to do the right thing, and I'm saying "Yes, go Neil!"” It is not in dispute that Mr Tan was dismissed for trader manipulation and in proceedings he commenced in Singapore, it was alleged that Mr Nygaard had been aware of the manipulation which Mr Nygaard flatly denied. Mr Nygaard also denied that so far as he was aware any lowballing had taken place and he denied that he was implementing a lowballing policy. However, in the transcript of Mr Nygaard’s interview with the FSA, he recognised that “. . . this looks really bad” and acknowledged that “[i]n hindsight I would say that this was a clear sign that these guys were being tempted to do this kind of thing.” PAG submits that Mr Nygaard’s explanation given in cross-examination is absurd. </p>

Any bank which quotes to the LIBOR panel could not quote a cost of funds greater than their Libor quote to the panel. Thus in the USD Libor where dispersion has been about 110 bps, the only people who could make a claim are those who fix above the average. For RBS it means our LIBOR would need to be higher than historically. Scott, could you send a complete list of quotes over the last two weeks from all 16 banks for USD to give a better idea of dispersion pls. . .”  </p>

We didn't want to be seen to be not doing what we said we would do. That was really what was kind of driving the discussion. The other part of this, I think it's important to note too, because I don't know if we'll get to that elsewhere, but we frequently talked about our cost of funds in the money market world, and there was -- most of the assets on the books of the bank were rolling on a one-month to three-month basis and, frankly, that is how the bank was run for many years, funding these short-dated assets on a short-term basis. When the crisis hit and, certainly the beginning of 2007, we began to try to extend the duration on the liability side, beyond three months. The implication of that is that our funding was actually more expensive than the levels at which we were rolling our assets at, because we were taking longer term funds to fund shorter term assets. In addition, we were taking more and more long-term liabilities through our group treasury that was issuing anywhere from two years out to ten years cash and swapping it down to curve, it could be one month plus 100 or 150, and we were funding assets at LIBOR flat, out of the money market book. </p>

Mr Walker was promoted to Head of London Money Markets in April 2009 and to Global Head of Money Markets in 2012. He was dismissed for gross misconduct in February 2013 and was subsequently re-employed and given an opportunity to resign which he did in May of that year. In the case of US$, JPY and CHF LIBOR, RBS admits a total of 155 instances of attempted or actual manipulation of LIBOR by RBS employees or employees of its affiliates.

He also stated that before the financial crisis, a transaction of reasonable market size might have been in the region of USD 100m but afterwards it was much smaller and that the best evidence of the rate at which a panel bank could have borrowed in the interbank market was the actual trading in that market.  </p>

He stated that because there was so much liquidity in the market he had narrowed his bid offer spreads to reflect the interbank market being much closer to the passive market than it had previously been. However, the actual setting of LIBOR or the creation of submissions was a two minute job in a ten or twelve hour working day but that one was setting the curve for the entirety of the day and that when setting that curve all the factors relevant to the BBA Definition and Guidance needed to be taken into account. In any event, he added that his LIBOR rate was the rate at which he perceived he could borrow in the interbank market at that point in time, reflecting where he felt he could get money at the passive rate and his LIBOR offer where he felt he could get funding in the interbank market. He stated that information was freely exchanged with derivative traders and that they could communicate by many means including the intercom system which worked both throughout the London premises and internationally.   </p>

The spread between banks got bigger and bigger and bigger, and the banks got more and more strained, or the better ones got better and the worse ones got worse.” It was for this reason that he said he described LIBOR as “broken”.

He also sought to defend matters raised rather than accept that any error had been made, an approach which led him to make contradictory statements. For example, after lengthy cross-examination on the point he eventually accepted that the analysis contained in appendix 5 to his report excluded all trades on a Friday after 11am which had not been explained in the Joint Statement, having asserted the contrary shortly beforehand. Dr Cartea was also prone to flamboyant and sweeping statements for which there was no evidence before the court.  </p>

Each expert then produced a Weighted Average Rate (a ‘WAR’) which represented the average of the rate at which RBS borrowed on the day in question and compared it with RBS’ LIBOR submissions. The days on which the LIBOR submission was below the WAR were described as “negative variance days.” In the case of each negative variance day Mr Osborne examined the specific day to see whether any conclusions could be drawn as to the likelihood of lowballing. By contrast, Dr Cartea had not inspected any of his results and had taken a strictly mathematical approach. Although he referred to each negative variance day in his report as “under reporting”, in cross-examination Dr Cartea stated that he was merely comparing borrowing costs to submissions and that he was not taking a view “as to whether they are lowballing or not” and added “. . . it is very difficult for me and I could not say and stand here and say that they are lowballing.”  </p>

If a £100m threshold is applied, Dr Cartea found 352 computable days of which 80 were negative variance days, being 22.7% and if £200m was used, he found 204 computable days of which 60 were negative variance days, being 29.41%.  </p>

It appears from a further analysis conducted by Mr Osborne as to the trades which “tipped” the day in question into being a negative variance day (which Dr Cartea did not dispute) that: 60 are eliminated if the Central Treasury City Code transactions are not included; a further 18 are eliminated if CUST_TYPE INTL or RDRC (i.e. other internal RBS Group trades within the LONCITY code) are excluded; and therefore 78 of 80 negative variance days, being 97.5% of all of the negative variance days identified by Dr Cartea, are due exclusively to the inclusion of internal transactions the pricing of which were not taken into account by RBS submitters, it being PAG’s own case that it would be wrong (and contrary to the BBA Definition) to take into account non-interbank trades in this way. </p>

On the basis of Mr Walker’s evidence that it was often the case that RBS would be able to secure most of its funding at the bid level, Mr Lord submits that Mr Osborne would have needed to adjust his WAR figures to determine what RBS’ offer rate would have been and that the factual witnesses had stated that “a reliable proxy” for the offered rate could be derived by adding 8 basis points to the prevailing bid rate. In cross-examination, Mr Osborne accepted that a higher number of negative variance days would have been identified had such an approach been taken.  In closing, therefore, Mr Lord sought to draw a line across one of Mr Osborne’s graphs at a level said to reflect an additional 8 basis points, the effect of which was to increase significantly the number of negative variance days which would have been identified from Mr Osborne’s data.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is common ground that the differences between the findings of the experts is driven to a large extent by their differing approaches to the filtering of the data in four main respects being: the identification of trades as belonging to a particular tenor; the day on which the WAR was calculated; the size of the transaction used; and the type of transaction used, including its geographical location and whether it was “external” or “internal”. As to days on which the WAR is calculated, Mr Osborne compared the LIBOR submission on a particular day with his WAR on that day whereas Dr Cartea compared the WAR with the LIBOR submission on the previous day. It is said on behalf of RBS that Dr Cartea’s approach creates anomalies including ignoring all trading on Fridays and therefore, precludes analysis on a Monday.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the size of transaction used, Mr Lord says that not only does Mr Osborne’s inclusion of all trades however small, fail to comply with the BBA Definition which refers to “offers in reasonable market size” but also has the overall effect of reducing the interest rate at which sums can be borrowed and therefore depresses Mr Osborne’s WAR. Mr Osborne accepted the proposition in relation to the effect on interest rates and also accepted that before the financial crisis, reasonably sized transactions were in the region of £100m. RBS on the other hand, submit that Dr Cartea based his benchmarks for “reasonable market size” upon RBS’ market capitalisation in 2008, which RBS says is both incorrect and irrelevant, and an article by a Mr Ellis referring to a reasonable market size of  a “few hundred million” for which there was no evidence. In cross-examination, Mr Thomasson stated that before the financial crisis reasonable market size might have been £50m or £100m and afterwards £10-15m. RBS submits that in any event, changing the size of the transaction makes little difference to the results and refers to Appendix 7 to the Joint Statement in which Mr Osborne’s team plotted his WAR against LIBOR submissions using different thresholds.   </p>

He says that the implied representations arise from proposing and transacting LIBOR referenced Swaps, expressly representing that they would be referenced to LIBOR in circumstances where RBS was intimately involved in the operation of the LIBOR mechanism and had the ability to affect the rate. He submits that Colman J’s reference to assumptions made by the representee highlights that matters may be implicitly communicated by conduct and sub-consciously understood, even if they were not consciously considered at the time.  He also relies upon <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Spice Girls Ltd v Aprilia World Service BV</span> [2002] EMLR 27 in which it was held that when making an agreement to publicise a product, a band had impliedly represented that they had no reason to believe that one of their number had an existing intention to leave the band during the term of the agreement.  </p>

UBS had originally planned to enter into the transaction directly with KWL but in fact, invited Depfa to ‘intermediate’, so that Depfa and KWL, and Depfa and UBS entered into back-to-back arrangements. Unknown to Depfa, the transaction with KWL was tainted because there had been bribery involving Value Partners and one of KWL’s managing directors, Mr Heininger. The Court found that the UBS relationships contact for Value Partners (Mr Bracy) knew that Value Partners and Mr Heiniger were dishonest. Depfa sought to rescind the contracts with UBS on the basis of a number of implied representations which included representations that the opportunity being presented to Depfa was proper and viable, that UBS believed Value Partners and Mr Heininger to be honest and that UBS did not have any “significant concerns” about their honesty.

However, I understood what the acronym stood for (based on other banking documents that I had seen) and that LIBOR was supposed to be more of a commercial rate that was based on the rates at which banks actually lent to each other or believed that they could lend to each other. I was also aware that LIBOR was set at 11am each day.” Mr Wyse’s evidence was that it “goes without saying” that: “When RBS were selling us the Swaps, and proposing that we enter into transactions that were based on LIBOR ... they were also representing (and I certainly understood them to be representing) that each of the Swaps would in fact be tied to LIBOR . . . and that LIBOR was what it was supposed to be - i.e. an interest rate that genuinely reflected the rate at which banks were able to borrow from each other or at which they believed that they could borrow from each other. I think it also goes without saying (and again, I certainly understood) that RBS was also representing that neither it nor any other bank had sought or would seek to manipulate LIBOR for their own benefit and that LIBOR had not previously been, and was not capable of being, manipulated by RBS or other banks.”  </p>

Lastly, he says that in proposing and transacting the LIBOR based Swaps, RBS was impliedly making LIBOR Representation 5. This accorded with what Mr Russell and Mr Wyse understood LIBOR to be. In addition, he relies upon certain express representations to this effect contained in the email of 6 March 2008 from Mr Jones to Mr Wyse copied to Mr Goldrick in which it was explained why PAG’s borrowing needed to be switched from Base Rate to LIBOR.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Although it is not in dispute that the governing principles in relation to implied representations are to be found in the judgments in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">MCI WorldCom</span> cases, Mr Handyside places particular weight upon the need for the representation or communication to have been made and submits that, in fact, PAG is running a “duty to speak” case and trying to shoehorn it into a different legal category. He says that assuming a state of affairs is not enough. There must be words or conduct from which a representation can be inferred and the representor must (objectively) have communicated the relevant information to the representee. He says that in this case RBS was merely willing to contract upon the terms which it put forward and the reference to LIBOR was no more than a reference to a rate which appears on a screen. The inclusion of reference to the rate was not an implied representation as to how the rate is set or its legitimacy. He reminded me of the underlying question in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Geest v  Fyffes</span> which was described at 680d as “whether a creditor owes to a guarantor or to a party providing an indemnity in the nature of a surety a duty voluntarily to disclose facts material to the decision whether to provide the guarantee or indemnity which is higher than that duty to avoid making implied misrepresentations which arises in respect of any ordinary contract” and drew my attention to the entire passage at  683a-e which is as follows:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.18in">“In my judgment, the law in England and other common law jurisdictions can now be fairly stated to have settled at the point of the following propositions. (i) The potential beneficiary of a guarantee or indemnity, as distinct from a contract of insurance, has no general duty to disclose to the party about to give the guarantee or indemnity all facts material to that party’s decision whether to enter into that contract. (ii) Where, however, in the course of inviting or negotiating the guarantee or indemnity the beneficiary makes express or implied misrepresentations of material facts, the representee will be entitled to rely on the defence to a claim on the guarantee that he was thereby induced to enter into the contract. (iii) Where there is no express misrepresentation, the first question to ask is whether there has been any implied misrepresentation at all and, as with any other type of contract, the essential issue is whether in all the circumstances relating to the entering into of the contract of guarantee or indemnity, including in particular (a) the nature of the contract between the beneficiary and the principal debtor, (b) the conduct of the beneficiary and (c) express representations made by him to the surety, it has been impliedly represented to the surety that there exists some state of facts different from the truth. In evaluating the effect of the beneficiary’s conduct a helpful test is whether, having regard to the beneficiary’s conduct in such circumstances, a reasonable potential surety would naturally assume that the true state of facts did not exist and that, had it existed, he would in all the circumstances necessarily have been informed of it. (iv) If there has been such a misrepresentation, the next question is whether it induced the person giving the guarantee or indemnity to do so in the sense of its having at least materially influenced his decision, although it may not have been the sole cause of that decision (see Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459 at </p>

Finally, he says that reliance upon the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Spice Girls</span> case is also misplaced. In that case, the Court of Appeal found that a fax had contained express representations about the commitment of each Spice Girl to the future implementation of all of the terms of the heads of agreement which were false and that the representations had been continued and affirmed during the course of negotiations. Mr Handyside seeks to distinguish the case therefore, on the basis that there were express representations as well as representations by conduct. He also says that it is no authority for the proposition that a party makes an implied representation merely by offering or proposing to enter into a contract. At paragraph [59] of the judgment of Sir Andrew Morritt VC, who gave the judgment of the court, the Court of Appeal considered continued conduct including the re-issue of a draft agreement containing the phrase “currently comprising” in relation to the band. It was held that: “in the context of the surrounding circumstances, it was concerned with an agreement which would continue into the future, in much the same sense as the conduct of SGL in approving the promotional material or of the Spice Girls in participating in the commercial shoot, in each case, for future use. In these two latter senses there was implicit in the representation derived from the conduct of SGL in circulating the draft agreement with the phrase “currently comprising” the representation for which AWS contends. It follows that, in that context, to say that the Spice Girls currently comprised the five named individuals without going on to say that one of them was going to leave within the period of the Agreement was false when made. What was omitted rendered that which was actually stated false or misleading in the context in which it was made: see Chitty on Contracts (1999, 28th ed.), Volume 1, paragraph 6– 016.”  </p>

It follows, as is also common ground, that UBS impliedly represented that if it had had sufficient credit lines, it would have contracted with KWL directly. This was true. The need for intermediary banks arose from CRC’s unwillingness to accept full credit exposure to KWL on all four STCDOs and was the solution devised by UBS’s senior management to resolve that problem. Depfa contends, however, that it was implicit in what it was told about this by UBS, in the fact that UBS told Depfa that it had done due diligence on KWL, and in the fact that the transaction was presented to Depfa at all, that UBS was also impliedly making the further representations set out at [733] above. In essence, it says that if those matters had not represented UBS’s state of mind, it could not as a reputable bank have presented this transaction to Depfa, and that Depfa was therefore entitled to understand that these representations were being made to it.” </p>

He submits that this is all the more so in the light of the context. RBS was not acting as advisor, but was an arm's length counterparty, which had carefully circumscribed through the use of contractual documentation the limited role it played and the information provided; there was no express representation; and the alleged implied representation is long, detailed and convoluted and involves matters of judgement or opinion which are wholly unsuitable for an implied representation of this kind.

He also points out that LIBOR Representation 5 purports to be an implied representation as to something which (in benign credit conditions), it happened to be, namely a proxy rate. As such, it is said to be hopelessly vague it being impossible, for example, for a reasonable representee to say how close all panel banks’ submissions would need to be to remain a proxy rate.  </p>

He says that it is hopelessly unclear as to be meaningless. As to the alleged express making of LIBOR Representation 5, it is denied that the email contains the representation alleged.

When the same question was put to Mr Wyse, his response was “It is not something that would have ever occurred to me” and when it was later put to Mr Wyse in terms that the representation was a “lawyer’s construct” he admitted that “It is true that this part – the LIBOR part of the case is not something I would be too involved in, I don’t think”. Mr Handyside submits therefore that the reasonable representee would also not have understood the 6 March 2008 email to contain LIBOR Representation 5 and the express representation case must also fail on the grounds that no representation was made.  </p>

Further, as to the distinction between an implied term and implied representations, Mr Handyside submits that PAG’s case rests solely upon assumptions rather than having been told something and for a representation to be implied it is necessary to focus on the whether the conduct is such that a reasonable representee would consider that he had been told what amounts to the representation. By contrast, for a term to be implied it is only necessary that it “goes without saying”. There is no need to be told anything. Mr Handyside submits therefore, that if PAG’s case that the mere act of offering a product or service is enough to give rise to wide ranging representation were accepted, it would drive a coach and horses through the distinction with serious adverse consequences for certainty of contract. He concluded by submitting that the terms of the Swaps were no more than a bargain calculated at the rate which appeared on the relevant LIBOR screen.  </p>

First, the only rate referenced in the Swaps is the 3M sterling LIBOR rate whereas each of the three alleged implied terms relate to LIBOR generally which accordingly, is not necessary. Secondly, LIBOR Implied Term 1 is sufficiently widely drawn that it includes the conduct of any of the Panel Banks, something which cannot have reflected the obvious intentions of the parties. Thirdly, Mr Handyside says that it is not credible to suggest that the LIBOR Implied Term 2 should be implied given that it amounts to a duty to speak. Lastly, in relation to LIBOR Implied Term 3, Mr Handyside submits that it is much too wide to be implied. It is not currency specific and includes reference to “attempting” which is both wide and vague. In fact, RBS would accept that there was an implied term in the Swaps and the Facilities that RBS would not dishonestly manipulate 3M GBP LIBOR so as to cause loss to PAG.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, I should say that it is well established and goes without saying that there is a common assumption that the parties to contractual arrangements will behave honestly. The implication of such a contractual term, which is not part of the pleaded implied terms claim, should not be intertwined with the question of whether the five alleged LIBOR Representations which are detailed and specific should be implied. Secondly, in my judgment, it is also necessary to avoid blurring the line between assumption and representation and between the implication of terms and implied representations. Mr Lord’s reliance upon the “helpful test” in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Geest v Fyffes</span> was just that. In that case, Colman J was considering a contract of guarantee or indemnity and stated that as with any other contract: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“the essential issue is whether in all the circumstances relating to the entering into of the contract of guarantee or indemnity, including in particular (a) the nature of the contract between the beneficiary and the principal debtor, (b) the conduct of the beneficiary and (c) express representations made by him to the surety, it has been impliedly represented to the surety that there exists some state of facts different from the truth. In evaluating the effect of the beneficiary’s conduct a helpful test is whether, having regard to the beneficiary’s conduct in such circumstances, a reasonable potential surety would naturally assume that the true state of facts did not exist and that, had it existed, he would in all the circumstances necessarily have been informed of it.” [683c-e] </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, the reference to what the reasonable potential surety might “assume” should not be construed as a shortcut. It seems to me to be clear both in principle and from the passage in Colman J’s judgment, that in order for the assumption to have arisen in the mind of the reasonable representee, there must have been conduct on the part of the representor upon which the assumption is based. The test applicable for implying terms in the sense of the term being “obvious” or “going without saying” on the other hand is more apt to be described in terms of assumption alone. In the case of implied representations, an assumption arises in the mind of the reasonable representee as a result of conduct viewed in context. I agree therefore, with Mr Handyside that there must be words or conduct on the part of RBS from which the representations can be inferred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Was the presentation of draft Swaps agreements tied to LIBOR sufficient to amount to conduct from which, in the context, the reasonable representee would have inferred/assumed that the LIBOR Representations were being made? I agree with Mr Handyside that the position was substantially different both in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Spice Girls</span> case and in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">KWL</span>. Neither case was based purely upon proffering of a draft transaction as conduct from which representations could be inferred. In the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Spice Girls</span> case, Sir Andrew Morritt VC at [54] – [60] considered a range of conduct including a fax which was held to contain an express assurance that each of the group was committed to the terms of the heads of agreement and the draft agreement which was circulating at the time. It was in this context that he held at [59] that it was implicit in the representation derived from the conduct in circulating the draft agreement with the phrase “currently comprising” that all members of the group would continue to be so throughout the term of the contract. In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">KWL</span> the implication arose from the fact that when the transaction had first been presented, UBS had informed Depfa that the reason why an intermediary was necessary was because its internal credit lines were full and therefore it was unable to contract directly and that it had done due diligence: [738]. It was in this context that Males J held at [740] that UBS impliedly represented that it believed the proposed counterparties to be honest, and did not have any significant doubts as to their honesty.  </p>

It is necessary to give business efficacy to each of the transactions and it seems to me that it goes without saying. I agree with Mr Handyside that the conduct of unknown Panel Banks would not have been within the contemplation of the parties. I reject however Mr Handyside’s criticism of the term based upon the fact that it is not expressly tied to the 3M GBP LIBOR which was the benchmark adopted in the Swaps themselves. It seems to me that that is what the term is referring to. It is expressly concerned with the “floating rate payable by or to RBS” and therefore, is by its very terms a reference to the rate applicable to the Swaps themselves. LIBOR Implied Term 2 is more difficult. It seems to me that it is crafted from the conclusions reached in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Geest v Fyffes</span> which is concerned with representations rather than terms.

This conclusion was not surprising since an earlier set of figures had shown insufficient profits to persuade him to buy. So inducement had been established. That being so, it was not then material to consider what he would have done if he had been given the true profit figures — a situation which had never arisen and to which he would not have given thought (except in the context of the subsequent litigation).  </p>

Mr Russell accepted in evidence that at the relevant time he knew nothing of the BBA Definition or the way in which submissions were made by Panel Banks, whether RBS was a panel bank or how LIBOR was calculated and that it had never occurred to him that it was capable of manipulation. He was able to say however, that he had “complete trust and faith that RBS were setting correct and qualified rates . . .” In Mr Wyse’s case, he could not recall any of the LIBOR Representations without seeing them and also accepted that it had not crossed his mind that submissions could be manipulated. He added in crossexamination that he knew that LIBOR was an average and that “the High Street banks” were involved in making submissions.

Mr Wyse said that it was something which never occurred to him and that he had no reason to believe that the rates quoted were other than genuine. Mr Russell also agreed that in the email Mr Jones was saying that LIBOR better reflected RBS's cost of funding than base rate and that if PAG’s loans were kept on base rate, there would be additional costs for the bank related to its capital requirements and the bank would therefore have to increase the margin charged over base rate to reflect that.  </p>

In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether it is appropriate to ask what they would have done if told the alleged truth as against if nothing had been said.

It accepts therefore, that if LIBOR Representations 1-4 were made, they were false. Depending upon its meaning, it also accepts that as a result of the effects of the Financial Crisis Dislocation, if made, LIBOR Representation 5 would also be false.  </p>

PAG contends, however, that a reasonable counterparty would have “run a mile” if it had been told that RBS was manipulating LIBOR in any currency, that the LIBOR Representations are widely drawn and that US$ LIBOR is potentially relevant to whether the LIBOR Representations were made fraudulently.  </p>

If, however, as RBS alleges it is necessary to prove that each individual knew that the LIBOR Representations were being made, it is submitted that the claim fails because Messrs Bescoby, Thomasson, Walker and Nygaard gave evidence that it never occurred to them that the LIBOR Representations were being made.

I also agree with Mr Handyside that it is irrelevant in relation to inducement, the admissions having been made. However, had the LIBOR Representations been made and relied upon, it seems to me that in principle, the position in relation to US$ LIBOR may have had relevance in relation to the knowledge of the relevant RBS employees and therefore as to whether the LIBOR Representations were made fraudulently.

Mr Handyside also relies upon the paucity of evidence in relation to alleged GBP LIBOR manipulation despite the disclosure of tens of thousands of documents. He points out that if GBP LIBOR manipulation was widespread as PAG alleges, there is no documentary evidence of it. Mr Thomasson and Mr Walker’s evidence was that the majority of communications were by recorded means and that there were staff based outside London. Furthermore, the change of seating applied to JPY and CHF as much as to GBP. Further, those who were involved with JPY and CHF misconduct were based in London and left documentary evidence of their wrongdoing. In addition, Mr Handyside points out that the intercom system was available to all and therefore, does not provide a solution for why there is such a disparity of documentary evidence in relation to GBP in comparison with JPY and CHF. He says therefore, that the only proper conclusion is that there is no documentary evidence because no improper manipulation occurred.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">PAG also relies on three specific matters in relation to GBP LIBOR. The first is the digital calendar/diary entries made by Mr Thomasson which Mr Lord says are clear evidence of Mr Thomasson having engaged in Trader Manipulation in relation to GBP LIBOR. Mr Lord submits that it is obvious what the entries were about. They were to remind Mr Thomasson to make his GBP LIBOR submissions on particular days in a manner which took into account transactions that were due to fix or refix their interest rates on the days in question. It is also said that the submissions made on those dates were consistent with him having done so. Mr Lord says that Mr Thomasson’s attempts to justify and explain the entries, which he says he cannot recollect, both in his witness statement and in cross-examination do not bear too much scrutiny. As to the suggestion that they were a reminder of a query about something in the market at the time, Mr Lord points out that there is no suggestion or evidence of what the query might have been. As to the suggestion that he might have been informed that RBS was expecting a large amount of money on a particular date, once again there is no evidence to support it. The suggestion in cross-examination that they might have been reminders for the purposes of setting the pricing curve is also said to be unlikely.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second specific matter is the Bloomberg chat of Mr Thomasson’s colleague Mr Foo and the third is the conduct of Mr Brent Davies. It is said that Mr Thomasson’s evidence that Mr Foo had misunderstood the situation was unconvincing. Mr Lord stated that in Mr Brent Davies’ evidence to the FSA given on 4 September 2012, the transcript of which was only disclosed on 8 August 2016 after the evidence had closed, he explained that the submitter had regularly taken into account the position of his own money markets transactions as well as those of other derivatives traders in the course of determining the GPB LIBOR submissions and went on specifically to identify Mr Thomasson. Once again it is said that Mr Thomasson’s attempt to discredit Mr Davies as a disaffected employee is unconvincing given that he accepted that he remained in touch with him after he left RBS.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the calendar entries, RBS submits that there is no evidence to connect them to taking account of inappropriate factors when making LIBOR submissions and that Mr Thomasson’s emphatic denial that he took into account the positions of derivative traders when making submissions should be accepted. It was also made clear that the only pleaded allegation in this regard is concerned with whether the entries coincided with requests made by other derivative traders, rather than with Mr Thomasson’s own money market book. RBS submits therefore, that there is no evidential basis upon which the court could properly conclude that these calendar entries are evidence of dishonest and fraudulent conduct on the part of Mr Thomasson and that there is no connection, as in the case of the FSA’s findings against Barclays Bank plc in relation to calendar entries, of a request by a derivatives trader which matched the entry itself. Nor, as in the Barclays case, were the calendar entries timed for around 11am when LIBOR submissions were to be made. They were timed for 8.30 -9am and 9.30 to 10am. Mr Handyside also reminded me that it is surprising that it was suggested tangentially at least that Mr Thomasson might have sought dishonestly to make movements in the RBS LIBOR submissions which would not trigger the alarm referred to in Mr Ewan’s email of 17 July 2009, when it was Mr Thomasson himself who had triggered the email correspondence because he was concerned about movements in submissions.</p>

It is submitted therefore, that employees who were very junior such as Mr Foo or who had limited experience on the money market side like Mr Davies might misunderstand.

Mr Lord says that Mr Walker’s explanation in cross-examination that his answer was non-committal is not credible.

It is submitted, nevertheless, that it was made because it was thought likely that Mr Walker would act on it. RBS has suggested that Mr Walker cannot have accommodated the request because “on 23 October 2008 Mr Walker moved his USD LIBOR submissions higher (i.e. the opposite of Mr Smith’s request).” However, this was only the case in the longer tenors (i.e. 3m - 1yr). RBS’s USD LIBOR submissions in the shorter tenors (i.e. 1m and 2m) were unchanged and, even on the calculations of RBS’s own expert (as to which, see further below), RBS’s 3m USD submission was around 25 basis points below the WAR of its costs of borrowing.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>PAG also relies upon the instant messenger conversation of 28 January 2010 between Mr Walker and Mr Green.

PAG points out that Mr Thomasson also acted as a substitute submitter for US$ LIBOR when Mr Walker was away, that he was involved in misconduct in relation to US$ LIBOR and therefore, it was more likely that he was also involved in GBP LIBOR Trader Manipulation.  </p>

Although PAG contends that the way in which RBS made its submissions was itself flawed, it is not suggested that the RBS LIBOR witnesses were acting dishonestly when following the submission process and this is fatal to the Lowballing claim.

That was my role and that was my primary objective, particularly during this time. If RBS was submitting rates that were that far away from the market we wouldn’t have been able to fund ourselves. And there’s just no incentive for me to have been submitting RBS’s LIBOR rates at levels that were anything other than where I would actually do the funding of that book.

PAG describes “Financial Crisis Manipulation”, as: “the making of LIBOR submissions when, as a result of the worldwide financial crisis and an increasing shortage of liquidity, RBS was either (i) unable to borrow funds at all on the interbank market or (ii) unable to borrow funds at the rate that it was submitting to the BBA”.  </p>

RBS submits that a lack of interbank trading made the LIBOR submitter’s job more difficult, and required him to take greater account of a wide range of factors in the absence of interbank trading, but that provided he did so honestly and submitted his genuine view, that was what the BBA Definition required and was not dishonest, no matter how dislocated (or “broken”) the market was. </p>

I also do not consider it appropriate to draw adverse inferences from the fact that the submitters were seated on the same trading floor with derivatives traders at the time and could contact those traders in numerous ways, including it would seem, by way of an unrecorded intercom. In this regard, I take account of the fact that although it is possible that improper communications were made in this way, it cannot be safe to assume it or draw some kind of adverse inference particularly in the light of the fact that despite the fact that the same means of communication was available to submitters and traders in other currencies, there is plenty of documentary evidence of their conduct. I also do not consider it appropriate to draw inferences from conduct in one currency in relation to what may have been conduct in another.  </p>

First, as I have already mentioned, I accept Mr Thomasson’s evidence that his discussions about LIBOR with the derivatives and money market traders were of a general nature in the sense of discussing likely rate moves and funding needs.  As I have already stated, I also do not consider that the Bloomberg chat between two graduate trainees, Mr Foo and Ms Hong is evidence of trader manipulation by Mr Thomasson. Mr Foo’s later conversation contradicts the first.  Accordingly, I accept Mr Thomasson’s explanation that Mr Foo was confused. To put the matter another way, it seems to me that Mr Foo’s communications to the FSA, taken as a whole, is insufficient from which to conclude on the balance of probabilities that trader positions were taken into account in the GBP LIBOR submissions.  I take this view despite Mr Foo not having been called as a witness. I do so in the light of the fact that there was no evidence before the court as to whether RBS could have called Mr Foo as a result of any continuing obligation in a severance agreement.   </p>

It seems to me that when the extracts from the transcript of the interview by the FSA are taken in the round, Mr Davies’ explanations were consistent with the general and legitimate assimilation of information which Mr Thomasson described. He stated that he had not seen people attempting to influence the GBP LIBOR submissions and had not observed traders proactively describing their fixings and seeking to influence LIBOR. Therefore, in my judgment, Mr Davies’ evidence does not support the conclusion that Mr Thomasson took account of traders’ positions when setting LIBOR.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">What of the diary/electronic calendar entries made by Mr Thomasson? Unlike the similar entries considered by the FSA in relation to misconduct by Barclays Bank plc, there is no evidence to connect them to requests made by traders to take their positions into account. This is particularly relevant in the light of the pleaded case, which is concerned with third party trader manipulation rather than an allegation that Mr Thomasson took account of his own money book when making GBP LIBOR submissions. It is also relevant to note Mr Osborne’s unchallenged evidence that RBS’ submissions were well above its WAR on the dates of the entries and fell on 21 August and 16 September 2009, the days on which the reminders were intended to take effect. In the absence of data to support them, I do not place great weight upon Mr Thomasson’s possible explanations of the entries, which he says he cannot specifically recall, as being reminders of something specific in the market at the time. It seems to me that they were no more than speculation on his part. Having taken account of all the matters to which I have referred, including Mr Thomasson’s refutation of wrongdoing, on the balance of probabilities, I am not satisfied that the entries are evidence of account having been taken of trader positions when making GBP LIBOR submissions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the light of my conclusion that it is insufficient in order to prove trader manipulation in GBP LIBOR to seek to rely upon an inference drawn from conduct in relation to CHF LIBOR or JPY LIBOR, or for that matter, US$ LIBOR, I will not set out my conclusions in relation to each of the alleged examples of improper conduct in relation to those currencies in detail here. However, I should add that I accept Mr Walker’s explanation of his use of the phrase “to suit their books” in various communications. It seems to me that if that phrase was intended to refer to trader manipulation it would be reflected in a constantly changing LIBOR submissions, which it is accepted did not materialise. As to the conversations which occurred before the conference call with Brevan Howard, I take the same view as regards the US $ conduct. Even if the Brevan Howard conversations were sufficient evidence from which to decide on the balance of probabilities that improper manipulation had taken place in JPY LIBOR to the knowledge of Mr Nygaard, which I do not consider to be the case, it seems to me that it is not appropriate nor safe to conclude by way of inference on the balance of probabilities that Mr Nygaard engaged in or was aware of trader manipulation in relation to GBP LIBOR. However, if it were relevant I would have found that Nygaard’s explanation of the “Go Neil” comment which related to JPY LIBOR, was most unconvincing and I would have been unable to accept it.  </p>

Through no fault of their own, they had also undertaken a relatively academic exercise in the light of the fact that they had to create their own data set to establish a WAR which in itself was an artificial concept.

It is far from clear to me what the effect upon Mr Osborne’s conclusions would necessarily have been if there had been an opportunity for a more careful analysis. The attempt to re-interpret his results by the overlay of a line on his graph does not seem to me necessarily to be sound. It is neither expert evidence which has been properly tested nor is it necessarily consistent with the exercise in which the experts were engaged. It seems that a bid rate was imposed on top of Mr Osborne’s WAR calculation despite the fact that neither expert made an adjustment for bid or offer rates having merely processed data relating to transactions. In the circumstances, I am unable to draw any conclusions from Mr Lord’s submission or his change to Mr Osborne’s graph.  </p>

I agree that the communications such as “bronze medal spot” appear on the face of them to reflect a flexibility in the minds of Messrs Cummins and Nielsen in relation to the setting of GBP LIBOR which had the potential were it carried through, to be inconsistent with the requirements of the BBA Definition. I also accept Mr Walker’s explanation that the discussion was “all about funding”. However, although that may well have been the case, it seems to me that the level of LIBOR submissions is intrinsically linked to funding and vice versa. In my judgment, the exchange is evidence only of discussion and opposing opinions amongst senior executives. It is far from a request and there is no evidence to suggest that it was acted upon. On the contrary, Mr Walker’s recorded responses were to the effect that his LIBOR submissions were consistent with the business and that he applied the same 8 basis points spread as he had done before. It seems to me therefore, that at worst, the exchange evidences consideration of the possibility of what might have been low or highballing which was met by Mr Walker’s explanation.  </p>

I agree with Mr Handyside that in the light of the fact that it is not alleged that RBS employees were dishonest in following its procedures in relation to LIBOR setting at the time, PAG’s case rests on manual amendment and the evidence of Dr Cartea. It was not put to Mr Thomasson that he had “lowballed” and his evidence that manual amendment to the curve was rare was not challenged. Furthermore, I accept Mr Thomasson’s evidence that it would make no sense to set RBS’ LIBOR rates at levels which were other than in accordance with where he was actually funding his book because his primary objective was to fund the bank in the unsecured wholesale market and if it was submitting rates far away from the market, it would not have been able to fund itself.

First, on a proper construction of the BBA LIBOR Definition, viewed against the relevant factual matrix, in my judgment, it is not necessary for a Panel Bank to have been able to borrow money of the particular tenor and currency in order to make a submission at 11am on a particular day. Secondly, the evidence does not support the conclusion that each of the Relevant Individuals knew that the BBA Definition should be interpreted in the way in which PAG alleges. The evidence in relation to Messrs Thomasson, Walker and Nygaard is all in the other direction and it was never put to them that they knew that it was contrary to the BBA Definition to make submissions when there were no transactions. </p>

To put it another way, it is not a purely transactional benchmark. It refers to the rate at which a Panel bank “could” borrow “were it do so”. Such a conclusion is supported by the amplification of the definition found in the BBA Guidelines, albeit that they were produced in 2008, the first of which refers expressly to that bank's “perception of its cost of unsecured funds in the interbank market.” The same phrases are used in the BBA Terms of Reference at paragraph 2 and the BBA Guidelines both of which were produced in 2009.  </p>

First, in this regard, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that it is necessary to construe the Definition itself in the light of the relevant context. Both the Guidelines and the Terms of Reference post-date the Definition and therefore, are not contemporaneous context for the purposes of construing the Definition itself. However, on the basis that it is not suggested that the Definition changed in any way, they are nevertheless, useful benchmarks against which to measure any construction placed upon the Definition.  Secondly, and in any event, in my judgment, when the phrase “so far as is possible” in paragraph 2 of the BBA Terms of Reference is construed in the context of the paragraph as a whole, it is obvious that it refers to the phrase “a fair and accurate reflection of that bank’s opinion” as to the appropriate rate and not as to whether it is possible to submit a rate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On a proper construction therefore, it seems to me to be clear that LIBOR is not a “transaction based” benchmark but requires professional judgment to be exercised in order to arrive at the perception of a particular bank’s costs of unsecured funds. The bank is required to put forward its genuine assessment of the rate at which it could borrow. It requires a statement of professional judgment or opinion having taken account of all relevant factors including most recent trading. As the BBA Guidelines state expressly:  </p>

In my judgment, such a conclusion is not only highly unlikely but also is inconsistent with the BBA Definition itself, the way in which it was amplified to which I have referred and the Terms of Reference and Guidelines (neither of which are alleged to have changed the definition.) The Terms of Reference provide at paragraph 1 that the Panel Bank “must” make a submission each day in all currencies and tenors and at paragraph 2 addresses the situation in which the Panel Bank has no market offer. In such circumstances it states that it is “required to use its market knowledge to supply an appropriate rate that is, so far as is possible, a fair and accurate reflection of that bank’s opinion of its cost of funds. . .”. </p>

I agree with RBS therefore, that the phrase was shorthand for the state of affairs and had no further significance, in particular in the light of my decision as to the meaning of the BBA Definition.

He submits that there is no allegation that any of the Relevant Individuals was aware of the misconduct that RBS has admitted took place in relation to JPY and CHF LIBOR, there is also no allegation that any of those individuals (save for Mr Walker, who was called to give evidence) was aware of the three improper requests that RBS admits were made in relation to USD LIBOR, PAG’s allegations of fraud against the “senior executives” are confined to what is properly to be regarded as Financial Crisis Dislocation; RBS does not dispute that senior RBS individuals knew at the time of the Financial Crisis that there was a liquidity crisis in the money markets, and that that market stress was having knock-on effects on LIBOR; this knowledge was not only known to personnel at RBS: it was also known to every participant in the money markets (every bank, broker and building society); it was also known to the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve (and other central banks); and it was also known to the FSA and other regulators; the issue is not whether RBS (including at senior levels) knew about Financial Crisis Dislocation which is admitted. It is about the significance of that knowledge, and in particular whether it amounts to knowledge that LIBOR was being manipulated. The answer to that issue depends upon the meaning of the BBA Definition. Lastly, Mr Thomasson was called and it all turns on the state of his knowledge.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, I agree with Mr Handyside that it was not established in cross-examination that Messrs Nygaard, Thomasson and Walker intended PAG to rely upon the alleged LIBOR Representations. They were only asked to accept that a counterparty would assume the LIBOR Representations were being made which is insufficient for the purposes of a claim in fraud or deceit.  Further, although I accept Mr Handyside’s submission that it is not disputed that senior executives at RBS including Mr Cummins, Mr Nielsen and Mr Cameron were aware of the effects of financial crisis dislocation, as I have already mentioned, it seems to me that the failure to call any of them in addition to Messrs Walker and Nygaard to explain the “gold medal spot” and “play it straight” conversations is surprising. In the circumstances of this case, however, it seems to me that it is not possible to apply the formula described by Brooke LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Wiszniewski</span> case directly. In my judgment, neither email was direct evidence of lowballing or trader manipulation and I have decided that the financial crisis manipulation case is based upon a false construction of the BBA Definition. In the circumstances, therefore, although as I have already mentioned, the failure of Messrs Cameron and Nielsen to give evidence reflects no credit on RBS, I do not consider that the circumstances fall within the formula described by Brooke LJ and in any event, in all the circumstances, I would not have considered it appropriate to draw adverse inferences.  </p>

Had I done so, I would have concluded that it was clear that Mr Walker was aware of three improper requests but there was no evidence that he acted upon them.

It is said that PAG was, no doubt, biding its time and had there been a surge in interest rates prior to June 2011, would have chosen to keep the Swaps alive. In relation to knowledge, RBS relies upon: Mr Russell’s acceptance in cross-examination that by January 2010, he had already started consulting lawyers about the situation; his evidence that by March 2010 he had been to see counsel; the reference in Mr Priest’s email to a Robert Palache of 15 September 2010 in which he states that much of the day had been spent with counsel; the fact that by October 2010, Mr Russell had written to George Osborne MP setting out PAG’s complaints about RBS in broad terms;  on 7 December 2010 Mr Priest informed RBS that PAG had received legal advice on the hedging arrangements; and in January 2011, confirmed that it had “consulted counsel in Manchester and in leading chambers in London”. RBS submits therefore, that PAG was aware of the facts giving rise to its current claims and of its alleged right to rescind by September 2010 at the latest.  </p>

In any event, he says that it is hard to see how breaking the Swaps could represent an unequivocal statement of PAG’s intention to continue them. Furthermore, he says that describing breaking the Swaps as an unequivocal statement of PAG’s intention to proceed with them is novel and that making payments under them cannot be an unequivocal statement.  </p>

It arose from a joint venture between PAG and Moorfields in 2009 under which it was agreed to look for and co-invest in commercial real estate developments. The Heads of Terms provided that a separate special purpose vehicle would be created for each project and that PAG would participate itself, through a subsidiary or a company controlled by Mr Russell. In August 2011, an exclusive right to purchase the site in order to redevelop and sell it, was acquired. The total cost was estimated to be £49.6m of which equity would need to be £26.1m. Under the proposed joint venture, it was necessary to provide at least £2.61m being 10% of the equity capital but there was an option to provide 25% being £6.525m. In fact, the entire equity amount was put forward by Moorfield. However, PAG Ventures Ltd entered into an asset and property management agreement with Moorfield under which it was entitled to a management and a success fee on the development of the project.  As a result, in December 2014, PAG Ventures Ltd received £0.529 million by way of management fee and £1.791 million by way of success fee.  </p>

Mr Mesher took the actual sale proceeds and assessed the return if the investment had been made, plus a £0.519m management fee, an approach which is not challenged by Mr Lawler. Mr Mesher accepted in the experts’ joint statement that PAG may have been able to make funds available to invest in the project even with the Swaps in place, if the project had been carried out in isolation.  </p>

It is common ground that PAG Ventures is 70% owned by members of Mr Russell’s family and has no connection with PAG other than the fact that it was for practical purposes under the control of Mr Russell. Mr Wyse explained in cross-examination that PAG Ventures had been set up on the advice of PAG’s accountants and that it was the trading arm of the business, PAG being the property investment business. It is submitted that PAG Ventures only became involved when the deal changed and it became necessary to take a management role more suited to a trading company.

PAG’s offer for the site was accepted at £1.75m in April 2010, and Mr Wyse explained that it was intended to develop it and keep it as an investment. Total development costs were estimated at £7.85m. Barclays Bank agreed to provide indicative finance on the basis that it was 100% let or £4.3m on the basis that it was 50% let.  In fact, it was not possible to pre-let the entire building although heads of terms had been agreed with two tenants and negotiations were in train with two more. Mr Wyse accepted that there was a £3.5m shortfall in funding. PAG was not able to make good the shortfall and withdrew from the project. It was Mr Mesher’s view that PAG had suffered a £3.02m loss based on its own contemporaneous project proposals. The experts also agreed that funding of £2.7m would have been required by PAG if the project was not fully pre-let.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">RBS submits that it is not credible that PAG would have proceeded with the project but for the Swaps for three main reasons. The first is that it was inconsistent with PAG’s business model of concentrating on pre-let and pre-funded development opportunities and therefore, PAG would not have invested in the Royal Mail site without it being fully pre-let. Reliance was placed on a presentation for potential investors produced in late 2010 in which reference is made to PAG having “restarted development activity, but only where the property is at a minimum substantially prelet.” Mr Handyside reminds me that Mr Wyse accepted in cross-examination that “we would have preferred pre-lets.” He went on to add that “we may well have started it if it was substantially pre-let.” The second alleged reason which is linked to the first, is that it was Mr Coulter’s evidence that no prudent developer would have proceeded with the project with only two floors pre-let, especially as in this case, if they were the middle two floors.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, RBS contends that the potential profit was too low for the risk which the project entailed. Mr Coulter calculated the potential profit at £643,000 which Mr Wyse accepted would probably not be enough to warrant the investment. PAG’s own estimate of rent and yield percentage had revealed a greater figure. However, there was no expert evidence in support. In fact, the differences in the figures are not that great. In relation to the supermarket, Mr Coulter took a rental figure of £55,000 instead of the £80,000 per annum figure which was being used in discussions with Tesco and Sainsburys which he viewed as mere discussions. In relation to the gym space, the real difference was as to yield. PAG used 7.55% and Mr Coulter 8%. </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">However, none of Mr Coulter’s comparables resulted in a percentage as high as 8% and he accepted that each of them were in very different locations. Further the national average yield at the time was 7.6%. Mr Coulter suggested in crossexamination that the Stockport economy was weaker and therefore the higher yield percentage was justified. As to the call centre, Mr Coulter had adopted a lower rent per annum than PAG but accepted that he had not taken into consideration the fact that it was intended to provide a car park on the site.  He also adopted a higher yield percentage and gave as his comparable a smaller property in Nottingham. In crossexamination he said that it was too crude an indicator purely to rely upon the size of property and that the kind of rent which was being suggested was very substantial for space in Stockport. Lastly, in relation to the office space, there was disagreement both in relation to rental value and yield, the former being explained in part by Mr Coulter having taken a smaller square footage into account. PAG factored in a greater area on the basis that it intended to extend the floor in question. In relation to the yield, Mr Coulter stated that he had taken into account the location and the mixture of tenants in the building.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, RBS submits that the inability to invest was not caused by the Swaps. However, it was Mr Mesher’s view that PAG would have been able to fund the project (in isolation), if it had not entered into the Swaps and Mr Lawler agreed with him. However, it was Mr Lawler’s evidence that it would have been “more challenging” to have funded the £3.58m needed for the partially let project, and he was unable to confirm that it could have funded this from its own resources. However, given PAG’s expected rate of return, he considered that it would have been to its advantage to dispose of a less profitable investment in order to invest in the Royal Mail site. In cross-examination, Mr Lawler suggested that PAG might have funded the additional £500,000 over and above its cash reserves of £3m from cash flow but accepted that he had not conducted the necessary analysis. The cumulative payments it had made under the Swaps by 16 April 2010 totalled £2.298m and the required investment was £3.5m. It submits that together with the £3m cash reserves it would clearly have had sufficient monies to have made the investment.  </p>

It was intended to be pursued as a joint venture and the PAG entity which appeared in the draft documentation including the Heads of Terms was PAG Ventures. In fact, in re-examination Mr Wyse explained that a subsidiary of PAG Ventures had been inserted in the execution version of the partnership deed and that it was intended that an SPV named Piccadilly 1216 Ltd would be used for the transaction and then transferred to PAG. However, the transfer did not take place. It was intended that £400,000 be invested for a 1.98% equity stake.  In relation to the Yotel project, however, the experts agreed that PAG made a profit of £396,000. Mr Mesher considered however, that PAG had suffered a loss of £1.26 million whereas in Mr Lawler’s opinion, PAG had not demonstrated any loss because PAG appears to have had adequate cash available to invest in the project notwithstanding its liability under the Swaps. Further, Mr Mesher relied on the contemporaneous project appraisals produced by PAG to arrive at his view of loss whereas Mr Lawler took account of the fact that Mr Coulter, the property expert instructed on behalf of RBS, considered the project was unlikely to have been viable. The experts agreed nevertheless that the evidence suggests that funds of approximately £400,000 were required to fund the minimum investment by PAG and that PAG would have been likely to be able to make these funds available even with the Swaps in place. </p>

RBS submits on the other hand that there was no need to sell in the light of the fact that PAG had £3m cash reserves in 2013 and £16m in 2014.  Based on Mr Roper’s report, Mr Mesher calculates a loss of £1.76m being the value of the site at the date of sale as £8.52m less the actual proceeds of sale being £6.76m, whereas Mr Coulter considers that the site has increased in value by less than £500,000. The real differences arise from two factors. First, Mr Roper proceeded on the basis that all necessary remedial work on the site had already been carried out and that there were two reports including warranties to that effect, whereas Mr Coulter had made a “prudent allocation” in that regard. In cross-examination he stated that he had allowed for the potential need for further compaction. Secondly, Mr Roper had allowed an 18 month period for construction requiring 6 months of bank financing rather than a three year period requiring 18 months of finance. However, in cross-examination Mr  Coulter maintained that although it was “to some degree crystal ball gazing” that three years had been a sensible build period to adopt, despite the fact that it had actually taken less time.  </p>

He accepted that he had not exhibited the recent house sale figures from which he had derived the calculations in his report. Further, his evidence was that the lowest actual Land Registry figure for a sale was £71,245, and yet the lowest figure which he used in his hypothetical calculations was £99,688. Further, one of the principal differences between Mr Coulter’s and Mr Roper’s calculations was the site preparation cost, Mr Roper having adopted a figure of £2,500 against Mr Coulter’s figure of £5,000.  Mr Roper’s figure is based on an assumption that there were “no special foundation/groundworks required”. He subsequently claimed to have considered the matter and decided that, in the light of two REC reports, there was in fact no remediation cost and stated in crossexamination that he had “seen videos” of the remediation work. The REC reports for 2013 in fact make recommendations for special care to be taken for future work. Mr Coulter on the other hand, has obtained evidence from knowledgeable experts and given the question proper consideration.  </p>

Was it the conduct of RBS which caused the sale? In his statement, Mr Wyse explained that it was pressure created by the Swaps and PAG’s treatment in GRG which had necessitated the sale. PAG had £3m cash reserves at the time and it is said therefore, had no need to sell. In cross-examination, Mr Wyse’s response was that PAG was seeking to generate additional cash which it thought it would need. The decision to sell came in July 2013 and PAG submits that it is to be noted that this was shortly after GRG had indicated that there would be a valuation of PAG’s portfolio and that it would have to re-finance its borrowing with another bank on the expiry of the facilities in June 2014.  </p>

Ultimately, Dr Cartea concluded in the Joint Report that the “true” BBA LIBOR was either 20, 30, 40 or 50 basis points higher than the published BBA Rate, giving a loss range of £386,755.09 to £932,934.45.  </p>

It was also pointed out that such an assumption turns on it being necessary to make a LIBOR submission every day which is contrary to the remainder of PAG’s case. Secondly, Dr Cartea had rounded up the number of basis points by which there was allegedly under-reporting on the 80 negative variance days. Thirdly, the use of an average under-reporting figure is said to be unsound where under-reporting can only have an effect on specific reset days under the Swaps. Fourthly, the same average was even applied on days when under-reporting had been found by Dr Cartea but at a different rate. Fifthly, he assumed that all banks were lowballing by the same average amount. </p>

However, I have already decided that the assumptions upon which his WAR was based were unreliable and therefore, I would have preferred Mr Osborne’s conclusion. Mr Osborne’s evidence was there would have been no change to 3M GBP LIBOR and therefore, no loss.  </p>

Contributor banks will be constantly in touch with clients and intermediaries and the information that they receive from them will naturally contribute to a bank's perception of its cost of funds. However, contributors should not ask intermediaries where they believe LIBOR rates will set on a given day and use this as a basis for submissions. This misses the point of the benchmark, and is a circular process that would rapidly lead to inaccurate rates. </p>

However, that does not necessarily mean that they should raise or drop their rates to these levels. LIBOR is the rate at which an individual Contributor Panel bank could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in reasonable market size, just prior to 11.00 London time. That is, it is the rate a bank could take funds at an arbitrary time in the market, not the rate that one institution will show money to a contributor whose name they are specifically looking for at a particular moment.  </p>

None of these are a perfect proxy for a bank's risk, because they lag, or are not accurate, or are mis-applied as measures of the cost of funds to a bank. Nevertheless, in the event of a significant event, such as an upgrade or downgrade from a major credit rating agency, contributing banks should be comfortable that they are able to justify their contributions in the light of any such change.  </p>
