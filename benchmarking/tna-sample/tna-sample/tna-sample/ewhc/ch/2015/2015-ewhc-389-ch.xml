	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">There has been disagreement between IBM, on the one hand, and the Trustee and the Representative Beneficiaries, on the other hand, about the meaning of what I said in certain parts of the Judgment and about precisely what conclusions I have reached as a matter of binding decision.  The authorities establish, I consider, that I am able, before judgment is entered (that is to say, before any order is sealed) to give further clarification of the Judgment and to correct any errors and eliminate inconsistencies.  The court has an untrammelled inherent jurisdiction to amplify its reasons and clarify the meaning of its judgment at any time prior to the sealing of its order: see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Paulin v Paulin </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 221; [2009] 3 All ER 88.  Indeed, there is even jurisdiction to alter an actual decision (see <span style="font-style:italic">In re L (Children) (Preliminary Finding: Power to Reverse) </span>[2013] UKSC 8; [2013] 1 WLR 634) although it is not, as will be seen, necessary for me to exercise that jurisdiction in the present case.  That case shows that the exercise of this power is not restricted only to exceptional circumstances.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The lack of clarity in the Judgment arises out of my consideration of the separate elements which went to make up Project Waltz.  In carrying out that exercise, I considered the 2009 NPAs “in isolation”.  I used those words in different ways in different paragraphs of the Judgment.  In doing so, I have caused some confusion.  As well as causing confusion, I may have said, in using those words, certain things which read literally do not reflect my true views.  The difficulties were raised at the hearing in June.  I did not consider it appropriate to deal with these difficulties at that hearing, considering that the matter should be left for fuller argument at the remedies hearing, although I did give some indications of my then thinking.  Having heard submissions about what the parties consider I did mean by what I said and what is, and is not, open for me to clarify or even review, I am now in position to deal with the confusion which I engendered.  I propose to clarify matters by considering each of the paragraphs of the Judgment which might be seen as giving rise to confusion or even inconsistency and, in so doing, state, or restate, my conclusions.  I will refer to paragraphs of the Judgment thus: Judgment [xxx].</p>

By that, I mean (and meant in the Judgment) to include not only the 5 elements identified at Judgment [19], but all the surrounding circumstances of Project Waltz, the purposes which it was designed to achieve and the method and strategies involved in attempting to achieve those purposes.  In this context, the 2010 and 2011 NPAs form part of Project Waltz.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">At Judgment [1511], I said that there can be no doubt that the Project Waltz changes conflicted with the Reasonable Expectations which I had identified.  There were three factors which I mentioned expressly in support of that conclusion: active members of the DB Plans would (i) cease to accrue further DB benefits from 6 April 2011 (ii) obtain no salary increases in the future (notwithstanding that Mr Riley had announced increases for 2009) unless they entered into the 2009 NPAs albeit that, after the initial announcement, the “future” in this context was limited to 2009 to 2011 with a review thereafter and (iii) be subject to the detrimental change in ER policy.  Enhanced M Plan members would also be subject to (iii). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in"> Mr Newman suggests that item (ii) should be omitted from that list because there was no Reasonable Expectation that there would be any salary increase at all.  But that is not the point: the point is that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> a salary increase were granted, it would not be pensionable.  Following Soto, members had a Reasonable Expectation that benefit accrual would continue at least until April 2011 so that, if salary increases were in fact awarded, they would be pensionable in part.  To put that in different words, the members had a Reasonable Expectation that salary increases would be pensionable; the 2009 NPAs displaced (to use a neutral word) that Reasonable Expectation even if it is right to say that the member was not entitled to any salary increase and had no Reasonable Expectation that he would receive any.  This is not to say that this displacement was a breach of duty.  That is a question which I addressed later in the Judgment.  I should add that I did not, in the Judgment, identify the pensionability of salary increases as giving rise to a separate Reasonable Expectation.  It is, however, a necessary part of the Reasonable Expectation that benefit accrual would continue in relation to salary, because the increase is part of the salary.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I did not, in that paragraph, use the words “in isolation” although the words “separately” and “by itself” have much the same flavour.  In referring to each element separately, I was intending to identify each element of Project Waltz with a view to considering whether that element, viewed apart from Project Waltz as a whole, would have given rise to a breach of duty.  I was therefore drawing a distinction between each element in the context of Project Waltz as a whole and (counterfactually) that same element apart from Project Waltz.  I was not, however, at this stage of the Judgment, drawing a distinction between two different scenarios: the first (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Scenario A</span>”) is one where, ignoring the other elements of Project Waltz, each element is to be considered in the context of the Reasonable Expectations which were established; the second (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Scenario B</span>”) is one where not only are those other elements to be ignored but also each element is to be considered on the assumption that no Reasonable Expectations at all had been established.   Under Scenario B, there might be a breach of duty quite apart from any Reasonable Expectation.  This could have been so, for instance, in relation to the earlier 2009 NPAs (and the same goes for the 2011 NPAs) which were unlimited in duration: this is the caveat mentioned in Judgment [1521].  Of course, a breach of duty under Scenario B would necessarily be a breach of duty in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.   When I said that each element must be considered separately, the enquiry could embrace both Scenario A and Scenario B.</p>

I did not distinguish between Scenario A and Scenario B in that paragraph.  The words “in isolation” would subsume both Scenarios.  The rest of that paragraph and also Judgment [1517] and [1518] are concerned with Mr Tennet’s submission that there was a separate Reasonable Expectation engendered by Ocean and Soto that members would not be treated differently so far as concerned pay increases depending on their election in 2006.  I stated that if there was an entitlement to pay increases such as Mr Tennet maintained, it did not arise as the result of a separate Reasonable Expectation but would be the result of the Reasonable Expectations actually established (in the context of and taking into account Project Waltz as a whole).  I left that issue for a further hearing.  Viewing the different elements “in isolation” did not feature in this part of my reasoning.</p>

In using the words “in isolation” in that passage, I did not need to distinguish between Scenario A and Scenario B since the hypothesis here was that there were no Reasonable Expectations at all engendered by Ocean and Soto.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The last sentence of Judgment [1519] uses the words “in isolation” again.  It is this which gives rise to some confusion.  What I was attempting to say was that, given the counterfactual hypothesis that the Reasonable Expectations summarised in Judgment [1510] had not been established, and given that the further Reasonable Expectation concerning salary increases had not been established, there would be nothing on which to base the assertion that the 2009 NPAs gave rise to a breach of duty “in isolation”.  If, as I fear is the case, it is not clear what I meant by “in isolation” at that point of the Judgment, I should say that this should be taken as a reference to Scenario B.  I did not intend to say anything about the position under Scenario A<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>still less about the position taking the 2009 NPAs in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.  In any event, whatever uncertainty there may be arising from the words I actually used, it is clear, reading Judgment [1518] and [1519] together that I was not saying anything in the latter to preclude the argument which I had identified at the end of the former.  As to Judgment [1521], what I said here was a caveat to the proposition that, absent any Reasonable Expectations and so that the words “in isolation” refer to Scenario B, there would  be no breach of duty.</p>

I held that Holdings was in breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty so far as concerns accrual of benefits and change in ER policy and of its contractual duty of trust and confidence so far as concerns the 2009 NPAs.  It was, I consider, implicit in that, and if it was not, I now make it an express finding that the 2009 NPAs, viewed as a separate element of Project Waltz but in the context of Project Waltz as a whole, gave rise to a breach of the contractual duty. In other words, if one asks whether the NPAs gave rise to a breach of contract, the answer was “Yes” in the context of Project Waltz as a whole, and not in isolation under either Scenario A or Scenario B.  I did not state in this paragraph that the 2009 NPAs viewed under Scenario A gave rise to a breach of the contractual duty although in Judgment [1515] I had already held that to be the position absent the global and local strands.  I indicated in Judgment [1528], although this was merely <span style="font-style:italic">obiter </span>at that stage, that the NPAs would not have given rise to a breach of the contractual duty under Scenario B.</p>

Judgment [1534] is my primary finding that Project Waltz as a whole gave rise to breaches of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and the contractual duty.  Judgment [1535] then goes on to consider each element of Project Waltz viewed “in isolation” and I answered Issues 4.1 to 4.5 in that context.  However, that was not what Issues 4.1 to 4.5, as formulated by the parties in the List of Issues were directed at, whether on Scenario A or Scenario B.  Rather those Issues were directed at whether each element of Project Waltz constituted a breach of duty when viewed in the context of Project Waltz as a whole and in the light of established Reasonable Expectations.  By diverting myself to a slightly different question, namely whether each element was a breach of duty when viewed “in isolation” (whether I was thinking of Scenario A or Scenario B is something I will come to), I failed to answer the actual Issues raised.  However, to be fair to myself, I think that the answers to those Issues are implicit in Judgment [1534] in the light of the lengthy analysis which I had carried out earlier in the Judgment; in particular, Judgment [1528] discussed above shows that I considered the 2009 NPAs to give rise to a breach of the contractual duty.</p>

Clearly, I was not intending to say anything contrary to the analysis which I had carried out earlier, in particular Judgment [1528].  In saying that the Later 2009 NPAs did not breach Holdings’ duties, I was addressing the position under Scenario B.  I accept that this is not clear from what I actually wrote, but I certainly did not intend to say that, taking account of the established Reasonable Expectations, there was no breach (although I did not decide to the contrary either).  To read what I said as deciding that there was no breach even taking account of the established Reasonable Expectations (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>Scenario A) would be inconsistent with what I said in Judgment [1517] and [1518] leaving open the argument (for a further hearing) that DB members had an entitlement to the same pay increases as DC members.</p>

It was necessarily implicit, however, in my findings at Judgment [1511 i)] (in relation to benefit accrual) and [1535 i)] (in relation to the Exclusion Notices) that the Reasonable Expectation endured for some period beyond 6 April 2011, a period sufficient for there to have been a breach of duty (and thus not for a simply <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> period).  It was, and is, my view that that is so and I should have said so expressly.  However, I did not need to decide the question of how much later the Reasonable Expectation could be said to endure and there is nothing express or implied in the Judgment to indicate my conclusion about that.  I will refer to the date beyond which the Reasonable Expectation concerning future benefit accrual did not continue as “<span style="font-weight:bold">the Longstop Date</span>”.  I will address later in this judgment the question of the Longstop Date: see at paragraph 426<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>below, although I mention that it is common ground that (on the basis of the Judgment and therefore subject to any appeal) this is no later than 31 March 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The “implied obligation of good faith” is how Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C described the contractual duty of trust and confidence in <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial Tobacco</span>: see at p 597.  This was the term referred to by Knox J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hillsdown Holdings </span>which I referred to in Judgment [353].  I described a different phrase "the implied duty [rather than obligation] of good faith and, perhaps begging a question, described that as a duty arising in a pensions context, using words reflecting the contractual duty.  In doing so, I am guilty of some inaccuracy in Judgment [353] and [354] since Knox J was clearly referring to the contractual duty whereas the reader of the Judgment might think he was referring to the implied obligation under a pension scheme.  But as I said in Judgment [354], Mr Simmonds himself used the words “<span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty” and that was clearly in contradistinction to the contractual duty.  When I used those words, I certainly intended them to be a reference to the implication into the trust deed and rules of the limitation described by the Vice-Chancellor.  I was, I can now see, eliding to a greater extent than perhaps I should have the content of the contractual duty with the limitation on the employer’s powers.  I do not think anything turns on that elision for the purposes of the Judgment since the issue was always the extent to which the limitation was not observed, that is to say whether Holdings had conducted itself “in a manner calculated <span style="font-style:italic">etc….</span>”.  But the matter is now brought into sharper focus by the submission which Mr Simmonds makes to the effect that the Imperial duty is not a duty at all but simply a limitation on the exercise of powers, a submission which has an impact on the availability of any financial remedy for failure to observe the limitation.  I will be dealing with that submission in due course.  I shall, nonetheless, continue to use the phrase “the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty”, intending it to refer not only to the limitation itself but also to the obligations, such as they are, which are imposed on the employer as a result of that limitation when it comes to the exercise of a power under the trust deed and rules.  Further, as explained in paragraph <span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal">431</span><span class="Strong"> below, the same limitation is to be implied in relation to other functions of an employer under the pension scheme so that, in using the phrase "the Imperial duty", I intend it to include, also, that limitation and the obligations arising from it.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">To recap, the position in relation to the 2009 NPAs is that, viewed in the context of Project Waltz as a whole and in the light of the Reasonable Expectations which I have held to arise, both the Initial and the Later 2009 NPAs were procured by Holdings in breach of its contractual duty of trust and confidence: see Judgment [1528] and [1534].  Further, the Initial 2009 NPAs viewed in a counterfactual context where there was no Project Waltz and no Reasonable Expectations (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>Scenario B described in paragraph 8<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>above) involved a breach of the contractual duty by Holdings because of the indication or threat that there would be no salary increases at any time in the future for members who did not sign up to the 2009 NPAs: see Judgment [1535ii)].  That finding was quite independent of the established Reasonable Expectations.  I made no decision about whether the Later 2009 NPAs would have given rise to a breach of duty under Scenario A (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>looked at in the context of the Reasonable Expectations established but ignoring the other elements of Project Waltz).

It is not surprising that the parties did not draw any such distinction.  The whole concept of viewing various elements of Project Waltz in the way I did – that is to say as something independent of Project Waltz itself – was mine.  Having used the concept in the way which I did, it is only right that both sides should be entitled to address such arguments as they wish in relation to the validity of the 2010 and 2011 NPAs under either Scenario A or Scenario B.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">When it comes to remedies, Mr Stallworthy submits that the right approach is to view the Project Waltz changes as a whole and in the light of the established Reasonable Expectations consistently with the approach to the issues of breach of duty.  I agree with that submission.  It reflects with what I said at Judgment [1512] (which I have mentioned at paragraph 8<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>above where I explained why it was appropriate to consider each element of Project Waltz separately).  This was not to cut down, in any way, the circumstances where a breach of the contractual duty of trust and confidence or of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty might be found.  Rather, there were two reasons to consider the elements of Project Waltz separately: first, because an element of Project Waltz might, of itself, give rise to a breach of duty (as I have held to be the case in relation to the Initial 2009 NPAs); and secondly because, in considering remedies, it is important to know what Holdings could have done to avoid a breach of duty.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">He submits that it is a wrong approach, one which is neither appropriate or of assistance, to consider, as I did in the Judgment, the different elements of Project Waltz in isolation (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>under either Scenario A or Scenario B).  He is, I have no doubt, right to say that the remedies to which the RBs are entitled must be assessed by reference to Project Waltz overall and its cumulative effect.  In introducing into the Judgment consideration of each element “in isolation” I certainly did not intend (and do not consider that I actually did so) to say that the remedy for breach of duty was to be assessed by an accumulation of separate remedies for each element which, by itself, would have given rise to a breach (whether under Scenario A or Scenario B).  But that is not to say, in my view, that it is inappropriate and of no assistance to see what the effect of each element might be taken by itself particularly if such examination reveals that an element, taken by itself, constitutes a breach of duty quite apart from its context within Project Waltz. </p>

In contrast, if an element of Project Waltz is, under Scenario B, of itself a breach of duty, then no amount of elimination of other objectionable elements will render that element unobjectionable.  This is the case, for example, in relation to the Initial 2009 NPAs which I have held to give rise to a breach of duty under Scenario B (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>even in the absence of any Reasonable Expectation and ignoring the other elements of Project Waltz).</p>

Perhaps (in the case of the RBs) this was out of fear that I would not focus on the real question (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>what is the remedy for the breach to which Project Waltz as a whole gives rise in the context of the established Reasonable Expectations) but instead look for a remedy in relation to each element separately; and (in the case of Holdings) that it was with a view to improving its position by persuading me to adopt precisely that (in my view erroneous) latter approach.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">The starting point in addressing these issues is that all of the 2009 NPAs took place in the context of Project Waltz.  In that context they all gave rise to a breach of duty as held in the Judgment.  In addition, I have, earlier in this judgment, clarified the Judgment in relation to the Initial 2009 NPAs to indicate that the Initial 2009 NPAs would “in isolation” under Scenario B (and <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> under Scenario A) have involved Holdings in a breach of its contractual duty of trust and confidence: the breach here was “presenting the members with the choice of signing non-pensionability agreements or receiving no pay increases at all in future”.  As I shall explain below, it is common ground, and I accept, that the NPAs did not themselves amount to binding contracts.  A contract came into being only when an actual salary increase was offered and accepted.  The implementation of the NPAs in the context of actual salary increases subject to the non-pensionability term was as much part of Project Waltz as the NPAs themselves and was all part and parcel of the conduct which gave rise to the breach of duty.  In particular, it was a breach of duty for Holdings (for all of the 2009 NPAs in the context of Project Waltz and for the Initial 2009 NPAs even in isolation) to offer salary increases only on terms that they would be non-pensionable and, accordingly, the actual introduction of such a term into the varied contracts of employments was also part and parcel of that breach of duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">Mr Newman suggests that I did not, in the Judgment, make any finding that the variation to the employment contract, or the collateral contract as he would have it, gave rise to a breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence.  I did not say so in so many words.  This was because the whole focus of the debate before me was on the NPAs themselves.  It goes without saying, in my view, that if the procuring of the NPAs was a breach of duty in the context of Project Waltz as a whole, so too was the procuring of the actual contracts giving effect to the protocol which the NPAs laid down.  It also goes without saying, in my view, that if the NPAs gave rise to a breach of duty in isolation (whether under Scenario A or Scenario B) then the actual contracts would do so too.  If it does not go without saying, then I say it now and hold that a contractual variation following on from an NPA was as much a breach of duty (or component of the overall breach of duty arising as a result of Project Waltz as a whole) as the NPA itself.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">The Trustee’s primary contention is that the 2009 NPAs are unenforceable.  Its fallback position is that they are void or voidable and liable to be set aside.  Quite what these words (void, voidable, unenforceable) mean in the context of the NPAs is something I will come to in a moment.  Holdings’ position is that the NPAs are all valid (and this is so notwithstanding that they give rise to breaches of duty in the context of Project Waltz as a whole and, in the case of the Initial 2009 NPAs notwithstanding that they would give rise to breaches of duty even in isolation).   Mr Newman submits that, in any event, it would not make any difference to the outcome if they were void or voidable.  As to salary increases, the Trustee’s position is that salary increases actually awarded to affected members are pensionable whereas Holdings’ position is that they are non-pensionable since that was the basis on which they were awarded.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">It needs to be borne in mind throughout the discussion that the Trustee was not a party to the NPAs.  So far as the Trustee is concerned, the benefits to which members are entitled are to be found in the provisions of the Plans of which the affected members were members (taking account of the validity of otherwise or the Exclusion Notices in accordance with my answers to Issues 13 to 18).  It is only if, and to the extent that, the Trustee is obliged or is able to give effect to a contract made between Holdings and an affected member (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the terms of any salary increase subject to the NPAs) that the actual benefits payable to a member can properly be other than the benefits for which the Plans provide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">It is Holdings’ position that the NPAs of themselves were not contracts.  This is said to be so because Holdings gave no consideration for them.  The Trustee did not contend that that was not a possible analysis.  The RBs presented an alternative analysis that the NPAs were contracts supported by consideration that members would not be rendered ineligible for salary increases.  I consider Holdings’ position to be correct.  I am not sure that much turns on this since the important point is to establish the terms on which the salary increases were in fact offered.  Even if there was a contract, as the RBs contend, and even if that contract is void or voidable as a contract, it does not follow that the terms of the (void/voidable) contract cannot, nonetheless, form the basis on which an actual salary increase is offered.  Ordinarily, a salary increase once awarded (unless and until it is somehow set aside) gives rise, I consider, to a variation in the contract of employment: it is not a free-standing contract that, in return for continuing to work, the employee will receive payment of a sum of money <span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the amount of the increase.  In my view, it makes no difference that, in the present case, a salary increase is awarded to a member on terms that the increase is subject to the non-pensionability term.  Further, the non-pensionability term itself is also to be given effect, if it is valid, as part of the contract in accordance with which the member receives the salary increase and therefore as a variation of the terms of the employment contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">I have referred above to a variation in the terms of the employment contracts.  I do not overlook Mr Newman’s submission that this is not a correct categorisation of the offer and acceptance (on the terms of the NPAs) of a salary increase.  He says that there is simply a collateral contract.  The reason he draws the distinction between a variation and a collateral contract is because he perceives it as strengthening Holdings’ position when it comes to remedies: if there is only a collateral contract, then it is easy to set the whole contract aside if the Trustee is correct in saying that the non-pensionability term cannot be relied on by Holdings whereas this is more difficult in the context of a variation to the employment contract itself.  I do not, myself, think it makes any difference which analysis is correct.  An important part of the Trustee’s case is that the consideration for the salary increase is not only the non-pensionability term but the employee continuing to provide his services.  Mr Newman’s case, it appears to me, sidelines that point by focusing on an alleged collateral contract which does not itself include that element of the consideration.  If that is wrong, and the analysis does make a difference, it is my judgment that the salary increase and the non-pensionability term take effect as variations to the contract of employment and not as merely a collateral agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">To explain that last proposition, the Trustee’s case (with which I agree) is that, where a salary increase is accepted as part and parcel of a valid package including a term that it will be non-pensionable, it is at that stage that there is a binding contract.  I do not understand Mr Newman to disagree with that, his point (which I have just rejected) being that there is a collateral contract rather than a variation of the original contact.  In <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains Ltd v Wightman </span>[1998] PLR 113 (“<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">South West Trains</span>”), the salary increase was offered on terms, and the acceptance of the offer gave rise to a contract under which the salary increase was subject to those terms (there being no issue of invalidity similar to that in the present case).  The position was the same in <span style="font-style:italic">Bradbury v British Broadcasting Corporation </span>[2012] PLR 283 (“<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bradbury</span>”) although I have recently held a further hearing on the question whether the BBC was in breach of its duty of trust and confidence; judgment is reserved.  Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Trustees of the NUS Officials and Employees Superannuation Scheme v Pensions Ombudsman </span>[2002] PLR 93<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(the “<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">NUS</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> case</span>”), the employee, Mr Allen, received a salary increase which was given to him on the express terms that it would not be pensionable.  The Pensions Ombudsman concluded that, unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains</span>, there had been no binding contract between Mr Allen and his employer.  Lightman J disagreed.  He held that Mr Allen had received an offer with </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">Further, Lightman J concluded that Mr Allen had accepted the offer because “he accepted payment of the increase and both he and the RMT continued to make pension contributions on the basis that the increase did not constitute part of Mr Allen’s basic salary for pension purposes.”  I agree with Mr Spink when he submits that the contractual analysis must be that the agreement reached between Mr Allen and his employer varied his contract of employment; the variation included (i) an agreement by the RMT to pay an increased salary and (ii) an agreement by Mr Allen that the increase should not be pensionable.   The salary increase clearly takes effect as a variation and since Lightman J held the two terms to be interdependent and not susceptible to severance it must follow that the non-pensionability agreement also became a term of the employment contract as varied.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">Like Mr Spink, Mr Newman says that there is no contract because there is no consideration moving from Holdings to the affected member: by signing an NPA, the employee is not getting anything to which he or she was not otherwise entitled.  That is not to say, on Mr Newman’s case, that the NPAs are not valid for what they are <span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> a statement of Holdings’ intention: it is simply that they are not valid and enforceable as contracts.  The NPAs are in the nature of a protocol or convention being laid down by Holdings as employer as to the interpretation of salary increase offers in the future. Whilst employee agreement was sought, because the formulation of salary increase offers is a matter for Holdings alone, no such agreement was in fact legally necessary.  As to that, I accept, of course, that no such prior agreement was necessary: as <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Bradbury </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">NUS </span>case show, the contractual relationship can arise at the same time as the award of the salary increase itself.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">It follows from the fact that the NPAs are not contractually binding that members are free to retract their agreement at any time.  Mr Spink qualifies this by saying “at least before the first salary increase is given” although for my part I cannot see why each proposed salary increase should not be treated independently for this purpose.  I will come to this in more detail later, but one of Mr Spink’s submissions is that the members who sent protest emails did vary or qualify their agreement so that Holdings cannot say, in relation to them, that salary increases were given only on the basis that they were non-pensionable.  He also submits (again I will come to this in more detail) that the NPAs cannot be relied on by Holdings because they gave rise to a breach of duty on the part of Holdings.  He relies on what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Bradbury,</span> namely that “the BBC ought not to be able to rely on a contract between it and a Member of the Scheme, the imposition of which would have given rise to a breach of any of the Implied Duties”.  What I did not say there, however, was anything about the impact on the salary increase awarded if the recipient of it subsequently sought to prevent the employer from relying on the agreement: it might be said that if Mr Bradbury sought to prevent the BBC from relying on his side of the bargain, so too the BBC ought not to be held to its side of the bargain.</p>

But I should not be taken as accepting the proposition that any non-pensionability agreement which one might come across in relation to other employers and other pension schemes and which is entered into (like the NPAs in the present case) in advance of any actual salary increase proposal, is necessarily non-contractual.

The answer to the question of unenforceability is informed, however, by considerations which go to whether the NPAs and ensuring contracts are void or voidable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">In the case of a document which creates or varies (or purports to do so) legal or equitable rights and obligations, it makes sense to talk about the document, or certain of its provisions, being void or voidable or unenforceable.  A document which is void is a nullity in terms of creating those rights and obligations; it is as if the document had never been entered into and as a result the rights of third parties may be adversely affected.  A document which is voidable may be voidable in whole or in part and it may, to some extent, be set aside on terms; third party rights may be protected.  A contract may purport to create a right which is in fact wholly unenforceable: thus a covenant in restraint of trade will not be enforceable if it is of too wide an ambit.  What is common to all these concepts is that they qualify apparent legal or equitable rights and obligations.  An apparent right or obligation is held not to exist (void) or is set aside (voidable) or cannot be enforced.  But even a void, voidable or unenforceable agreement can be relied on for some purposes.  The relevant document still remains a document and it still has content.  The fact that it is void or is set aside or contains terms that are not enforceable does not mean that it cannot be referred to for other purposes.  It may, for instance, be highly relevant to the construction of some other document (by being expressly referred to in that other document) or to establishing the legal effect of other conduct (for instance in establishing what other legal or equitable rights and obligations arise out of the same transaction as the void/voidable/unenforceable document or out of some related transaction).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The principal contrary argument, it seems to me, is that, valid or not, the terms of the NPA formed part of the offer of the salary increase and that it is only in the context of the contract of employment as varied (to include both the salary increase and the non-pensionability term) that the validity of the non-pensionability term falls to be assessed.  In other words, the position is no different from what it would be if there had been no NPA in the first place but simply an offer (as in <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">NUS </span>case) of a particular salary increase on terms, albeit an offer on terms which gave rise to a breach of Holdings’ contractual duty of trust and confidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.50in">Secondly, instead of doing that, Holdings could have made the offer expressly by reference to the agreement already made.  In that case, it would have been clear that the offer was being made on the basis that the increase would be non-pensionable; the reference to the agreement could only be taken as a reference to the terms of the first option contained in Mr Ferrar’s email of 27 October 2009 which the members had elected to adopt.  This, in my view, would be so <span style="text-decoration:underline">even if</span> it were subsequently held that the NPAs had been procured in breach of duty.  This is because the NPAs would not be relied on as a source of rights or obligations, but only as a document containing terms incorporated by reference in the offer.  The fact that the agreement to those terms may be invalid having been procured in breach of duty, does not mean that the terms themselves, contained in Mr Ferrar’s email to members on 27 October 2009, could not form the terms of an offer made by Holdings any more than they could not have formed the terms of an offer under i) above.  As under i) above, either that condition would be valid or it would be invalid, but my conclusion is that the offer would have been made (and accepted) on that basis.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">In answering those questions, it is helpful to address the contractual position had there been no breach of duty.   The starting point (see paragraph 48 above) is that the NPAs represent the members’ advance agreement to the terms on which salary increases will be offered: a contract is made as and when a salary increase is granted since it is only at that stage that Holdings gives any consideration.  The next step in the contractual analysis is that by implementing the salary increase, Holdings is making an offer to the members that, in consideration of their continuing to serve, they will receive the salary increase.  But clearly the members cannot accept the salary increase without accepting also that the increase will be non-pensionable.  The reason that that is so is because it must be taken to be implicit in the offer that the terms of the (valid – my hypothesis in this paragraph being there is no breach of duty) NPA are incorporated into it; by accepting the salary increase, the members accept the non-pensionability term.  It is not clear (and in the context of a valid NPA does not matter) whether the non-pensionability term, when given contractual force, is properly to be seen as an express term or an implied term.  It might be said to be express because the implicit term of the offer is itself express in the sense that there is an express agreement (the NPA) that any salary increase will be non-pensionable.  On the other hand, it might be said to be implied because there is no difference between something being implicit and being implied.</p>

What is not clear, however, is that the terms of the NPA obtained from members in breach of Holdings’ duty, can be relied on as part of the offer which the members accept by receiving the salary increases awarded.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">In my judgment (ignoring for the moment the position of those members who sent protest emails), the terms of the NPAs are incorporated into the terms of the offers and, by accepting the salary increases, the members are to be treated as accepting offers on those terms.  The validity of the non-pensionability term is therefore to be assessed in the context of the contracts of employment as varied.  Members may have been – and many clearly were – unhappy about Holdings’ conduct in procuring the NPAs but there is no doubt that they actually made the elections, which they did pursuant to the online tool, and thereby signified their agreement to the non-pensionability of salary increases.   Members did not withdraw their election or agreement prior to the salary increases: it is clear that Holdings intended the salary increase to be subject to the non-pensionability agreement.  It is not possible, in my view, to interpret the offer as one of a salary rise subject to the non-pensionability term if and only if the NPAs involved no breach of duty.  I therefore consider that the members’ challenge to the validity of the non-pensionability term must be made within the context of the contracts of employment as varied.  This is an aspect I deal within when addressing Issue 3.</p>

The only basis on which Holdings could maintain that the member concerned would be subject to the non-pensionability term when he came to be awarded a salary increase is because he or she had ticked the acceptance box.  The express term of this email must, in my view, be effective to override the tick in the box and to make clear the member’s lack of agreement.  I do not disagree with the proposition that, had I held the NPAs to involve no breach of duty (either in isolation or as part of Project Waltz), then a member sending an email such as this could not take the benefit of the salary increase without being subject to the non-pensionability term.  But that is not to say that, for such a member, he is bound by it given the breach of duty which I have held to be involved.  If Holdings, in the face of an email such as this, chose to give a salary increase, it was open to the member to continue to serve and to claim the increased salary as a valid variation of his contract of service.  It was Holdings which took the risk that the NPAs might be held to involve a breach of duty.  In terms of offer and acceptance, the members’ emails demonstrate that there was no NPA <span style="font-style:italic">vis à vis </span>such members so that the offer made by granting the salary increases (without at the same time expressly incorporating the non-pensionability term) was not an offer which included that term.

Although the 2006 Partial NPAs were not reflected in an amendment to the I Plan (in contrast with the position under the Main Plan), it is obvious, if I may say so, that in referring to the obligation of the Trustee to provide benefits in accordance with the terms of the I Plan, the member did not have in mind the 2006 Partial  NPAs; thus the email says the member “continue(s)” to consider that the Trustee is bound to provide benefits under the terms of the I Plan when, had he thought about it, he would have realised that the Trustee was only bound to provide benefits which reflected the 2006 Partial NPAs.  If the analysis is that the members sending such emails were not consenting to the non-pensionability term, then the 2009 NPA was effectively being rejected.

Those concepts are apposite only to documents which do give rise to such rights and obligations.  As to whether they are enforceable or not, that is again, in my view, to ask a non-question.  The issue is not whether the NPAs are, of themselves, unenforceable.

As to members who did not make any sort of protest, the non-pensionability term did form part of the salary increase offer which was made and accepted.  Whether that term, as part of the contract of employment, is void, voidable or unenforceable is a matter I deal with under Issue 3.

The difference between the two categories is that the Initial 2009 NPAs would give rise to a breach of Holdings’ duty even if viewed in isolation (under either of Scenarios A or B).

First, it says that on a proper construction of the terms of the agreement under which the salary increases were awarded, those increases are not repayable; and secondly (which is really the point I have just made), this is not a case where the whole of the consideration for the salary increase has failed.  I think the Trustee’s case can be stated in this way (although it is not quite how Mr Spink puts it): Holdings has awarded salary increases which take effect as variations to the contracts of employment; it has attempted to attach conditions to the increases; although it has obtained the agreement of the members to those conditions, that agreement was obtained in breach of duty; therefore the conditions are invalid; and so the salary increases take effect free from the conditions.  Alternatively, the non-pensionability term is more than a condition attached to the salary increase, but is a term which is, taken by itself, invalid: it can and ought to be set aside without the need to set aside the whole of the contractual agreement which resulted in the variation of the contract of employment.   In either case, the risk of the non-pensionability term being held invalid was Holdings’ risk.  In this context, to adopt Holdings’ position would be to leave the salary increases in place only if the non-pensionability term is given effect; otherwise, the members are not entitled to any salary increases.  This would, it is said by the Trustee, be unfair to members since they would have no increases, which would be to condone the breach because it would implement the default option under the online tool.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in">To put this another way, as he does, Mr Spink says, in the context of Issue 3.1, that the members did exactly what they had been asked to do in that they had accepted that their salary increases would not be pensionable. They had not provided a warranty that this would be the case, nor agreed to any term whereby they would repay or lose the salary increases if the NPAs were unlawful or ineffective. Further, the members performed their part of the agreement by working for Holdings on the basis of the agreed salary: that is labour that they have given and, quite obviously, cannot take back.  The position is entirely different from that considered by Lightman J in the <span style="font-style:italic">NUS </span>case where the non-pensionability term involved no breach of duty on the part of the employer so that the terms on which the salary increase was offered became terms of a valid and enforceable agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in">It follows from my analysis under Issue 1 that there is no question of the variations to the contracts of employment being void.  If they were, it would follow that no salary increases had been awarded to anyone which, I have to say, would be an unacceptable and surprising result.  Nor, I think, is there any question of the voidness or setting aside of any free-standing contract in which, in consideration of Holdings awarding a salary increase, the members agreed that that increase would not be pensionable.  In the first place, there would not appear to have been any such free-standing contract: rather, there was an overarching variation of a member’s contract of employment as already explained with consideration moving each way – on the member’s part to continue to serve for the increased salary (with the increase being non-pensionable) and on Holdings’ part to pay an increased salary for that service.  Secondly, even if there had been such a free-standing contract, it was superseded by, and merged into, the contract of employment.  If the members have a remedy, it is relation to the enforceability or otherwise of the non-pensionability term as a term of the employment contract.</p>

Applying that approach, there can be no doubt the disputed term is to be implied into contracts where the non-pensionability term is to be found (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>as I have explained, the contracts of employment).  The correct approach is to ask (i) whether the breach of duty on the part of Holdings is such as to justify imputing a different intention to the parties (ii) whether it is sufficient to disregard what the parties actually thought the terms of the contract meant and (iii) whether it is sufficient to require one of the parties to be held to a bargain it never agreed to and which the other party never thought was on offer.  Mr Newman’s argument, therefore, is that the correct approach is to start off by identifying what the terms of the contract are without reference  to extraneous matters of enforceability.  He goes so far as to say that the disputed term should be implied even if (contrary to his position) an express term to the same effect would be held unenforceable because of the breach of duty; in other words, the disputed term should be implied even though it would not be enforced.</p>

In contrast, if the disputed term is to be implied only to be held unenforceable, then its unenforceability by Holdings may have a consequence on the enforceability by the member of the salary increase awarded under the very same contract which includes the invalid (implied) disputed term.  </p>

Surely, it can be asked, receiving the benefit must breach the agreement that the salary increase would not be pensionable?  But if that is so, why would the court not be willing to grant an injunction to restrain the breach of contract in the first place?  And if such an injunction could be obtained, what is the difference between that and the term which, on the hypothesis now under consideration, is not to be implied?</p>

Neuberger J did not find that attractive.  But the present case demonstrates that such a distinction might be valid, although the distinction becomes clearer if one uses the word “inherent” rather than “implicit”.  In other words, it is part of the nature of an agreement providing for a salary increase to be non-pensionable that a pension cannot be claimed in respect of it.  It is not because the disputed term is to be implied that the member will not be able to make a claim; rather, the member will be unable to do so because there is  no claim in the first place.  Accordingly, the validity of the NPAs – or rather, of the express term of the contractual variation of the employment contracts – is to be judged by reference to the validity of a single term (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the non-pensionability term) which properly construed contains within it an agreement not to claim a pension based on the salary increase.

The solution, it seems to me, is this.  The reason why, in cases of valid non-pensionability agreements, a term is implied (to the effect that the member will not seek to obtain from the pension scheme a benefit based on his full salary) is because that is implicit; and the item in which it is implicit (or inherent) is the express term that the salary increase will be non-pensionable.  If one asks what is meant by an increase being non-pensionable it means, quite simply, that as a matter of contract between employer and employee, a particular increase will not count towards pension; it would be <span style="font-weight:bold">inconsistent</span> with such an agreement for a member to be able to claim the full benefit for which the rules of the scheme provide. </p>

Perhaps, like Schrödinger’s cat, the disputed term is both alive (implied) and dead (not implied) and it is only when Holdings seeks to apply it that it becomes inapplicable.  </p>

In all these cases, the affected members need to allege that the non-pensionability term, as a term of the varied contract of employment, is invalid.

In my judgment, it clearly is unenforceable in the sense that the affected members could not be prevented from claiming benefits based on salary increases being pensionable: Holdings would not be entitled to injunctive relief against the affected members preventing them from doing so.  Given that the 2009 NPAs gave rise to a breach of Holdings’ duty and – more importantly – given that the actual non-pensionability condition attached to salary increases gave rise to breach of duty, a court of equity ought not, in my judgment, to compel the affected members to give effect to an agreement which it was a breach of duty on the part of Holdings to obtain.  Holdings’ position is not helped by the absence of proper consultation of a non-trivial nature (as to which see Judgment [1585]). </p>

Its meaning is clear.  For Holdings to seek to enforce that latter term is not, subject to one point, a breach of the contract of employment at all: quite the reverse, Holdings would be acting in accordance with the terms of the contract and there would be no wrong of which Holdings would be seeking to take advantage.

In that case, liquidators sought successfully to set aside a settlement agreement which had been procured as a result of illegitimate means on the part of the defendant.   It was argued on the part of the defendant that the parties could not be put back into the position which they occupied before the settlement agreement.  It is not entirely clear why this was said to be so, but this can only have been because the defendant had lost his bargaining position since the liquidators had already enjoyed the benefit of the settlement agreement, namely the withdrawal of his effective veto on a certain scheme which the liquidators needed to implement.  That veto had been improperly exercised, which represented the illegitimate means by which the defendant had procured the settlement agreement giving rise to an allegation by the liquidator of economic duress.  And so, in relation to the submission that the liquidators could not set aside the settlement agreement because the parties could not be put back in the position they occupied before, the Privy Council said this at [39]: </p>

The condition was held to be void and the pension not payable. At the other extreme are cases where the invalid restraint is merely an incident of a larger transaction which could "survive without difficulty the elimination" of the invalid restraint: see Romer L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodinson v.

I doubt that there is any real difference between these different formulations, so long as it is recognised (i) that the avoidance of the contract is not limited to the case where the only consideration for the promise, apart from the invalid restraint, is a technical or nominal consideration; (ii) that the court does not attempt to assess the relative values of the various considerations for the promise. But for my own part I prefer the formulation expressed by Denning L.J., since it appears to me to put the point of balance in the right place.

In the case of a covenant in restraint of trade its validity is assessed against the admissible background and, if found to be an excessive restraint, it will be unlawful and unenforceable.  Whether the remainder of the contract can be relied on or whether the whole contract has to be avoided is then to be assessed in accordance with the principles just explained.  Similarly, in the present case, the validity of the non-pensionability provision must be assessed against the whole background.  I have held that the 2009 NPAs, and thus the ensuing contractual variations to the contracts of employment, gave rise to a breach of Holdings’ duty.

Other documents show clearly that increases were planned and determined before the members were asked to sign NPAs.  However, as Mr Newman points out, the increases were planned only after Holdings had decided to proceed with Project Waltz and thus only in the context that they would not be pensionable.  That may be so, but overall, it is clear that Holdings regarded the members as deserving of some additional reward for their services.  But rather than give an option for a member to take some other reward (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>a smaller, pensionable, salary increase of the same value (actuarially assessed) as the proposed non-pensionable salary increase), Holdings simply gave no alternative option (other than the option of no salary increase at all). </p>

And so Mr Spink submits that for Holdings to seek to enforce that term now or in the future (whether by attempting to restrain the Trustee from paying the full benefit or by asserting a claim to damages) would give rise to a further breach of the duty of trust and confidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in">As I see it, the result of the contrary view (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>that there would no further breach of duty) is unacceptable and so I accept Mr Spink’s submission.  The contrary view would mean that, in spite of Holdings having procured the NPAs and contractual non-pensionability term in breach of duty, the members would in fact be bound by it unless, of course, the whole salary increase contract was avoided.  But in that case, the members would find themselves, 5 years after the Initial 2009 NPAs, with no salary increases since 2009 and the possible obligation to pay back the increases which they have already received.  That would not be to put the members in the position in which they would have been if the 2009 NPAs had never been imposed in the first place.  If they had not been imposed, it is quite possible (even if Mr Newman is right to say that there was no obligation on Holdings to do so) that members would at least have been considered for salary increases and, in practice, Holdings may have thought it right not to discriminate between DC and DB members; albeit that the salary increases might have been smaller, there would have been a real prospect that DB members would obtain some increase even absent a non-pensionability term.  It is manifestly <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> Holdings’ position that members should, retrospectively, be considered for salary increases if the increases actually awarded are abrogated.  Quite the reverse: Holdings’ position is that a further consultation in relation to Project Waltz is not necessary because the result would be a foregone conclusion: the result which Holdings considers to be a foregone conclusion is that the DB members should have salary increases from 2009 only if they are subject to a non-pensionability term (and perhaps not even then).  Perhaps more importantly, the members will have worked for the additional 5 years for a reward (old salary and therefore no pensionable increases) less than that which even Holdings considered appropriate (increased salary but increase not pensionable).  In these circumstances, I agree with Mr Spink’s submission that an attempt by Holdings to enforce the non-pensionability term would give rise to a breach of duty which the members are entitled to restrain.  I anticipate – at least I hope that I can anticipate – that were I to make a declaration to that effect, Holdings would not, in fact, seek to enforce the non-pensionabilty term.  If Holdings is to escape from the conclusion that to enforce the non-pensionability term would give rise to a further breach of duty, it needs, at the least, to provide the members with something equivalent to that which they might have expected to receive had Holdings acted properly in 2009, by which I do not mean the minimum possible applying <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack</span> principles.</p>

They knew that the total increase was divided into two components: a pensionable base component and a non-pensionable supplement.  But this was a notional division.  Members were to receive a single salary increase albeit comprising those two components: they did not receive two separate increases.

It does not follow from that proposition that, even when the inclusion of the non-pensionability term in the varied contracts of employment is found to give rise to a breach of duty, the 2006 Partial NPAs or the amendment to the DB Rules in the Main Plan are not relevant.  In my judgment, they remain of relevance and have continuing effect.  They are to be interpreted, adopting a purposive construction, so that the actual salary increase is to be notionally divided into a basic component and a supplement.  This is one natural meaning (indeed, in my view the more natural meaning) of the words used.  Thus the amendment refers to a member agreeing that  any salary increase will include the supplement: accordingly, if an increase in salary of £3X is granted without any more being said, that is to be treated as including a non-pensionable supplement of £X with only the increase of £2X being pensionable.  This is the effect of the actual rule in the case of the DB Rules of the Main Plan; and it is the effect of the 2006 Partial NPA in the case of the I Plan where, as I have already concluded, that NPA continues to apply even in the case of members sending protest emails. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in"> To put that last point another way, my analysis under Issue 3, of why Holdings cannot rely on the non-pensionability term demonstrates that that term is to be severed from the rest of the varied contract of employment, leaving the salary increase intact.  However, if the non-pensionability term is severed in this way and is held to be invalid, the question needs to be asked: What are the terms on which any increase is awarded?  Quite clearly, it is awarded on the same terms as the pre-existing salary, for instance as to timing and frequency of payment.  I see no reason why one of the terms on which it is awarded should not include the terms on which it would have been awarded but for the invalid non-pensionability term.  Indeed, one might expect that it would be awarded on the same terms as previous salary increases so that there would be a “pool” of salary increases divided into pensionable and non-pensionable components.  I reach this conclusion as a matter of interpretation of the contractual arrangements between the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in">Yet another way of putting essentially the same point is to focus on the impact of the breach of duty which is, in accordance with my conclusions under Issue 3, that the non-pensionability term, once severed from the rest of the contract of employment, was <span style="text-decoration:underline">invalid</span>.  If a term is invalid, that means that it is ineffective to alter the pre-existing contract.  If the non-pensionability term had not been included in the variation of the contracts of employment in the first place, that term would clearly not displace the 2006 Partial NPAs.  The 2009 NPAs themselves do not displace the 2006 Partial NPAs: if the provisions of the 2009 NPAs do not become valid terms of the varied contracts of employment, then the offer which Holdings makes, and which is accepted by the members accepting the salary increase and continuing to serve, must by necessary implication include the pre-existing terms on which salary increase offers were agreed to be made, that is to say the 2006 Partial NPAs.</p>

This is because employees had no right in advance of any particular salary increase offer to be awarded or to be considered for a salary increase.  Thus, consistently with the <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack </span>principle (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack v Woods of Colchester Ltd </span>[1967] 1 QB 278),  damages must be nil as Holdings could have declined to give any salary increases at all.  If Mr Newman is right, then Holdings’ case overall (much of which I have already rejected in relation to Issues 1 and 2) is that its breach of duty has absolutely no consequence at all; the members have no remedy.  On Holdings’ case, not only is the non-pensionability term valid and enforceable (a proposition I have rejected) but also the breach of duty in imposing that term carries no sanction.  </p>

Thus in cases of bonus awards, the court, when assessing damages for a wrongful failure to award any bonus, seeks to evaluate what the employer itself would have been likely to do.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I disagree with Mr Newman’s proposition that the members had no right even to be considered for a salary increase.  I doubt that it is often right that an employer can say that it need never consider granting salary increases.  But even if that is wrong as a universal proposition, it is clear, in my view, that Holdings did have a duty to consider salary increases for DB members.  This is because it did actually consider salary increases for DC members and actually awarded increases.  Although Holdings might have been able to justify awarding no increases to DB members had it acted wholly properly and not in breach of duty in the context of Project Waltz, that is very far from clear.  At the very least, it would have had to consider whether or not to do so and a refusal to do so could be seen as giving rise to a breach of the contractual duty of trust and confidence and perhaps even as irrational and perverse.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given that Holdings would have had to consider granting salary increases, the case would fall, in my judgment, to be approached in the same way as the judges approached the question in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Horkulak</span>.  Accordingly, in assessing damages the court would have to evaluate what Holdings would have been likely to do.  I do not, therefore, consider that Mr Newman is right to say that members who entered into the 2009 NPAs cannot <span style="font-weight:bold">as a matter of principle </span>obtain damages.  Subject to proof of loss in individual cases and the application of the normal rules of causation and remoteness, I consider that, in principle, damages are recoverable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first is that there can have been no Reasonable Expectation in 2009 that all future salary increases would be pensionable.  This is because the 2006 Partial NPAs made clear that 1/3rd of those salary increases would not be pensionable.  Further, the Main Plan DB Section was amended following Project Soto to incorporate this limit.   The Trustee does not dispute this.  It is to be taken account of in assessing the measure of damages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Newman’s second point is that, in addition, by analogy with the position regarding future benefit accrual, there can have been no Reasonable Expectation that the policy of Holdings set out in the 2006 Partial NPAs would never change. Accordingly, there must be a point of time at which Holdings could properly adopt a policy of not awarding pensionable salary increases.  Again, the Trustee does not dispute the general proposition but observes that, among other matters (i) there would be a need for consultation and (ii) such a proposal might give rise to issues of unlawful age discrimination.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Newman’s third point is that members who joined the DB Plans after the conclusion of Projects Ocean and Soto cannot have had Reasonable Expectations based on those projects.  This is relevant only to the I Plan since the C and N Plans were closed to new members at the material times.  In my view, the conclusion does not follow from the fact that these members joined the DB Plans after the projects had been implemented.  It all depends on what those new members were told about the projects and whether what they were told could reasonably be taken as representations to them.  It is not a matter in which I have ruled in the Judgment.  It is not a matter which I can take any further in this judgment: the answer will all depend on the facts applicable to the individual concerned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Newman’s fourth point is that the members cannot get more by way of damages than they could be entitled to under the Rules of the Plans. It is evident from Judgment [289(iii)] that the effect of the implied limitation on the Exclusion Power preserving the final salary link is to protect benefits accrued up to the date of the service of the Exclusion Notices (<span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> 28 May 2010). Accordingly, accrual between 28 May 2010 and 6 April 2011 would not attract the benefit of the implied limitation being referred to, and a member cannot through an attack on the NPAs alter this position (assuming the Exclusion Notices to be valid).   As will be seen later, my view is that the Exclusion Notices are voidable, so this point falls away in relation to members who elect to avoid the Exclusion Notices <span style="font-style:italic">vis à vis </span>themselves.  It is, in any case, based on a rather literal reading of what I wrote.  I think the meaning of what I wrote is clear, namely that the implied limitation has effect from when the Exclusion Notice takes effect, not from when it is physically served.  If it was not clear, let me make clear now by way of decision that that is when the implied limitation has effect from.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One further issue which might arise is whether a member who asserts the invalidity of the non-pensionabilty term is also able to obtain damages as a cumulative remedy.  In this context, the Trustee does not contend that damages are payable in circumstances where the 2009 NPAs and the non-pensionability terms in the contracts of employment as varied are void, unenforceable or set aside.  I assume that this will be its position in relation to the status of the non-pensionability term in the light of my conclusions under Issue 1 to 3.

Consequential losses can only be viewed as part of the losses arising as a result of the breach.  It is necessary to compare the position of a member if there had been no breach of duty with his actual position in the context of the breach of duty.  In purely financial terms, the invalidity of the non-pensionability term will almost certainly over-compensate the member since it is unlikely that Holdings would, acting properly and in the absence of the NPAs, have awarded members collectively as high a salary increase as was in fact awarded to those who had agreed to the NPAs.  Such over-compensation would, in my view, have to be set off against the consequential losses claimed. </p>

Although Issues 4 and 5 are focused on the 2009 NPAs (and under my analysis the ensuing salary increase contracts), it is Holdings’ overall conduct in relation to Project Waltz which gives rise to the breach of duty.  The purpose of any award of damages is to compensate the members for that breach.  It is true that I have held that the Initial 2009 NPAs (and also the 2011 NPAs) give rise to a breach of duty quite apart from Project Waltz, but they too form <span style="text-decoration:underline">part</span> of Project Waltz and any damages remedy must reflect that.</p>

Indeed, I do not think that it should be applied willy-nilly even if Holdings was not, contrary to my view, under any duty even to consider whether DB members should be awarded salary increases.  It may well, in either case, be that the requirement to act rationally and in good faith would preclude Holdings from awarding no salary increase at all.  The court, in assessing damages, must then evaluate what would have been likely to happen: and in carrying out such an assessment, the court is not constrained to determine the very lowest figure which Holdings could have awarded without giving rise to any breach of any duty.  However, the court must consider all of the reasonable courses which Holdings might have taken (or at least ones which Holdings presents to the court on an enquiry as to damages).  </p>

I would not, even on his approach, in such an evaluation attach much, if any, weight to what Holdings now says it would have done (rather than could have done).   It may not be admissible evidence.  But even if it is, I venture to suggest that it is almost impossible for Holdings to form a sensible conclusion about what it would have done had there been no Project Waltz and were it to take account only of matters which it could properly have taken into account in making decisions about employee remuneration consistently with all Reasonable Expectations.  Holdings has shown its colours already by saying that a further consultation is not necessary because its decision, even following a consultation, is a foregone conclusion, namely to implement Project Waltz or something as near to it as can practically be achieved.  </p>

The search is not for the loss flowing from the NPAs and the non-pensionability term in the salary increase contracts by themselves, but is rather for the loss flowing from Project Waltz as a whole, of which the NPAs and the non-pensionability term form only a part, albeit an important part.  If one is to apply the general principle of damages (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>to put the claimant in the position in which he would have been but for the breach), members are to be put into the position which they would have been if there had been no Project Waltz at all.  It may well be that Holdings could justifiably say that damages should be assessed on the basis that there would be no pensionable salary increases after the Longstop Date (whatever that date may be).  But before that date, what Holdings would have been likely to have done in terms of salary increases is to be assessed on the footing that Holdings would not have suggested a course of conduct designed, in practice, to circumvent the Reasonable Expectation. </p>

In that case, the defendant was found to have acted in breach of contract in reducing the plaintiff’s wage; the contract of employment had not been terminated nor had it been varied by acceptance of the reduced wage.  On the question of damages, the defendant placed reliance on the “minimum obligation rule”. The argument was that, since the defendant could lawfully have terminated the plaintiff’s employment by 12 weeks’ notice, it must be treated as if it had done so with the result that the claim to damages must be limited to the shortfall in wages during that period.  That argument was rejected.  Lord Oliver said this: </p>

It assumes the very proposition which has already been rejected, namely, that the employment under the contract of service has come to an end. If it had, then no doubt there would be room for an inquiry at what date the employer could first lawfully have terminated it. But that is not the case with which this appeal is concerned. What your Lordships are concerned with here is a claim for sums due under a continuing contract which never was terminated, either lawfully or unlawfully, and there simply is no room in such a case for the application of the principle referred to.”</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Rigby</span>, the contract clearly required the full wage to be paid; it was earned for the actual period for which the claim was made because the plaintiff was actually employed during that period.  The defendant could not limit its liability by reference to a counterfactual situation which it might have brought about and which would have prevented its contractual obligation arising.  In the present case, the breach of contract on which the damages claim is based is not a failure to grant the actual salary increase in a way which was pensionable: the matter could not be put that way because there never was such an obligation.  Rather, the breach is the procuring of the NPAs and the non-pensionability term: the damages flowing are to be assessed as if that breach had not occurred.  It is therefore necessary to evaluate what Holdings would have done since it cannot be said, without further evaluation, that it would have awarded the salary increases which it in fact awarded.  </p>

If such a member decides, instead, to stick with the non-pensionability of the salary increases and to sue for damages, then (if he can assert such a claim at all which is not clear given his election) there can be no question of claiming damages to compensate him for the salary increase not being pensionable.</p>

The argument here is that DC members were, predominantly, younger than DB members.  Giving pay increases to DC members but not (in the case of the hypothetical offer) to DB members rejecting the non-pensionability term would amount to a prohibited disadvantage.  I am not prepared to address that issue.  It raises a number of questions which, in my view, cannot possibly be dealt with on the basis of the factual findings which I have already made or which I could make on the basis of the evidence which I received.  This discrimination issue will have to be resolved on a case by case basis if and when claims are brought by members for damages.</p>

If it is binding, there can be no claim for damages to compensate for the fact that the salary increase is not pensionable.  The contractual claim will be for breach of duty in the imposition of the NPAs and the non-pensonability term; and here the measure of damage is ascertained by carrying out a comparison of the members’ positions as matters stand and as they would have stood but for the breach of duty.</p>

I am not willing to deal with this issue in the context of a Part 8 claim seeking declaratory relief.  Although wishing to be as helpful as possible in bringing finality to the disputes, there is a point beyond which it is inappropriate to go.  I do not consider that it is appropriate that I should, in the face of opposition from Holdings, determine on a group basis a hypothetical issue, hypothetical because it may be that no claim for damages is ever brought.  Mr Simmonds made some powerful points at the beginning of his oral submissions.  I have already gone considerably further (and will do so under other issues too) than he considers I should go.  I obviously take a different view, but I do agree with him that the issue of exemplary damages is one which should be dealt with only in the context of litigation where they are actually claimed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My reluctance to deal with the issue is made all the greater by these three considerations.  The first, which I hope is correct and uncontentious, is that exemplary damages have never been awarded in relation to a breach of contract rather than in respect of tortious liability.  The second, which may be debateable, is that exemplary damages are anomalous in that they are punitive and punishment has no part to play in the adjudication of the rights and obligations of parties in civil litigation.  The third, which is only a tangential consideration, is that this judgment is already very long and overlong in its preparation.  A judgment on the issue of exemplary damages would, of itself, be a significant undertaking.  It is more important that I produce this judgment than that I deal with exemplary damages.

As in the case of exemplary damages, and for similar reasons, I do not propose to address this issue.  It would be quite wrong to attempt to decide this issue, not least because equitable compensation for breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty will, in terms of the measure of compensation, be influenced by the correct approach to damages for breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence.  If exemplary damages are not available, that is not a good starting point for those asserting that there can, nonetheless, be an exemplary award of equitable compensation and it is certainly not an issue which should be decided unless the issue of exemplary damages is decided.  Further, those asserting the power of the court to award such a measure of financial recompense will have to circumvent the oxymoronic concept of compensation which punishes rather compensates.  It is not simply a matter of using a different phrase – for instance equitable damages – since the description “equitable compensation” reflects the jurisprudential basis on which a financial award has, in the past, been made.</p>

Accordingly, Holdings is not able to rely on <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack </span>to launch an argument that no damage has been suffered because Holdings was not obliged to grant any salary increase at all.  Rather, damages are to be assessed on the basis of an evaluation by the court of what the likely outcome would have been if Project Waltz had not been formulated and implemented.

Quite what “in response to” means, I am not sure. And to use the word “dismissal” is to beg a question: a member would be able to obtain damages if Holdings’ breach of contract amounted to a repudiatory breach justifying the member in treating the contract of employment at an end.  In the present case, that requirement is, in my judgment, satisfied and the begged question answered accordingly.  Even so, the member would have to establish that he had suffered loss.  There would be the usual issues concerning the taking of alternative employment; and Holdings would be able to argue, in any particular case, that the member concerned had decided to leave service in any case and that the breach of contract was not therefore causative of any loss.  Further, since Holdings could have terminated service by giving an appropriate period of notice, it may be that <span style="font-style:italic">Lavarack</span> principles apply with damages in relation to lost earnings being limited by that consideration, although the pension rights attached to termination without cause would need to be taken into account.</p>

I do not propose to resolve that point other than to say that, in principle, the amount of a damages award subject to whatever tax that award has to bear, should equate to the amount which the member would have received taking into account whatever tax those amounts would have borne or would (so far as concerns future payments from the DB Schemes) in the future have to bear.</p>

I have already clarified what I did, and did not, intend by that paragraph.  In the light of that clarification, the argument only runs under Scenario B since I did not hold that the Later 2009 NPAs would not have given rise to a breach of duty under Scenario A.  I agree with Mr Newman this far, namely that, under Scenario B, there is no material distinction between the Later 2009 NPAs and the 2010 NPAs and therefore reach the conclusion that, under Scenario B, there would be no breach of duty involved in the 2010 NPAs.  </p>

Indeed, it is because of their entitlement to be treated in the same way as DC members that the DB members can say that the relevant NPAs involve a breach of duty.  This is because DC members have in fact been given salary increases; DB members should have been given the same increases; for those that signed NPAs, the result has therefore been a disappointment of their Reasonable Expectations, a disappointment so serious as to give rise to a breach of the duty of trust and confidence.  </p>

So, perhaps somewhat illogically, I will consider the arguments first and then decide whether I should allow them to stand as part of the RBs’ case.

Mr Stallworthy’s main line of argument is that, Holdings and the Trustee having agreed the Soto changes (under which salary increases would be at least 2/3rds pensionable), it was likely seriously to damage employees’ trust and confidence in Holdings for it to turn round three years later and insist on an agreement that future salary increases had to be entirely non-pensionable otherwise no increases would be given.  While DB members may not have had any Reasonable Expectation of any particular level of salary increases in any particular year, it was implicit, he submits, in the relevant Reasonable Expectation (that future salary increases would be at least 2/3rds pensionable) that Holdings would not declare DB members ineligible for any salary increase whatsoever<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>unless they entered NPAs making salary increases entirely non-pensionable.  That subverted and undermined the ‘deal’ struck under the Soto Changes and the elections which members made under Soto on the faith of IBM’s assurances.

Mr Stallworthy suggests (although Mr Newman rejects this suggestion) that the short-term nature was cosmetic because Holdings believed (incorrectly as it turns out) that the Exclusion Notices were valid and would permanently break the final salary link: the 2011 NPAs, at least, were only put in place because Holdings had become concerned about the validity of the Exclusion Notices. </p>

Even if it would be a breach of contract to award no pay increase at all (this is point i) to which I will come in a moment), I can see no reason why discrimination between DB and DC members is necessarily unreasonable or perverse or capricious.  If in the context of a conventional <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains</span> situation, a non-pensionability agreement such as the Later 2009 NPAs and the 2010 NPAs would not be objectionable (as, in my view, would be the case) notwithstanding a difference in treatment from that afforded to DC members, I do not consider the fact that there is a Reasonable Expectation regarding pensionability of salary increases leads to the conclusion that a DB member nonetheless has an entitlement to the same increase in salary as a DC member.</p>

To bring into the equation the restriction on access to the M Plan would be to bring into account another element of Project Waltz.  The object of my analysis is to ascertain the position on the hypothesis of Scenario A.  Whereas I think there is assistance to be gained, in addressing remedies, from establishing the position under Scenario A, I do not think any assistance is to be gained by addressing a Scenario A Max (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>Scenario A plus exclusion from M Plan), under which almost by definition Mr Stallworthy gets what he wants.

If this were a conventional <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains </span>situation, periods of non-pensionability of that sort would be unlikely to give rise to any breach of an employer’s duty.  Taking, counterfactually, the Later 2009 NPAs and the 2010 NPAs out of the context of Project Waltz (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>Scenario A again), I do not consider that this point demonstrates a breach of duty when, without it, there would not be one.  The (short-term) threat is said to be objectionable because the only reason it was short-term was because Holdings believed the Exclusion Notices would achieve the desired end.  But that, it seems to me, is once again to set those NPAs in the context of Project Waltz which is contrary to the assumption of Scenario A.  As with point iii), I do not think any assistance is to be gained by addressing a Scenario A Max (Scenario A plus long-term intention) which again really adds nothing to the actual finding I have made that all of the NPAs, in the context of Project Waltz as a whole and taking account of the established Reasonable Expectations, involve Holdings in a breach of duty.</p>

I do not remember Mr Tennet raising this possibility at the main hearing although he did, of course, raise the possibility of a Reasonable Expectation of non-discriminatory salary increases, a possibility I rejected.  There was nothing in the evidence which I received at the trial to suggest that future salary increases were discussed: there was no agreement, or even a non-binding expressly stated understanding, that any salary increase in the future would be made.  There could, therefore, have been no Reasonable Expectation generated <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless</span> it was necessarily implicit in the established Reasonable Expectations.  Under Scenario A, I do not consider that it would be implicit.  A member would no more be entitled to an increase than he or she would be if the NPAs had not been made; whilst members may have had a hope, or even an expectation (but not one engendered by Holdings) of future pay increases, it cannot be said that they had a right to such increases.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I come back to the same point which I made in relation to the Soto accrual argument.  It is, in different words, that my introduction of the “in isolation” aspect of the case was not to qualify in any way the breaches of duty on the part of Holdings.  It is the entirety of Project Waltz which gave rise to the breaches of duty and the remedies to which the RBs are entitled must reflect those breaches of duty.  I had focused on each element of Project Waltz in isolation (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>sometimes Scenario A and sometimes Scenario B) because I considered, and still consider, that some assistance may be given in determining the appropriate remedies from consideration of the breaches, if any, to which any particular element gives rise in isolation.  I can see that it might also be of assistance to consider whether the NPAs taken as a whole, but independently of the other elements of Project Waltz gave rise to a breach of duty (and whether the position would be different if the Reasonable Expectations are or are not taken into account) but that is not what I had in mind when referring to the various elements in isolation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My own analysis is slightly different from that of Mr Stallworthy.  In the Judgment, I held that DB members had a Reasonable Expectation that benefit accrual “in accordance with the Soto Changes” would continue at least until April 2011.  The only relevant changes under Soto were that future salary increases would consist of a base salary increase plus a 50% non-pensionable supplement (resulting, in effect, in increases in salary being only 2/3rds pensionable).  I held that the Project Waltz changes conflicted with that Reasonable Expectation because DB members would become ineligible for salary increases in the future unless they entered into NPAs: for slightly more detail, see Judgment [1511].  And I also held (see Judgment [1528]), that the 2009 NPAs were procured in breach of duty in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The three major elements of Project Waltz were identified in Judgment [1511] (cessation of benefit accrual from 6 April 2011, no salary increases unless NPA signed and detrimental changes in ER policy).   I have already explained  that the 2009 NPAs displaced the Reasonable Expectation that salary increases would (at least in part, following the Soto changes) be pensionable without at that point deciding whether the disappointment of this Reasonable Expectation in relation to the Later 2009 NPAs  is sufficiently serious, by itself, to give rise to a breach of the contractual duty of trust and confidence.  In my judgment, it is.  The Reasonable Expectation that benefit accrual would continue until a Longstop Date (on any view not before April 2011) was an extremely important part of the agreements and understandings which were part and parcel of the Soto changes.  Part of that Reasonable Expectation was that salary increases (if any) granted before that date would be pensionable and the pensionability of salary increases was an important aspect of the Reasonable Expectation.  To disappoint that part of the Reasonable Expectation without justification (as I have held to be the case) seems to me to be a very serious matter.  The same goes for the 2010 NPAs and the 2011 NPAs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is no answer to that, in my view, for Holdings to say that there could be no disappointment of the relevant Reasonable Expectation because it did not have to award any salary increase.  The point is that if a member <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> sign an NPA, any salary increases actually awarded would not be pensionable.  As a matter of fact, such a member could reasonably hope for a salary increase and, indeed, increases were awarded to those who did sign.  If it is right that Holdings was able to decline to grant any salary increases, that may go to remedy: it does not go to breach.</p>

It is not, however, just a matter of disappointing the Reasonable Expectation.  The Initial 2009 NPAs and the 2011 NPAs are objectionable quite apart from the Reasonable Expectation because no reasonable employer would make a blanket decision refusing for all time not to grant any pay increase unless the member concerned entered into an NPA.  Since, as I have held, all of the NPAs were part of a strategy to ensure that future pension increases would be non-pensionable, it is appropriate, in my judgment, to assess the validity of the Later 2009 NPAs and the 2010 NPAs by reference to their place in the overall scheme of things, as part of the strategy.  This is, in effect, Mr Stallworthy’s continuum argument.  I accept it. I reject Mr Newman’s submission that there is no factual basis for this conclusion.  Indeed, I think that the paragraphs in the Judgment which I have mentioned earlier in this judgment contain relevant findings.  If those are wrong, on the basis that there was no evidential basis for them, that is a matter for correction by the Court of Appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, when it comes to considering remedies, it may be important to understand why, conceptually, there is a breach.  To illustrate the point which I wish to make, I go back to the proposition (see paragraph 30 above) that an employer’s duty of trust and confidence can be breached by its actions cumulatively.  This can be so where none of the relevant actions, if it were the only action, would amount to a breach of duty.  So imagine a case where the employer takes 5 steps none of which by itself and taken out of context would give rise to a breach of duty but which cumulatively do give rise to a breach of duty.   If one asks whether step 3 was a breach of duty, the response might be for further clarification of what the question means.  Does it ask whether step 3 would be a breach of duty if it was the only step, to which the answer is “No”.  But if the question is whether step 3 forms part of a course of conduct which gives rise to a breach of duty, then the answer is “Yes”; and this could be so even if the cumulative effect of steps 1, 2 and 3 was not to give rise to a breach of duty, but steps 4 and 5 were needed to complete the breach.   On the facts of the case, it may be that steps 1 to 5 were not simply a sequence of steps having a cumulative effect, but formed part of a pre-planned scheme or strategy: the question whether step 3 was a breach of duty might then be focusing on whether, when it was taken, it was a breach of duty in which case the answer would, again, be “Yes”.  The answer is, <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span>, “Yes” if step 3 would have been, standing by itself, a breach of duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, the 2010 NPAs gave rise, for reasons already stated, to a breach of duty under Scenario A, that is to say viewed apart from Project Waltz.  This was because of the serious disappointment of the Reasonable Expectation that salary increases would continue to be pensionable until at least April 2011.  In the context of Project Waltz as a whole, it was an essential element in a larger scheme that disappointed the Reasonable Expectation and was thus a breach viewed in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.  This is because a threat that no salary increases would be considered at all in the future unless an NPA was signed would be a breach of duty; and the 2010 NPAs were part of a strategy to achieve that end with no genuine intention that the position would be reviewed each year.  At least, there was no evidence of a genuine intention to do so and I am entitled to infer from the totality of the evidence which I did receive that there was no such intention.</p>

However I do not consider that procuring the members to enter into the 2010 NPAs gave rise to a breach of Holdings’ <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  It is true that the way in which effect is given to a valid NPA (as in <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains</span>) involves the trustees of the scheme giving effect to the contract between the employer and the employee and thus overriding the formal provisions of the scheme.  If the trustees threaten to ignore that contract, the employer’s remedy is to seek injunctive relief to restrain payment to the employee of that to which the rules strictly entitle him.  The economic effect of the contract, it can be seen, is the same as a valid rule amendment if one could be made. However, in my view, the procuring of the contract does not engage the same sort of duties as the exercise of a power exercisable by an employer under the scheme.  </p>

The Longstop Date was no further away than 2014 and may have been earlier.  On its own, an NPA which disappointed that Reasonable Expectation for the period remaining might not be seen as giving rise to a breach of duty.  However, the threat of no salary increases being considered at all in the future unless an NPA was signed was again a breach of duty.  Had the 2011 NPAs been genuinely short-term, and not such as to give rise under either Scenario A or Scenario B to a breach of duty, the position might have been different.

For reasons already given, I do not consider that Mr Stallworthy’s arguments that the failure to provide any salary increase would be perverse or capricious, let alone his argument that DB members should have the same salary increases as DC members, are good ones which makes it unnecessary to decide whether I should admit them.  But so far as the NPAs give rise to a breach of duty on the basis that salary increases would be non-pensionable, I have already said that this Reasonable Expectation is a necessary part of the Reasonable Expectation that benefit accrual would continue in relation to salary, because the increase is part of the salary.

In contrast, Holdings’ position is that the Exclusion Notices are simply voidable; they should not be avoided but, on the contrary, should be validated on terms (as to which for more detail see at paragraph 263 below) the effect of which, in summary, would be that they would take effect according to their terms but Affected Members would be afforded the opportunity to be placed in the position that they would have been in if pensionable service in relation to the DB Plans had not been terminated by the Exclusion Notices until the Longstop Date (for the meaning of which, see paragraph 23 above).</p>

Mr Simmonds notes (as is apparent from the passages I have already quoted) that in <span style="font-style:italic">Pitt v Holt</span>, the Supreme Court has confirmed that the consequence of such a breach is that the exercise is voidable rather than void.   He submits that, by analogy and parity of reasoning, an exercise of a power in a manner that constitutes a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty ought to render such exercise voidable rather than void.</p>

There is no sensible reason for imposing – indeed, it would be perverse to impose – a more draconian remedy in respect of the exercise of a power in a manner that breaches a non-fiduciary duty than the remedy that arises in respect of the exercise of a power in a manner that is in breach of trust/fiduciary duty.</p>

On the facts of the present case, two such unintended, or unwelcome, consequences are, according to Mr Simmonds, immediately apparent. First, it follows necessarily from the Trustee’s contention that the Exclusion Notices are void <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio </span>that there cannot be any right on the part of a given member to elect under the Pension Decision Tool to remain in his Chosen DC Arrangement even if that would be more beneficial to him than continuation of pensionable service for the purposes of the DB Plans. Secondly, a consequence of a finding that the Exclusion Notices are void would be that Hybrid Deferred status would simply fall away so that any new exercise of the Exclusion Powers (it being common ground that the Longstop Date is no later than 31 March 2014) would result in C Plan Over 60 Members being unable to access an unreduced pension on early retirement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the submissions made in the preceding two paragraphs.  I attach no weight to the way in which the matter was put in Holdings’ position paper or to Mr Evans’ expression of surprise on the part of the Trustees on learning of Holdings’ current stance (which, as Mr Simmonds’ points out, was the Trustee’s own position before it took on the mantle of arguing the RBs’ case).  Further, I reject Mr Evans’ argument to the effect that Holdings’ argument fails to recognise the effect of the Pension Decision Tool.  Mr Simmonds’ point, with which I agree, is that the Tool itself envisages an affected member waiving the entitlement to be treated as having continued in pensionable service under the DB plan in the event that the Court held (as I did) that members were so entitled.  That provision of the Tool is consistent only with the Exclusion Notices being voidable rather than void (or indeed unenforceable).<span style="font-weight:bold">   </span>Unless I am compelled by an overwhelming analysis, or bound by authority, to conclude that a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty leads to the Exclusion Notices being rendered wholly void, it is not the conclusion which I would reach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The submission really comes back to the points already made that the purposes of the trust deed and rules of a pension scheme include promoting trust and confidence between an employer and the members rather than undermining those concepts. Accordingly, an employer’s powers under a pension scheme must be exercised for a purpose which is consistent with maintaining trust and confidence rather than undermining them. If, instead, an employer purports to exercise its powers for a purpose which would undermine trust and confidence (and thereby breach its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty), then such exercise would be contrary to the purposes for which the powers had been conferred.  And so it is said that, because the exercise by Holdings of the Exclusion Power (in serving the Exclusion Notices) was a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it thereby constituted an exercise of the Exclusion Power for an improper purpose. That improper purpose was to seek to implement the Project Waltz changes in order to achieve IBM’s own financial objectives in a manner which confounded the members’ Reasonable Expectations.</p>

However, I expressly stated at the end of Judgment [289(iii)] and at Judgment [294] that my conclusions were subject to any “good faith” argument and without prejudice to any issues arising in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  Whether or not the point was open to the RBs to run at the earlier hearing, the focus in relation to the Exclusion Notices was rather different.  I am sure that the fair and proportionate approach on the present hearing is to allow the Trustee to run whatever points it wishes to raise about the Exclusion Notices giving rise to a breach of Holdings’ contractual duty of trust and confidence and the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">He has a further argument, namely that if the Trustee’s argument in this regard were correct then every exercise of a power by an employer in breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty would be contrary to the purpose of the power and, hence, void. By analogy, every exercise by a trustee of a discretionary power in a manner that constitutes a breach of trust/fiduciary duty would also be void – but that is inconsistent with the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Pitt v Holt. </span>The fallacy in the Trustee’s argument he seeks to identify is the assertion that the purpose for which the power was conferred included maintaining trust and confidence between employer and member. That is the purpose of the duty that imposes a fetter upon the power; it is not the purpose of the power itself (not least because, if it were, there would be no need for the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty to impose such a fetter).  Mr Evans’ retort is that this argument all turns on equating breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty with the sort of breach of trust which only renders the exercise of a power voidable and is therefore to beg the question.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One thing which is clear, in my judgment, is that a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is not, of itself, a fraudulent exercise of the relevant power in the sense of a fraud on the power as addressed in the authorities.  Those cases are concerned with benefiting non-objects of the power.  But that is not the present case: the purpose of the Exclusion Power was surely to enable Holdings to bring an end to benefit accrual if it considered it desirable to do so <span style="text-decoration:underline">even in its own interests</span>.<span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span>  The objection to the Exclusion Notices is not that this is what they purported to do (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>to exclude the affected members in Holdings’ own interests), but that they did so in circumstances which resulted in a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  As Mr Simmonds submits, the power (to exclude affected members) and the duty (not to act in a way which breaches trust and confidence) are not to be confused.  If it is right to look at the purpose of the duty at all, it can only be described in an entirely circular way as the purpose of maintaining the relationship of trust and confidence.  If Mr Evans’ line of argument is correct, I do not see why it would not apply equally to a breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the exercise of a discretionary power: one of the purposes of such powers, on his line of argument, would be to preserve the fiduciary relationship  between the trustees and the beneficiaries so that any breach of trust becomes a fraud on the power (because, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, it is beyond the scope of the discretionary powers to be exercised in a way which breaches the fiduciary duty).  Such a line of argument is clearly wrong and, in any case, is not admissible in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Pitt v Holt </span>in the Supreme Court.  </p>

He says that I indicated a similar approach at Judgment [372] where I recognised that “there may be cases where it would not be just or proportionate to strike down the exercise of the power at all; and there may be cases where the result is partial, rather than total, invalidity of the exercise of the power”.  And he refers to Judgment [1532 i)] as well.  I flag here that account needs to be taken, in relation to the duration of the DB accrual, not only of the Longstop Date but also of the requirement for consultation.  Holdings submits that no further consultation is needed; the Trustees submit to the contrary.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Simmonds draws an analogy with the grant of other equitable remedies.  It is the general practice for the grant of an injunction in interim proceedings to be accompanied by cross-undertakings given to the Court.  Similarly, the grant of the discretionary remedy of rectification can be granted conditionally or on the imposition of terms: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sargeant v Reece </span>[2007] EWHC 2663 (Ch) at [86]; <span style="font-style:italic">Konica Minolta Business Solutions (UK) Ltd v Applegate</span> [2013] EWHC 2536 (Ch) at [49] – [53], decisions I see no reason to doubt.  Finally, he refers to <span style="font-style:italic">Pitt v Holt </span>in the Supreme Court.  In that case, HMRC were concerned that the settlement should not be set aside because, among other reasons, the Court would not know what proprietary claims would vest in the estate of the disponor against third parties (such as the trustees of the settlement).  In order to eliminate that concern, the disponor’s executors confirmed by letter an irrevocable intention not to make any claim on behalf of the estate against the trustees or recipients of distributions.  Lord Walker observed that, but for that letter, “the court might, if minded to grant relief, have required an undertaking to the same effect as the one that [the executors] have volunteered”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is the further point made by Mr Simmonds that, as the decision of Neuberger J in <span style="font-style:italic">Bestrustees </span>shows, it is possible to sever, in appropriate cases, the exercise of a power into valid and void components and to uphold the valid and strike down the void.  In my view, it must surely follow (again in appropriate cases) that the court can take the same approach in relation to a voidable exercise of a power which can be severed in the same way.  But the point goes further; it can be argued that the court should recognise the flexibility of the discretionary remedy by, in effect, severing the good from the bad by imposing terms or accepting undertakings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Then comes the critical part of Mr Simmonds’ submissions on the facts.  He submits that there cannot have been a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in the context of Project Waltz but for the disappointment of Reasonable Expectations on the part of members.  For that, he relies on various parts of the Judgment, in particular Judgment [389], [391], [1030] and [1519] which show that the disappointment of Reasonable Expectations was the foundation of the breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  That is right subject to two caveats.  The first is that the Initial 2009 NPAs and the 2011 NPAs would have given rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty because of the permanent nature of the pensionable pay freeze; and the second is the failure to consult, the consequences of which I come to later.  However, it is possible to take account of both of those caveats in fashioning the appropriate remedy (or in the formulation by Holdings of its proposals).  But subject to those caveats, the Reasonable Expectation in relation to benefit accrual extended only to the Longstop Date and to treat the Exclusion Notices as valid beyond that date would be to provide a remedy for a period in respect of which there was no breach of duty, a result which he says would be neither just nor proportionate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to (i), the Trustee’s position is that the Exclusion Notices are avoidable at each individual affected member’s election rather than only liable to be avoided by the Court in relation to all or a group of Affected Members.  I do not understand Mr Simmonds to argue for a different conclusion.  Indeed, it is inherent in Holdings’ own proposals that it is for each affected member to elect.  In any case, the Trustee’s position is, in my judgment, the correct one.  Whatever may or may not be severable, I see no reason why the Court should not be able to treat each affected individual separately.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is, after all, a duty owed to each member just as the contractual duty of trust and confidence is owed to each employee.  This is not a case where it is critical, or even important, to Holdings that all affected members are treated in the same way so there is no scope for an argument that it would be unfair and prejudicial to Holdings to avoid the Exclusion Notices in relation to some but not all of the affected members.  It follows from the submission that I am not being invited actually to avoid the Exclusion Notices at all at this stage but only to determine that each affected member has the right to avoid <span style="font-style:italic">vis à vis </span>themselves.  The answer to (i) is therefore “No” and to (ii) is that I am not being invited to set them aside.

In strict terms, the position as I see it is that it is the Court which would set aside the Exclusion Notice but would do so only in relation to affected members who elect for that course.  It is therefore open to me to impose conditions for the exercise of my power in terms of the giving of notice.  That would include the timing of such an election.  A similar question of timing relates to the connected issue of election discussed under Issue 19 at paragraph 417 below.  For the same reasons as given in that paragraph, I propose to address the question of the timing of any election at a further hearing after the hand-down of this judgment. The answer to (i) of this issue is “Yes”. I do not answer (ii) at this stage. My order subject to the caveat at the start of this paragraph) will be one which orders the setting aside of the Exclusion Notice in relation to the individual affected member on the making of the election: I do not need to be further involved at that stage.</p>

The Exclusion Notices were served in the context of proposals on which there should have been, but there was not, a proper consultation so that the lack of consultation was not just a failure to observe the relevant Regulations.  It is one thing to allow the exercise of a power to stand, in whole or in part, where there has simply been an inadequate consultation; it would be quite another thing to allow such an exercise to stand where a consultation was carried out which was not merely inadequate but constituted a breach of the duty of trust and confidence. Mr Simmonds says that all that is needed to remedy the breach of duty resulting from the service of the Exclusion Notices is to treat them as taking effect from some later date.  That fails to recognise the breach of duty arising from the lack of proper consultation.  I return to this theme later.</p>

Mr Simmonds’ response to that was that the only remedy for breach of the Regulations was that provided in the Regulations themselves so that there could not be any parallel contractual claim.  I do not agree with that, for two reasons.  The first reason is that I do not see the claim under the Regulations as precluding a contractual claim.  Suppose that Holdings had entered into an express contract with an affected member to comply with its obligations under the Regulations.  I see no reason why a breach of the Regulations should preclude the member from obtaining a contractual remedy including the recovery of damages if any could be shown.  Regulation 18 does not, in my judgment, have that effect but is there only to make clear that the breach of statutory duty carries only the statutory sanction.  The second reason is that it is not the mere breach of the Regulations which has given rise to the breach of duty; the facts giving rise to the breach of the Regulations are part of, but not all of, the facts giving rise to the contractual claim which can, in my judgment, be asserted by the RBs in parallel with the breach of the Regulations and is a claim in respect of which a remedy can be provided quite apart from the remedy under the Regulations. I enlarge on this when considering the consultation breach under Issue 29.</p>

Mr Evans relies on what Lloyd LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Pitt v Holt </span>in the Court of Appeal, referring to [99] and [100], paragraphs on which Mr Simmonds also relies.  He accepts that where a court exercises a discretion to avoid an act or rescind a transaction, it may impose terms as a condition of granting relief.  But this is not, he contends, a licence for the court to rewrite the parties’ bargain or the impugned act (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>it is no licence to rewrite the Exclusion Notices) or to impose whatever terms it thinks fit in order to achieve a result that is, at some abstract level, “fair”.

It is not and never has had the function of providing compensation for the misrepresentation or some hybrid solution to reflect what would be fair between the parties having regard to the nature of the representation and the extent to which one party has been misled by another. Consistently with that, the court has no power to create a new bargain for the parties. What has been induced is the original bargain and it is the purpose of the remedy to return the parties to their position before that particular bargain was made. There is therefore no room for any form of equitable engineering directed to re-constructing the fabric of the original contract… ”</p>

In contrast, the present case, he says, is a case of unilateral transaction where Holdings was simply exercising a power vested in it and exercisable without the need for any consent.  There was no transaction or bargain, with members or with the Trustee.   Referring to O’Sullivan, Elliot &amp; Zakrzewski, he cites a passage at 19.07: “Because it is concerned with bargains, the rule against partial rescission does not apply to gifts and other unilateral dispositions”.  Mr Simmonds accepts that gifts are obviously different from the Exclusion Notices; but he submits that the approach should be the same.  Given that there is no bargain, the objection about rewriting the parties’ bargain does not arise.  As Mr Simmonds puts it, all the court has to do “is identify to what extent the unilateral transaction is valid”.  This chimes with the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Bestrustees </span>(as to which see below) the question being whether it is possible to identify conceptually two different elements of the exercise of the power.  And so Mr Simmonds asks rhetorically why it should not be possible to impose terms on the parties to produce a comparable result to the one that would follow if the Exclusion Notices were valid. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any case, he submits that Holdings had a unilateral right to terminate accrual from the Longstop Date because that would not interfere with any Reasonable Expectations.  The Exclusion Notices should be set aside only partially, assuming that they should be set aside at all, to reflect that unilateral right and to give them validity to that extent.  It is in the context of the partial avoidance/validation that Holdings makes its proposals which, in its submission, provide a just and proportionate remedy.  If I do not accept what is proposed, Holdings is prepared to consider alternative proposals to meet any inadequacies in the proposals which I perceive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Evans makes two points in riposte.  First, he says that the service of the Exclusion Notices is not to be equated in any way with a true unilateral transaction such as a gift.  It has to be seen in the context of the mutual rights and obligations between Holdings and the members.  The service of the notice varies the rights as between them – for instance it has an impact on the obligations of the members to pay contributions by bringing an end to their obligations to do so, and the service of the notice determines the quantum of the members’ benefits.  There is therefore a bilateral element to the Exclusion Notices. I do not consider that this riposte answers Mr Simmonds’ point.  The impact on members of the service of invalid notices is a factor to be taken into account in determining the terms on which they can be (wholly or partially) set aside.  But the case remains, in my view, outside the realm of bilateral transactions relevant to rescission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to make one preliminary point.  It is that the issue for me is whether the Exclusion Notices themselves can be set aside in part (or whether, rather than setting them aside, I can accept undertakings from Holdings to implement its proposals).  In answering that question, it will be necessary to examine what action Holdings could properly have taken at the time <span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>in May 2010.  The issue is not whether, at some later time, Holdings could have served effective Exclusion Notices.  It would not, in my judgment, be right to tailor the remedy for the breach of duty in serving the Exclusion Notices by taking account of subsequent events so as to justify a closure of the DB Plans to further accrual from some later date.  If it is right to take account at all of what Holdings could properly have done, that matter must be judged as at May 2010 and not some later date. </p>

However, ultimately I reject it for essentially two reasons.  The first is that, in principle, I do not consider that I have the power, in the exercise of my discretion, to impose conditions on the avoidance of the Exclusion Notices to achieve their validity from the Longstop Date; and not having that power, I do not consider that I have power either to accept undertakings or other commitments from Holdings to achieve the same result.  The second reason is that, even if that is wrong, I am not satisfied that Holdings’ proposals would, in fact, provide a remedy for its breaches of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.

Typically, cross-undertakings in damages are given when interim injunctions are granted: the price of obtaining the injunction is that, should it turn out that the injunction should not have been granted, the claimant will compensate the defendant for any loss occasioned.  Cross-undertakings of that sort are not appropriate, of course, in the case of final injunctions.  If the court does impose terms (or accept undertakings from a claimant) where a final injunction is granted, which must be rare, it could only be because the terms reflect the right which the claimant is seeking to enforce.  In the present case, however, the “right” (if one is to continue with the analogy) which the RBs are seeking to enforce is the right to have the DB Plans properly implemented in accordance with their provisions. What Holdings seeks to do is to implement a change to the Plans which has not been properly implemented by giving partial effect to an otherwise invalid exercise of its powers.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to conditions imposed on the making of an order for rectification, Mr Simmonds relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Sargeant </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Konica.</span>  In <span style="font-style:italic">Sargeant</span>, the deputy judge made it a condition of his order that Hilda (the person seeking rectification) return to her brother’s estate a sum which she had received under the agreement before its rectification.  It may very well have been the case that the estate would have had some sort of restitutionary claim; but even if it did not, the restoration of the money was within the scope of the sort of terms which could be imposed in cases of misrepresentation, undue influence or fraud to achieve <span style="font-style:italic">restitutio in integrum</span>.  The additional concerns of the judge relating to the continued occupation of the relevant farmland by the executors indicate that he might have been prepared to impose other terms but, as I read what he says, those terms would have been directed at ensuring that the rights of the estate were not prejudiced.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Konica</span>, the same deputy judge made an order rectifying the terms of a pension scheme as a result of which some beneficiaries would cease to be entitled to certain amounts under the unrectified provisions.  As a matter of fact, it appeared that there were no beneficiaries who had actually received any sums which, under the rectified provisions, they would not be entitled to receive.  But in case there were, the deputy judge indicated that he would provide in his order that any affected beneficiary could apply to the court to argue that the rectification order should have been made only on terms that the beneficiary did not need to refund any sums so received.  It does not appear to me that the judge was intending to give such a beneficiary the opportunity to retain that which he was not entitled to retain.  The beneficiary might, for instance, have a change of position defence to any claim by the pension scheme for return of the overpayment.  The judge was saying no more, I think, than that a right such as that could properly be given effect to by imposing a term as part of the order for rectification.</p>

Lord Walker made his remarks in a situation far removed from the present case.  What the executors had done was to eliminate a concern of HMRC that the order setting aside the settlement would create uncertainty.  There might, without the elimination of that concern, have been a defence to the claim to set aside the settlement.  That is very different from the present case where the breach of duty has been established – there was no adequate defence – and where the search is now for the appropriate remedy for that breach.  </p>

Having said that, I do not consider that it is open to the court to rewrite history by giving a wholly different effect to an act of the employer in order to remedy a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  Subject to one caveat, it is not, in my judgment, open to me, as a matter of principle, to give effect to the Exclusion Notices by treating them as validly taking effect from some future date; nor is it open to me to refuse to exercise my discretion to set aside the Exclusion Notices on Holdings’ undertaking to implement its proposals.</p>

I can think of no rational argument for saying that severance is possible where a transaction is potentially void but not where it is only potentially voidable.  The question then arises of whether the Exclusion Notices are severable.  If they are severable, then a separate question may arise which is whether terms can be imposed when the severable part is in fact avoided.  But if severance is not possible, I do not consider that the court can achieve severance, by the back door as it were, by rescinding the entire transaction but only on terms that it be given partial effect.  If the Exclusion Notices cannot be severed, then they cannot be rescinded either even on terms that they take effect only from the Longstop Date.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But even if that is wrong, I am not satisfied that Holdings would (and could) have served Exclusion Notices specifying the Longstop Date or some later date as the date from which the affected members would cease to be members.  In this context, it seems to me that the burden is on Holdings to demonstrate that it would have served Exclusion Notices since it is Holdings which is relying on what it says would have been possible if it had complied with its duties.  Further, it is not, in my judgment, enough for it to establish that it would have been able properly to serve Exclusion Notices; and then, in reliance by analogy on the general principal in damages claims to say that the RBs’ remedies should be constrained by the minimum which Holdings could have done to comply with its duties.  That general rule is not applicable to cases where an employer has failed properly to exercise a discretion in relation to bonuses or other benefits: see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Rutherford v Seymour Pierce Ltd </span>[2010] EWHC 375 (QB), [2010] IRLR 606 at [33].  In such cases the court, in assessing damages, puts itself in the position of the employer and assesses what the likely level of bonus would have been.  In the case of a binary decision, as in the present case between the service or non-service of an Exclusion Notice, the court needs to be persuaded <span style="text-decoration:underline">at least</span> on a balance of probabilities that Exclusion Notices would have been served.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My findings of fact at the trial are insufficient to support a finding that Holdings would, in May 2010, have served Exclusion Notices with an effective date on or after the Longstop Date.  On the evidence which I received, I do not consider that I would then, or should now, reach the conclusion that it would have done so.  The context in which it would have had to consider the question would have been one where it would have appreciated that Project Waltz as a whole would give rise to a breach of duty and would have appreciated also that the NPAs – all of them – were part of  a series of transactions comprised in those breaches of duty.  Holdings would have realised that, consistently with the Reasonable Expectations, it was unable to bring about a situation under which DB accrual between 2009 and the Longstop Date could be terminated (other than by, perhaps, the nuclear option of winding-up the DB Plans).   Project Waltz was flawed; I cannot conclude, in the hypothetical scenario where that flawed project was not taking place, that this single element – the service of Exclusion Notices effective from the Longstop Date – would have been implemented.</p>

Booking the curtailment gains in the 2009 accounts was central to that object.  It is accepted by Mr Evans that specifying a later effective date in the Exclusion Notices would still have allowed curtailment gains to be booked in the 2009 accounts.  But there is a dispute about the impact of a change of effective date on the amount which could be booked.  Mr Simmonds says that it would have been only slightly different.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Evans has this to say about that submission. First, he says, correctly, that I made no findings about this.  More importantly, the matter was not explored in any detail at the trial.  I agree that it is not appropriate for me now to make detailed findings without the benefit of further expert advice which neither side has sought to adduce for the purposes of this hearing.  Nonetheless, it is possible, I consider, to say that the amount might, and probably would, have been very different.  The curtailment gain represents an acceleration, for accounting purposes, of the savings achieved by Soto.  This was because the amortisation period for the prior service credit was brought forward as the result of the closure of the Plans.  In effect, the part of the prior service credit which would otherwise have been spread over the years after closure is recognised in one year.  In the present case, the amount accounted for in 2010 and 2011 before closure was unaffected, but the amount that would have been accounted for after closure was brought forward and it was recognised in 2009 on the footing that the Exclusion Notices were valid.  Mr Evans has shown me some of the material which was in evidence, material emanating from IBM, which shows that for the Main Plan there would be a curtailment gain of £66 million in respect of the period from closure to the end of the third quarter of 2014 booked for 2009 on the assumption of accrual ceasing in 2011.  However, as he points out, if the closure had taken effect from 31 March 2014 the only amount which would have been booked in 2009 was the residual amount properly referable to the period after that date (being the date of closure).  So the curtailment gain booked in 2009 would have been very much smaller.  I agree that postponing the closure to 31 March 2014 would have had a significant effect on the amount of the curtailment gain.  This would have had an impact on the ability to deliver the 2010 EPS targets which were required by Project Waltz.  That impact was significant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, there is a real doubt (to put it at its lowest) that an important element of Project Waltz was capable of delivery by the premature announcement of termination of DB accrual.  In those circumstances, it is far from clear – certainly I am not satisfied – that Holdings would nonetheless have served any Exclusion Notices.  It is more likely, it seems to me, that it would have worked up some alternative proposals and have waited to see how matters developed in the future.  As it happens, things moved on quite a lot; in particular, in May 2010, IBM announced that non-operational retirement related costs would no longer form part of its EPS reporting and targets given to investors.  And of course, much later, Holdings would have known that the Exclusion Powers could not break the final salary link.  </p>

In the context of Issue 14.4 it does not appear that there is much if anything between the parties because, if contrary to my finding, the Exclusion Notices can be partially set aside by being treated as taking effect from a future date, Holdings’ proposals provide the affected member who elects to accept the proposals, with Hybrid Deferred status.  It is common ground that Hybrid Deferred status would be subject to any necessary consents being given by the Trustee and subject to any subsequent events that would have caused cessation of such status in respect of any given member.  There would, however, be a dispute between Holdings and the Trustee about the form of the Hybrid Deferred status in question, Holdings’ case being that it means the form communicated to members in 2009 in particular in respect of early retirement.

This power – and, hence, any Reasonable Expectation in respect of it – was relevant only to retirement from active status. Once the Longstop Date has occurred and valid Exclusion Notices have taken effect, however, members will not be in active status and, accordingly, any Reasonable Expectations in relation to the early retirement policy will no longer be of relevance. Furthermore, Hybrid Deferred status itself has never been subject to any Reasonable Expectations on the part of members; it was a concession offered by IBM during the course of the Consultation. In particular, there was no separate Reasonable Expectation as to what Hybrid Deferred status would consist of. Therefore, if Hybrid Deferred status is to apply to affected members from some future date, it must be Hybrid Deferred status in the form that was communicated to members in 2009 (including, in particular, the application of the New ER Policy).</p>

I can pick it up at 22 October 2009 when there was a TMM at which the Trustee agreed to the necessary amendment subject to the Court confirming that IBM had not acted in breach of good faith and had met members’ reasonable expectations.  That, of course, did not give rise to a binding contract and, in any case, the condition was not fulfilled as I have held that there was a breach of the duty of good faith.  The minutes of the TMM record Mr Ferrar as asking the Trustee to agree to two proposals: (i) the creation of a new category of member (hybrid deferred) “for all members who ceased accrual on 5 April 2011” and (ii) “the <span style="font-weight:bold">opportunity [my emphasis]</span> to admit Members into M Plan for future service”.    It was recorded that the new, more stringent, early retirement policy from 6 April 2011 would be implemented.  It was also recorded that Mr Lamb clarified that the Trustee was not prepared to introduce a hybrid deferred category or to allow Members to enter the M Plan without the direction of the Court.  On the next day, Mr Newman wrote to Mr Ferguson to confirm the Trustee’s position:</p>

He had written “to set out the changes the Company is prepared to make if the Trustee (a) agrees to implement them by amending the Plans and (b)…..”.   The changes included cessation of DB accrual on 5 April 2011.  The requested amendments were clearly to give effect to the proposals, that is to say changes taking effect <span style="font-weight:bold">as from 5 April 2011</span>.  And, as Mr Ferrar made clear at the TMM, the amendments were to facilitate the proposals – there needed to be in place a structure pursuant to which Holdings would be able to implement its proposals (which, to repeat, included the New ER terms).  The understanding, of course, was that Holdings would in fact implement the proposals: it would hardly have taken all the time and trouble which it had if that was not its firm intention.  But there was no obligation, at that stage, to do so and, had there been a change of heart for some reason before service of the Exclusion Notices, nobody could have compelled Holdings to provide M Plan membership. </p>

That, I think, is not strictly accurate.  The amendments (requested in Dickinson Dees’ letter dated 2 November 2010) were not requested in order that the amendments should of themselves confer Hybrid Deferred status or to give the option; rather, the amendments were requested in order to provide the structure under which an affected members could achieve Hybrid Deferred status and under which effect could be given to such an option.  The amendments were needed in order for Holdings to be able to offer an affected member the benefits of Hybrid Deferred status as from 6 April 2011.  </p>

There was nothing in this that would oblige Holdings, as a matter of contractual obligation to the Trustee or to the RBs, actually to make to the affected members the offer which it was proposing to make.  This conclusion is consistent with another passage relied on by the Trustee which in my view, far from supporting its argument, actually supports Holdings’ case:</p>

Something else would need to be done actually to give rise to such membership within the amended structure which allowed for it.  That “something else” would be (i) the offer of such status by Holdings and (ii) the election by the affected member to adopt one of the three offers which Holdings was proposing to make.</p>

I make the same points in relation to that as I have already made in relation to the earlier correspondence.  The Trustee is not assisted, in my view, by the passage in that letter in which Nabarro notes an “apparent risk” that Holdings would withdraw the option of M Plan membership if the Trustee failed to give the agreement sought.  It is not possible to derive from that the proposition that the Trustee was agreeing to the amendment only on the basis of a contractual commitment to admit the affected members to Hybrid Deferred status and to membership of the M Plan.  But even if that is wrong, the contractual commitment was, in my judgment, only in the context of a valid termination of DB accrual on 6 April 2011 (although if that date had shifted by a few days or even weeks, no doubt Holdings would have continued with the proposals and not declined to make the offer which it was, at that stage in December 2010, intending to make).  If there was a contractual commitment at all, it was only one which would have obliged Holdings to admit the affected members to Hybrid Deferred status and to M Plan membership as a consequence of the termination of the service of the Exclusion Notices contemplated by the proposals (and not, therefore, of some different and later Termination Notices served following the determination of the Court that the actual Exclusion Notices were to be set aside).</p>

The reason it is no answer is because the arrangement clearly contemplated (subject to waiver of the entitlement) that members would be entitled to be treated as having continuing Pensionable Service under the DB Plans.  They could not, at the same time, accrue benefits under the M Plan or, even if they could, they were clearly not intended to do so.  The continuing accrual of DB benefits meant that the affected members simply remained as members of the DB Plans as though the Exclusion Notices had not been served: they could not, with that status, also have the status of Hybrid Deferred members.  </p>

The New ER Policy was accordingly invalid: it is as much invalid in relation to Hybrid Deferred members as in relation to active members.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reject the Trustee’s submissions on this point.  It is clear, in my view, that the communications with the Trustee and the Pension Decision Tool make clear that Hybrid Deferred status is being conferred on the basis that the New ER Policy would be adopted in relation to the Hybrid Deferred members.  There is nothing wrong, in principle, in Holdings adopting different ER policies in relation to different groups of people, provided that the difference is not illegally discriminatory or irrational or perverse.  Holdings could, therefore, have decided to retain the Old ER Policy for those retiring from active service, but have expressly adopted a different policy in relation to those retiring from Hybrid Deferred status.   I see no reason why that “different policy” should not have been the New ER Policy.  Accordingly, if Holdings were now to serve valid Exclusion Notices taking effect from the Longstop Date (or some later date) and assuming (contrary to my finding) that the members affected by such Notices were entitled to Hybrid Deferred status, there is nothing to prevent Holdings from applying the New ER Policy to them.  </p>

I suppose one could quibble about what “must” means in Issue 15.4.  For my part I consider that, if a statutory regulation provides that an employer may not take certain action unless he has consulted about it, it would be entirely apposite to say the employer “must” consult before taking that action.  In the present case, the relevant Regulations of the Consultation Regulations (mentioned above) provide that an employer may not make a listed change unless there has been the consultation required by the Consultation Regulations.  Clearly a termination of DB accrual would be a listed change; in my judgment the Regulations require Holdings to carry out the statutory consultation before it serves any further Exclusion Notice.  </p>

In that context, he refers to Judgment [1554] and [1555].   I agree with that submission, but only up to a point.  I accept that there is no general contractual duty to consult so that generally the failure to do so would not give rise to a breach of any duty of trust and confidence.  But there may be cases where the fact of a failure to consult destroys or seriously damages the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and the employee.  In such a case, there is a breach of the implied contractual term.  I do not consider, in such a case, that it would be correct to say the term which is ordinarily to be implied is excluded in relation to the failure to consult because the only remedy is that provided by the Regulations.  </p>

It seems to me that the employer might well be in breach of its implied duty of trust and confidence if it then failed to consult but nonetheless implemented changes to the disadvantage of the members.  Now it may well be that Mr Simmonds is correct to say that the only remedies for that breach are those laid down in Regulation 18.  But that does not mean that there has been no breach of the contractual duty: it simply means that that breach does not entitle the employee concerned to any remedy other than that laid down by the Regulations.  In such a case, if one asks whether the employer “must” consult, the answer must surely be “Yes” otherwise not only will it be in breach of its statutory obligations, but also in breach of contract.  Further, the case for injunctive relief in these circumstances would be stronger: such relief would not only prevent a breach of statutory duty but would also prevent a breach of contract.  </p>

Regulation 18 sets out the exhaustive list of remedies which do not include any remedy that involves an employer’s being ordered by the Court to carry out a process of consultation.   I do not disagree with that.  But it is not an answer to the point that Holdings needs to consult about what is (jumping ahead: see for further analysis the immediately following paragraphs of this judgment) an entirely new proposal, namely to serve Exclusion Notices in the future, some years after the original Project Waltz proposals and against an entirely different financial and economic backdrop.  </p>

I do not accept the submission that new Exclusion Notices would not be a new proposal.  It is true that part of the previous consultation was whether pensionable DB service should be terminated.  But there has been no consultation about whether that termination should take place in the very different economic and financial circumstances of 2014 as compared with 2010.  Moreover, there has been no consultation in the context of the change in IBM’s EPS reporting to investors.  Further, in the light of the Judgment, it is to be hoped that Holdings might view with slightly more independence from IBM Corporation than it did previously proposals emanating from Armonk with which it might not agree from a UK operating perspective.  I draw attention to Judgment [1590] in this context.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason is that the previous consultation was not a consultation simply about termination of DB accrual.  It was a wider consultation about Project Waltz and it was only within that context that the termination of DB accrual was to take place.  A new proposal to terminate DB accrual will not be in the context of Project Waltz.  Whether there will be a free-standing proposal to end DB accrual by exercise of the Exclusion Powers, or whether that will be done in the context of a wider proposal, perhaps similar to Project Waltz, I simply do not know.  But one thing which can, in my judgment, be said is that whatever is proposed hereafter will be a new proposal.  It will not be possible to rely on the original consultation as an adequate consultation in respect of any component of such a new proposal.</p>

In my  judgment, that obligation of an employer applies as much to the exercise of his rights and powers under a pension scheme as they do to the other rights and powers of an employer. Say, in purported exercise of its right to give or withhold consent, the company were to say, capriciously that it would consent to an increase in the pension benefits of members of union A but not of the members of union B. In my judgment, the members of union B would have a good claim in contract for breach of the implied obligation of good faith: see <span style="font-style:italic">Mihlensted v.

If a remedy was to be found, it could be found only in the contract of employment.

He points out that Nourse LJ based his decision on an implied term rather different from the implied contractual term of trust and confidence.  In contrast, Nicholls LJ did refer to something very similar to the implied duty of trust and confidence, saying at [64] of his judgment that it was necessarily implicit in the contract of employment that the bank agrees that it will discharge its functions under the trust deed in good faith.  But why, Mr Simmonds asks, is it a necessary implication if there is an independent fetter in the trust deed?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I see the force of the point behind that question.  There are, however, two reasons why these submissions are not an answer to the Trustee’s case that the duties run in parallel.  The first is that the remedy for the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty may not provide the remedy which justice demands.  If Mr Simmonds is right in his submission that there is no financial remedy available to a member for breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, then the implied contractual term is needed to enable him to obtain a remedy for conduct on the part of the employer which destroys or seriously damages the relationship of trust and confidence.  Indeed, on one view, the implied contractual term is more obviously appropriate given the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty than it would be without such a duty.  Mr Simmonds’ submission turns on the need to imply a term.  But the implication of a term is not to be judged exclusively by necessity.  Rather, the test is that which I have discussed at length earlier in this judgment in the context of the disputed term: see paragraph 91<span style="font-style:italic">ff </span>above. In applying the test, it is helpful to ask whether the term would go without saying.  Surely, if Holdings and a member had been asked, they would have agreed that it went without saying that Holdings would exercise its powers in accordance with the limitation to which the powers are subject.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason is that it I do not think that it is open to me (or if it is I do not consider that I should) to adopt Mr Simmonds’ approach.  It would require me to reject the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Milhenstedt</span> which I think only the Court of Appeal should do.  Even if Nourse LJ’s decision can be side-lined on the basis that his focus was not on the implied obligation of trust and confidence but on a different implied term, Nicholls LJ clearly rests his decision in contract.  He does so <span style="text-decoration:underline">even though</span> there might be a trust claim (the point which he left open) and must, therefore, have considered it possible to imply a term into the contract of employment even if there were a limitation on the exercise of the discretion.</p>

I consider that all one can  properly say, in the context of Project Waltz as a whole, is that certain actions gave rise to a breach of contract, other actions gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and other actions may have given rise to a breach of both duties.  The context of Project Waltz is important because it is only in that context which one can judge whether a particular action breaches whichever of the duties is under consideration.

Just as a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty can take many different shapes and forms, so too the equitable remedy should be crafted to reflect the nature of the breach.  Rather than saying that, because one remedy is available for a particular sort of breach (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>financial compensation for one type of breach), that remedy should be available for all types of breach, I think that a more principled approach would be to match the remedy to the breach in accordance with established authorities applied by way of analogy where it is possible to do so.</p>

One can have a duty not to do something, or a duty, if one does something, to do it, or not do it, in a particular way.  In the case of pension schemes, there is a duty (or call it an obligation if you will) on an employer to exercise its powers, if it exercises them at all, in accordance with the limitation stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial Tobacco</span>.  Inherent in, indeed the essence of, the limitation is an obligation on the employer not to act in a particular way.</p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty has been fashioned in the context of the exercise of powers. It may be, as Mr Evans submits, that there are other situations in which the employer or the employee may take actions in the context of the pension scheme (in contrast with the contract of employment) which would destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence.  It may be that, by way of further extension of the implied contractual obligation of trust and confidence, a new duty should be imposed or the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty expanded.  But that is not, simply in terms of language, what is meant by the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  The remedy for breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty must be assessed by reference to the scope of the duty which has, thus far in the development of the jurisprudence, been established. Having said that, I consider that the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial</span> duty should apply to closely analogous functions (see paragraph 431 below).

Further, <span style="font-style:italic">Houghton v Immer </span>is a case where the voidable exercise of a power led to an award of equitable compensation.  English law is, I consider, consonant with that decision.  It provides a good analogy and suggests strongly to me that equitable compensation is available in cases of breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.

But in cases where the employer is exercising a discretion, the position is, I think, different.  Thus in cases of bonus awards, the court, when assessing damages for a wrongful failure to award any bonus, seeks to evaluate what the employer itself would have been likely to do.  It is not to be assumed that the discretion would have been exercised so as to give the least possible benefit to a claimant if such an assumption would be unrealistic on the facts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Rutherford v Seymour Pierce Ltd </span>[2010] EWHC 375 (QB), [2010] IRLR 606 at [33] and <span style="font-style:italic">Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">International International </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 1287, [2004] IRLR 942<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>at [48] and [64] to [72].

Whether that is a sensible view depends on whether, pending an appeal, the Trustee is to administer the DB Plans in a way which reflects the result of this judgment or whether a stay is placed on the implementation of my decisions pending an appeal.  I have not yet heard any submissions about permission to appeal against my conclusions in the Judgment let alone my conclusions in this judgment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Trustee likewise relies on its arguments in relation to Issue 16 in relation to the principle of an award of damages and/or equitable compensation. There is some detail on the application of the principles to the facts.  Mr Evans submits that it is possible that affected members may have suffered financial loss as a result of the shortness of the ER Window and the announcement of the pending introduction of the New ER Policy. In particular, there are a number of members who retired during the ER Window who contend that they would not have retired then, but rather would have continued in Holdings’ service, had it not announced the impending change to its policy regarding early retirement from active status (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the change from the Old ER Policy to the New ER Policy). The Trustee understands that the total number of these members is 861. A significant number of such members have already brought claims against IBM in the Employment Tribunal. These members contend that they have suffered financial loss as a result, for example lost earnings and other in-service benefits and lost DB accrual. They may also present claims for consequential losses, such as the reduced value of state benefits, share options and losses due to an inability to maximise the investment strategy and tax efficiency of their pension arrangements.  In principle, and subject to proof that as a result of the existence and shortness of the ER Window they retired earlier than they would otherwise have done, such members should be compensated by a monetary award – either by way of damages or equitable compensation, as set out above. </p>

In principle, an affected member is entitled to damages for breech of contract, or equitable compensation in respect of Holdings’ breach of its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty.  In relation to a person who retired during the ER Window, I do not consider that it is appropriate for me to give any further ruling.  In the context of a damages claim, there are likely to be significant issues about causation, remoteness and mitigation; and similar issues may arise in relation to equitable compensation.  I think that these issues would best be dealt with in proceedings (in which I include mediation) between Holdings and the affected members concerned.  I am anxious, in any case, not to say anything which might have an impact on any damages claim made by such a member in respect of salary.  If there is a contractual claim in respect of lost pension benefits, logically there ought to be a similar claim in respect of lost salary.</p>

In effect, this would be to give them the additional DB accrual they lost as a result of their early retirement, plus compensation for other financial losses to the extent that those are attributable to pension provision (and not, for instance, for lost earnings which has nothing to do with the pension schemes or the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty).</p>

In this judgment, I have already rejected Mr Simmonds’ suggestion that the Longstop Date was 6 April 2011 (or at least a date not very long after that).   In the light of my conclusions in relation to the Exclusion Notices, it is not in fact necessary to decide on the Longstop Date for the purpose of the remedies flowing from the invalidity of the Exclusion Notices since (subject to the Trustee’s reservation of its position on appeal) it is accepted before me that it is no later than 31 March 2014. Nor is it necessary to decide the point for the purposes of remedies flowing from the invalidity of any of the NPAs (or rather of the non-pensionability terms resulting from them).  However, if it were necessary for me to do so, I would adopt 31 March 2014 as the Longstop Date.  The period ending on that date is the period relevant to the other Reasonable Expectation concerning continuation of the Old ER Policy.  That policy could only apply to a member if he was an active member when he left service.  But if a valid exclusion notice could be served taking effect before that date, the Old ER Policy would not apply to him.  The result of that somewhat technical point is the same as the message that members might have taken from the combination of all of the many communications; it would be an unusually astute member, I suggest, who would have appreciated that, although he would be entitled to take early retirement on the Old ER terms, that entitlement could be abrogated by the simple expedient of excluding him from the Scheme.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Subject to one possible exception, this conclusion is not inconsistent with anything in the Judgment.  The exception is that, in Judgment [865], I did say that a reasonable member remaining in the DB arrangements could not form an expectation that the DB Plans “would for the rest of his working life, or indeed until 2014” remain open to future accrual.  On one reading, this could be said to be a finding that the Longstop Date was before 2014.  But that would be contrary to what I said in Judgment [1532 i)] where I said that the Longstop Date “might be 2014 or perhaps even earlier”.  I could not have said that if I had previously decided that the Longstop Date was before 2014 unless I had overlooked that I had done so.    I certainly did not intend to decide the point in the Judgment; Judgment [865] would more accurately have reflected my view if I had said “beyond 2014” rather than “until 2014”.  But that is only one reading.  This paragraph must be read in its context in the Judgment as a whole.  At this stage, I was considering Project Soto and the proposals announced and explained at the managers’ meeting in January 2006.  There were other communications after that (see Judgment [866] to [926]) which could have had an impact on how the earlier communications were to be seen.  Judgment [1532 i)] reflects my ultimate view that I should not decide the point.  I therefore propose to proceed on the basis that I did not decide the point in the Judgment or, if I did, that it is open to me to review that decision to eliminate the inconsistency with Judgment [1532 i)].</p>

By that I meant a Reasonable Expectation similar in content to that engendered by Ocean, not one which would, subject to a different starting point, have the same duration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There has been some debate about the basis on which Holdings’ conduct gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and how that breach is to be characterised.  One thing is clear which is that the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty is an equitable, not simply a contractual, duty; although <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial Tobacco</span> itself concerned the exercise of a power (just as the service of the Exclusion Notices concerned a power) I do not perceive any different approach being applied to the exercise by an employer of any other function under a pension scheme, in particular a change of policy which does not require any rule amendment or exercise of any other formal power.  I use “the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty” as including the duty in respect of such functions.  The remedies available for breach of duty in the exercise of an employer’s functions under a pension scheme are no different, in principle, from the remedies available for breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty in the exercise of a power, although the difference between the function in question and a power may require remedies to be tailored to suit the circumstances.  </p>

In that sense, there is a parallel with the NPAs which did not of themselves give rise to rights or obligations but indicated the basis on which future salary increases would be awarded.  In my discussion under Issue 2, I expressed the view that it was inapposite to approach the NPAs by asking the question whether they were void, voidable, unenforceable or valid.  Those questions were better directed at the contracts which came into being as a result of the NPAs having been entered into.  The NPAs gave rise to breaches of duty and thus had an infecting impact on the contracts which were based on them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Similarly, the change in ER Policy gave rise to a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty but it is inapposite to ask whether the New ER Policy itself is void, voidable, unenforceable or valid.  What matters, in terms of remedy, is the action which was taken in the light of the New ER Policy which would not have been taken if the Old ER Policy had continued.  There are two main classes of member to consider each of which comprises members who wished, at any time up to April 2014, to leave Holdings and who could have taken early retirement under the Old ER Policy but who would not be able to obtain (including those expressly refused) consent under the New ER Policy.  The classes of such members are (i) members who nonetheless decided to leave service on the less favourable early leaver provisions and (ii) members who decided to remain in service rather than leave on the less favourable early leaver provisions.  The first category is unlikely to include any member who could have taken advantage of the ER Window but there may be people who slipped through that net for one reason or another.  And there is, of course, the category of member who did take advantage of the ER Window but who would have preferred to remain in service with the Old ER Policy applying: I have considered their position under Issue 20.3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the first category, it is reasonable to assume that most members who left service voluntarily without consent would have left service if the Old ER Policy had continued to apply to them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second category, there were, no doubt, many members who remained in service who would have taken early retirement if the Old ER Policy had continued in operation.  Members had a Reasonable Expectation that they would be able to take early retirement under the Old ER Policy, a Reasonable Expectation which would last until April 2014.  Such a member, however, faces an evidential burden in satisfying one or more of Holdings, the Trustee and a court or tribunal that he would have taken early retirement had the Old ER Policy been available.  If such a member cannot demonstrate that he would have taken early retirement, the change in ER policy will have had no impact on him and he is not entitled to a remedy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to many of the Issues concerning the change of ER Policy, the Trustee analyses the change of policy as the advance refusal of consent to early retirement.  Under the Old ER Policy, a member could have asked for consent to take early retirement and would virtually automatically have been given consent if he fulfilled the relevant criteria.  Once the New ER Policy was in place, it was still open to a member to seek consent but there would be little point in his doing so if he knew that he did not fulfil the new criteria.  There would not, in his case, be an express refusal of consent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As an overarching point, the Trustee contends, for the purpose of remedies, that Holdings should be treated as having given consent to retirement from active service to all eligible members (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>those who would have been entitled to take early retirement under the Old ER Policy) who in fact left service during the period for which the Old ER Policy should have continued in effect.  The class under consideration here, of course, comprises members who did not have consent to early retirement (other than C Plan Over 60 Members who did not need consent) and either took immediate early leaver benefits or became deferred members.  The Trustee’s submission is that those who took immediate benefits should now receive (with retrospective effect) the benefits which they would have received under the Old ER Policy and that those who became deferred members should now be entitled (subject to an election to the contrary) to the same benefits (with retrospective effect) as if they had taken immediate benefits and not become deferred members.</p>

Before I turn to those, there is one important point in relation to the New ER Policy which I need to address and which will feed into the answers to the Issues.  It is the extent to which Holdings could have validly resolved on a new ER policy identical to and along the lines of the New ER Policy.  In the Judgment, I decided that the Reasonable Expectation concerning ER policy was that the policy would not change until April 2014.  Accordingly, Holdings would have been able to announce (subject to an appropriate, if any, period of notice) a change in that policy as from the end of March 2014 without thereby giving rise to any breach of duty.   This area is explored further under Issue 22.2.</p>

Nor do I find it particularly helpful to ask whether the “refusals or deemed refusals of consent” were void/unenforceable/voidable/valid.  The more important issue is the effect of the New ER Policy on the eligible members.  There is no doubt that, in the light of the Judgment, the change of ER Policy and its implementation gave rise to a breach of duty on the part of Holdings in relation to eligible members.  The change of ER policy gave rise to a breach not only in the context of Project Waltz as a whole, but also viewed in isolation under Scenario A (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>taking account of the Reasonable Expectation relating to the continuance of the Old ER Policy).  An eligible member who has left service is able correctly to say, in my judgment, that, had it not been for Holdings’ breach of duty, he would have been treated differently; he would (subject to the answer to Issue 21.2) have become entitled, on leaving service, to benefits in accordance with the Old ER Policy (save to the extent that Holdings would have been entitled, in any particular case, to decline to apply that Policy to the member, for instance because of special operational requirements).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Is there any reason in principle why the Trustee should not do so?  I do not think so.  The reason (the only reason) that it should not do so is that the Rules provide for the beneficial early retirement benefit to be paid only where Holdings has given consent to the early retirement.  However, in a case where Holdings would be in breach of duty in refusing its consent (so that it would be acting irrationally and perversely), it would be appropriate, in my judgment, to direct the Trustee to administer the Plans as if consent had been given.  This remedy, it is to be noted, is not one which requires any action on the part of Holdings.  It is a remedy which goes only to the way in which the pension trusts are to be administered.  This result can be reached in (at least) the following two ways, each of which is, in my judgment, valid:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">First, as a matter of construction of the Rules, it is possible to imply a term to the effect that, where consent is withheld in breach of duty, it is not required.  On any test for the implication of a term – whether the test articulated by Lord Hoffmann in the <span style="font-style:italic">Belize Telecom </span>case or the “goes without saying” test or “necessary to give business efficacy” approach – a term can be implied dispensing with the need for consent in such a case.  In a different field, a covenant against assignment of a lease without the consent of the landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, allows an assignment without consent where consent is unreasonably withheld.  There is nothing at all surprising – indeed it is to be implied – in the proposition that early retirement should only be with Holdings’ consent but with a proviso that such consent should not be irrationally or perversely withheld.</p>

That case demonstrates how a Trustee is entitled to depart from the express trusts of a pension scheme (with injunctive relief being granted if necessary) where appropriate contractual arrangements have been entered into between an employer and affected employees.  Both the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and the contractual duty of trust and confidence were breached by Holdings’ failure to consent to early retirements in the cases under consideration.  The other side of that particular coin is that Holdings’ duties required it <span class="hidden"/>to give its consent to early retirement.  The Trustee is entitled, in my judgment, to recognise Holdings’ duties in administering the Plans.  It should do so by treating Holdings’ consent as having been given (in contrast to the first route which dispenses with the need for consent at all).</p>

If, contrary to my approach, it is necessary to address the validity of the New ER Policy and the failure to consent to early retirement pursuant to the policy on the basis of the validity of the exercise of a power, then the discussion already carried out in relation to the exercise of the Exclusion Powers is relevant.

Consider, by way of analogy, the position which would have obtained if the policy which Holdings was permitted to adopt had to be set out in a Schedule to the Rules, Holdings having a power to amend the Schedule from time to time.  A change of policy would then be effected by a change to the Schedule: effectively Holdings would be exercising a power given to it by the constitutional documents.  The change of policy in the present case can be tested by the same criteria as the exercise of the hypothetical power of amendment in the example.  I have examined the principles sufficiently in considering Issue 13.  The result in relation to the change of policy is that the New ER Policy is not void, but is voidable and liable to be set aside in whole or in part at the election of the members.  This would leave the Old ER Policy in force.  As to the actual failure to consent, see the next following paragraph.  </p>

And it is necessary to address matters at that level, in any case, following on from the setting aside of the New ER Policy. Once again, the analysis in terms of the exercise of a power is dealt with under Issue 13.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty at this stage of the analysis is that Holdings has simply failed to give consent.  It has, albeit in breach of duty, failed to exercise a power (namely to consent to early retirement).  To speak of a failure of that sort as being void, unenforceable or voidable and liable to be set aside does not make a great deal of sense unless there is a default position in such cases, that is to say a default position in which consent is to be treated as having been given.  Suppose, for instance that an individual had asked for consent to early retirement and had been refused; and suppose that I were to hold that such refusal was void or was to be set side.  That makes the refusal a non-decision but does not, of itself, substitute for it the granting by Holdings of consent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The answer to Issue 21.1 is that the New ER Policy cannot be relied on by Holdings (subject to the answer to issue 21.2) in relation to an Eligible ER Member who would, had the Old ER Policy remained in force, have been entitled to benefits in accordance with that Policy.  A refusal or deemed refusal of consent in relation to such an eligible member who has left service was, or was part of, a breach by Holdings of both its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty and its contractual duty of trust and confidence.  The Trustee should proceed on the basis that either consent was not required or that it is to be treated as having been given.  A member may, however, elect to retain benefits as if the Old ER Policy did not apply to him.</p>

To my mind the real issue is whether Holdings can restrict the impact of my conclusions in relation to Issue 21.1 to that part of the pension benefits which is attributable to pensionable service prior to 6 April 2005 (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the period prior to the Project Ocean changes) leaving the New ER Policy to take effect in relation to benefits attributable to pensionable service from 6 April 2005.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Judgment, I decided (although Mr Evans made a valiant attempt to persuade me that I did not decide it at all) that the Reasonable Expectation concerning ER policy was that the Old ER Policy would apply until 2014 in relation to service up to the implementation of Project Ocean.  In other words, members were entitled to hold a Reasonable Expectation that if they retired before 2014 (or rather before the end of March 2014) they would know that they would obtain an immediate pension which, in respect of that part which had accrued by 6 April 2005 (calculated taking account of the final salary link as Mr Simmonds accepts), would attract the favourable early retirement factors.  They had no Reasonable Expectation that, if they retired early, that part of the pension attributable to service after 6 April 2005 would attract those favourable factors.  It was therefore open to Holdings to implement changes to early retirement provided that the Reasonable Expectation was respected.  It could, for instance, have introduced a rule amendment (subject to Trustee consent and to appropriate consultation) which altered the early retirement factors applicable on early retirement with consent so that different factors applied in respect of service before and after 6 April 2005.  To the extent that it was possible to achieve the same objective by a change of ER Policy, there was nothing to prevent it doing so (at least viewing the change of ER policy ignoring the fact that it would form part of Project Waltz).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What it chose to do was to announce the New ER Policy.  This change of policy was a change to the circumstances in which consent to early retirement would be given.  It thought that this change would be effective in relation to the whole of a member’s pension entitlement.  But the result of the Judgment is that it could not be effective in relation to the part of the pension attributable to pre-6 April 2005 service.   Faced with that fact, Mr Simmonds submits that the solution is simple: a member is to be entitled to retire early but the New ER Policy will apply only to that part of his pension accrued after 6 April 2005.  It is a necessary element of this submission that, had the point been realised when the New ER Policy was introduced, it would have been possible, expressly, to adopt a new ER policy which said precisely that.  I do not consider that this could have been done.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal reason why this could not be done is that it is not conceptually possible to divide the relevant consent into different components.  The Rules permit a member to take early retirement with Holdings’ consent: see Rule 2 Schedule D Main Plan DB Rules; Rule 6.6 Data Sciences Section Rules; and Rule 2 Schedule G I Plan Rules.  If he does retire with consent, then the whole of his pension attracts the favourable early retirement factors.   Either a member retires with consent or he does not retire with consent: I do not understand how, conceptually, it can be said that a member both (i) leaves service with consent and (ii) does not leave service with consent.  As I have suggested, a rule amendment might have been possible to achieve Holdings’ object.   But that was not done and that is not what the Rules of the DB Plans in fact provide.  It is not possible, in my judgment, to treat a consent to take early retirement under those Rules as operative in respect of one period of service but not another.  The New ER Policy itself was simply not capable of effecting a change to the Rules which would have brought about this result.  I can understand an argument that, had it been possible to implement a new policy which achieved Holdings’ object, then the New ER Policy should be treated as doing so.  But, for my part, I have not been able to think of such a policy and none was put forward by Mr Simmonds.  Accordingly, I reject Holdings’ case on this issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, the result of what I have said reflects, in my view, how the reasonable person would have viewed matters.  Holdings having engendered a Reasonable Expectation that accrued benefits were protected, and thus that the benefits of the existing ER policy would continue to be available in respect of past service, the reasonable person would know, looking at the Rules and booklets, that he was entitled to early retirement with Holdings’ consent.  He would know of the practice and policy always to grant consent.  It would not have occurred to the reasonable person, I venture to suggest, that by changing its <span style="text-decoration:underline">policy and practice concerning the giving of consent</span> Holdings would be able to treat different periods of employment differently.  He would surely have understood that a Rule amendment would be needed to produce that result.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is another reason why this severance of the consent requirement cannot take place.  The adoption of the New ER Policy did not take place in isolation.  It took place in the context of Project Waltz as a whole.  It is the proposals as a whole which were flawed.  Even if the New ER Policy had been reflected in a Rule amendment so that it applied only to future service, it would still form part of Project Waltz and thus part of a project the aim of which was to achieve an objective which could not be achieved without a breach of duty.  One aspect of that, but not the entirety, is the lack of adequate consultation.  It is far from clear that, if there had been a proper consultation and assuming that Holdings had acted entirely properly, any change at all would have been made to the ER policy.  In these circumstances, I do not consider that the Court should countenance giving partial validity to the New ER Policy even if that were possible in principle.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, it seems to me that the conclusion for which Holdings argues is, in effect, asking me to treat the change of ER Policy as effecting a change in the Rules by allowing consent to be given for one period but not for another.  Even assuming that such an amendment could be made, it could be made only in respect of future service.  But no such amendment was made: it could only take effect from the date on which it is made and, no amendment having being made so far, the Old ER Policy must continue to apply at least up to April 2014.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I certainly agree with Mr Simmonds that there is no conceptual difficulty in Holdings’ approach.  The question is whether, when a member leaves service, he is to be treated as retiring with consent even though (i) no consent has been given and (ii) he had no Reasonable Expectation that the Old ER Policy would be in force after March 2014.  There is no question of severance of the good from the bad.  Further, even if that is wrong, there is no conceptual difficulty in severing the New ER Policy in respect of the periods before and after the end of March 2014: its operation can be ineffective so far as concerns members leaving service before that time but effective thereafter.  I would add that the members have known since late April 2014 (by which time it was possible to have digested, so far as digestion was ever possible at all, the Judgment).  It might be said therefore that the members have had plenty of time in which to make a decision whether to leave Holdings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, that is not necessarily to say that the New ER Policy can be treated as a valid policy known to the members and by which their early retirement requests would be assessed as from the end of March 2014.  With the benefit of the Judgment (to the extent that it survives any appeal) it can be seen that the Reasonable Expectation did not survive beyond the end of March 2014.  But nobody knew that until I had handed down the Judgment, with the parties taking radically different approaches to the duration of a Reasonable Expectation even assuming it was established.  It is clear that, had anyone been asked to say how the good was to be severed from the bad, it would have been impossible to say.  Holdings would have said the New ER Policy did not need to be severed: it was wholly good.  The RBs would say that the New ER Policy was inherently flawed and should not be recognised at all.  Even those who might have accepted that it could take effect from some future date would have been unable to say what that date was.  Accordingly, were this a case where it was necessary to sever the good from the bad as can be done with the exercise of powers (as to which see the discussion of <span style="font-style:italic">Bestrustees </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Betafence</span> at paragraphs 298<span style="font-style:italic">ff</span> above) I doubt very much that it would be appropriate to do so.

What they would know is that it would not be available to them after 6 April 2014 if (as turned out from my Judgment) the Reasonable Expectation had expired by that date.  Unless it can be said that to present members with that choice was itself another breach of duty, the difficult decision has to be made.

Unless it can be said that to present members with the change without giving them a last opportunity to take advantage of the Old ER Policy was another breach of duty, I do not, once again, see why Holdings should not be able to implement the New ER Policy.

As in situation 1, Holdings has in fact indicated that the Old ER Policy is not one which it intends to continue (albeit it has to recognise that it is constrained by the Reasonable Expectation); and as in situation 2, its position is that further notice is not required.  What both situations 1 and 2 have in common is that neither of them has anything to do with a breach of the members’ Reasonable Expectation concerning continuation of the Old ER Policy.  But that (subject to one point) is also the case on the actual facts.  It is not the past breach of duty on the part of Holdings which gives rise to the position in which the members now find themselves.  Rather, it is because the constraint arising out of the Reasonable Expectation has come to an end and because, having made clear that members should not harbour any expectation about the continuation of the Old ER Policy, members were faced with a difficult choice.  In other words, the members’ complaint will not be about disappointment of their Reasonable Expectation and will not, therefore, be about a remedy for the breach of Holdings’ duty brought about as a result of that disappointment.  </p>

There must come a time after which Holdings is entitled to adopt such a policy free from the constraints of Project Waltz.  Whether Holdings can implement such a policy once such a time has arrived without giving reasonable notice of the change of policy is not a question which arises in the context of remedies for the breaches of duty involved in Project Waltz.

If a change of policy could not, as a matter of general approach, be implemented without notice, then notice would be required for Holdings to adopt the new policy; but if notice was not required, then the fact that the new policy follows on from the end of Project Waltz and takes place in the context of the litigation leading to the Judgment and to this judgment does not result in notice being required, when otherwise it would not be required.  </p>

The point has not been argued.  If any party wants me to deal with the point, I will consider whether I should do so, taking account of any objections to that course.  It may help if I provide some very provisional views which are not put forward even as preliminary decisions in principle:</p>

In that submission, Holdings made clear that the New ER Policy was to take effect.  If a period of notice was required, the period from 17th July to date would be a reasonable one.  If there is any doubt about Holdings’ position at that time, there could not be any doubt by the end of the remedies hearing at the end of July.  </p>

These Rules do not, like some other pension schemes, draw a sharp distinction between those who retire, on the one hand, and those who leave service early, on the other hand.  Instead, the larger class – those who leave early – contains a sub-class – those who retire before NRD – with an immediate pension being payable only to those in the sub-class.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first is this.  A number of cases have considered the meaning of the words “retire” and “retirement” in the context of pension scheme documentation.  Some fine distinctions have been drawn.  The message to be taken from the cases as a whole is that context is critical to ascertaining the meaning of the words used.  Before turning to those cases, I remind myself of the proper approach to construction which I dealt with at Judgment [215] and [216] including reference to my earlier judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">PNPF Trust Company Limited v Taylor </span>[2010] EWHC 1573 [2010] PLR 261 at [127] to [145].   As before, I see no reason to depart from what I said there and I see no merit in repeating it.  I add only that it would be hardly surprising, in the context of such a substantial document as the 1997 TD&amp;R (and earlier iterations) to find gaps and minor inconsistencies.  The court should not struggle to fill the gaps or avoid the inconsistencies if to do so would produce a result which, although literally full and consistent, fails to reflect what it can be said must have been the draftsman’s intention.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that it is appropriate to construe the Rules in the context of the legislation (both tax legislation and social security/pensions legislation) and Inland Revenue/HMRC Practice Notes.  This is admissible material: see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Mettoy Pension Trustees Ltd v Evans and others </span>[1990] 1 WLR 1587 (see Warner J at p.1610H) and <span style="font-style:italic">British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v British Airways plc </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 672, [2002] PLR 247 (see Arden LJ at [30]). However, care must be taken in carrying across to the rules of a pension scheme the meaning which particular words have in the legislation or Practice Notes.  For instance, the word “retirement” may have one meaning in the Practice Notes.  The rules should then be construed, if possible, consistently with the Practice Notes but that does not mean that the word “retirement” has to be given the same meaning in the rules.  If, for instance, the rules spell out using different language the substance of what the Practice Notes provide, then there may be no need to give a particular word, such as “retirement” the same meaning in the rules as in the Practice Notes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third point is a longer one and relates to the various meanings which the words “retire” and “retirement” might have in different contexts.  There is no doubt that the verb “retire” can be used in both a transitive (“X has been losing his edge recently and his employer has decided to retire him”) and an intransitive sense (“X has had enough of his job and, now he is 64, has decided to retire”).  Both are perfectly “natural” meanings although perhaps the intransitive sense is the more common.  The noun “retirement” can be used to describe the result of either or both of a person retiring or being retired.  It is all a question of context.</p>

A goes off to a better paid job as an assistant solicitor in another firm.  B has decided on a change of career and has obtained a job as a forester.  C, having inherited a large amount of money, has decided not to undertake any further paid work and has decided to devote his life to good causes and his vegetable garden.</p>

Most people – certainly the objective reasonable person – would see that as an age at which retirement, in the full sense of ceasing to be in paid employment, could take place.  That, it seems to me, is why it is correct to say that A, B and C have all retired from F LLP.  But if A, B and C had all been aged 30, it must be very doubtful that anyone would say that there had been a retirement of any sort.  Save in exceptional cases, such as sports professionals, it would not be a normal to use the words “retire” or “retirement” in relation to a person who left his employment at that age.  There is, perhaps, a more general exception: it is a perfectly normal use of the word to describe someone leaving service on grounds of ill-health as retiring even if that is at a comparatively young age.</p>

In the present case, it might provide some assistance.  The early retirement rule in the 1983 TD&amp;R provided that an immediate pension could be paid on retirement “if the Principal Employer agrees that the Member may be offered an immediate pension”.  Clearly the focus was not on consent to retirement but on consent to payment of an immediate pension.  If the member did not obtain that consent, he would become a deferred pensioner; the pension would become payable at the specified date (the later of leaving service and normal pension age under the preservation legislation).  But if one goes back to the 1977 TD&amp;R, one finds a rule which provided that an immediate pension could be paid “on retirement from service before the normal retirement date” where “such retirement is either … with the consent of the Principal Employer…”  It is clear, in contrast with the 1983 TD&amp;R, that the consent was to retirement not to payment of an immediate pension, although the latter would follow from the former.  There had been a deliberate change of focus.  The 1990 TD&amp;R provided for an early pension “On the retirement of a [relevant member] before his normal retirement date with the agreement of the Principal Employer”.  It seems to me that the wording of Rule 2(1) is far closer to the 1977 TD&amp;R than to the 1983 TD&amp;R.  I do not think that the archaeology provides a helpful pointer to the construction of Rule 2(1) since it might be said that the draftsman, far from wishing to continue the 1983 version, wanted to go back to the 1977 version.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Newman draws attention to the provisions in the 1990 and 1991 TD&amp;Rs which provide for deferred benefits to be payable from the NRD or any earlier date (within a 10 year limit before the normal date) subject to the prior agreement of the Principal Employer.  The prior agreement is referable to the payment of the benefit, not the leaving service, and is, on his submission, entirely consistent with the corresponding consent requirement in the early retirement provision.   I do not find that point even remotely persuasive.  In each case – immediate or deferred pension – the trigger for the application of the relevant rule is leaving service.  Bringing a deferred pension into immediate payment could not be linked to leaving service: the end of the member’s employment would, by this time, be historic and the consent requirement could only relate to brining the benefit into payment.  Indeed, in the 1977 TD&amp;R, where the consent is to retirement rather than to the immediate payment of benefits, the deferred pension can be brought into payment “subject to the consent of the Trustees” and subject to the amount being determined by the Trustee which demonstrates the contrast between consent to retirement and consent to drawing a benefit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do, however, note at this point that the early retirement rule in the 1991 TD&amp;R was, in all material respects, the same as Rule 2(1).  The earlier rule (again Rule 2(1) – but then found in Schedule G (Retirement Benefits)) – falls to be taken into account when construing the new rule.  The later provision does not necessarily have the same meaning as the earlier one since the 1995 TD&amp;R was a replacement of the rules of the Plan and did not simply effect textual amendments.  On a related point, Mr Newman submits that Rule 4(4) Schedule F cannot be relied on in the interpretation of the 1997 TD&amp;R.  That Rule was introduced after what is now Rule 2(1).  That, as a matter of law, is wrong in my view.  Rule 4(4) Schedule F forms part of the same TD&amp;R as Rule 2(1) and must be taken account of in construing Rule 2(1).  Again, the 1997 TD&amp;R is a complete replacement of the pre-existing provisions; this is not a case of textual amendments to an existing set of provisions.  This conclusion follows, in my view, from the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Stena Line Ltd v MNRPF Trustees Ltd </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 543 [2011] PLR 223 at [31] to [35], in particular the following passage from the judgment of Arden LJ:</p>

I accept Mr Spink's submission that, even though the very same clause is effectively readopted in the same form, its meaning may change on each re-introduction if the context in which it is re-adopted is materially different. Its meaning may be narrowed, or it may equally well have been widened, because of changes in the relevant background circumstances which fall to be taken into account in interpretation. Likewise I would also accept, as did the judge in paragraph 97 of his judgment, that it is possible that the meaning of a clause changes on re-adoption because there has been some material change in the scope or effect of some other clause in the period between its introduction and its reintroduction that has an impact on it……”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the structure of Rule 2(1), Mr Newman draws attention to what he calls the gateways to the provision of the deferred pension: (i) retirement (ii) before NRD (iii) with consent and (iv) after a minimum age (50) save in case of ill-health.  The benefit “shall” then be paid (but this, I note, is subject to the other alternatives listed in Rule 1 Schedule F).  He says that these four elements are not cumulative but independent.  I do not understand that submission.  There may be four gateways; but, on any view, the third of them is consent.  That means consent to something, but, structurally, there is no reason why that should be consent to payment rather than consent to retirement.  </p>

But so far as the meaning of “consent” in Rule 2(1) is concerned, I do not find the comparison between that Rule and Rule 1 Schedule F to be of any material assistance.  Rule 1 Schedule F simply lists the range of alternatives which might be open to a member “who terminates Pensionable Service before his Normal Retirement Date”.  Where more than one alternative is open to a member, he may choose which is to apply to him.  Again, I do not consider that the structure of Rule 1 Schedule F, whether read by itself or together with Rule 2(1), provides any pointer to whether the consent referred to in Rule 2(1) is focused on retirement or immediate receipt of benefits.</p>

The requirement for consent can, no doubt, be partly explained from a funding perspective: the actuary would require a greater contribution than was actually required if there had been a right to take early retirement at, say, age 60 or even earlier.  It can also be partly explained as an instrument for managing a suitable turnover in its workforce by providing it with a mechanism for encouraging employees to leave.  But that cannot be the whole explanation since consent was not required in relation to C Plan Over 60 Members.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What can be said, I think, is that one purpose of the early retirement provision was to allow Holdings to decide, at least in the case of N Plan Members, whether to allow access to the early retirement pension and this is so whether consent is focused on retirement or on receipt of benefits.  It seems to me that this is a pointer to a wider, rather than a narrower, construction of “retirement” in Rule 2(1) (although whether it goes as wide as the Trustee submits is a slightly different question).  This is because it is reasonable to think that Holdings would have wanted to retain as wide a discretion as was reasonable and sensible so that the scope of “retirement” should be generously interpreted.  As a good employer, Holdings would recognise that it needed to treat its workforce not simply in accordance with its implied duty of trust and confidence, but also fairly.  It may for commercial reasons face the need on occasions to make individual employees or groups of employees compulsorily redundant but, at the same time, might want to provide them with early retirement pensions in accordance with the favourable ERDFs.  It would be entirely unsurprising to find an early retirement provision which permitted Holdings to do precisely that; and so it would be unsurprising to find that Rule 2(1) itself could be construed to allow precisely that, without the need for Holdings to obtain an amendment to the TD&amp;R to achieve that result.  Rule 9 Schedule D provides for increases to pensions in payment, but I have been unable to find a provision providing for increases in other benefits (other than by amendment).</p>

Relying on the (unidentified) purpose of the early retirement provision, he says that it cannot be correct that there should be an automatic entitlement to the advantageous early retirement terms in those cases.  This point, he submits, falls away if consent is not consent to retirement but is rather consent to the immediate payment of benefits: even if dismissal is “retirement”, it is not with consent unless consent is actually given, and nobody suggests that consent is an automatic consequence of dismissal.  </p>

Rule 2(1), as rectified following the Rectification Action, applies to the C Plan.  C Plan Over 60 Members are able to retire without consent over the age of 60.  Accordingly, if compulsory redundancy or dismissal for cause are “retirement” within Rule 2(1), a C Plan Over 60 Member would be entitled to an immediate pension applying the favourable discount factors.   But if it is contrary to the purpose of Rule 2(1) to allow access to the favourable ERDFs in the case of Eligible ER Members, it is just as much contrary to that purpose in the case of C Plan Over 60 Members.  And so, if effect is to be given to that purpose, then it is “retirement” which has to be given a narrow meaning since the problem is not solved by an appeal to the need for consent.</p>

Dismissal does not naturally fall within the sense of those words. In particular, the rule 13(c)(iii) context of retirement “at the request of the employer” does not naturally embrace dismissal. Rule 23, on the other hand, with its broader and different language “leaves service”, appears designed for situations going beyond that of rule 13’s retirement. If “retires” in rule 13 means simply “gives up work” and otherwise takes its meaning entirely from its context, then it seems to me that there is no need for a separate expression relating to “retirement”. Mr Furness suggests that “retirement” is a special word simply used for situations of various kinds where an employee is entitled to an immediate, as distinct from a deferred pension, and that those situations are all identified in rule 13. It is true that rule 13 is dealing with cases of immediate payment of a pension, but there is no reason why, if those cases might arise in any situation (within the stated parameters) where an employee leaves service, rule 13 would not itself have been written in terms of “leaves service”. The fact remains that the basic rule is that an employee is entitled to a normal retirement pension at the normal retirement date and that the basic rule is that if he leaves service early then he is still entitled to that pension at that time. One comes back, therefore, to the fact that a normal retirement pension is measured against retirement in the ordinary way at the retirement age.”</p>

Dealing with this particular point in order to get it out of the way, it carries no weight, in my view.  To categorise the purpose in that way is simply an attractive way of asserting the conclusion which Mr Newman wants to reach.  Even if dismissal can amount to retirement, that retirement still has to be with Holdings’ consent before entitlement to the beneficial terms of Rule 2(1) is available.  The Trustee does not contend that dismissal, of itself, automatically provides the necessary consent.  If there is a point to be made, it seems to me to be a point in favour of the Trustee rather than Holdings: it is that there may be occasions where Holdings wishes to dismiss an employee but also wishes the member to retire on the beneficial terms of Rule 2(1).  The wide construction allows this beneficial treatment to be afforded through the simple mechanism of giving consent (although, no doubt, the object could be achieved by the use of other rules, including use of the amendment power if necessary).  </p>

It is said that the use of the language of retirement (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>“Retiree”) in relation to such a person lends some support to the suggestion that the occasion on which he left service was a retirement.  I do not agree with such a suggestion.

On the wider view there is a retirement where a member is dismissed after NRD by reason of compulsory redundancy and even dismissal for cause.  However, on the narrow view, there would be no “retirement” so that Rule 4(4) would not apply with the result that the Late Retirement factor would not be available.  Indeed, it is not easy to see under what provision such a person would be entitled to any pension.  He also says that this would breach the anti-forfeiture provisions of section 92 Pensions Act 1995: the court should therefore construe the provision in a way which avoids the section applying.   He may be correct in saying that section 92 would be engaged, but that is not a killer point since, as Mr Newman points out, the effect of the section would be to override the Rule if it would otherwise give rise to an inadmissible forfeiture.  </p>

On the narrow construction, Rule 4(4) does not require, and no other Rule requires, the pension to come into payment when the member leaves service since there will be no “actual retirement”.  This would not comply with the then Inland Revenue Practice Notes (IR12) which required pensions to come into payment by at latest age 75.  This is a pointer to the rejection of the narrow construction and adoption of the wide construction under which this problem would not arise. Mr Short submits that “retirement” cannot have different meanings in Rule 4 and in Rule 2, to which Mr Newman asks “Why not?” and submits that the obvious answer to this problem is that it does have different meanings.  </p>

Under Rule 5(5) a Postponed Retiree is able to receive a lump sum either on reaching NRD or on later retirement.  On the narrow construction, compulsory redundancy will not give rise to a retirement so that a Postponed Retiree who did not elect to receive his lump sum at NRD is not entitled take one later.  It seems to me that this point adds nothing to the one mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this judgment.  In particular, if “retirement” in Rule 4 is given the wider meaning, then the reference in Rule 5(5) to “later retirement” would, in my view, mean “later retirement in accordance with Rule 4”.  </p>

There is I think a slight indication in favour of the wide construction to be found in the words “A Member who terminates Pensionable Service” at the start of Rule 1.  There can be no doubt, in my view, that Schedule F embraces all types of termination of Pensionable Service including dismissal and compulsory redundancy.   A Member who is dismissed is nonetheless to be seen as one “who terminates Pensionable Service”; the draftsman did not see any need to use a different phrase such as “whose Pensionable Service terminates”.  If the verb terminate can be used in a transitive sense, why, it might be asked, should “retirement” not likewise be seen as encompassing a transitive use of the verb “retire”.  Mr Short makes the point, which I have made already in slightly different language, that “terminates Pensionable Service” and “on retirement” are not mutually exclusive given that Rule 1(1) encompasses members who are entitled to a pension on retirement under Rules 2 and 3 Schedule D.</p>

There is a distinction between “retirement” in Rule 2(1) and “terminates Pensionable Service” in Rule 1 Schedule F.  Mr Newman submits that, on the Trustee’s wide construction of “retirement”, there would be no need for two different concepts.  I do not agree.  There is clearly a need to provide for the early benefits of an early leaver who is not, on any footing, entitled to an immediate pension, for instance a person leaving service under the age of 50 or a person with less than 2 years’ qualifying service.  Rule 1 Schedule F is there to provide an exhaustive list of the available choices which might arise although in any particular case only some of the choices will be available.  Thus “retirement” is a sub-set of termination of Pensionable Service, but that fact does not tell us anything about the contents of that sub-set.  </p>

He submits that the word “retirement” should be construed consistently with the use of the same word in the tax legislation in the absence of a strong indication to the contrary.  I do not propose to go through the many statutory provisions discussed in his historical exegesis.  But there is one aspect I do need to deal with.  It relates to the definition of “retirement or other benefit” which has continued in substance in the same form since section 23 (1) Finance Act 1947 right through to section 612 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (in force at the date of the 1997 TD&amp;R).  That definition makes no reference to benefits taken from deferral and so it is suggested that it is unclear whether they amount to benefits taken on retirement.  This is important because, if they do, it will include benefits taken by those who have been dismissed.  Further, although it is the case that a scheme could obtain discretionary approval for tax purposes even though it included provision of some benefits which did not fall within the definition of retirement or other benefits, deferred benefits taken are not mentioned in the list setting out the circumstances in which the discretion to approve a scheme could be given.   The list was not exhaustive but it would be odd for such a common form of benefit not to be included in the list.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The answer to this, although it is not necessary to decide the point finally, appears to me to be found in the definition of “service” also originally found in section 23 FA 1947:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus “retirement” is seen as the state of a person who was, but no longer is, in service by reference to a particular employer.  Even a 30-year old who leaves service voluntarily would be seen as in a state of retirement.  He would not, in accordance with the modern requirements for exempt approval, be able to receive his benefits until a much later age but when he does receive them, they will be benefits “in connection with past service, after retirement…” within the words of the definition.  Similarly, when an employee is dismissed he ceases to be in service: like the 30 year old just mentioned, he may not become entitled to immediate benefits, but when he does become entitled to them, they again qualify, it seems to me, as benefits “in connection with past service, after retirement…”.  It can be seen, therefore, that the tax legislation contains a wide express definition of retirement.  One question in the present caseis whether, and if so how, that definition and the definition of “retirement or other benefit” feeds into the interpretation of the Rules.</p>

In particular, the word “retirement” is defined in the legislation by reference to “service” so that retirement and leaving service (for whatever reason) are reflective of each other.  The second paragraph which I have quoted from Chadwick LJ is no doubt correct.  The Revenue could be expected to satisfy themselves that the terms of the scheme in question provide benefits which are consistent with the grant of discretionary approval.  It does not follow that the words “retire” or “retirement” have to be construed as having the wide meaning of the statutory definition.  It would be a matter of indifference to the Revenue whether dismissal of a member over the age of 50 gave rise to a right to an immediate pension applying the generous ERDF or whether it gave rise only to a deferred pension.  If Chadwick LJ’s approach is applied in the present case, it means that every occasion of leaving service is a “retirement”.  But if that is right, it immediately gives rise to the question why Schedule F introduces a different concept when referring to “benefits following termination of pensionable service” (in the title to Schedule F) and to “terminates Pensionable Service” (in Rule 1).  Why, I ask rhetorically, did not Rule 1 Schedule F simply refer to a Member who retires rather than one who terminates Pensionable Service if Chadwick LJ’s approach is to be blindly applied? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether the flawed premise is there or not, I think I should address Mr Short’s submissions on this topic.  I agree that retirement is not always consensual: for instance, in the present case a male Eligible ER Member might resign at say, age 61 but without Holdings’ consent: he would be a person who enters into retirement within the meaning of the Rules, it seems to me, notwithstanding that he does not become entitled to an immediate pension.  Mr Short contends, in any case, that authority is against the proposition that retirement is always consensual.  He relies on the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Waite v CGHQ</span> [1983] 2 AC 714.  I do not perceive in that decision any generally applicable approach to the meaning of retirement.  Lord Fraser referred to Mr Waite variously as having been dismissed, having been retired; and he used the phrase “compulsory retirement” in the course of his discussion.  It is not contentious that “retire” and “retirement” can be used in a transitive sense if that is what the context indicates.  It may be a contentious proposition – but it ought not to be and I think that <span style="font-style:italic">Waite </span>shows that it is correct – that the word “retirement” can include the state of affairs resulting from dismissal; moreover, the transitive use of the verb “retire” is entirely apposite to certain sorts of dismissal.  Thus Mr Waite was dismissed on 30 April 1980 when he was aged 60½; he was described by Lord Fraser as compulsorily retired.  The use of the word “retired” is entirely apposite in the context of the termination of Mr Waite’s service; but there is no doubt that he was dismissed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For that proposition, he relies on the various iterations of the IBM Employee Handbook that deal with “Termination”, which he says do not suggest otherwise.  It should, however, be noted that the Handbooks do state that the normal retirement age is 63 and that late retirement is not permitted.  Although, as Mr Short submits, a normal retirement age is not necessarily the contractual retirement age (he relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Royal &amp; Sun Alliance v Payne </span>[2005] UKEAT 0122/05 at [28]), the question is one of construction of the employment contract.   Under the Handbook which Mr Short gave as an example (which is all I have looked at in this context and is, I assume, typical), the “normal retirement age” for all permanent employees is stated to be 63.  But “actual retirement age” is as defined in the pension plan to which the member belongs.  Quite what the contractual retirement age is in the light of those provisions is not entirely clear.  Further, although late retirement is stated to be impermissible, there would be nothing to prevent Holdings from extending a member’s employment beyond the defined retirement age if it so agreed with the member in which case the contract would not come to an end.  Again, by way of example, a female member of N Plan (having a normal retirement age of 60) was able to defer retirement until 65; if she elected to do so, the contract of employment would then be extended to that age but, absent any extension, would in my view come to an end at age 60.</p>

This was the case with male N Plan members (who are described in the 1997 Handbook as having an “actual” retiring date of 65) In addition, some employees who transferred into IBM under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection from Employment) Regulations 1981 may have (and there were many in 1996) had contractual retiring dates of over age 63.  In those cases, it would have been necessary (in any case where the employee did not wish to leave) for Holdings to dismiss them at age 63 in order to enforce its then policy against late retirement, that is to say after age 63.  As to that, it would be surprising to my mind if an employee who had a contractual retirement date of 65, but who was dismissed at age 63 in accordance with a policy concerning late retirement generally, was not then to be regarded as having entered into “retirement” within Rule 2(1).</p>

Mr Short’s submission is that their position does not point to the narrow meaning of “retirement”.  In this context, there is a potential anomaly (I will call it the “<span style="font-weight:bold">misconduct anomaly</span>”).  If “retirement” is given the wide meaning for which the Trustee contends, then a member who is dismissed for misconduct nonetheless enters into retirement (at least if he is over 50 being the age at which the Rules of the Plan at least envisage the possibility of retirement) and becomes entitled to the beneficial early retirement pension. Mr Short submits that there is, in fact, no anomaly because, under the common ground approach, access to the advantageous ERDFs is still controlled by the need for consent.  There is, accordingly, no misconduct anomaly to point to Holdings’ narrow construction.   It is true, I agree, that there is no such anomaly so far as concerned the Eligible ER Members on that approach to consent.  </p>

It is <span style="font-style:italic">Young v Associated Newspapers Ltd </span>(1971) 11 KIR 413.  Mr Newman cites this authority to show that the court was not unduly concerned by an anomaly similar to the one arising in the present case if the narrow construction is correct in relation to Rule 2(1) and the same construction applies to Rule 4, namely that Postponed Retirees dismissed for misconduct would not be entitled to any pension at all.  The Judge accepted that there might be an anomaly (although he left open the point of construction).  But even if there was, he considered that it was one which the employer could eliminate by use of its amendment power.  The relevant rule in that case referred to a member “retiring with the consent of the company”.  The Judge considered that the meaning of that provision was plain, namely that it did not include dismissal (in that case, a compulsory redundancy) and that its plain meaning could not be eliminated by reference to the anomaly.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the word “retirement” in Rule 2(1) is to be construed in such a way that it does not include dismissal for misconduct.  It may be that the inclusion of such dismissal in the case of C Plan Over 60 Members could be seen as an anomaly which could be lived with, but it remains, nonetheless, an anomaly and is to be eliminated if possible.  It is not, in my view, an ordinary or natural use of the word retirement that it should include dismissal for misconduct.  I do not say that retirement can never include such dismissal, but the context must be such as to demand that construction. Even the transitive use of the verb “retire” would not ordinarily include a dismissal for misconduct.  Whereas an employer might be said to “retire” an employee when he becomes less effective at his work than the employer would wish or expect, that cannot be said of a person dismissed for misconduct when that occurs before NRD.</p>

There would be no inconsistency in such an implication with any express provision of the Main Plan.  It is, if I may say so, obvious that there is a lacuna if retirement has the narrow meaning; and it is obvious – applying the “it goes without saying” reality check –  what the implication should be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.48in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, it can be said that there is a material difference between the dismissal for misconduct of a member who has reached NRD (and could thus retire, even in the case of an Eligible ER Member, without consent) and such dismissal where the Member has not reached NRD.  One objection to the use of “retirement” in relation to the member dismissed for misconduct before reaching NRD is that it simply cannot have been intended that such a member should obtain access to an immediate, and beneficial, pension.  But that objection does not apply to a Postponed Retiree.  Indeed, where a person leaves Service after his NRD, it seems a perfectly proper use of words to me to describe him as having entered into “retirement” in the context of Rule 4.  The fact of the matter is that Rule 2(1) and Rule 4 serve very different purposes; and although the Rules appear close to each other in the same Schedule, their context is different.  I see no reason why a different meaning should not be given to the word “retirement” in the two Rules.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that, in some circumstances other than in relation to a Postponed Retiree, dismissal can give rise to “retirement”.  It is a small point, but a person dismissed even by reason of misconduct on the very day of his NRD must surely enter into “retirement”; if not, there is nowhere else that his benefits can be found under any express Rule of the Main Plan.  More significantly, I regard it as clear that a person who suffers serious ill heath (amounting to “Incapacity” as mentioned in Rule 3 Schedule D) enters into “retirement” within the meaning of Rule 3 whether he resigns or whether his contract is terminated by his employer because of the ill-health.  For reasons given by Mr Short and which I have already addressed, this is not a case of frustration as described by Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">AGCO</span>.  It is simply inconceivable, to my mind, that a member who is dismissed in these circumstances should not, on the basis that this was not an occasion of retirement, be entitled to a pension in accordance with the discretion conferred by Rule 3.  So here, as in Rules 1 and 4, one finds a different meaning of “retirement” from the narrow view espoused by Holdings in the context of Rule 2(1).</p>

Holdings accepts (rightly in my view) that the dismissal which results from voluntary redundancy gives rise to “retirement”.   My view is that dismissal for misconduct does not give rise to “retirement”.  Further, the termination of a member’s contract of employment when he does retire may be brought about, in contractual terms, by a notice.  It is perfectly proper for such a notice to be given, but it is, nonetheless, a dismissal.</p>

The sort of objections which can be raised to dismissal for misconduct falling within the meaning of “retirement” do not apply to compulsory redundancy any more than they apply to voluntary redundancy.  In contrast with the position in relation to dismissal for misconduct, it is a perfectly proper use of the verb “retire” in a transitive sense to describe a member made compulsorily redundant as having been retired.

He distinguished the position of voluntary redundancy from that of compulsory redundancy, because, although the former was formally completed by means of a dismissal, it occurred in reality as a result of a prior consent to such a dismissal (see at [65]), and it fitted better into the concept of retirement “at the request of the employer” (see at<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[69]): the practicalities are that, if the employer wants to have an early retirement programme, he has to take the first step and issue his invitation or make his request (see at [70]).</p>

Rimer J (at [84]) dismissed the claim on the basis that the compromise agreement did not entitle the claimant to any benefits under the pension scheme. The Judge also considered whether, if he did have such an entitlement, the claimant retired “with the consent of” the employer so as to qualify under the scheme’s early retirement provision. The Judge (at [90] to [96]) considered that the claimant did not so retire, as the essential concept of consent in this context was that the initiative comes from the employee, and the employer in effect agrees to premature release from employment – the employer in that context cannot have consented to the termination as the employer cannot consent to his own act.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept those submissions.  As Holdings accepts, a voluntary redundancy constitutes “retirement” notwithstanding that the process is initiated by the employer and notwithstanding that it takes effect, formally, by way of dismissal.   According to Rix LJ, it qualifies because it is not in reality a dismissal but rather occurs as a result of prior consent to such dismissal (see at [65] of <span style="font-style:italic">AGCO</span>).  The voluntary redundancy process commences, I accept, only because the employer has initiated it.  But it is implicit, in my judgment, in the request from the employer for volunteers that any “retirement” which takes place (albeit by way of dismissal) will be one to which the employer has given its “consent” for the purposes of Rule 2(1).  Indeed, in a voluntary redundancy programme, an employee may or may not have his application for redundancy accepted.  If he is accepted for redundancy, the employer will clearly be consenting to his departure, a departure which is effected formally by a notice of dismissal.  That notice does not vitiate or qualify the consent which is necessary for the process to continue.  As Mr Short says, this is not a case of Holdings consenting to its own act (which is an argument which can be raised in relation to dismissal on compulsory redundancy); rather it is a case of Holdings consenting to the voluntary redundancy.  Accordingly, even on the <span style="font-style:italic">Minter </span>analysis, the relevant initiative for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">actual redundancy</span> rather than for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">commencement of the process</span> comes from the member and it is Holdings which consents.  The ensuing departure of the member is a retirement with consent.  Access to the benefit then follows automatically because that is what Rule 2(1) provides.  Holdings’ policy (whether the Old ER Policy or the New ER Policy) is entirely irrelevant: the policy relates to when consent will be given whereas, on my analysis, consent is automatically given in a case of voluntary redundancy.  It is not open to Holdings to say at one and the same time both (i) that consent is given to retirement but (ii) the member shall not be entitled to an early retirement pension.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That is, as I see it, the analysis, if the common ground approach is not correct.  But if the common ground approach is correct, the issue of consent now needs to be addressed in that context.  In that case <span style="font-style:italic">Minter</span> has no scope for application.  Rimer J’s reasoning, was that the employer could not “consent” to its own act in terminating the contract of employment.  In the present case, in contrast on the basis of the common ground approach, Holdings does not need to provide “consent” to the termination of the contract of employment; there only needs to be consent to the access to benefits.  Mr Short accepts that Holdings did not give express consent.  Instead, he submits that it is the affected members that are to be treated as having consent in the light of the unlawful withdrawal of the Old ER Policy.  When considering the position of whether consent was required to retirement rather than access to benefits, I said that it was necessarily implicit in the request from the employer for volunteers, that any “retirement” which takes place (albeit by way of dismissal), will be one to which the employer has given its “consent” for the purposes of Rule 2(1). On the common ground approach, it is not, however, necessarily implicit in the request from the employer for volunteers, that consent will be given to payment of an immediate pension with a favourable ERDF.  </p>

In that context, I have decided that the Trustee is able to provide the benefit to which the member would have been entitled if Holdings had given its consent in accordance with the Old ER Policy.  To repeat what I said, in a case where Holdings would be in breach of duty in refusing its consent (so that it would be acting irrationally and perversely), it would be appropriate to direct the Trustee to administer the Plans as if consent had been given.   The same applies to voluntary redundancy once it is established, as I have decided, that voluntary redundancy is “retirement”.  This is so, in my judgment, even if the voluntary redundancy takes place in the context of a Separation Programme which is not itself part of Project Waltz (although the fact that it is not part of Project Waltz may be important when considering Issue 28, waivers). The question  then is whether Holdings was in breach of duty in failing to provide its consent to an early retirement pension.</p>

A number of witnesses expressed their concerns about the New ER Policy because they saw the Old ER Policy as a safety net if they were made redundant.  But of course it was there as a safety net because a member would have been able to retire before being made compulsorily redundant and thus obtain an immediate pension.  Whether a member could have formed a Reasonable Expectation that the Old ER Policy would apply if, contrary to the common practice, he was made compulsorily redundant, I doubt.  And whether members could have formed a Reasonable Expectation that the Old ER Policy would apply in the event of an unprecedented compulsory separation programme I doubt even more.  I do not decide either point.  But what I do say is that I am not presently satisfied that the Old ER Policy would have applied in these situations.  And if it would not have applied, then the compulsory phases of the Separation Programmes would not have given rise to retirements “with consent”.</p>

The source of the consent has to be found elsewhere if the Trustee is to succeed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the conceptual possibility of consent being given to retirement in the context of compulsory redundancy (or indeed dismissal), I agree with the Trustee that this possibility does exist.  I reach that conclusion for the following reasons.  The purpose behind the requirement for consent under Rule 2(1) is to give Holdings a measure of control over the benefits which a retiring member is to receive: Holdings is concerned not so much with the fact of the retirement but with the consequences of the retirement.  So long as Holdings has control over whether the (expensive) benefits of Rule 2(1) are available, the purpose of the consent requirement is acknowledged.  In those circumstances, a purposive construction leads to the conclusion that Holdings is able to give a valid consent for the purposes of Rule 2(1) even in cases where the retirement occurs as the result of a compulsory redundancy (as it can, in accordance with my earlier decision).  The important point here is that the member only becomes entitled to the benefits of Rule 2(1) if Holdings agrees that he should do so by giving its consent under Rule 2(1)).   It would be open to Holdings, therefore, to make a group of members compulsorily redundant and (i) to agree expressly that such retirement (the hypothesis here is that there is “retirement”) shall entitle the members concerned to the benefits provided under Rule 2 and (ii) to state expressly that consent was being given to such retirement.  This would be effective, in my judgment, to entitle the members to benefits under Rule 2(1).</p>

Suppose, for instance, that an Eligible ER Member leaves service aged 61 without consent.  He is perfectly properly described as entering “retirement” but is not entitled to an immediate pension on the beneficial terms because Holdings has not consented.  As a matter of ordinary language, Rule 2(1) can be read as including retrospective consent, a conclusion which is entirely consistent with my approach to consent in the context of dismissal by reason of compulsory redundancy.</p>

In his oral submission, Mr Newman presented a rather different argument.  Putting the point in my own words, a member is given a choice under Rule 1 Schedule F of how to take his benefits.  Even a member who is entitled to an early retirement benefit under Rule 2(1) does not have to take that benefit: he can choose to take a deferred pension, exercising his choice under Rule 1(1) Schedule F.  Accordingly, the waivers can be seen as elections by the affected members to become deferred members (or Deferred Retirees) rather than to take immediate pensions (as Retirees).   In making that submission, he relies on a number of communications with members which show, he says, what the members thought they were agreeing to.  It is true that the documents show that Holdings regularly explained that, whether the redundancy was voluntary or compulsory, it was not consenting to early retirement: rather, the position was that there was a dismissal by way of redundancy which had the consequence that the member would become a deferred member. However I have not found any hint of election in these communications in the sense of the exercise of a choice under the Rules.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor is there any hint of election in the waivers themselves.  The underlying basis of the waivers is that the member accepts (on Holdings’ case) that he is not retiring with consent: in other words, he accepts that he does not fall within Rule 2(1) at all.   He is not, therefore, within Rule 1(1)(b) Schedule F (entitlement to an immediate early retirement pension) in the first place.  </p>

These paragraphs were not enlarged on at the oral hearing and I had not picked up the point which now leads to confusion.  It is that paragraph iii) appears to be saying that the waiver relates only to consent, in which case it would not apply where consent is not required (which, following the Rectification Action, is in fact the case for C Plan Over 60 Members).  Paragraph i), however, says that a claim by a person who does not need consent (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>a C Plan Over 60 Member) is not waived “save in respect of the Phoenix waivers”: in other words, it appears to be accepted that a C Plan Over 60 Member cannot take the point that consent was not required under the Phoenix Programme.  I take the combination of the two paragraphs to be acceptance by the Trustee in relation to the Phoenix Programme that, in the case of a C Plan Over 60 Member, the waiver is effective to preclude him from arguing that consent is not required; but not as acceptance that he is unable to take the same points, such as they are, as are open to Eligible ER Members.  </p>

This is not a case where the waiver is relied on by Holdings as a waiver of claims which the person providing the waiver had no idea could be made where different considerations might apply.  This is of relevance to the general, second, limb of each of the waivers which purports to waive all claims “that I am otherwise entitled to an immediate early retirement pension”.  The court is reluctant to extend waivers and compromises to matters about which the parties (or at least the party providing a waiver) could not possibly have had in mind.  But that is not the position in the present case where the complaints about Project Waltz had been thoroughly aired and where it was known that a Reasonable Expectation about the duration of the Old ER Policy was in the frame.</p>

Holdings maintained that redundancy was not “retirement with consent” and was concerned to meet the argument that it might be.  For Eligible ER Members who accepted the severance terms, Holdings required the Members to agree that the granting of voluntary redundancy was not to be taken as the giving of consent to retirement (or again in the language of Rule 2(1) that there was not a “retirement with consent”).  Now, that was either correct (in which case the waiver was not necessary) or it was doubtful (in which case the waiver represented a compromise).  If it had been clear to all concerned that voluntary redundancy did fall within Rule 2(1) then the language of the waiver would surely have been rather different.  The members would not be waiving claims; they would be agreeing to a variation of their benefits (along the lines of a <span style="font-style:italic">South West Trains </span>agreement).

If that were the only basis on which the Member would be entitled to benefit under Rule 2(1), it seems to me that the Phoenix waiver would take effect in relation to that entitlement.

That, in my view, is a false dichotomy.  The reason why, in either case, the Member is entitled to a benefit is because the relevant consent is established (on this hypothesis, consent to access benefits).  The waiver relates to a claim under “the IBM Pension Plan…. or otherwise” to the effect that granting voluntary redundancy amounts to consent to early retirement.  But this, it seems to me, precisely covers the consent which would, apart from the waivers, be treated as arising on voluntary redundancy as a result of the arguments based on the Old ER Policy.   This, in my view, is so even if one ignores the words “or otherwise” where they appear in the first limb of the waiver.  Taking those words into account, the case is only made stronger.</p>

It seems to me to be clear from the background and from the waivers themselves that Holdings was intending that those made voluntarily redundant should become entitled to deferred benefits only.  The first limb focuses on the issue of construction of Rule 2(1), in particular the issue of consent.  The second limb must have been intended to add something.  On Mr Short’s approach, it adds little, if anything.  I see no reason to restrict its meaning by excluding claims to an entitlement which relies on Holdings’ breach of duty in abrogating the Old ER Policy.  I do, however, consider that the “or otherwise entitled” limb applies only to a claim arising out of the voluntary redundancy.  In other words, the provision is to be read as “or that I am otherwise entitled <span style="font-weight:bold">thereby</span> to an immediate early retirement pension…” where “thereby” refers to “by granting me voluntary redundancy terms”.</p>

But that is precisely what the waiver is directed at: by waiving the claim that he has retired with consent, the member accepts that he does not qualify for the benefit.  The fact that the consent which triggers Rule 2(1) arises, under the common ground approach, as a result of the argument about the Old ER Policy rather than, under the alternative approach, as an inherent part of voluntary redundancy does not take the case out of the scope of the waiver.</p>

The reasons for these conclusions are the same as those which I have given in relation to Phoenix.  I do not consider the FAQ  statement points to a different result.  The relevant invalidity to which the FAQ statement, we now know, applies, is the change of ER policy.  The invalidity of that change, however, has no impact at all on the members’ entitlement under the alternative approach.  As I have explained, the Old ER Policy (or any other ER policy) is irrelevant.  On the alternative approach, voluntary redundancy would give rise to “retirement with consent” and the member would be entitled to an early retirement pension.  That right has not been affected at all by the invalidity of the changes to the Old ER Policy.  The right to the early retirement pension was, it is true, eliminated on the voluntary redundancy, but this was all to do with the settlement agreement and nothing to do with the invalid change of policy.  The FAQ statement is saying no more than that the members would not lose any rights which they would have had if the change of policy had not taken place.</p>

It provides that a member will not, by entering into the settlement agreement, surrender any rights which he would otherwise have.  On a literal reading, that means rights he would have if he had not entered into the settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement is the separation agreement which itself contains the waivers found in a schedule.  That makes perfectly good sense where those rights can be identified outside the settlement agreement itself: the member can enforce those rights.  But where those rights would not exist apart from the settlement agreement, the position is rather more complex.  If the member had not entered into the settlement agreement, he would not have been granted voluntary redundancy and there would have been no right which he would otherwise have had.  </p>

But even if it had done, that would not get the member far.  Voluntary redundancy would then be an occasion when he would, absent any contrary agreement, be entitled to an early retirement pension.  But that would be subject to a valid agreement to the contrary.  Holdings would say the separation agreement was precisely such an agreement.  Of itself, the separation agreements did not give rise to a breach of duty, so that it was open to Holdings to obtain such agreements with Eligible ER Members just as much as it was able to do so with a member where consent was not required at all.  </p>

It begs the question about what those rights would have been: there is no reason to think that the affected members would have been offered voluntary redundancy on terms which allowed for early retirement under Rule 2(1).</p>

I accept Mr Short’s submission in relation to the first limb of the Mercury and Apollo waivers that the waiver only goes to consent.  Since consent was not required in the case of these Members, that part of the waiver does not affect their entitlement to an early retirement pension as a result of the voluntary redundancy.  However, the second limb of the waiver does apply.  These Members are not concerned with consent.  Their benefits arise because voluntary redundancy is retirement.  The only reason they might not have been entitled to early retirement benefits, in the absence of any waiver, was the argument that voluntary redundancy did not amount to “retirement”.  Quite clearly, the second limb of the waiver is wide enough to protect Holdings from the adverse (for it) result given by this judgment that voluntary redundancy does amount to retirement.  This conclusion, indeed, lends further support to the conclusions I have reached in relation to the Eligible ER Members.  It would be odd if those Members (in respect of whom consent was required) were in a better position, <span style="font-style:italic">vis à vis</span> the waivers, than the C Plan Over 60 Members (where no consent is required).</p>

My reason, in brief, is that the ordinary and natural meaning of Rule 2(1) is, in my judgment, unambiguous.  It requires a very strained reading to relate the requirement for consent to access to benefits rather than to a change of status from active membership to retirement.  I am wholly unpersuaded by Mr Newman’s four arguments to the contrary.</p>

I consider that, by waiving the claim to the entitlement which would otherwise have existed on his voluntary redundancy, the affected member necessarily waives any financial claim based on his inability to claim the entitlement which would otherwise have existed as a result of that redundancy.</p>

In practice, the important claim which is not waived arises if an affected member could show that he would not, had the Old ER Policy not been changed, have taken voluntary redundancy but would, instead, have retired.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to such a claim, I consider the position of a C Plan Over 60 Member first. I am told by Mr Simmonds  that there were, as a matter of fact, no C Plan Over 60 Members who entered into waivers under the Mercury and Apollo Programmes.  It has not, at the time of the handing down of this judgment, been possible for the Trustee and the RBs to confirm the position.  If Mr Simmonds is correct, then there is no issue so far as concerns those Members.  But in case there were any such Members, I should deal with        the issue. It is difficult to see how the invalid change in ER Policy has any impact on such Members taking voluntary redundancy under the Mercury and Apollo Programmes.  They did so after my decision in the Rectification Action.  Those members knew that consent was not needed.  They nonetheless took advantage of the terms offered for voluntary redundancy, including provision of the waivers.  They did so no doubt after taking, or at least after being invited to take, legal advice.   I do not know why they would have taken that course.  Whatever their reasons, Holdings’ breach of duty in relation to Old ER Policy cannot have had anything to do with their choice.  They have, in my view, no claim for damages arising as a result of the Separation Programmes.  On the other hand, there may have been (I simply do not know on the evidence) C Plan Over 60 Members who decided not to take voluntary redundancy under the Separation Programmes but instead simply left service and claimed benefits under Rule 2(1).  They clearly have no damages claim arising out of the Separation Programmes.  So far as C Plan Over 60 Members taking voluntary redundancy under Phoenix, their position, in this respect, is the same as that of the Eligible ER Members discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>

A Member would then have had a choice to accept the offer (in which case he would have had to provide a waiver in respect of which no issue of breach of duty would arise since the hypothesis is that the Old ER Policy remains in force).

This was on the footing that, if a consultation was carried out at all (which was not mandatory), it had to be carried out properly.  Although not every failure to carry out a consultation properly necessarily gives rise to a breach of the implied duty, I held that the failures in the present case were so serious as to give rise to a breach.  The RBs put their claim on the basis that this breach was a breach of the implied contractual duty rather than a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty: see Judgment [1537].

He then submits that the Court cannot, in reliance upon a breach of the implied contractual term, supplement the remedies available to individual members since that would be to undermine the statutory scheme.

It is to be noted that the statutory scheme in that case gave Mr Johnson a remedy for precisely the complaints which he made: see Lord Hoffmann at [56].  Lord Millett agreed with Lord Hoffmann’s opinion, adding some observations of his own; and Lord Bingham agreed with both of them.  Lord Steyn’s opinion is consistent with the others.  All of the judges considered that the statutory scheme contained the exclusive territory for the determination of Mr Johnson’s rights and remedies.  As Lord Nicholls succinctly put it:</p>

There was, in any case, a further reason why the implied term of trust and confidence did not apply to the circumstances of Mr Johnson’s dismissal, a reason which is not applicable in the present case. It stemmed from the difficulty which Lord Hoffmann saw in extending an implied term, which was concerned with the continuing relationship of employer and employee, to the circumstances in which that relationship could be brought to an end.  I agree with the submission on behalf of the Trustee that the whole point of the <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson </span>exclusion area is that the employee has already been dismissed and has an individual statutory remedy for unfair dismissal; in those circumstances, the implied duty of trust and confidence has no further part to play.  </p>

The essential point is that the conduct of Holdings gave rise not only to a breach of the Consultation Regulations but also to a breach of the contractual duty.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would only add this.  In Judgment [1555] I gave an example which illustrates why, in principle, there ought to be a remedy in a case such as the present.  To build on that example (or perhaps merely to repeat it) suppose that an employer decides to consult on a matter which is not covered by the Consultation Regulations at all; and suppose that the manner of consultation is such as to give rise to a breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence.  Clearly, in principle, the affected employees would have a claim for damages for breach of the implied duty.  Why should it make any difference if the consultation includes, or even relates only to, matters which do fall within the Consultation Regulations?  I consider that it should not do so.  Section 259(3) Pensions Act 2004 does not require a different answer to be given: that section is concerned with the validity of the decision not with the consequences of that decision if it gives rise to a breach of some other duty.</p>

In other words, the statutory scheme displaces the common law including what would otherwise be the members’ contractual rights.  In this context, the breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence is not that the consultation failed to comply with the Consultation Regulations; rather, there was a breach of the implied duty because of the way in which the consultation was carried out.  Although, absent the Consultation Regulations, Holdings would not have been obliged to carry out a consultation at all, the fact is that it did so; and having done so, it was under an obligation to do it properly.  If, as I have held to be the case, its failings were serious enough to have amounted to a breach of the implied duty, then Holdings’ submissions, if correct, would result in the statutory scheme displacing the members’ contractual rights.  </p>

Unlike in the case of the statutory scheme in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson</span>, the Consultation Regulations give an individual member no remedy at all.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson</span>, it would have circumvented the statutory scheme if the court could give a financial remedy exceeding that which Parliament had laid down and which the employment tribunal could award.  In the present case, I do not consider that the granting of a financial remedy to an individual member for breach of the implied duty would undermine the statutory regulatory scheme.  I would see the argument that, if the Consultation Regulations had themselves provided an individual member with a financial remedy limited in amount, then the member would not be able to obtain a greater amount on the basis of a breach of the implied term.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Trustee’s contention is that the implementation of Project Waltz should be suspended pending a proper consultation.  One aim of this submission is to ensure that Holdings should not be able now to take any step in Project Waltz which it could properly take assuming (i) that the consultation had originally been conducted properly and (ii) that Project Waltz would have been adopted following such a consultation.  Another aim is to prevent Holdings from making any fresh decision to implement any of the same or similar proposals as were comprised in Project Waltz without a further consultation: this is particularly relevant to the possible service of new exclusion notices which, clearly, cannot form part of the original Project Waltz proposals (because they are new) but in respect of which the Trustee contends a further consultation must be conducted.  I consider the most suitable way to address the Trustee’s contention is to consider the impact on each of the 5 elements of Project Waltz, which I do in the following paragraphs.  My discussion is without prejudice to the point (I will refer to it as “<span style="font-weight:bold">the overarching point</span>”) which I deal with after that discussion, namely the submission on the part of the Trustee that, in the light of announcements made to members and the setting up of the PCC, members were entitled to expect that Project Waltz would not be implemented until the consultation had taken place: the submission is that no such consultation has taken place and that the whole of Project Waltz must, for that reason alone, be postponed until a proper consultation has been carried out, and this is so even though the period during which any Reasonable Expectation could be held has expired.</p>

I have also held (see my answer to Issue 15.4), that a further consultation will be necessary in relation to that.  Although the submission was not made in relation to Issues 13 to 15, that I should grant injunctive relief, it is made in relation to Issue 29.  I consider that I should do so unless Holdings is willing to give certain commitments to the Trustee and members or undertakings to the court.  The position is not entirely straightforward to deal with because of the possibility of appeal and also because it is part of the Trustee’s case that the failures in the consultation process are, by themselves, sufficient to justify postponement of Project Waltz <span style="text-decoration:underline">even if</span> Holdings were to be successful in an appeal against my other conclusions in the Judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ignoring, for the moment, the impact of any appeal, it would not be necessary for me to grant injunctive relief in relation to the service of further exclusion notices if Holdings were to give a binding commitment to the Trustee and members and/or an undertaking to the court that it would not serve further exclusion notices without conducting a proper consultation as required by the Consultation Regulations.  In saying that, I am simply indicating the sort of response from Holdings which would persuade me not to grant injunctive relief.  Absent such a commitment and/or undertaking, I consider that it would be appropriate for me to grant injunctive relief to prevent a breach by Holdings of its statutory duty under the Consultation Regulations and to prevent a further breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Now, taking into account the possibility of appeal, one outcome might be that the Exclusion Notices are held to be valid.  In that case, an injunction or undertaking such as I have discussed above would not in fact bite: the injunction or undertaking would not prevent the Exclusion Notices taking effect according to their terms.  But another outcome might be that the Exclusion Notices can be set aside and that new exclusion notices are required but without the need for any further consultation.  In that case, to have granted the injunction or required the undertaking would have given the members more than they are entitled to: and so it can be said that there ought to be nothing to prevent Holdings from now serving new exclusion notices without suffering the delay of a further consultation.  Accordingly, a mechanism needs to be found under which Holdings can serve an immediate exclusion notice which will have effect from the date of its service if the Judgment is overturned on appeal, but which will not have any effect if the Judgment is upheld (or not, in the event, challenged).  And there will need to be a resolution of the basis on which Plans should be administered pending any appeal.  I must leave matters there for the moment since such a mechanism  has not, of course, been debated before me, and nor has the basis of interim administration; the parties must be given the opportunity to do so if a mechanism cannot be agreed. </p>

In accordance with my answers to Issue 1 to 12, the affected members are not bound by the non-pensionability term (indeed for members sending protest emails, that term is not a term of the varied contracts of employment in the first place).   It may be that fresh NPAs would be sought by Holdings.  Even if new NPAs would form part of Project Waltz, and even if the overarching point is correct, there is nothing to preclude Holdings from seeking to obtain new NPAs which would, on an individual basis, take effect after the Longstop Date provided that such NPAs are not procured in a way which gives rise to a further breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence.  I do not consider that I should accede to the Trustee’s request that Project Waltz should be “suspended” in such a way as to preclude Holdings from seeking, in a proper way, further NPAs.  In the light of that conclusion, the possibility of a successful appeal by Holdings in relation to the NPAs does not need to be considered.  </p>

This issue arises in two contexts: the first is that I am right in my conclusions in the Judgment about Holdings’ breach of its implied duty of trust and confidence and its <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, and the second is that I am wrong.  I propose to restrict myself to consideration of the first of those contexts.  It is not possible sensibly to deal with the second context without knowing the extent to which and the basis on which the Court of Appeal disagrees with my conclusions.  The consequences of the consultation breach in the second context should be dealt with by the Court of Appeal.</p>

It is not suggested, and I do not consider that it could be suggested, that Holdings could not make any changes whatsoever to the Plans without prior consultation (save such consultation as is required by the Consultation Regulations).  For instance, it would be open to Holdings to adopt a new ER policy different from the New ER Policy without consultation, although it would, of course, need to exercise its power to change that policy in a proper manner.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So, what does it mean to say that Project Waltz should not be implemented?  Surely it was of the essence of Project Waltz that the 5 Elements should take effect as from the dates appropriate to each element: the Exclusion Notices were to take effect from April 2011 (it being thought that the final salary link would be broken), the NPAs were to achieve the non-pensionability of pension increases until then (and thereafter in case the Exclusion Notices did not break the final salary link) and the New ER Policy was to have immediate effect.  The result of the Judgment and of this judgment is that nothing like those proposals can take effect.  At best, from Holdings’ point of view, new exclusion notices can be served only after a further consultation, new NPAs might be possible and the New ER Policy could be introduced (although perhaps only after a period of notice).  It does not seem to me to be realistic to describe these possibilities as implementation of Project Waltz.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Rather, it will be the implementation of new proposals, an implementation which will require a fresh decision by Holdings.  That decision will have to be made in the context of current circumstances.  Any decision will need to take account of the different circumstances which exist today from those which existed in 2009.  In particular, the financial and economic conditions are different, NPPC no longer features in IBM’s EPS reporting and Holdings now has my decisions in the Rectification Action relating to the rights of C Plan members and in the Judgment relating to the preservation of the final salary link when the Exclusion Powers are exercised.  Further, Holdings should now understand from the Judgment that it cannot simply act on the basis of threats of dire consequences from CHQ if it does not act in a particular way desired by CHQ; and CHQ should understand that it is no defence to an allegation of breach of duty by Holdings that it is simply implementing proposals which, for all practical purposes, have been imposed by CHQ.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The consultation breach is particularly serious given the other breaches of duty established in the Judgment.  Indeed, had the consultation been conducted properly, those other breaches might never have occurred.  The consultation process was important as I explained in the Judgment.  I held that the result of a further consultation is not a foregone conclusion; it would fulfil a useful purpose in informing Holdings in its decision making process.  An obvious way of correcting that breach would be to require Holdings to hold a further consultation before deciding to implement Project Waltz.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against that, it is to be remembered that Holdings is not, absent the overarching point, obliged to consult before attempting to persuade members to accept new NPAs or before changing its ER policy.  Nor was it obliged to do so in 2009; its obligation was only that if it did consult (as it did) it should have done so properly.  Of course, Holdings must act properly if it is to make a fresh decision to proceed with Project Waltz or so much of it as can now be implemented.  And in doing so it must take account of the different circumstances which exist today from those which existed in 2009 which I have identified above.  But that is not to say that a consultation is mandatory.  Even if the Trustee is correct when it suggests that Holdings cannot, consistently with its implied duty of trust and confidence, introduce major pension changes such as Project Waltz, without consultation, I do not consider that Holdings would, simply by virtue of seeking new NPAs or changing its ER policy to accord with the New ER Policy, be putting itself in breach of duty unless it first consulted subject to the possible application of Regulation 8(3)(e) of the Consultation Regulations (as to which see paragraph 694 above).   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, that is not to say that the particular circumstances in which the original (non-mandatory) consultation took place might not lead to a different conclusion.  Those circumstances include the following.  In Judgment [1263] and [1304] I recorded that the consultation period ran until 20 October 2009.  The employees were told that no final decisions would be made until the consultation was complete, that is to say, in the event, not before 20 October 2009.  I also explained the process for the setting up of the PCC through which the consultation would be carried out.  The Trustee’s case is, that having announced the consultation and set up the PCC, it would be a breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence for Holdings to refuse to do what it promised, that is to say to carry out a genuine consultation before making its decisions on Project Waltz.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Holdings would say in relation to that submission that it is putting the Trustee’s case far too high.  The remedy for this breach of contract is damages.  It would be to give the members too much to postpone the time at which Holdings can properly implement proposals to effect pension costs savings until after a further consultation.  An award of damages would reflect the actual breach namely a failure to consult properly in 2009 and would reflect what would have happened <span style="text-decoration:underline">at that time</span> if Holdings had acted properly.   Given the effect of my decision in relation to Issue 1 to 28, it may be that the members have suffered no loss at all as a result of the failure to consult.  In contrast, to require a further consultation would be to give the members something which they might have come nowhere near obtaining if Holdings had acted properly in 2009: it is highly unlikely, Holdings would say, that it would simply have left pension provision as it stood.  </p>

Once having decided to consult, Holdings was obliged to consult properly.  In the context of the breaches to which Project Waltz gave rise, the failure to consult at the time was, as already stated, a serious matter.  The affected members were entitled to have a properly conducted consultation carried out before any decision <span style="text-decoration:underline">about Project Waltz</span> was made which was not done.  Before remaking any decision necessary to implement new exclusion notices, new NPAs or the New ER Policy (or anything resembling it) Holdings should <span style="font-weight:bold">if, but only if, contrary to my earlier conclusion</span>, these changes would now form part of Project Waltz, carry out a further consultation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moving away from the suspension issue, the consultation breach gives rise to a claim for damages.  In the light of my conclusions on Issues 1 to 28, I doubt that the consultation breach gives rise to any additional claim over and above the claims arising from the other breaches already discussed.  I have considered the principles, to some extent, under Issue 5.  I say that the consultation breach does not add to the affected members’ claims because, as explained under Issue 5, the Court has to conduct an evaluation of what would have happened if Holdings had not acted in breach of its duties.  It is not easy to see how that objective evaluation could depend on whether or not Holdings had carried out a proper consultation because the Court will be in possession of all the material which Holdings should have taken into account: all of the points which could have been made by the affected members, the PCC or the Trustee in an actual consultation can be made to the Court by way of submission.</p>

Without knowing the extent of such reversal and the reasons for it, it is not possible for me to identify the correct principles to apply in relation to the assessment of damages for breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence in relation to the failure to consult properly.  Contrast, for instance, these two possible outcomes on appeal so far as concerns the NPAs: (i) the procuring of the NPAs was a breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence but gives rise only to a claim in damages and (ii) the procuring of the NPAs was not a breach of duty at all (whether in isolation or as part of Project Waltz).  The measure of damages for the breach of the implied duty in relation to the consultation breach would, I think, be entirely different in these two cases.  Further, if I am wrong in my assessment that the conduct of Holdings amounted to a breach of the implied duty and the <span style="font-style:italic">Imperial </span>duty, it is possible that I am wrong, also, in my conclusion that the deficiencies in the consultation process amounted to a breach of either of those duties.  </p>

For instance, it may be that by setting aside the Exclusion Notices, a member will obtain a more valuable remedy than he would achieve by an award of damages in relation to the service of the Exclusion Notices if they were not set aside.  That must be borne in mind when it is suggested that the consultation breach has resulted in actual damages.  I consider that the matter of damages is best left there: it will be for the Court of Appeal to resolve issues of damages in the light of its conclusions should they differ from my own.</p>

I am unwilling to say more about the principles to be adopted than as set out in my discussion under Issue 5.  Holdings ought not to serve further exclusion notices without going through the consultation required under the Consultation Regulations.  I would be prepared to consider granting injunctive relief to the limited extent discussed above if the parties are unable to agree a mechanism for preserving their respective interests as suggested above.  Holdings is obliged to consult on any matters which form part of Project Waltz, but I am of the view that any new proposals are almost bound to be something very different from Project Waltz, not least because of the timing issues, so that any need for consultation on new proposals is not a consequence of the Judgment or this judgment.  Since the possibility of injunctive relief along the lines I have discussed was not fully debated before me, I think it is appropriate to allow any party to make further submissions on the point.</p>

During the course of the hearing it was agreed between the Trustee and Holdings that the underpin would be calculated differently in the case of ill-health early retirements; the ERD (if any) to be applied in such a case is to be the factor which would apply to active members in the relevant Plan.
