	      <span style="font-size:12pt">This is a Part 8 claim concerning the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (“the Scheme”) established with effect from 6th April 1978. The Scheme is a non-sectionalised industry-wide defined benefit occupational pension scheme, established for the benefit of British Merchant Navy ratings and their dependants. Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund Trustees Limited, (“the Trustee”) is the sole trustee of the Scheme and seeks the Court’s approval to proceed with a proposed amendment to the Rules of the Scheme in order to introduce a complex new contribution regime (the “New Regime”) under which all Employers which have adhered to the Scheme (the “Participating Employers”) may be made liable to make contributions to repair the current deficit. The proposed amendments give rise to issues as to whether their introduction would be a proper exercise of the Trustee’s powers and whether in fact, they are within the scope of those powers. These have come to be known as the “Propriety Issues.” </span>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In addition, the Court is asked to determine a number of questions which arise as to the status of the Scheme principally under section 75 Pensions Act 1995 and the Regulations made under that Act. The provisions in question govern the statutory liability of Employers to make deficit contributions in particular circumstances. The issues affect the terms upon which certain Employers allege that they are entitled to cease to participate in the Scheme, leaving the liabilities attributable to their former employees behind. These have come to be known as the “Open /Frozen Issues”.</span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The Trustee acts by a Board of up to twelve directors of whom half are appointed by the Chamber of Shipping (the trade association for the British shipping industry) and half are appointed by the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers. In addition there is one non-voting independent trustee director.  The two groups of directors are referred to respectively as "Participating Employers' representatives" and ~Members' representatives" in the Trust Deed and Rules. The Trustee Board is subject to a "dual majority principle" as a result of which all resolutions must be passed by majorities of both groups of directors, and any exercise of the Scheme's power of amendment must be approved by majorities of both groups. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">The First Defendant, Stena Line Limited (“Stena Line”) is a Current Employer as defined in Rule 3 of the Trust Deed and Rules of the Scheme dated 1 August 2007 (“the Current Trust Deed and Rules”). The Stena Line group bears the largest funding burden amongst the Current Employers under the 2001 Regime to which I shall refer. Under that regime, it is liable to meet 60% of the deficit repair contributions in relation to the entire deficit. </p>

The term “Historic Employer” has been adopted as shorthand for an Employer which became an “Employer” or “Participating Employer” within the definition of that expression in the then current Rules of the Scheme but which is not and has never been a Current Employer. A significant proportion of the voluntary contributions were paid on behalf of the P&amp;O group of companies. However, as with most of the other Voluntary Employers, P&amp;O Ferries ceased to pay voluntary contributions in 2006 and has not contributed to the deficit in the Scheme since that time. </p>

I am happy to make such orders. In relation to the Propriety Issues in general terms, it is intended that the Trustee be appointed to advance arguments in favour of the propriety of the New Regime.  In particular, it is proposed that the Trustee be appointed to represent all Employers interested in contending for an affirmative answer to Issues 1, 2 and 4 and that P&amp;O be appointed to represent all those Employers interested in arguing for a negative answer to the questions posed under those issues. Issue 1 is whether it would be proper for the Trustee to amend the Scheme to enable contributions to be demanded from all Participating Employers whether Current, Historic or Voluntary, (“Full Augmentation”). If the answer to Issue 1 is “yes”, Issue 2 arises. It is whether it would be proper for each Participating Employer’s liability to be calculated by reference to the percentage of the liabilities of the Scheme that is attributable to the pensionable service of Members whilst employed by that Participating Employer. Issue 4 is whether it would be proper for the New Regime to give credit for deficit contributions paid by Current Employers under the 2001 Regime and ex gratia contributions made by Voluntary Employers and for payment of section 75 debts (“Re-Apportionment”).</span>

Obvious examples of that, which are very familiar in the Chancery Division, are a decision by trustees to sell a family estate or to sell a controlling holding in a family company. In such circumstances there is no doubt at all as to the extent of the trustees' powers nor is there any doubt as to what the trustees want to do but they think it prudent, and the court will give them their costs of doing so, to obtain the court's blessing on a momentous decision. In a case like that, there is no question of surrender of discretion and indeed it is most unlikely that the court will be persuaded in the absence of special circumstances to accept the surrender of discretion on a question of that sort, where the trustees are <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie </span>in a much better position than the court to know what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.”</p>

In essence, it was as to the circumstances in which the court might approve a transaction when expert advice had been followed by the trustees.  Mr Cooper’s argument was that the expert advice that the trustees received raised a number of questions that ought to prevent the court approving the intended sale, whereas Ms Penelope Reed QC, counsel for the trustees, and Mr Christopher Tidmarsh QC, counsel for the 1987 trustees, submitted that if the trustees received and followed expert advice, they should not be required to second-guess it and the court should not withhold its approval.  As will appear in due course, I think it is important to distinguish carefully between allegations that trustees have not fulfilled their duties to the beneficiaries, and allegations that trustees’ professional advisers have acted in breach of their duties to the trustees.”</p>

The New Regime is supported by Stena Line and International Marine both of which are Current Employers and opposed by P&amp;O and Sealion both of which are Historic Employers and by Mr Brown on behalf of the Members.   </span>

The 2011 actuarial valuation, conducted as at 31 March 2011, revealed that the Scheme had assets of £676m, liabilities of £888m on an on-going basis and as a result, a deficit on that basis of £212m representing a 76% funding level. As at 31 March 2011 the Scheme had approximately 30,000 Members. Since that time, the deficit has grown. The preliminary results of the 2014 actuarial valuation show that the deficit as at 31 March 2014 on an ongoing basis was £325m representing a funding level of 70%. A funding update in mid September 2014 revealed an ongoing deficit of £333m.</span>

The deficit was divided amongst the Current Employers in proportion to each Current Employer’s share of the liabilities attributable to all Current Employers as at 31 October 1999 and the schedule of contributions aimed at restoring the funding level of the scheme to 100% of MFR by April 2006, one year earlier than required by the relevant regulations. Under the 2001 Regime, the other Participating Employers of which there were around 200 (the Historic Employers), had no obligation to contribute to the Scheme. In fact, ten of those Historic Employers agreed to make voluntary contributions to the deficit between 2001 and 2006. They did so but have not done so since (the “Voluntary Employers”). </span>

A new contracted-in defined contribution pension plan was established. It was open to those who were currently contributing Members of the Scheme whose Employers acceded to it and to new employees. Further, under the 2001 Regime amongst other things: Rule 31.0(ii) was deleted and was replaced by a collective power in the Current Employers to wind up the Scheme in certain specified circumstances; the Current Employers gained certain rights in relation to withdrawal from the Scheme; provision for the funding target to be changed was inserted; and the holding of ad hoc meetings between the Trustee and the Employers to discuss investment matters was provided for. </span>

On this reading, a single dissentient Participating Employer could cause a winding up.  This has been referred to as the "Forced Wind-up Construction".  Although the Forced Wind-up Construction was rejected in proceedings in 2009 to which I shall refer, until that time, the Trustee was concerned that an Employer could require the Scheme to be wound up when in significant deficit with the effect that benefits would not be met. It is not in dispute that the structure of the 2001 Regime was influenced by the Trustee’s concerns about whether the Forced Wind-up Construction was correct. Accordingly, it is said that the Trustee felt constrained and sought to recover contributions only from consenting or non-objecting Participating Employers in order to avoid the risk of a winding up which would have been extremely disadvantageous to Members. </p>

This resulted in what was termed cross-subsidy under which the Current Employers were liable to pay in respect of the past employment costs of Historic and Voluntary Employers. By 2006, the 2001 Regime had resulted in eliminating the MFR deficit on an “equity gilt” basis. However, by that time, a more prudent funding regime had been imposed by the Pensions Act 2004. In fact, despite the implementation of the 2001 Regime, as a result of the assumptions adopted by the scheme actuary, the 2005 actuarial valuation revealed a deficit of £93m on an ongoing basis (86% funded) and a deficit of £470m on a buy out basis.  </span>

Around this time, in March 2006, most of the Voluntary Employers ceased to contribute to the Scheme causing the financial burden of the 2001 Regime on the Current Employers to increase by 80-85%.   </span>

A paper prepared by Mayer Brown International LLP (“Mayer Brown”) which was considered at the meeting, explained that an MNOPF style amendment would enable the Trustee “to spread more equitably the responsibility for meeting the deficit in the Fund amongst those who were Employers of Members at the time at which liabilities in respect of such Members accrued.” Mr Brookes accepted in cross examination that although expert advice had yet to be obtained, it was considered that such a step would be covenant enhancing which was an important part of the equation.

It is calculated by reference to the percentage of the liabilities of the Scheme referable to the benefits accrued in the Scheme by Members whilst in the employment of that Participating Employer, calculated by use of Method C together with an element by way of pre-emptive reallocation of liabilities from those Participating Employers who are determined to be unable to pay their share (“Orphan Loading”), the application of further Orphan Loading to adjust for overall shortfall in recoveries from Participating Employers and finally, an adjustment to reflect past deficit contributions already made prior to the introduction of the New Regime.

Given the complexity of the subject matter, the amount of detailed expert advice which was obtained and the length of the period over which the process was undertaken, I did not find it surprising that, at times, Mr Brookes found it difficult to recall the precise nature of the discussion which had taken place at Trustee Board level. This was complicated further because he was also dealing with matters as a member of the Litigation Committee to which the Trustee Board had delegated some of its powers. When evaluating his evidence I also take into account that, at times, in cross examination he was only taken to part of a detailed professional report and not to the whole. Suffice it to say that I accept Mr Brookes’ evidence and that I reject the submissions that as a result of Mr Brookes’ occasional inability to recall the detailed discussion of the Trustee Board, despite detailed Minutes and the relevant professional advice papers, I should decide that matters were not properly considered or determined by the Trustee. </span>

It was concerned with the practical impact of the Implementation Methodology. In it Mr Howarth stated that P&amp;O Ferries received from the Trustee in November 2012 an illustration of the anticipated share of the deficit and the contributions payable which was updated in 2014. The illustration revealed that P&amp;O Ferries would be liable for 25% of the total liabilities of the Scheme which equated to more than £50m on 31 March 2011 deficit figures and £88m on 31 March 2014 figures. As a result, Mr Howarth and a Mr Pither made a presentation to Lincoln in August 2013 as to the financial position of the P&amp;O Ferries Group which demonstrated that P&amp;O Ferries could only afford to pay 30% to 44% of the annual deficit contribution indicated in the illustration with which it had been provided. Thereafter, the presentation was appended to a letter dated 9 September 2014 sent to Mr Brookes. However, Mr Howarth concluded that P&amp;O Ferries’ inability to pay within the ten year period was not discussed by the Trustee and the potential effect upon the operation of Orphan Loading was not taken into consideration. </span>

He also stated that after the August 2013 meeting, Lincoln informed the Litigation Committee that it had met with P&amp;O Ferries but did not discuss the nature or content of the presentation. He added that the August 2013 meeting was not concerned with covenant assessment and Lincoln did not suggest that any information received was relevant in that regard. He also stated that Lincoln had been asked to comment and advised “that they considered the Presentation at the time it was provided and their view was, and remains that it “does not contain information that would, of itself, enable a covenant rating of the P&amp;O [Ferries] Group or P&amp;O Employers to be determined.”” He also stated that Lincoln’s advice was that “the Presentation does not contain material that would affect their rating of those Participating Employers nor the overall rating of the Fund.” </span>

On that basis the Trustee did not object to the admission of the evidence but reserved the right to argue that the uses to which P&amp;O Ferries was seeking to put the information were unsustainable and to argue that the matters were not a material consideration, even if true. </span>

In addition, at the First Meeting, the Trustee was advised that if the pool of Employers which might be made liable for contributions was increased, a new method of apportionment of liabilities would be required. The Trustee received a paper prepared by Towers Watson, the actuarial firm of which the Scheme Actuary was a member.

That decision was taken on the basis of a paper submitted by Towers Watson. The paper also considered methodologies for giving credit for past contributions paid since 2001, noted that it would be necessary to consider the treatment of the Stena Line escrow account and identified the risk of Employer default if deficit contributions were sought from "untested" Historic Employers who had not been required to contribute for many years. It also mentioned the possibility that some Historic Employers would find contributions under the New Regime unaffordable. Lastly, it also introduced what has become known as Orphan Loading for the first time.

The Trustee does not owe any freestanding legal duty to Participating Employers to treat them “fairly”. He had also advised that any decision in relation to the new deficit contribution regime should at this stage be determined on an “in principle” basis only, until all relevant information had been obtained by the Trustee, such as full Participating Employer and percentage liability share data, and the implications for the security of members’ benefits of any new deficit contribution regime are identified and considered.</p>

It provided an outline of the apportionment process and showed the rough percentage of liabilities that are attributable to the Participating Employers.  The paper also gave an indication of the liability split between Current, Historic and Voluntary Employers.  It revealed that an estimated 8% of the liabilities was attributable to Participating Employers which are dissolved.  The paper was considered by the Trustee Board at a meeting on 27 April 2012. </span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Also in April 2012, Towers Watson prepared a paper for the Litigation Committee on what was termed "retrospective adjustment" but has become known as Re-Apportionment. The paper recognised that no decision had yet been, or could be, made on Re-Apportionment. Towers Watson then presented a further paper about "<span style="font-style:italic">retrospective adjustment</span>" to the Trustee Board meeting on 26 June 2012 in which it was stated that an important feature of the New Regime would be "<span style="font-style:italic">the extent, </span>if any<span style="font-style:italic">, to which the new apportionment shares will apply retrospectively</span>".  It considered making no allowance for past contributions in comparison with allowance back to 2007 and 2001. However, the paper stated that it used approximate data and that Towers Watson did not intend a decision to be made by the Trustee based on it. No decision was made but one of the Board of the Trustee asked that analysis be performed of giving credit back to 2010. That exercise was carried out and appeared in subsequent advice papers. </p>

The Minute of that meeting records that the Board noted the Lincoln report concluded that subject to confirmation based on more accurate Employer data, augmenting the pool of Employers to include Historic Employers would enhance the overall covenant supporting the Fund.  The paper itself made clear that only Augmentation had been considered and that consideration of what has come to be known as re-apportionment required “a more thorough and accurate understanding of the Historic Employer base” and would take place in a separate paper. The conclusion on an ongoing basis was that: “   . . . it seems likely that prospective Augmentation would result in day to day affordability of contributions at least as good as the Fund currently enjoys.” In the draft the phrase “would not result in a material reduction in the day to day affordability of contributions” had been used. It seems that the more positive description was inserted in part as a result of email comments on the draft made by Mr Cullen the professional secretary to the Trustee. </span>

In fact, the conclusion on an overall basis both in the final and the draft versions was that Lincoln considered Augmentation to be covenant enhancing. This is what is recorded in the minute of the meeting. Mr Brookes was unable to recall the length of the discussion which took place but noted that all members of the Trustee Board would have received the report in advance and had the opportunity to ask questions. Lastly, in this regard, he was taken to Lincoln’s recommendation that in order to confirm that Augmentation was covenant enhancing in practice, it would need to be clarified whether “all or only a top portion of the Historic Employers by liability share” should be included in the Augmentation. Mr Brookes was unable to recall whether that issue had been considered. Nevertheless, the process proceeded by reference to full Augmentation. Mr Brookes commented that the New Regime was being refined by reference to an entire suite of tools and if one aspect had been found wanting, the Trustee would have reconsidered the relevant elements of the package. </span>

He added that the amendment power on its face was wide enough to allow such an amendment and that Arden LJ in the Court of Appeal had held that it should be construed in accordance with its terms, no more and no less.

The same is true of the reference in paragraph 154.  It seems to me therefore, that Briggs J was not considering the use of the power of amendment to enable credit to be given, per se.  However, it seems to me that impliedly at least, he must be taken to have concluded that such an exercise would have been within the power of amendment.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">By way of illustration, Leading Counsel referred to a family trust. The purpose of a family trust is to maximise the benefits for the beneficiaries of the trust. The interests of the beneficiaries are therefore aligned with the purpose of the trust. By contrast, a pension scheme also involves employers and the purpose of a pension scheme is to deliver the benefits specified in the trust deed and rules, not to maximise the benefits for the beneficiaries. The interests of the beneficiaries are therefore not always aligned with the purpose of a pension scheme. To illustrate this proposition: if a pension scheme trustee has a discretionary power in relation to a surplus, there is no overriding duty on the pension scheme trustee to use the surplus to augment benefits, although this would be in the interests of the beneficiaries, given that the purpose of a pension scheme is not to maximise the benefits for the beneficiaries. If a pension scheme trustee is faced with a deficit and is deciding whether/how to exercise its discretionary powers, the Trustee must determine the most "appropriate" way to make good the deficit which is consistent with the purposes of the pension scheme (i.e. to deliver the benefits specified in the trust deed and rules), rather than an overriding consideration of what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries."</p>

Whilst recognising that there are inherent cross subsidies in an industry wide scheme, he stated that the 2001 Regime had created substantial additional cross subsidies and pointed out that under that regime, only the Current Employers were paying deficit contributions despite the fact that the deficit is attributable to pensionable service across the entire Participating Employer population. He postulated that it was difficult to conclude that the Scheme was established with the purpose of enabling the employment costs of one Participating Employer to be subsidised by another.

Lastly, Mr Nugee also considered whether the Trustee would need to know the answer to the Open/Frozen Issues before any decisions could be taken on a New Regime.  He stated that it depended upon whether the answer affected the covenant implications of any New Regime in a material way.  If Lincoln reached the same overall conclusion on each of the "open" and "frozen" bases, he considered that the Trustee Board could properly conclude it was not necessary to resolve the open/frozen issue first. </span>

Mr Newman on behalf of Mr Brown sought to make much of what he submitted were the differences between that advice and that of Mr Nugee and therefore, I will set out the salient points. However, Mr Brookes’ evidence reiterated in cross examination was that the advice upon which the Trustee based its decision making was that of Mr Nugee together with that of Mayer Brown.

Mr Tennet is recorded as having noted that it was very common for trustees to seek to repair deficits by imposition of deficit contributions on a number of employers in a way which was proportionate to the responsibility for the overall liabilities under the scheme. However, he also noted that there was no prohibition upon imposing joint and several liability between Employers. Having been asked about the position of the individual directors of the Trustee company, Mr Tennet commented that: </span>

He also made reference to exercising the amendment power for the purpose of ensuring that the Scheme can deliver the benefits promised and that the paramount purpose was to return the Scheme to solvency and that the Trustee does not owe a free standing legal duty to Participating Employers to treat them “fairly” but that did not mean that the Trustee should not have regard to the financial impact of particular contribution regimes because it is generally not in the Members’ best interests to put strain on Employers so that their ability to continue in business is prejudiced because it might weaken overall employer covenant. However, if different contribution regimes would be equally effective or there was no material difference between them, (what was termed a “tie break”) it would be rational to take account of their impact on Participating Employers.   </span>

The letter stated that Lincoln had been commissioned to provide covenant advice and in particular to confirm: that widening the pool so that all Participating Employers can be required to pay deficit contributions would improve the strength of the overall employer covenant and therefore, the security of the Members’ benefits. It stated expressly that “The Trustee Board’s decision in principle in 2009 about widening the pool was made on this basis and confirmation is now required as part of its process”; and an assessment of the effect on the strength of the overall employer covenant of the new regime “taking into account deficit contributions already paid.” In cross examination, Mr Brookes confirmed that it was expected that those steps would improve the strength of the covenant.  </span>

It was at this meeting that the Trustee considered the finalised advice papers and made the decision on whether to proceed with Augmentation and/or Re-Apportionment or to keep the 2001 Regime. In advance of the circulation of the six advice papers to be used for the purposes of the Third Meeting, the Trustee Board received an introductory briefing from all the professional advisers on 27 September 2012. It was Mr Brookes’ evidence that despite the fact that the Trustee had taken the decision to proceed with Augmentation in principle on 29 April 2009, the position was considered afresh at the Third Meeting. I accept Mr Brookes’ evidence in this regard. It is borne out by the form of the slides for the briefing session on 27 September 2012 which refer to reconsideration and if appropriate confirmation of the “in principle” decision. </span>

On that occasion, Mr Nugee also addressed the Board at some length. Lincoln’s slides reveal that they advised that on the frozen basis, the covenant strength remained “Fairly Strong” both on the 2001 basis and if Augmentation were adopted. On the open basis, Augmentation improved the covenant strength from Fairly Weak/Neutral to Fairly Strong. The Lincoln slides also reveal that the Trustee was asked to consider whether it wished to enhance rather than maintain the employer covenant. Mr Brookes accepted that he did not know whether this was discussed and it seemed likely that the discussion did not take place. However, he made clear that the meeting on the 27 September 2012 was lengthy and that the briefing provided was thorough and detailed which I accept. </span>

In fact, each of the advisers gave a short reprise of their advice by reference to a joint power point presentation. It was acknowledged that the main purpose of the Scheme was to provide members with the promised benefits and it was felt that “all the options under consideration in relation to a new deficit contribution regime including retaining the current regime were consistent with the purposes of the Fund.” Further, the Minutes record that the Trustee recognised that “it should ensure that any decision furthered the purposes of the Fund, but as regards other relevant matters, giving them appropriate weight was likely to involve balancing various matters without giving undue weight to one particular matter.”  It is stated that the issues which the Trustee went on to consider were cross-subsidy between Participating Employers, employer covenant strength, downside risk, and administrative cost and workability.   </span>

Reapportionment would not only result in greater deficit contributions being apportioned to the Historic Employers but it may also increase unwillingness to the extent that it is perceived to be unreasonable because it is “un-doing” or “re-doing’ a regime which has been in place since 2001.

They also explained that the Pensions Regulator had moved away from previous statements about the significance of willingness in assessing employer covenant.  Rather the Pensions Regulator was focussing more closely on an employer’s legal commitments to support a pension scheme.  In this regard, it was noted that Participating Employers will be under a legal obligation to pay whatever deficit contributions are due under any validly introduced regime.   However, the view was expressed that unwillingness was still a downside risk in practice - particularly if a Participating Employer could not itself pay its contributions without support from the wider corporate group in which it resides. </p>

He made clear that the Trustee had in mind that widening the pool of Participating Employers to include Historic Employers would include those who had never been asked to pay deficit contributions before and might not be able to do so. He mentioned that on the Trustee’s working assumption that the Scheme was “frozen” the overall covenant had been rated on the 2001 Regime basis as “Fairly Strong” (defined by Lincoln to mean “likely that the employer covenant will be sufficient to fully fund the pensions obligations”) and that as a result the Trustee was satisfied that the covenant was sufficient to support a contribution regime which would deliver the benefits. He added that the Trustee considered that all of the options under consideration were consistent with the purposes of the Scheme in that they would all enable the Trustee to deliver the benefits and that as a result, the Trustee could take into account other factors including cross-subsidy.    Furthermore, on the basis of Mayer Brown’s paper for the Third Meeting to which I shall refer, he states that the Trustee considered the New Regime to be potentially covenant enhancing even on the basis that Re-Apportionment was adopted. </span>

Before the start of the Third Meeting, the Trustee Board had an opportunity to ask questions of the advisers from Mayer Brown, Towers Watson and Lincoln who at the start of the meeting also gave a short reprise of their advice.</span>

However, it also stated that the Trustee could and should bear in mind the legitimate interests of Participating Employers, subject to its duty to ensure that beneficiaries receive the benefits to which they are entitled, which in turn depends on the underlying funding of the Scheme. It went on to state that the impact of the New Regime on funding and the overall covenant strength was an important matter but not the sole matter which should be considered. It reiterated the advice of Mr Nugee as follows: </span>

Mr Nugee said that it is difficult to see how the Trustee Board could properly introduce a new regime if the Trustee Board has received advice that it would significantly reduce the strength of the overall employer covenant."</p>

However, it had also been made clear that taking account of the interests of Participating Employers was subject to the Trustee's duty to ensure that beneficiaries receive the benefits under the Deed and Rules.  Potential factors both in favour and against addressing cross-subsidy were set out. Included in the factors against addressing the issue were the fact that the 2001 Regime had been approved by the Court and that it might be said that Re-Apportionment was "re-writing" history and that the effect of such a "re-writing" would be to place a burden on Historic Employers which the Current Employers had indicated they would bear. It was also noted that Historic and Voluntary Employers might have made no financial provision for deficit contributions after 2001 and that Re-Apportionment would have a greater impact on them.  The Appendix to the paper identified various potential periods for giving credit for past contributions, ranging from no credit, to 2010, 2007 or 2001, pointing out the impact of each period on cross-subsidy, covenant strength and whether it could be said to involve "re-writing" history.  The significance of 2010 was described as being the fact that it was the date when contributions were first paid following the Trustee's “in principle” decision of 29 April 2009, 2007 was described as the date when contributions were first paid following the cessation of most voluntary contributions and 2001 as the date the 2001 Regime came into effect. In cross examination, Mr Brookes accepted that by addressing cross-subsidy a relative benefit was conferred upon Current Employers. </span>

The split of liabilities was also set out on the basis of Re-Apportionment back to 2001, 2007 and 2010 respectively and the split of the liability between Current, Historic and Voluntary Employers was shown in rough terms revealing a split attributing 32.5% of Scheme liabilities to Current Employers, 29.5% to Voluntary and 38% to Historic Employers. </span>

Towers Watson also mentioned that under the New Regime, as before, orphan liabilities would be re-spread and that if credit were given for past contributions the effect was to increase orphan liabilities. Three different scenarios relating to failure to pay were set out which included the assumption that nothing was recoverable from dissolved Employers and that Employers dubbed “Very Weak” for covenant purposes would only be able to two thirds of their liabilities.

It also emphasised the weakening effect of Re-Apportionment (without an Implementation Methodology) on ongoing covenant support, rather than its positive effect on the last man standing covenant. Mr Brookes was cross examined extensively on the detailed content of the Lincoln paper. His response to the detailed questions was that he had relied upon the advice and the exercise of professional judgement by Lincoln and considered that Lincoln would have made the Trustee aware if it thought it necessary to obtain further information or costings on any particular aspect of the matter. </span>

In particular, Lincoln advised that if Re-Apportionment were adopted, a robust Implementation Methodology could "ensure employer covenant remains at least as strong as the current Fairly Strong rating". The paper set out various possible approaches including re-spreading of orphan liabilities, Orphan Loading, (the grossing up of invoices to reflect an assumed default rate, to ensure that the "correct" amount is collected), requiring payment of contributions in lump sums from weaker Employers, requiring credit support (e.g. guarantees from group companies or third parties), or use of an escrow arrangement whereby Current Employers continue to pay amounts due under the 2001 Regime. It also made reference to the risk of non-payment by dissolved and Very Weak Employers. </span>

Mr Brookes explained in his third witness statement, on the "open" analysis, the Trustee's decision enhanced the covenant to Fairly Strong (with an Implementation Methodology); on the "frozen" analysis the covenant already was Fairly Strong but with an Implementation Methodology the New Regime would as a minimum be no less strong than the current rating and potentially stronger. As I have already mentioned, “Fairly Strong” was defined by Lincoln as: "It is likely that the employer covenant will be sufficient to fully fund the pensions obligations". In cross examination, it was pointed out to Mr Brookes that at this stage, the Trustee had no information about the viability of the Implementation Methodology or its cost but appeared to have made a decision to adopt it nevertheless. It was Mr Brookes’ evidence that Lincoln had given strong assurances that a workable and cost effective regime could be designed and that the Trustee had relied upon that assurance. </span>

The Trustee Board concluded that the cross-subsidy under the 2001 Regime should be addressed to the fullest practical extent and that it was appropriate to give credit back to 2001.

Fifthly, for the same reason, the Trustee Board considered the amendment of Rule 31 to allow Historic Employers as well as Current Employers to terminate the Scheme in certain circumstances. Sixthly, the Trustee Board considered the proposed power to allow a Participating Employer which is in "credit" under the New Regime (having already made deficit contributions in excess of its share of the deficit under the New Regime) to off-set the credit against contributions due from another Participating Employer.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In summary, the Implementation Methodology works on the basis that each Participating Employer will be liable for a share of the deficit known as a "Deficit Share Amount" calculated as follows: each Participating Employer is given a "Participating Employer's Percentage" of the deficit (calculated in proportion to its share of the Fund's liabilities); this amount is increased by Orphan Loading to reflect anticipated orphan liabilities; it is then adjusted to give credit for past contributions. Each Participating Employer is required to pay its Deficit Share Amount in two instalments, the first being two thirds of the amount due with the balance due a year later. However, if the Deficit Share Amount exceeds £100,000, the Participating Employer may request an extension of the period to pay in front-loaded instalments with interest (an "Individual Payment Plan").  The payment period is based on the Participating Employer's own covenant strength or on the provision of credit support from other entities to improve its covenant. A Participating Employer that can demonstrate it is unable to afford its contributions (an "affordability constrained employer") may request an extended payment period.  It may be required to restrict its activities (e.g. payment of dividends) or it may, where feasible, be asked to provide external credit support.  If amounts payable by an affordability constrained Employer fall due after the end of the Recovery Period, Orphan Loading will be increased to ensure recovery of this long "tail" of contributions from the other Employers within the Recovery Period (but the affordability constrained Employer is not released from liability for the "tail" of contributions).    This is viewed as a covenant-strengthening feature of the Implementation Methodology which ensures that the "tail" of contributions is covered up-front by the other Employers.  In the event of liabilities becoming orphaned, the orphaned Participating Employer's Percentage will be re-spread proportionately amongst the other Participating Employers. In addition to the mechanism in the Implementation Methodology, it is proposed that the Trustee would have power to impose joint and several liability.</span>

On the open basis they reported that the covenant would be improved two rating categories from Very Weak to Fairly Strong under the New Regime, with the share of contributions supported by Very Strong or Fairly Strong Employers increasing significantly from 5% to 39%, and with an increased number of Very Strong and Fairly Strong Employers supporting the covenant. On the "frozen" basis the New Regime increased the share of contributions supported by Very Strong or Fairly Strong Employers from 12% to 39% and increased the number of Very Strong and Fairly Strong Employers supporting the covenant, albeit that the overall covenant remained in the same Fairly Strong category as the current regime.  Both reports explained that Lincoln had adopted a prudent approach to the reliance placed on last man standing covenant. This was on the basis that by the time liabilities were re-spread to the Very Strong Employers, their covenant might have deteriorated materially.  Lincoln explained that "we have adopted the approach that the best support to the Fund in the long term is Participating Employers that can afford their own liabilities, with only a relatively small allowance made for Very Strong employers". </span>

In his third witness statement Mr Brookes stated that on the basis of the Lincoln covenant advice presented at the Seventh Meeting, the Trustee Board was satisfied that the New Regime was in the interests of Members by promoting the main purpose of the Scheme being the provision of the promised benefits. Further, at the Seventh Meeting, Lincoln advised that an escrow arrangement was unnecessary on the basis of the covenant enhancement that could be achieved by the proposed Implementation Methodology.  </span>

The outstanding issues were explained in papers from Mayer Brown, Lincoln and Towers Watson.  The advisers were also present at the Eighth Meeting and explained their advice. First, as a result of criticisms raised by P&amp;O Ferries, having received advice from Lincoln, the Trustee Board considered whether it wished to proceed with partial augmentationand decided against doing so.

As a result, the Trustee Board asked Lincoln to stress test the Implementation Methodology so that the Trustee could be satisfied that it could be used irrespective of the funding target and Recovery Plan that might be adopted in the 2014 Actuarial Valuation or any future actuarial valuation.</span>

Lincoln advised in such circumstances, the overall covenant on the "open" and "frozen" bases would remain in the Fairly Strong category. In cross examination, Mr Brookes confirmed that it was Lincoln’s advice which had been relied upon and not the way in which the matter had been put in the paper provided by Mayer Brown for the meeting which suggested that it had been the Implementation Methodology itself which had been stress tested.  </span>

Ensign's paper stated that the current budget for administrative expenses was £7.5m per annum, including £85,000 per annum annualised costs for collecting contributions under the 2001 Regime.  Under the New Regime, the annualised cost would be an estimated £205,000 plus one-off set-up costs of up to £200,000. The costs were discussed in some detail and it was concluded that no further detail was needed and that it was not necessary to reconsider the earlier decisions in relation to the New Regime as a result of costs and administration issues. </span>

The Trustee also considered revised Member and Employer data and papers from Towers Watson and Lincoln which confirmed that the changes had very little impact on their previous advice.

On the basis that the Scheme is “frozen” Mr Dewar considered that the overall employer covenant would be stronger under New Regime, albeit still within the “Fairly Strong” category used by Lincoln. He also considered that on the frozen basis, the New Regime represents a reasonable approach to dealing with the deficit. On the basis that the Scheme is “open” rather than “frozen”, Mr Dewar concluded that the overall employer covenant would be significantly stronger under the New Regime and that once again it represents a reasonable approach to dealing with the deficit. Furthermore, he considered the steps in the Implementation Methodology to deal with Participating Employers with affordability constraints to be appropriate and consistent with tPR guidance. He also considered the steps in the Implementation Methodology to permit Participating Employers a longer payment period on the basis of their covenant strength to be appropriate and consistent with tPR guidance, enabling the Trustee to take a proportionate and cost effective approach. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In cross examination he confirmed that he did not consider Lincoln’s advice to be defective in any way and that he considered their approach to be prudent. He also added that when one starts with Full Augmentation, the effect of the Implementation Methodology is gradually to re-distribute debt to the stronger Employers which has the effect of strengthening the employer covenant and reduces the likelihood of having to rely upon the last man standing. He also stated that given the number of Participating Employers it is very difficult to achieve a Very Strong covenant rating but that given the number and the last man standing in the background, the covenant strength was more than capable of securing the benefits. He added that whether one demands contributions from the strongest Employers first or last makes no difference to covenant strength but that there may be a greater propensity to challenge if one were to go straight to such Employers. However, he accepted that the same effect could be achieved by requiring the strongest Employers to pay the deficit, place their contributions in escrow and then pursue the weaker Employers, as Mr Newman suggested in his submissions. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In relation to Partial Augmentation, Mr Dewar pointed out that it requires the Trustee to make a judgment at the outset as to which Employers are included and which are excluded. He said that it is difficult to define where the line should be drawn and difficult to apply it in practice whereas there are no such practical problems with Full Augmentation. He was adamant that increasing the pool of Participating Employers obliged to pay contributions has a positive effect on covenant strength. He also observed that releasing weaker Participating Employers from their liabilities might weaken the overall employer covenant and not extract value from all Participating Employers, and thereby be detrimental to Members’ interests. He also observed that in his Supplemental Report, Mr Murphy criticises the Trustee for failing to consider the impact of imposing a liability on Very Weak Employers, but ignores the fact that Participating Employers receive a Deficit Share Notice prior to the issue of any invoice, and they can then request to be considered for Option 4 whereby the Trustee can consider whether to reduce the liability and/or extend the payment period if appropriate. In fact, in cross examination, Mr Murphy accepted that he was not an expert in relation to the financial and accounting issues concerning the effect of the receipt of a notice by a Very Weak Employer which was the subject of his Supplemental Report and he stated that he could not comment in detail and that despite his reference to it, FRS12 was not relevant to the issue. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">However, Mr Dewar concluded that Mr Squires’ proposals generally do not represent a reasonable approach because: they are unnecessary, given the strength of the overall covenant under the New Regime; they do not appear to be in line with general market practice nor with the recovery plan of the other major fund in the sector (the MNOPF, which has a 12 year recovery period); they risk having an adverse impact on the strength of the individual Participating Employers’ employer covenants such that the overall covenant strength could be weakened; it is not in line with tPR guidance (which focuses on technical provisions); and various elements of it (especially the short recovery period of three years, which Mr Squires admits is unusual) would significantly reduce the Scheme’s flexibility and the Trustee’s ability to deal with either favourable market conditions or higher than expected contributions during the first two years of the three year recovery period. He also points out that Mr Squires’ regime would place undue financial pressure on the Participating Employers and would be likely to result in claims of unfairness from some Stronger Participating Employers; it would be likely to increase cross-subsidy due to the higher initial burden placed on Weaker Participating Employers; none of the schemes that Mr Dewar works with have self-sufficiency as their primary funding target, and where it is set as a secondary target the recovery period is significantly longer than 3 years. tPR guidance is based on technical provisions rather than self-sufficiency. </span>

He added that a Fairly Strong employer covenant should deliver the appropriate funding and protections for Members’ benefits, is acceptable and it is not necessary to seek a Very Strong covenant. In addition he stated that it would be very difficult for the overall employer covenant rating to be Very Strong on Lincoln’s scale, given their prudent approach and without removing the Not Rated, Dissolved, No information, Very Weak, Fairly Weak/Neutral and Fairly Strong Employers, which would mean a loss of covenant support from the majority of Employers. He added that changes in the strength of 22 individual Employers’ covenants since October 2012 emphasise the need for a flexible Implementation Methodology. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Murphy proceeded on the basis that the Scheme is “frozen.” In summary, he concluded that the Trustee has an opportunity to strengthen the employer covenant and thus enhance the ultimate prospect of the Members receiving their promised benefits. He reviewed the covenant advice requested by and provided to the Trustee and was concerned about insufficient emphasis on the importance of the objective of strengthening overall covenant, along with conflict between this objective and that of avoiding cross-subsidy. He was concerned that Lincoln had not been asked to advise on alternative methods of Augmentation or apportionment. He noted that despite the advice provided in the Lincoln June 2012 Augmentation Paper, Lincoln was not subsequently asked to advise on the covenant implications of Entire Pool Augmentation/ Method C compared with alternative approaches, nor on the impact of the “central” issue of Employer affordability of contributions. He does not consider that the Trustee was provided with adequate advice on the possible implications of the transfer of significant liabilities to the Very Weak Employers estimated to be an increase from £42m to £196m after Orphan Loading. Furthermore, he notes that Lincoln was not asked to and did not provide the Trustee with sufficiently detailed advice on the impact on the overall covenant of the five Very Strong Employers following augmentation. Mr Murphy also has concerns that Lincoln’s assessment of their impact in terms of overall covenant strength was flawed, in particular Lincoln’s assessment that the overall covenant would be “Fairly Weak / Neutral” after reapportionment but before mitigation. However, I should add at this stage that this conclusion was based on Mr Murphy’s assumptions as to the identity of three of the Very Strong Employers which he subsequently accepted was incorrect.  Mr Murphy’s overall conclusion when these issues were viewed together, was that the scope of the covenant advice requested by and received by the Trustee fell significantly short of what Mr Murphy considered was necessary to enable the Trustee to make a fully informed decision on the structure of the New Regime. </span>

Mr Murphy has no material criticisms of the scope of the instructions provided by the Trustee to Lincoln regarding the Implementation Methodology, other than the Trustee was not advised on the likely costs. </span>

Mr Murphy believes that the Trustee should have been provided with further information regarding the covenant implications of Full Augmentation (and the alternative) in 2012. He believes that the Trustee should have been provided with further information regarding the possible implications of imposing significant liabilities on the Very Weak Employers. Further, it remained his view that the Trustee should have been provided with additional information regarding the covenants of the Very Strong Employers, in the absence of which it would have been unable to fully consider the advantages/disadvantages of Full Augmentation and the alternatives, and could not have fully considered covenant risks arising from reapportionment. </span>

Mr Murphy adopts a single overall assessment which takes account of the “last man standing” whereas Lincoln discount the last man standing element. However, he accepted that different reputable covenant advisers can reasonably take different approaches to covenant assessment. He also accepted that Augmentation would increase covenant strength. In addition, he accepted that he had not considered some of the documentation and had only considered the position on the basis that the Scheme was “frozen”. He also accepted that in the light of the slides provided by Lincoln it was acceptable for the Trustee on the basis of Lincoln’s assurances, to be confident that an adequate Implementation Methodology could be devised. He also commented that there was a good likelihood of the covenant strength produced under the New Regime “meeting its obligations” and that the covenant produced by the New Regime meets his own strong covenant test.

He was also instructed to advise on the footing that the Trustee has a duty to “act in the best interests of the Fund’s members” and that “best interests” means best financial interests.

Without this advice the Trustee could not properly consider the impact of these elements on Orphan Loading, covenant, affordability of contributions and Members’ interests; if Lincoln had performed stress testing on the alternative scenarios mentioned above, they may have concluded that the employer covenant is sufficiently robust to support a regime which is materially better for Members, using a “true up” mechanism to address any concerns about additional stress being placed on weaker Participating Employers. </span>

He concluded that in order to minimise risk it is in Members’ interests for the Recovery Plan to be as short as possible, target self-sufficiency, be practical to implement and to avoid the risk of value destruction by causing a Participating Employer’s insolvency when there is the potential for recovery via a longer payment period. In this context, Mr Squires considered that a framework along the lines of the Implementation Methodology could be adopted as long as: the target was non-reliance on covenant within three years through de-risking and funding to at least self-sufficiency; any amounts not expected to be received within three years should be “orphan loaded”, with annual readjustment based on actual experience; only those Participating Employers with “affordability constraints” should be permitted extended recovery plans; and appropriate policies for the recovery or abandonment of debts from dissolved and defaulting Participating Employers should be adopted. </span>

He added that it was a positive development from the Members’ point of view and that bringing stronger Employers in was something which Members could feel comfortable supporting. As a corollary, he agreed that releasing Employers from contribution obligations would be likely to reduce the strength of the covenant using his covenant assessment methodology. He went on to confirm that he had no problem with the strength of the covenant after the introduction of the New Regime, there was no gamble being taken with the employer covenant after all and the New Regime does not expose the Members to an unacceptable risk of their benefits being unfunded. He also confirmed that he considered Lincoln’s covenant advice to be within the bounds of what was reasonable and now that stress testing had taken place, considered the New Regime to be sufficiently robust and that Members would benefit from knowing that the Implementation Methodology works. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">However, in his opinion, the Illustrative Regime would be better for Members by transferring risk of ultimate underfunding from Members to stronger Participating Employers. He considers that the potential impact of the Trustee choosing an alternative Funding Target (such as self-sufficiency) is untested by Lincoln, which represents a material shortcoming in their analysis and prevents the Trustee from properly considering the impact of a range of potential Funding Targets on covenant and affordability of contributions. He says that an additional shortcoming of Lincoln’s work is that he has seen no evidence that they have considered the potential impact on covenant of the Trustee choosing an alternative Recovery Period, which could lead to additional administrative burden and cost to the Trustee and increased strain on a number of Participating Employers. Mr Squires suggests that a practical solution to concerns regarding his Illustrative Regime would be to either only apply Orphan Loading to the strongest Employers, or for the strongest Employers to pay money into an escrow account to cover “at risk” contributions.  However, he considers the Trustee’s proposals to impose joint and several liability and a ‘synthetic s75 debt’ against non-statutory Participating Employers to be broadly covenant enhancing and that they should be incorporated into any collection regime. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Further, in the addendum to his report, Mr Squires noted that in his report he had stated that automatic setting of contribution timetables for Employers based solely on covenant strength was not consistent with tPR Guidance. He noted that the changes to tPR Guidance arguably reduce the relative importance of affordability in determining the length of recovery plans. However, he stated that the Implementation Methodology bases any extension solely on covenant, rather than the suite of factors identified by tPR. Therefore he remains of the view that the automatic extension under the Implementation Methodology, while pragmatic, is inconsistent with tPR Guidance and therefore with the Trustee’s stated objective to comply with it. Nevertheless, in cross examination he accepted that when setting the Recovery Plan, something which has yet to take place, the Trustee would be able to tailor it in order to comply with tPR Guidance. He also accepts that the revisions to tPR Guidance may result in a situation where the Illustrative Regime is more demanding on Employers than would be suggested by tPR’s principles outlined in the Revised CoP3. However, he believes that the Illustrative Regime achieves the outcome of illustrating a potential contribution regime that would be more aligned to Members’ “best interests” (i.e. the Trustee’s duties) than that outlined in the Implementation Methodology. </span>

Mr Squires understands Mr Dewar to be making two key points: that because Lincoln chose to use a four-grade rating system, a material change in covenant strength could occur without resulting in a change of grading with which Mr Squires agrees; and a Very Strong covenant grading on Lincoln’s scale would, in Mr Dewar’s view, be difficult to achieve as a consequence of a number of factors including the size of the deficit, the contributions to fund the deficit within a reasonable period and the number of Employers responsible for contributions. Whilst not commenting on Mr Dewar’s experience, Mr Squires agrees with Mr Dewar because Lincoln’s approach treats covenant as an average of individual employer covenants, rather than an aggregate. However, he concludes that while under the approach adopted by the Trustee it would be difficult to achieve a Very Strong covenant, it could be achieved under different assumptions. </span>

None of them asserted that Lincoln’s methodology and the Implementation Methodology in particular, were unreasonable and in fact, they all agreed that the employer covenant is stronger under the New Regime than it is at present whether on an open or a frozen basis and that the New Regime neither gambles with the covenant nor exposes the Members to unnecessary risk. Furthermore, Mr Squires went as far as to say that the Members would be better off under the New Regime. Further, in fact, none of the experts advocated partial augmentation and for example, Mr Murphy did not disagree with Lincoln’s basis for rejecting such a strategy. </span>

The second is whether in taking the decision to implement the New Regime and the particular aspects of it taken as part of the whole, the Trustee has not taken into account irrelevant, improper or irrational factors and has not reached a decision which no reasonable body of trustees properly directing themselves could have reached.

First, he says that it fails to bring about any significant strengthening in the overall employer covenant (the “overall covenant”); secondly, he says that it is inherently flawed, because it consists of two supposed objectives which are bound to fail and which therefore should never have been decided upon; and which depend upon a complex web of provisions the majority of which would be unnecessary were it not for the initial strategy, (“the Bootstrap”); and thirdly, it results from a process in which the Trustee has failed to obtain sufficient evidence in relation to the capacity of “Very Weak” or “Fairly Weak / Neutral” Participating Employers to meet their required deficit<span style="font-family:Garamond"> </span>contribution; the impact upon the overall covenant of the five “Very Strong” Participating Employers; and/or the potential for partial augmentation and its impact on the overall covenant (“Lack of relevant information”).</p>

However, he points out that the New Regime itself involves a large amount of cross-subsidy and that it is not necessary to deliver the benefits. Secondly, Mr Spink points out that Full Augmentation is in fact a fiction. He says that the indications are that many Participating Employers will not or may not be able to pay which makes Orphan Loading and the Implementation Methodology necessary. This is illustrated by the conclusion in Mr Murphy’s report that upon Full Augmentation without more, 44.5% of the deficit liability will be attributed to Weaker Participating Employers classified as “Very Weak”, “Dissolved”, “Not rated” and “No information”. </p>

The minutes of that meeting record that it was “noted” in October 2012, when the principle of Full Augmentation had been decided upon by the Trustee, that it had not been “<span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span>” to consider partial augmentation. Mr Spink says that this remains unexplained and that it was irrational not to have considered the alternatives properly. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, Mr Spink says that Lincoln was not asked by the Trustee to provide (and did not provide) advice that was close to sufficiently detailed on the impact on the overall covenant of the five (or four) Very Strong Employers after the first stage of the deficit repair mechanism took effect, that is, after the full augmentation of the pool. He also says that an additional lacuna in the material considered by the Trustee prior to making its decision was evidence and advice concerning the capacity of the weakest Employers to pay the contributions required as a result of their deficit share and the potential practical effect on them if they were not able to do so. On the basis of Full Augmentation alone, 44.5% of the deficit liability would be attributed to Participating Employers classified as “Very Weak”, “Dissolved”, “Not rated” and “No information”. As a result of these deficiencies, Mr Spink submits that the Trustee could not and did not properly or fully consider the potential disadvantages of Full Augmentation, nor the potential alternatives to it. He says that it is an improper purpose to decide to eradicate cross-subsidy whilst closing one’s mind to considering other alternatives. </p>

However, there was no expert evidence available to the Trustee in 2007 or for that matter in 2009. He says that thereafter, the Trustee went about obtaining such expert advice to confirm that Full Augmentation would improve the overall employer covenant. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, he says that from June 2012, Lincoln having replaced “not materially detrimental” in the draft report with “at least as good” despite the changes sought by Mr Cullen, the Trustee proceeded on the revised basis that the covenant advice needed only to confirm that the New Regime including the Implementation Methodology would “at least maintain” the overall employer covenant rather than enhance it. He also submits that the failure to reveal Mr Cullen’s requests and the material change was remarkable. He says that Mr Brookes’ evidence that he cannot recall any discussion with Mr Cullen about this and his attempt to justify not telling the Board on the basis that it could be likened to an updating as new information becomes available was one of the more unreliable parts of Mr Brookes’ evidence. The central point upon which Mr Spink relies is that the Board was not informed that Lincoln was not willing to state that there would be an improvement in the employer covenant and there was no discussion about the change in objective, in other words abandoning the intention to improve the covenant. Mr Spink also makes the point that Mr Brookes accepted in cross examination that the advice at that stage did not support that objective. Mr Spink also points to the table produced by Mayer Brown to which I referred and says that it was misleading.  </p>

Further, there is no other evidence of such a discussion. He submits that this was irrational, a crucial oversight on the part of the Trustee and evidence of an improper purpose. He also says that the characterisation of the decision to proceed with Full Augmentation in October 2012 as “in principle” should be treated with care. He says that if it were truly in principle, it would have been re-visited but that there is no evidence of this. </p>

Accordingly, Mr Spink says there was a procedural failure and it was irrational of the Trustee to exclude investigation of the partial augmentation route. </p>

Mr Spink submits that the Trustee failed to instruct Lincoln to address the issue of partial augmentation from the view point of improving the covenant strength above that which could be achieved by Full Augmentation and therefore the advice received was insufficient.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">In summary, Mr Tennet submits that Mr Spink’s case in this regard is bound to fail. He points out that the New Regime includes within in it all the advantages of partial augmentation without the need for the Trustee to seek to draw a line between Employers. He also pointed out that none of the experts advocated partial augmentation and that Lincoln in their July 2014 paper prepared for the Eighth Meeting identified a number of drawbacks and did not advocate Partial Augmentation. In fact, they advised that they “cannot see from a covenant perspective any reason why partial augmentation ought to be “adopted”.” Neither Mr Squires on behalf of Mr Brown nor Mr Murphy on behalf of P&amp;O Ferries suggested that there was any fault in that advice. </p>

Accordingly he says, it cannot be said that the advice was not properly considered by the Trustee. In fact, he says that covenant advice was received on six partial pools: not making an amendment and keeping the 2001 Regime; Augmentation only; Re-Apportionment to 2010, to 2007 and to 2001; and all of the those variables minus two C2 Employers; minus twenty-one C2 Employers; excluding dissolved Employers from the pool; excluding eight discharged Employers; and the effect of excluding the Very Weak and dissolved Employers.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tennet says that Mr Brookes’ evidence is clear that the key decisions were made at the Third Meeting with the benefit of professional advice and had not been predetermined in any way. This was not challenged in cross examination. As to the criticism that the Trustee changed its objective in 2012, Mr Tennet points out that Mr Murphy agreed that it was common sense to assume that Augmentation would be covenant enhancing. Furthermore, Mr Tennet submits that the overall conclusion in Lincoln’s draft report was that Augmentation was “covenant enhancing” and that that was what was recorded in the Minutes of the 26 June 2012 meeting. It was consistent with the advice contained in the Implementation Methodology paper dated 9 October 2012 which recorded that on a last man standing basis both Augmentation and reapportionment “will tend to be covenant enhancing” and that Augmentation with prospective reapportionment would be likely to be at least marginally covenant enhancing.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, Mr Tennet says that the approach taken by the Trustee in relation to covenant advice on Re-Apportionment was entirely consistent with the advice which it had received from Mr Nugee. He had advised that the Trustee would "need to know what the impact would be on the strength of the overall employer covenant if the new regime were to take into account deficit contributions already paid" and went on to add that "if the Trustee receives employer covenant advice that taking into account deficit contributions paid since 2001 would have no adverse effect on the strength of the overall employer covenant, it is the right thing to do".  The advice sought included an assessment of the effect on the strength of the overall Employer covenant of the New Regime taking into account deficit contributions already paid. Mr Tennet submits that this is not an irrational or flawed process and given that the New Regime with the Implementation Methodology is in fact, covenant enhancing is devoid of merit. </p>

Accordingly, the power must be exercised exclusively in their best interests and not for anyone else. He says that it is not open to the Trustee to characterise the purpose of the Scheme in an abstract manner and as a result ignore the objects of the power. In this regard, he referred me to </span>

Further indicators are the nature of the trust property itself, the nature of the power and its terms. The trust property is the Employers’ debt obligation to the Scheme which secures the accrued rights of the members. It is not in dispute that the nature of the power is administrative and the terms of the power are that of a unilateral amendment power in the hands of the Trustee. Mr Newman submits that there is nothing in the terms of the power itself to indicate any need to take the interests of Employers into consideration. Furthermore, once Employers were required to fund the deficit on a buy out basis on a winding up, any power which they may have had to threaten a winding up was neutralised and they were left without a negotiating position. Nevertheless, he says that the Trustee has taken no account of the unilateral nature of the power. </span>

He also criticised what he described as Mr Nugee having taken the 2001 Regime as a benchmark and the assertion that imposing deficit contributions only on the ten strongest Participating Employers would not be an “appropriate or rational way of allocating deficit contributions.” He also draws attention to the advice that the Trustee is compelled to consider whether it ought to take steps to reduce or eliminate additional substantial cross-subsidy inherent in the 2001 Regime and the statement that it is “difficult to conclude that the Scheme was established with the purpose of enabling the employment costs of one Participating Employer to be subsidized by another . .” Mr Newman says that there is nothing in the Trust Deed and Rules itself which requires one to come to such a conclusion.    </span>

Mr Newman seeks to draw a distinction between that advice and that of Mr Nugee and the position of the Trustee before the Court.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In relation to the uncertain nature, Mr Newman drew attention to the fact that there are some decisions yet to be made. The Implementation Methodology contains numerous blanks which depend upon other factors yet to be determined including the length of the Recovery Period and the funding target to be adopted. These will affect covenant strength. Mr Tennet’s response on behalf of the Trustee is that such flexibility is appropriate and that the Lincoln papers dated January and July 2014, the first of which was on the basis of a £200m deficit and a ten year recovery Period and the second of which adopted a £600m funding target and a 3 year Recovery Period (the parameters advocated on behalf of Mr Brown), both resulted in a Fairly Strong covenant. Mr Newman says that nevertheless, the Trustee has not stress tested the Implementation Methodology and in fact, has no intention of adopting the parameters which he advocates. He says that even if I am against him on the law I should not approve the Trustee’s proposal unless assumptions are adopted which are no less beneficial to members than those suggested by Mr Squires.  Lastly, he points out that despite the continued development of the elements of the New Regime no updated legal advice was obtained after February 2013.  </span>

He says that it is not a genuine risk management system. Mr Newman says that the first assumption as to a 33% risk of non-collection from very weak Employers is insufficiently cautious and does not err on the side of the Members. It assumes that 100% will be collected from Employers categorised as Fairly Weak over a period of 10 years despite the fact that those Employers may not remain in the same category and that the ten year period may not dovetail with the Recovery Period. He reminded me that in cross examination Mr Dewar stated that Lincoln had reached their conclusion on recovery based on the likelihood of wider group support for weaker Employers whilst nevertheless disregarding Employer driven actions for the purposes of covenant assessment.  </span>

Mr Newman raises three concerns. First he says that the figures assume a 10 year Recovery Period which may not be the case. Covenant enhancement therefore, depends upon the length of the Recovery Period which is an unknown. Secondly, Mr Newman points out that by its very nature, Phase 2 takes effect at the earliest in year two. The delay involved increases the risk of non-collection because it increases the opportunity for Employers to take steps in order to seek to avoid their contribution obligations. Thirdly, Mr Newman points to the reference in the Implementation Guide to dialogue between the Trustee and the Employers and the fact that if an Employer refuses to agree to a payment regime and to pay, there is no explicit mechanism by which that unrecovered obligation can be orphan loaded at Phase 2. </span>

He points out that after re-apportionment 63% of the deficit is borne by Employers with a covenant rated Very Weak or below which he says is of clear benefit to Current Employers and contrary to that of the Members. He aligns himself with P&amp;O Ferries in this regard and goes on to say that the Trustee’s reliance upon the Implementation Methodology is misplaced.

He points out that there is only reference to the burden upon the Employer and that a situation which would jeopardize further contributions would not be in the Members’ interests. He says therefore that there are circumstances in which the interests of the Members and the Employers elide but that this is not one of them.  In response, Mr Tennet asks rhetorically how a duty to act solely in the best interests of the Members can depend on whether there is a surplus or not, given that the existence of a surplus is dependent to a great extent upon the assumptions applied by the actuary.</span>

If they thought that something had gone wrong in the drafting to the detriment of PFPL though not of members of the scheme, they were fully entitled to draw it to PFPL's attention. Mr Newman has said, in his written reply to Mr Stallworthy's submissions that "no decision of the trustees should be made without the employer's interests being considered and taken into account".

The advice received by the trustee from Leading Counsel is recorded in the Judgment at [21].  Amongst the matters that the trustee was advised to consider were the adverse effect of the apportionment on the entity (the Company) to whom the debt was apportioned and the fairness of the apportionment. At [68] Sir Andrew Morritt V-C said that if the issue had arisen, he would have been prepared to order a trial of the issue of whether "proper consideration" had in fact been given to “the legitimate interests of the Company.” Also, at [48] in connection with an earlier exercise of a power of amendment, it is recorded that Counsel for the Company contended that in exercising the power to amend "the Trustee was bound to have regard to the interests of the Company."  Sir Andrew Morritt V-C said "I agree". In this regard, Mr Newman points out that it is not suggested that the interests of the Employer trumps those of the Members and in fact, the Members’ interests were not directly engaged because the Employer was not able to pay the debt in any event. He says therefore, that it takes the matter no further forward. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Mr Tennet says that if in approaching how to address a disclosed deficit the Trustee was required not to take into account the interests of Employers Rule 29.2 is drafted in a remarkable way. In addition, he says that the reference to the interests of the Employers in Rule 30.4 which is concerned with the withdrawal premium, is an indicator that such interests should be taken into account here. With regard to the MNOPF case, Mr Newman says that the case was only concerned with construction and that the propriety of the amendment itself did not arise. He also points out that Arden LJ made clear in the 2011 Court of Appeal decision that the construction of the Rules should be approached without any particular predisposition. Mr Newman says therefore, that the terms of the Scheme give no support for a construction of the amendment power which would take into account the interests of the Employer. </p>

Secondly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Alexander Forbes v Halliwell</span> [2003] PLR 269 the Court was concerned with surplus in the context of winding up.

In that case, a question arose as to whether the power to buy out beneficiaries’ benefits could be exercised to confer an external financial benefit on certain Members to the exclusion of others placing the Scheme in a position in which it was unable to meet the benefits of the remaining Members. It was held that the powers of the scheme had to be exercised for the purposes for which they were conferred and accordingly, could not be exercised in the manner proposed even though it might be in the Members' best financial interests. </p>

He says for example that if the best financial interests of the members are always paramount, in schemes where the trustee has unilateral power to augment benefits, the trustee would always conclude that it should do so if the Employer could afford it and where the trustee has a unilateral power of amendment, the trustee would inevitably use the power to remove any non-entrenched feature of the scheme that protected Employers' interests or limited members' rights and the trustee would always be under a duty to seek the immediate repair of an entire deficit, if necessary by driving the Employer into insolvency where benefits were no longer accruing. This he points out is contrary to tPR Guidance. Mr Newman submits that in the circumstances of this Scheme the consequences are far from absurd.  </p>

Next he reminded me that the provisions of the Scheme must be construed against the relevant taxation background.  He took me to an extract from IR12 (1979) at paragraphs 16.4 and 16.18 which makes clear that in the case of centralised schemes, the Inland Revenue requirements were always that unnecessary cross-subsidy should be avoided. Thirdly, in this regard he reminded me that within the structure of the statutory funding regime, to be found in Pensions Act 2004, both the trustee where the rules give them a unilateral power to fix contributions and the regulator where the regulator exercises unilateral powers over Employers because the trustees have fixed contribution levels without agreement are required to take into account the interests of the Employer. In the light of the fact that the policy objective behind the 2004 Act is to protect members’ interests it is likely that the statutory provisions are intended to reflect trust law.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Simmonds and Mr Tennet are supported in their views by Mr Green who appears on behalf of Stena Line. Mr Green emphasises that the main purpose of the Scheme is to provide benefits to members in accordance with the Rules of the Scheme from time to time.  Accordingly, he says it is within the scope of the amendment power and a purpose of the amendment power for such power to be used to seek to meet that purpose. Mr Green concurs with Mr Nugee that references to a “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">” may be a useful short-hand, but in a pension scheme the evaluation of such interests has to be in the context of what the rights of the beneficiaries actually consist of which is to have the benefits provided to and in respect of them in accordance with the terms of the scheme. He submitted that the orthodox formulation of how a trustee should exercise a fiduciary discretion is to be found in </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Edge v Pensions Ombudsman </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">at 627D-E and that it is that the trustee should exercise the power for one or more proper purposes, taking into account relevant considerations but not irrelevant ones. Mr Green adds that there is no place in this formulation for automatically imposing overriding duties on the trustees to advert solely to members’ interests.  On the contrary Chadwick L.J. makes clear at 627D-F:</span>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Properly understood, the so-called duty to act impartially—on which the ombudsman placed such reliance—is no more than the ordinary duty which the law imposes on a person who is entrusted with the exercise of a discretionary power: that he exercises the power for the purpose for which it is given, giving proper consideration to the matters which are relevant and excluding from consideration matters which are irrelevant. If pension fund trustees do that, they cannot be criticised if they reach a decision which appears to prefer the claims of one interest—whether that of employers, current employees or pensioners—over others. The preference will be the result of a proper exercise of the discretionary power.” </p>

He also adds that </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">is not dealing with the equitable distribution of the funding burden in industry-wide schemes, and that the last sentence of the extract is simply a comment that members will be hurt if the Employer goes out of business, not a suggestion that the role of the Employer is only relevant insofar as it benefits members. </span>

Mr Green also reminded me that the scope of a power of amendment is not to be artificially read-down, where its language is wide, and no provisos have been introduced reducing its operation: per Arden LJ in the 2011 Court of Appeal decision at [55] when considering this very power. </span>

He adds that an equitable imposition of contribution obligations in relation to individual Employers is within the legitimate purposes of the amendment power although it must be subordinated to the main purpose of ensuring a reasonable level of certainty that benefits will be met. He also emphasises that in all iterations of the Rules, each Employer has had to pay contributions reflecting the ongoing accrual of their own employees’ pensions. He says that there is no hint that the position is intended to change if there is a deficit and that in such circumstances the strongest Employers have to meet it. </span>

For example, they say that deficits would have to be reduced immediately by a one-off lump sum contribution wherever the Employer could pay and the Trustee had the power to set contributions. Furthermore, they say that trustees would have to demand contributions in multi-Employer schemes from the Employers that were strongest at the time to avoid taking any risk that those Employers might become unable to pay before the deficit was redressed. This would be done irrespective of the extent to which the deficit related to those Employers’ employees. Further, where an Employer was strong and the scheme well funded, the trustee should make unilateral benefit augmentations (potentially up to Inland Revenue limits) because this would be in members’ best interests. They say that this is not how pension schemes are run. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Furthermore, Mr Green points out that if Mr Newman is right, the 2001 Regime, blessed by Blackburne J having heard from representative parties, was in breach of the Trustee’s duties. It split the contributions rateably between the pool of “Current Employers” rather than targeting the strongest Employers. He also points out that unlike in a private trust, which is a bi-partite relationship between trustee and beneficiary, occupational pension scheme trusts are tri-partite in nature because Employers have a continuing role under them. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the purposes of an occupational pension scheme and of the powers under it include purposes relating to the treatment of the Employer and are not simply limited to furthering the interests of the beneficiaries. The continuing role and interest of Employers reflects the fact that the Employers are the primary funders of the scheme, with ongoing funding obligations under the rules and statute. Therefore, the way that the burden of funding the benefits is distributed and the way that the necessary funding is ascertained are of the most direct concern to them; an occupational pension is part of the pay that the Employer is providing to the employee or former employee through the vehicle of the scheme; and the Employer owes to its employees duties of good faith in the exercise of its powers under the scheme, and the duties continue to be owed to those who leave the employment and thereby become former employees. </span>

He points out that Mr Newman’s suggestion that the Very Strong Employers should first be required to contribute is “plucked out of the air”, perverse and creates an economic advantage for other Employers which are direct commercial rivals. The suggestion that their contributions should be held in escrow is also just not how pension schemes work and would create difficulties in relation to the tax treatment of the contributions. </span>

In those circumstances, Mr Tennet submits that on Mr Newman’s case, in fact, all contribution regimes are equally good and the tie break principle comes in.  </span>

In my judgment, it should not be treated as if it were separate from the proper purposes principle. In fact, it seems to me that the way in which the matter was put by Lord Nicholls extra judicially sums up the status of the best interests principle and the way it fits in to the duties of a trustee. It is necessary first to decide what is the purpose of the trust and what benefits were intended to be received by the beneficiaries before being in a position to decide whether a proposed course is for the benefit of the beneficiaries or in their best interests. As a result, I agree with his conclusion that “ . . to define the trustee's obligation in terms of acting in the best interests of the beneficiaries is to do nothing more than formulate in different words a trustee's obligation to promote the purpose for which the trust was created." </span>

The learned Judge’s comments were made in the context of his consideration of a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the members of a trust.  He explored the common law and equity in some depth and concluded that the statute did not extend beyond the general law. If by his conclusion that the “best interest duty” operates  “in combination with other duties” he meant that it flows from and is moulded by the trustee’s obligation to promote the purpose for which the trust was created, I agree. As Lord Nicholls pointed out, first it is necessary to determine the purpose of the trust itself and the benefits which the beneficiaries are intended to receive before being in a position to decide whether a proposed course is in the best interests of those beneficiaries. </span>

In this case, given the extent of the deficit and the urgent need for deficit contributions in order to secure the benefits, it seems to me that the relevance of the position of the Employers capable of making such contributions and their interests is much the same as the circumstances which Chadwick LJ was considering and in the same way, it is perfectly legitimate for the Trustee to take such matters into account when exercising its powers for the purpose of promoting the purposes of the Scheme. </span>

It seems to me that such an effect is a good indicator that the best interests principle is not freestanding. In my judgment, this is also illustrated by the practical consequences highlighted by Messrs Simmonds, Tennet and Green which they describe as absurd and to which I referred at paragraphs [210] and [223]. This conclusion is also supported by Mr Green’s point that if Mr Newman were right, the 2001 Regime itself would have been arrived at contrary to the duties of the Trustee.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">It follows from what I have already decided that I also reject Mr Newman’s submission that in fact, in proposing the New Regime which includes Full Augmentation and Re-apportionment which as a result, has the potential for the reduction of contributions paid by some Employers, the Trustee is acting in a way which amounts to a fraud on the power of amendment in the sense of the exercise of a power with the purpose of benefiting a non-object. I agree with Mr Simmonds that the purpose of the Scheme and therefore, the purpose of the amendment power is to further the purposes of the Scheme by securing the benefits of the Members. In my judgment, there is nothing improper when furthering the purposes of the Scheme by securing the benefits, if an effect is that some Employers may possibly and ultimately pay less. This does not render the Employer an object of the power. If that were the case, then any exercise of the amendment power so as to widen the pool of Employers liable with the potential effect of strengthening the overall employer covenant would be characterized as a fraud on the power. That cannot be correct. Secondly, having the effect of potentially lessening the liability of Current Employers is not the same as a purpose of conferring a benefit upon them. As Mr Brookes described it in cross examination, addressing cross-subsidy had the effect of conferring a “relative benefit” upon Current Employers. His evidence was not however, that the Trustee has decided to exercise the amendment power for the purpose of conferring even a relative benefit upon Employers or some of them. </span>

Such a conclusion is entirely contrary to those decisions and would also be entirely arbitrary given that the pool of contributors under the 2001 Regime was arrived at as a result solely of consensus.

I will deal with them in turn. Before doing so, it seems to me having taken account of all of the evidence both written and oral and in particular Mr Brookes’ explanation that each of the advisers’ papers tabled at each of the Key Meetings were considered by the Trustee at the relevant meeting, there can be little doubt but that the Trustee considered the detailed professional advice contained in each of those papers when making their decisions. In my judgment, this is borne out by the Minutes of those meetings (which were professionally produced and checked by Mr Brookes amongst others).  The fact that they do not set out the detail of discussions upon each of the topics on every occasion does not detract from my conclusion. Further, this conclusion is not diminished by Mr Brookes’ evidence in some instances that he could not recall the discussion or in some cases, the length of it. </span>

Even if Mr Brookes’ approach was informed by his involvement in the matter over a lengthy period since 2007, it does not seem to me that his evidence as to the basis for the decision of the Trustee Board itself is affected. In this regard, I also take account of the fact that it is not disputed that the composition of the Trustee Board changed over the period during which the New Regime was under consideration and that accordingly, the composition of the Board was different in 2012 from 2009.</span>

The paper presented in its final form in June 2012 and the advice before the Trustee Board in October of that year was considered and Mr Brookes explained that all of the relevant advisers were available at the briefing meeting in September and at the October Meeting to explain and respond to questions.

Mr Brookes’ evidence in this regard, which I accept, was quite unequivocal. He stated that he understood the covenant advice to mean that the New Regime whether on the open or frozen basis, would deliver an effect on covenant strength which was not neutral. He said, “If it could be the same or better, that isn’t neutral.  . . . “at least as good” has that potential extra connotation: it is not neutral.” It seems to me that that was entirely consistent with the ultimate conclusion reached in the paper which was recorded in Mayer Brown’s table. </span>

To reiterate, it is clear that after June 2012 the covenant advice was and was understood to mean that the New Regime would deliver covenant at least as strong as that under the Current Regime and that the Trustee proceeded on this basis from October 2012. Quite properly, Lincoln had phrased their advice in terms of the covenant strength being “likely to be sufficient” to deliver the promised benefits. In my judgment, nothing turns on the use of such a phrase. It is merely consistent with prudent professional advice which seeks to take account of the fact that the very nature of the issues encompasses future uncertainties. </span>

Mr Brookes’ evidence to which I have referred accords with Lincoln’s advice and the Mayer Brown paper. In addition, the slides prepared by Lincoln for the briefing meeting and the Implementation Paper described the New Regime as “potentially covenant enhancing” which was why Mr Brookes confirmed that he felt re-assured by the covenant advice.   </span>

It seems to me that in the light of the unequivocal advice which was received from Lincoln albeit not until July 2014, Mr Spink’s argument cannot succeed. Advice in relation to partial augmentation and its effect upon covenant strength was received and considered. As I have already mentioned, Lincoln advised that from a covenant perspective they could not see any reason why partial augmentation ought to be adopted. The minute of the Eighth Meeting makes clear that the advice paper was considered and that Lincoln gave further oral advice at the meeting. Furthermore, none of the experts advocated partial augmentation and Mr Murphy did not disagree with the bases upon which it was rejected by Lincoln. Accordingly, in my judgment although advice in relation to partial augmentation was not obtained at an early stage, there is no basis for Mr Spink’s criticism.</span>

First, I have already found that the Trustee is not under a duty solely to maximize benefits. Furthermore, as Mr Newman himself accepts, the operation of defined benefit pension schemes is all about managing risk. Accordingly, there is no such thing as a circumstance in which benefits can be “ensured” in the sense of guaranteed. The task of the trustee and in this case, the Trustee, is to manage risk in a reasonable way and to adopt a regime which it is reasonably satisfied will return the Scheme to solvency having adopted reasonable assumptions. This is a matter for the Trustee having taken proper professional advice. </span>

In my judgment, in order to arrive at such a situation, it is not necessary to have eliminated all risk or taken all possible steps to do so. If that were the case, the ambit of trustees’ discretion would be artificially curtailed. In fact, if Mr Newman is right, in this case, it would be necessary for the Trustee to adopt factors more restrictive than those proposed by Mr Squires before it could place itself in a position in which it could exercise its discretion. </span>

Mr Spink also criticised the Trustee for making its decision before the Implementation Methodology was designed. Given Mr Brookes’ evidence that they were assured that it would be possible and Mr Dewar’s unchallenged evidence that it was reasonable for Lincoln to say that they could design an appropriate Implementation Methodology and that the matter remained under review, in my judgment there is nothing in this point. Furthermore, I agree with Mr Tennet that there is nothing in Mr Newman’s assertion that once the Implementation Methodology had been designed, each of the decisions should have been revisited. It seems to me that as the decisions had been taken on the basis that a suitable Implementation Methodology could be designed, once Lincoln had done so and satisfied the Trustee, there was no need to re-visit the original decisions. </span>

The allegation that there was no meaningful consultation, amongst others, was not put to Mr Brookes in cross examination. Mr Tennet addressed the points nevertheless in his closing. He pointed out amongst other things, that Mr Nugee had reviewed the consultation material and had stated that he had no concerns. As Mr Tennet points out, the complaint takes no account of the presentation made by three advisers to consultees. Slides were presented on that occasion which amongst other things referred to the intended credit mechanism. The Orphan Loading and estimated default rates which Mr Spink suggests were concealed, were in fact, set out in the Q&amp;As. Lastly, in this regard, in closing, Mr Spink contended that Q&amp;A3 was defective because it did not make clear the role of Stena Line. In this regard, Mr Tennet responds that the position of Stena Line was well known, that the Trustee had not sought comments from Stena Line on the New Regime and it was Mr Brookes’ unchallenged evidence that the Trustee had not been influenced by Stena Line’s letter of 23 May 2012 when making its decisions.

None of the experts have suggested that the New Regime is unreasonable nor have they raised the questions which Mr Newman has posed. Furthermore, the retention of blanks in the Implementation Methodology at present can be of no surprise. As Mr Tennet points out they are a necessary reflection of the fact that it is dependent upon variables which will be adjusted and is intended to be capable of being used in the future in respect of different recovery periods, payment plans and actuarial valuations. </span>

Mr Squires did not seek to criticize these elements of the New Regime nor has it been suggested that Lincoln’s advice was unreasonable in this respect. It was accepted that the Implementation Methodology should be sufficiently flexible to deal with future eventualities and it will be up to the Trustee to take appropriate steps in the future. The last of these points falls into the same category. Mr Newman raised concerns that Phase 2 Orphan Loading involved a degree of Employer involvement and consensual discussion. Once again this is not something which caused the experts any concern. They considered the Implementation Methodology to be reasonable. In any event, the Implementation Methodology provides for the whole of a deficit share to be paid in two instalments over a short period, if in fact, consensus is not reached. </span>

In relation to cost, he points out that the first Towers Watson report contained only a rough estimate of relative costs and despite Mr Tennet’s note of advice given at a consultation on 7 March 2012 which records that the Trustee was justified in incurring costs even if they were a significant sum in order to inform its decisions, no detailed analysis was undertaken. He contrasted this with the level of detail in relation to the costs of the Implementation Methodology. In relation to delay, Mr Evans says that in fact, it has taken more than twelve months to design the entirety of the New Regime and more than twelve months since permission to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused in November 2011 and therefore, it may have been appropriate to use Method D. He also says that although it is accepted that it was necessary to determine the apportionment of liability shares before covenant advice could be given, it did not follow that the covenant advisers could not start work at all until after the method of apportionment was decided upon. Lastly, he says that as Method D was used for the purposes of the exercise undertaken in 2001, when departing from it, it was necessary to obtain more detailed information about the loss of accuracy and the risks involved. </span>

He also says that in accepting a recommendation, the decision maker can be taken to have engaged with the reasoning and the assessment of each of the options which are also set out.  In relation to the reasoning itself he says that there is nothing wrong in an adviser setting out the relative cost, timescale and accuracy of potential approaches and suggesting a pragmatic way forward.

He points out that what Mr Evans described is “speculation.” Of course, if the Trustee were required to reconsider whether Method C or Method D should be adopted, it would have to take into account the fact that if Method D were adopted, it would be at least another twelve months before the covenant advisers had a definitive liability apportionment upon which to work.

Secondly, it seems to me that Mr Evans’ submissions are based upon the statement in Mr Brookes’ third witness statement that the Trustee Board accepted the recommendation in the Towers Watson report.

He points out that the 2001 Regime which was approved by the Court was a package of measures which included the imposition of deficit repair contributions upon Current Employers together with changes in the rights and benefits of Employers under the Scheme including rule 30 withdrawal, Rule 31.1 termination and consultation with Employers in relation to investment decisions. As part of the package, the Scheme was also closed and membership contributions ceased. Mr Spink says that the Historic Employers did not sign up to those changes including in particular the removal of Rule 31.0(ii) and as a result, should not be required retrospectively to become subject to the contribution obligations since 2001. </span>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in">“In the courts below the Board of Management's power to make a retrospective amendment was dealt with as a separate topic. But before their Lordships it was rightly conceded that this topic is merely a reflection of, or another (and possibly less helpful) way of putting, what is essentially the same point as to the scope of the power of amendment. Modern authority (as reviewed and summarised by Lord Mustill in L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd [1994] 1 AC 486, 524–525) has recognised that when the law raises a presumption against the retrospective operation of an enactment or a disposition (including a rule change), it is concerned with fairness in the circumstances of the particular case, rather than with the application of some general formula. In the amendment of pension scheme rules, back-dating (that is, deeming a change of the rules to have been made at a date earlier than the date of the actual change) cannot be used as a device so as to rewrite history or validate an amendment which would otherwise be beyond the scope of the power of amendment. But if the substance of what is proposed is within the power, back-dating will not by itself lead to invalidity (whether it will be more or less helpful, simply as a matter of drafting technique, will depend on the circumstances).”</p>

It is clear from Lord Walker's reasoning that the mere fact that an amendment is back-dated is not objectionable. In the present case, however, the amendment is not merely back-dated, it has truly retrospective effect. Thus the active members' defined benefit rights which accrued between 1 January 1992 and 3 March 1992 were not even converted into defined contribution rights. Instead the Plan proceeded as if the members' entitlement during that period had accrued on a defined contribution basis. In my judgment that is outside the power conferred by clause 7(i) for two reasons. First, it amounts to an attempt to re-write history. Secondly, it is barred by the Fetter.”</p>

He also points out that the 2001 Regime was entered into after detailed legal and actuarial advice had been obtained and was approved by the Court.

Mayer Brown had advised that the Trustee needed a good reason to undo the 2001 Regime.  However, neither the Minute of the meeting nor Mr Brookes’ evidence suggests proper consideration was given to the matter. It was merely decided as a matter of principle and the lack of proper consideration and the balancing of the undoing of the 2001 regime against other factors is a fundamental flaw in decision making. Further, he says that the legal advice on retrospection was not considered. In addition, he says that the decision was irrational because no account was taken of the fact that the 2001 regime had been approved by the Court. He also attacks the decision as irrational because it was taken in principle but was not revisited once the full details of the Implementation Methodology were available. Further, he says that it weakens the overall covenant and reduces the security of benefits in the cause of preferring one class of Employers over another. It gains the Scheme nothing. </span>

Accordingly, he says that the consultation was defective and as a result, the Trustee was not in a position to take into consideration all relevant factors. Secondly, he says that the Trustee had insufficient information as to the level of administrative cost and complexity of the proposed regime. Not only were no quantified costs available by the time of the October 2012 meeting but there was no attempt to cost alternative regimes such as adoption of Augmentation only or different versions of Partial Augmentation. Cost was not readdressed in January 2014 and the Ensign paper in July 2014 amounted to too little too late. Furthermore, he reiterates that Mr Brookes received material information about the ability of P&amp;O Ferries to meet future contribution liabilities and referred it only to Lincoln and not to the Trustee. In addition, he relies upon the matter raised in Mr Murphy’s report that the issue of a Deficit Share Notice without the issue of an invoice would have a deleterious effect upon a very weak Employer.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">I agree with Mr Green that for the purposes of this case it is unnecessary to construe the amendment power in order to determine whether it can be exercised retrospectively. I have come to this conclusion because in my judgment the proposed exercise designed to give credit for contributions already paid is not retrospective at all. As Mr Green and Mr Tennet submit, it is a present exercise of the power with prospective effect. Although not directly relevant, I agree with Mr Tennet that the description of retrospectivity contained in section 71 Pensions Act 1995 is helpful by way of analogy. In this case, the intention to give credit for past contributions when determining future liabilities, in my judgment is not an exercise of a power in order to put something in place "</span>

I come to that conclusion despite the proposal that the Current Employers not only be given credit for past contributions against present and future contributions but are also to be credited with interest in respect of the payments made. I do not consider the fact that credit is to be given in relation to the present value of the contributions already made gives rise to the conclusion that the clock is turned back or that previous liabilities are erased in a way which would be similar to the circumstances under consideration in </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">I also reject Mr Spink’s submissions based on an analogy with the old Hastings-Bass principle.  This is not a case of the Trustee regretting something which it did in the past which it thinks it ought not to have done and seeking to say that it did not do it in the first place. In fact, the Trustee does not resile from the 2001 Regime or suggest either that it wishes it had not done it in the first place. On the contrary, the Trustee contends that the 2001 Regime was appropriate in the circumstances which arose at that stage. The circumstances with which the Trustee is faced now include a large deficit calculated on more stringent lines and the decisions in the 2009 Proceedings and the subsequent 2011 Court of Appeal decision. Briggs J made clear in his judgment in the 2009 Proceedings at [104] that the 2001 Regime was not “irrevocable” and dismissed Mr Spink’s arguments based on estoppel. As I have already mentioned, in doing so he implied that credit could be given for past contributions made by Current Employers. His conclusions were affirmed in the Court of Appeal. It seems to me that by means of the re-writing history argument it is sought either to elevate the 2001 Regime to a status which it does not deserve and which is contrary to the 2011 Court of Appeal decision or to resurrect a quasi estoppel type argument. There is no room for either the latter or the former and in addition, the former is not borne out on the facts. As both the Court of Appeal and Briggs J noted the 2001 Regime itself contained the amendment power which it was clear might be used in relation to a future deficit. </span>

In my judgment it is clear that the issue was raised in the Mayer Brown paper prepared for the Third Meeting and in cross examination, Mr Brookes confirmed that at the meeting, one of the factors put in that paper was that reapportionment might be considered to be “re-writing history”. Further, the minutes of the meeting reveal that the Board considered cross-subsidy figures, the fact that pensions were deferred pay, the fact that the 2001 Regime had been approved by the Court and the “un-doing” /”re-doing” point. It made its decision accordingly and therefore, in my judgment their decision cannot be impugned on this basis. </span>

The question here is if account is to be taken of payments made since the introduction of the 2001 Regime whether it would be proper to take account of all payments since 2001 as the Trustee proposed or only those since a more recent date.   Mr Evans on behalf of Sealion approached this issue under two headings, the first of which was the impact of retrospective credit upon the Scheme as a whole. He says that the further back credit is given, the more of the deficit which is shifted onto weaker Employers, the greater the detrimental effect upon the overall employer covenant and the greater the reliance upon the Implementation Methodology in order to make good the distortion. However, the Implementation Methodology is not guaranteed to work. He says that the need for the reliance on the very complex Implementation Methodology demonstrates that the Trustee’s decision to do so is so unreasonable as to be perverse.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Evans produced a schedule based upon figures produced by Mr Murphy and those in the papers produced for the Trustee by its covenant adviser, Lincoln. It shows that under the 2001 Regime, 79% of the Scheme liabilities are borne by stronger Employers and 21% by those which are weaker. With both Augmentation and re-apportionment to 2001 the burden is shifted so that approximately 73% of the liabilities are borne by weaker Employers.  If credit is given for payments since 2007, the percentage is 70% and if retrospective credit were only given for payments after 2010, the percentage borne by weaker Employers is 52%. I should add that Augmentation alone has the effect of shifting the liabilities so that 45% is borne by weaker Employers. Although Mr Evans accepts that Orphan Loading ameliorates the shift of the burden he describes, nevertheless, he says that the end result of the Trustee’s New Regime would be to reduce the stronger Employers’ share of the liabilities from 79% to 36%. </span>

He says that this arose from the Trustee’s desire to address the issue of historic cross-subsidy between those Participating Employers who had been contributing towards the deficit under the 2001 Regime and those who had not. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">addressed the impact of re-apportionment (from 2010, 2007 or 2001) by reference to covenant ratings, the focus of the report and its conclusion concerned the impact on the overall rating of the covenant support for the Scheme. Although Lincoln’s conclusion was that re-apportionment would adversely affect the overall covenant support for the Scheme before application of the Implementation Methodology, the extent to which the length of the reapportionment period shifts the burden and adversely affects the covenant was not focussed on. Mr Evans says that this is equally true of the Mayer Brown paper of 1 October 2012 which was considered at the Third Meeting. He says that although a number of different potential re-apportionment periods were identified the implications were not addressed in terms of the extent of the shift of liabilities to the weaker Employers. He says therefore, that the Trustee’s decision (subject to Court approval) to adopt full retrospection, taken at the Third Meeting, was by reference to the impact on Participating Employers by type and not by covenant rating, the emphasis being upon the elimination of cross-subsidy. </span>

Second, he says that Mr Evans offers no explanation for why it is outside the bounds of reasonableness to regard the fact that if one re-apportions back to the date which Voluntary Employers stopped paying but no further they obtain no credit for their contributions, as one which outweighs the increased liability shifting caused by more retrospection. Thirdly, he points out that there is no evidence to support the proposition that after the operation of the Implementation Methodology, the further back one goes the worse it gets. The only post Implementation Methodology information relates to re-apportionment to 2001 and shows that the position is better than under the present regime. Lastly, he points out that by saying the Implementation Methodology is only necessary because of Re-apportionment, Mr Evans flies in the face of the advice given by Lincoln. Lincoln advised that Implementation Methodology would be necessary even if Augmentation were adopted without Re-apportionment. In relation to Mr Evans’ Schedule, Mr Tennet points out that the inability of small Employers to pay should not be overestimated.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Evans goes on to disagree with the advice of Mr Nugee given to the Trustee in July and September 2012. He advised that taking into consideration the fairness of the impact on Historic Employers, any of the potential retrospection dates considered by the Trustee would be rational and therefore proper.  Mr Evans says</span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">first that the unfairness to Historic Employers of calculating their liability by reference to payments made by others at a time when they were not liable to make such payments and were unaware that such a liability might be imposed on them, is so unreasonable as to be perverse. Secondly, he says that the advice focussed only on the question of fairness to the Historic Employers rather than also taking account of the consequences for the Scheme.  The combined effect of the two factors is such as to render a decision in favour of full retrospectivity so unreasonable as to be perverse.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As to fairness, Mr Tennet accepts that November 2012 was the date on which indications of deficit share were sent to Historic Employers. However, he says that there is no rational link between the date of notification and liability. As to the shock as a result of the likely liability which Mr Evans described, Mr Tennet says that it takes no account of affordability driven payment plans. He adds that the quantum of the demand cannot impose rationality constraints upon the date for re-apportionment. In support, Mr Green adds that liability is not a function of notification. All Historic Employers had originally signed up to the Scheme and therefore, are contractually bound to abide by its terms including amendments to those terms. </span>

It was up to the Trustee having taken proper professional advice to balance the effects of retrospectivity against cross-subsidy and the consequent shift of the burden of liabilities and having done so, to determine the appropriate date for such retrospection. It seems to me that there is no basis for concluding that its decision is unreasonable or that it failed to take into consideration all relevant and no irrelevant factors. I share Mr Green’s reservations as to the utility of Mr Evans’ schedule which he produced with the assistance of his instructing solicitors and the conclusions he seeks to draw from it. In any event, given the detail of the professional advice taken by the Trustee, the fact that I consider that the balance of the relevant factors was a matter for the Trustee alone and that there is no expert evidence to suggest that the conclusion reached was a perverse or unreasonable one, in my judgment, Mr Evans’ schedule takes the matter no further. </span>

The only post Implementation Methodology information relates to re-apportionment to 2001 and shows that the position is better than under the present regime. I have already found that the evidence does not support the contention that the Implementation Methodology would be unnecessary if Re-apportionment was not adopted.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">I also agree with Mr Tennet and Mr Green in relation to Mr Evans’s argument based on fairness. First, in my judgment, it is relevant that all Historic Employers were originally contractually bound to abide by the terms of the Scheme including amendments to those terms. It seems to me that the Historic Employers ought at least to have been aware of the possibility of further amendments to the Scheme in order to bring them in to the pool of contributing Employers and in particular, are likely to have been aware since the decision in the MNOPF case. In any event, I agree that there is no necessary link between notification or awareness and liability and that the surprise factor if any, has been properly and reasonably addressed by means of the payment plans on offer. Further, as I have already mentioned, in my judgment it is for the Trustee to determine the weight to be given to the effect upon cross-subsidy compared with the shifting of liabilities of the amount of retrospection applied. There is nothing to suggest that the way in which they have reached that conclusion is unreasonable. It was not raised as an issue by the expert witnesses.   </span>

Mr Green on behalf of Stena Line says that Rule 5.5 is a scheme apportionment Rule for the purposes of section 75 and 75A only and it has no impact upon Rule 5.2 and the Schedule of Contributions. On the other hand, Mr Simmonds says that if the Current Employer’s Percentage reduces to zero it does so automatically for the purposes of Rule 5.2.</span>

He says that there is no reason to do so. In relation to Issue 9, Mr Green submits that if in fact, the effect of an ECE at a time when the Scheme was in balance on the MFR basis has the effect of a reduction of the Current Employer’s Percentage to zero and as a result, the reduction of the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage to zero (which he does not accept) and if as a further consequence such an employer cannot be required to pay a premium or comply with the transfer of liabilities provisions and successor scheme provisions, then Rules 30.3 to 30.8 cannot operate in relation to such an employer and it cannot withdraw at all.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">As I have already mentioned, these issues arise from the fact that the International Marine and the numerous other C2 Employers which it represents, contend that they have suffered an ECE for the purposes of the section 75 regime. It is necessary therefore, to consider that regime, at least in outline. Section 75 Pensions Act 1995 came into force on 6 April 1997. It together with associated regulations to which I refer together as “the s.75 regime” provides for statutory debts to be payable by specified employers which have been referred to as “statutory employers”. Statutory employers for the purposes of the s75 regime are and have always been defined as “</span>

The definition of a relevant insolvency event for the purposes of the s.75 regime has changed over time.  As at 31 May 2001 when the 2001 Rules were introduced it was confined to liquidation: s.75(4) PA 1995 (in its pre-6 April 2005 form).  As at 1 August 2007 when the Current Rules were introduced it had been extended to include all insolvency events as set out in s.121 Pensions Act 2004 together with a solvent winding-up.

The question then arises about precisely what groups of employees are covered by the key phrase other than active members who are clearly included on any view.  I can put the question this way: is it enough to prevent an ECE occurring in relation to the Scheme that the employer employs a person who falls in one of the following descriptions, and if so which?  The descriptions are: (a) a person eligible to become a member as of right; (b) a person who requires the consent of the Trustee to be a Member; (c) a deferred Member; (d) a pensioner Member; (e) a person whom the employer is intending to employ and who will, upon employment, be eligible to join the Scheme.”   </p>

This, he says, might be thought to connote at the very least a requirement that the employee in question be eligible to join the scheme so that (for example) employment once the scheme was closed to future accrual would not count and would no longer be ‘employment to which the scheme relates’, any more than employment with the same employer before the scheme was set up would be.  He is probably right to say what he does about a scheme which is closed to further accrual.  But it is not because there is no longer any employment to which the scheme relates (which is true but not relevant); rather it is because there is no longer any description of employment to which the scheme relates.”  </p>

He says that it follows, correspondingly that in either case, after 31 May 2001 to trigger an ECE, on the facts of this Scheme where there are no Eligibles, a Current Employer needs to cease to employ statutory active members.  However, there were no statutory active members after 31 May 2001. He says that despite being called “Active Members” in the Scheme definitions, all such Members were deferred Members, with accrued benefits, having the benefit of a generous basis of revaluation as of 31 May 2001 as an incident of those previously accrued benefits. Those benefits he says were “already earned” and had as one of their indefeasible incidents the right to CARE linkage whilst the Member in question remained (or was deemed to remain) in seagoing employment. </span>

He describes it as a single benefit with two elements. He says therefore that if there is no ability to accrue further years of service, there can be no further accrual of benefit to which the scheme relates. The benefit in this case, including the entitlement to a CARE link thereafter was earned by reference to service before 31 May 2001 and was accrued as at that date. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">He illustrated this further by reference to the Long Service Benefit and Short Service Benefit for the purposes of the preservation regime. </span>
	      <span style="font-family:'Courier New';font-size:12pt">Long Service Benefit is calculated by reference to n/60ths of Service to Normal Pension Age multiplied by a final pensionable salary at Normal Pension Age. Short Service Benefit is calculated by reference to n/60ths based on service to cessation of years of accrual multiplied by final pensionable salary at cessation of years' accrual. However, Mr Green points out that n/60ths of service to cessation of years' accrual multiplied by final pensionable salary at Normal Pension Age, or whatever other date before Normal Pension Age one chooses to leave employment, is neither Long Service Benefit nor Short Service Benefit. Mr Green says that a moment's thought shows that if one were trying to define the pension benefit, being the benefit earned by reference to pensionable service, by reference to the final salary link only, rather than by reference to years of accrual, there would be an infinite variety of candidates for the definition of Long Service Benefit. Such a concept because of the flexibility of the final pensionable salary ingredient in the defined benefit calculation would be inherently flexible and uncertain which Mr Green says would be apt neither for a description of a Long Service Benefit nor for the description of a Short Service Benefit. As a result, he says that the whole concept of pensionable service is that the years of service are actually informing the benefit, multiplied by whatever it is that should actually be relevant by way of definition under the rules. </span>

Section 51 is concerned with annual increases in the rate of pension and makes reference to “pension  . . . attributable (i) to pensionable service . . .”. It is not in dispute that for this purpose, “pensionable service” is being used only to refer to year-by-year accrual. Section 51 applies different increases to those components of the pension attributable to different periods of pensionable service. It is agreed that it is plainly not intended that (for example) a period of revaluation be treated as a period of pensionable service for these purposes (and therefore potentially to attract a different rate of pension increase). Mr Green describes this is a “killer point” in his favour whilst Mr Simmonds says nevertheless that section 51 is irrelevant for the purposes of determining the meaning of “pension or other benefits.”  </span>

Schedule 16 introduced the “preservation requirements” for the first time. “Pensionable service” was defined as “service in relevant employment which qualifies the member (on the assumption that it continues for the appropriate period) for “long service benefit” under the scheme; “long service benefit” being in turn defined as the benefit which the member would qualify for if he were to remain in “relevant employment” until normal pension age: Schedule 16 paras 3(1) and 2(b) SSA 1973. “Relevant employment” was defined as “any employment to which the scheme relates”: Schedule 16 para 2(a).   </span>

He says that “Long service benefit” is the product of multiplying years of service with the final salary or in this case, the CARE link. Mr Green emphasises that the concept is one of long “service” benefit and that it is not based on a member’s years of service (to his date of early leaving) plus years when not accruing years of service but enjoying only a final salary (or CARE) link. </span>

It provides therefore for the need to provide Short Service Benefit where pensionable service is terminated before Normal Pension Age.

It is on this basis that he says one is able to calculate Short Service Benefit in a manner congruent with Long Service Benefit. He also referred me to paragraph 11 which provides that if paragraph 10 does not apply, Short Service Benefit is to be calculated on the basis of “uniform accrual” which is proportionate to one’s pensionable service. Mr Green points out that in order for the accrual to be uniform, it has to be on the basis of years of accrual. There can be no uniformity if the accrual is partly made up of n/60ths and partly made up of a continuing final salary link. He adds that if pensionable service, in forming the Short Service Benefit, continues whilst the final salary link continues but whilst there is no continuing increase in the years of accrual, there is no uniformity to that which has been compared with the Long Service Benefit. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Green also took me to the Social Security Act 1985 which introduced with effect from 1 January 1986 rights to a statutory baseline level of revaluation of deferred benefits and rights to transfer out the cash equivalent of deferred benefits and makes use of the Social Security Act 1973 definition of “pensionable service”. Mr Green says that the point of the statutory baseline revaluation rate is to ensure that when a member ceases his year-by-year accrual, his benefits are increased in line with inflation, irrespective of whether the scheme provides for a measure of inflation-proofing. However, Mr Green says that that protection could be eroded or even circumvented if Mr Simmonds is right and pensionable service continues despite years of accrual having ceased. An employer would be able to provide, for example, revaluation at the rate of just 1% while the member remains in employment and on Mr Simmonds’ argument, the member would still be in pensionable service and therefore, not subject to statutory revaluation as a deferred member and the protection would be circumvented.  Mr Simmonds’ answer to this is that if statutory revaluation is better, it is open to the member to opt out of pensionable service. Mr Green says this is cumbersome and puts an unrealistic onus upon the member. Interestingly, no one is suggesting in this Scheme that because of the continued CARE linkage that the Members are not entitled to  a cross check against GMP revaluation. </span>

As a result they are provided with revaluation at a better rate than if they ceased such employment and became deferred members. In simple terms therefore, he says that it is seagoing employment which “qualifies” them for their CARE linkage and that is pensionable and amounts to an “other benefit” under the Scheme within the definition of “pensionable service” in section 124(1) Pensions Act 1995. </span>

He also took me to an extract from the Registered Pension Scheme Manual which is concerned with the annual allowance charge in respect of pensions saving. In particular, he referred to a passage which states that where an individual has left a pension scheme “but their future benefits are still linked to their final salary the individual is not a “deferred member” for the purposes of the tax rules.” The reason given is that they are “still accruing benefits to the continued salary link.”  The Registered Pension Scheme Manual goes on to state, “If the individual’s pension rights are still based on their current salary and so that benefits increase if they receive a pay rise (even though the amount of their pensionable service does not change) then they are not a deferred member.” Mr Green says that Mr Simmonds’ reliance upon the Registered Pension Scheme Manual and section 151 Finance Act 2004 is of no assistance to him.

Mr Simmonds reasons therefore, that the definition of “pensionable service” in section 124 Pensions Act 1995 includes the ability to qualify both for defined benefit and defined contribution benefits and therefore, the definition of “employer” in that section includes being an employer of persons who may be accruing a mixture of benefits. As a result, Mr Simmonds says that as an ECE occurs when ceasing to be a statutory employer, the definition is inconsistent with pensionable service being merely based upon the accrual of years of service.   He also submits that given the definition of an ECE in regulation 2 of the 2005 Debt Regulations, it is possible for a “defined contribution employer” to undergo an ECE. This too, he says is inconsistent with the accrual of benefits being synonymous with the accrual of years service only. </span>

If that is correct, it is necessary to base the s75 debt on assumptions about how long the CARE link may last. On Mr Simmonds’ analysis, the s75 debt crystallises when the CARE link terminates and there is no need for any assumptions.    </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">In relation to preservation, revaluation and cash equivalents, Mr Simmonds says it matters not whether Mr Green is right or wrong. The context is different. Nevertheless he made detailed submissions in relation to each context. In relation to preservation he pointed out that the regime applies to “any occupational pension scheme” and that a combination of the definition of “pensionable service” in section 70(2) and “long service benefit” and “benefits” in section 70(1) Pension Schemes Act 1993 is consistent with the inclusion of both defined benefit and defined contribution within the scope of the regime. Accordingly, he says that Mr Green cannot be correct. He makes the same point in relation to revaluation by reference to sections 83(1), 84(3) and Schedule 3 paragraph 5(1) Pension Schemes Act 1993 which provide for revaluation of money purchase benefits. In relation to cash equivalents, Mr Simmonds says that section 94(1)(a) Pension Schemes Act 1993 expressly states that it applies to “an occupational pension scheme other than a salary related scheme” but nevertheless uses the concept of the termination of “pensionable service.” This too, he says is inconsistent with Mr Green’s argument.  </span>

There are neither final salary linkage nor n/60ths accrual in defined contribution schemes. Furthermore, in relation to revaluation, section 84(3) and the money purchase method at paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 3 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 Mr Green says that they refer to payments made by or on behalf of a member “in the manner in which they would have been applied if his pensionable service had not been terminated.” This casts no light upon the meaning of the expression for the purposes of a defined benefit scheme which is dealt with by reference to the “average salary method” set out in paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to the 1993 Act.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Despite the complexity of the statutory regime and the elaborate submissions on behalf of both the International Marine and Stena Line, this issue is relatively short albeit far from straightforward. After 31 May 2001, did the Current Employers or any of them continue to employ persons in the description of employment to which the Scheme relates and after 6 April 2008 did the Current Employers or any of them employ at least one person who was an active member of the Scheme in the statutory sense? If they did not do so, the Scheme was frozen and neither the International Marine nor any other C2 Employer could have suffered an ECE. In the circumstances of this case the question is whether years of accrual having ceased on 31 May 2001, the continued revaluation applied after that date at a preferential rate to n/60ths built up year on year in relation to those within the categories of Rule 4 is sufficient to mean that the C2 Employers continued to employ persons in the description of employment to which the scheme relates.     </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt"> There is no doubt that an “active member” is defined as a person in “pensionable service under the scheme” and therefore after 6 April 2008 the question is whether there were persons in “pensionable service” under the Scheme whom an employer could cease to employ in order to fall within the definition of an ECE. Prior to 6 April 2008 it is the “employment of persons in the description of employment to which the scheme relates” which is relevant. However, the definition of “pensionable service” which is the backbone of the definition of “active member” uses the almost identical phrase, “description or category of employment to which the scheme relates which qualifies the member , . . . .for pension or other benefits under the scheme.” In short therefore, in order to be in “pensionable service” is it necessary to continue to accrue years of service in relation to a scheme or is the continued entitlement to an enhanced rate of revaluation sufficient? </span>

Equally, although Mr Green explained the background to the provision of the favourable rate of revaluation for those within the categories in Rule 4, which stemmed from the perceived need to avoid breaching the provisos to the amendment clause in Rule 30, the subjective intention of the Trustee or the Trustee and the Employers is of no relevance to the exercise in hand. In fact, for this purpose, it seems to me that the provisions of the Proposal in relation to the 2001 Regime are also irrelevant. The Proposal may be relevant background when construing the Trust Deed and Rules.

After 31 May 2001, the accrual of benefits takes place in the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Plan. It is service to which the Scheme “related” in the past tense. The benefits accrued as at 31 May 2001 when they ceased to accrue years of service under the Scheme and the right to revaluation at a particular level is inherent in the accrued benefit as at that date. The continued entitlement to the preferential rate is conditional upon continuing in a status set out in Rule 4 but on the facts of this case, that status is no longer an employment to which the Scheme relates, even in the case of employment with a Current Employer. The right to the enhanced revaluation had already been earned by reference to service before 31 May 2001 and had accrued at that date. </span>

In fact, in order to have a right to the enhanced rate, it is not necessary to be in employment at all.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Secondly, this conclusion is consistent with the way in which “pensionable service” is treated in section 51 Pensions Act 1995 which is in the same Part of that Act as the definitions with which I am concerned and is referred to in section 124 of that Act. Mr Simmonds concedes that section 51 only works if the reference to  “pensionable service” contained in it is a reference to accrual of years. Otherwise, in a case such as this, the section would be providing for revaluation upon revaluation. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Thirdly, as Mr Green points out, it is also consistent with the way in which revaluation, preservation and cash equivalents work. I agree that if pensionable service does not relate to accrued years of service, it would be difficult if not impossible to calculate short service benefit with any certainty. The same is true in relation to the cash equivalent regime. I am less certain about his conclusion in relation to revaluation. In that regard, if Mr Simmonds were correct and pensionable service continued by virtue of the provision of a very low rate of revaluation, despite years of accrual having ceased, it would be open to the Member to opt out of pensionable service in order to gain the advantage of the statutory rate of revaluation. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Simmonds drew attention to four aspects of the Proposal. The first was the move from the situation under the 1994 Rules where ceasing to employ Ratings brought about a cessation of the liability to contribute to the Scheme to one in which the Current Employers were liable to pay their percentage of the pro rata share of liabilities accrued by reference to service with that Current Employer as at October 1999 irrespective of whether they continued to employ Ratings or not. The second was that the funding target was modest. It was 100% on the MFR basis by April 2006, one year before the end of the prescribed statutory period. He says that this is reflected in the definition of “Schedule of Contributions” in the 2001 Rules which refers to meeting the MFR requirements with increases in contributions “only when required to meet those requirements” and thereafter, limits the circumstances in which the Schedule of Contributions could be changed. Thirdly, he says that the Proposal made clear that section 75 debt payments made by an individual Current Employer which would reduce the overall amount of the MFR deficit, would operate to reduce the liability share of that Current Employer. Lastly, he draws attention to the right for Current Employers to withdraw from the Fund on terms.</span>

If no re-allocation takes place then the remaining Current Employers do not continue to bear 100% of the liabilities after an ECE has taken place resulting in a section 75 debt having been triggered and the exit of a Current Employer. Mr Simmonds says that this is reflected in the following passage from the Proposal:</span>

If that is wrong, he says that it would be open to the Trustee to introduce a new Schedule and that in any event, the Trustee has the power to amend in order to change the Current Employer’s Percentage.  Mr Simmonds disputes this.

On the contrary, each Current Employer’s Percentage is fixed.

It does not exonerate Current Employers from their responsibilities under their express employers’ contributions covenant under Rule 5.2 (being the absolutely fundamental ingredient of the 2001 Regime), nor does it exonerate Current Employers from the obligation to provide a Receiving Scheme to receive its due share of liabilities as a condition of being allowed to withdraw which as was recognised by Blackburne J in the 2001 Proceedings and is borne out by the 2001 Proposal was central to the 2001 Regime.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">First, Mr Green noted the terms of Rule 30.0 which states that the “only” circumstances in which a Current Employer can cease to be a Current Employer are set out within Rule 30. Mr Green says that this could not be clearer. The only circumstances in which the Current Employer’s obligations under the Rules and hence its Current Employer’s Percentage can be eradicated or reduced to zero for the purposes of the Rules as a whole are contained in Rule 30 and specifically Rule 30.8. This, he says is entirely contrary to Mr Simmonds’ argument. In this regard, Mr Simmonds submits that a Current Employer whose Current Employer’s Percentage has been reduced to zero nevertheless remains a Current Employer and is subject to any proper exercise of the amendment power, subject to the following caveat. He says that the ExxonMobil companies are not subject to that amendment power because they have already given notice under Rule 30.3 but that the remaining C2 Employers are subject to that power subject to the questions raised in Issues 6 and 7. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mr Green drew attention to Rule 30.2 which is concerned with the circumstances in which a Current Employer obtains the consent of the Trustee for one or other companies to take over its responsibilities as a Current Employer under the Scheme and therefore, is permitted to withdraw under Rule 30.1. In particular, he referred me to the final sentence of Rule 30.2. He says that in such circumstances it is not envisaged that the liability of the incoming substitute companies under Rule 5.2 is extinguished but only reduced to allow for any payment made of a section 75 debt by the withdrawing Current Employer. Mr Green says therefore, that it is intended that credit should be given for such debt payments against a positive Current Employer’s Percentage and that this is inconsistent with Mr Simmonds’ argument. Mr Simmonds on the other hand, says that the last sentence of Rule 30.2 is inconsistent with Mr Green’s construction of Rule 5.5 because it is another example of circumstances other than those in Rule 30.8 when liability is reduced by reason of a section 75 payment despite not being mentioned in the definition of Current Employer’s Percentage.   </span>

He says that they are predicated upon the basis that the Current Employer’s Percentage and therefore, the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage can only be modified pursuant to Rule 30.8 after the withdrawal has taken place. </span>

He says that if that argument is right, if the Current Employer seeking to withdraw did not like the terms imposed under the Rule 30 withdrawal mechanism, at that stage, it would merely transfer its seagoing Ratings to a sister company in order to reduce its percentage to zero and avoid the consequences of the withdrawal mechanism altogether. He notes that the idea that a Current Employer who continues to employ Ratings who are members of the Scheme and gives notice of withdrawal (taking effect at the Scheme’s next year end) is fully subject to the withdrawal provisions, but a Current Employer who takes the precaution of ceasing to employ such persons immediately before giving such notice, or between giving such notice and withdrawal at the Scheme’s year end, is able to leave free of their requirements, is as unattractive as it is implausible, and clashes directly with the express statement in the Proposal that “[a] Current Employer will not cease to be responsible for its share of the shortfall if it ceases to employ eligible Ratings”.  </span>

Furthermore, he says that the implausibility is increased by the fact that, if Mr Simmonds is right, a cohort of Current Employers (the 1999–2001 Current Employers) who had ceased to employ Ratings who were Members of the Scheme between 31 October 1999 and 31 May 2001 and who would have suffered ECEs at that time would be treated differently and less favourably under the Rules than the position for which International Marine contends. All 1999-2001 Current Employers will have suffered ECEs by definition, but because that will have preceded 31 May 2001, their “Current Employer’s Percentage” and “Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage” under the Scheme will be unaffected, with the result that their withdrawal will be fully subject to (a) the premium requirements and (b) the transfer of liabilities to a successor scheme requirements of Rule 30.3.  Mr Green says that there is nothing in the Proposal which would justify such a distinction. On the contrary, he points out that the Proposal clearly proceeds on the basis that ceasing to employ Ratings who are Members of the Scheme after 31 May 2001 is not to affect the “Current Employer’s Percentage” of a Current Employer.</span>

He accepts that one should look at the Rules as a whole and at Rule 5.5 in the context of Rule 30. He says that the fact that the two Percentages must be equal is clear from Rule 30.5 under which the Receiving Scheme is to receive a transfer of liabilities “with a value . . . equal to the Current Employer’s Percentage of the Withdrawing Employer (the “Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage”) of the total liabilities of the Scheme at the date of withdrawal” and that therefore, the Receiving Scheme should receive a transfer payment “equal to the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage of the total assets of the scheme” as at that date.      </span>

Lastly, he referred me to Rule 30.7 which is concerned in part with the situation in which a section 75 debt arises on ceasing to employ Ratings upon withdrawal from the Scheme. In that case, the entire s75 debt payment is added to the outgoing Employer’s share of the assets so that it gets full credit for it. He says therefore, that this coheres with his construction of Rule 5.5 and that it would be unfair if the same full credit were not available where a section 75 debt arises as a result of an ECE which occurs before the withdrawal.  In this regard, Mr Green retorts that Rule 30.7 is not consistent with Mr Simmonds’ approach to construction because on withdrawal under Rule 30.7 a transfer of liabilities occurs and a transfer payment is made whereas under Mr Simmonds’ scenario, no liabilities at all are transferred.  </span>

Taking those matters into account, and taking care to construe the Rules and not the Proposal as if it were the Rules, it seems to me that Rule 5.5 does not include an ECE. I come to this conclusion despite the reference to section 75 in Rule 5.5 and the reference to both sections 75 and 75A in the 2007 version of that Rule. It seems to me that an amendment in 2007 without more, is of little assistance in determining the construction to be placed on the 2001 version of the Rule. If anything, it may suggest that the 2001 version should be construed more narrowly. </span>

The Proposal makes clear that the obligation to contribute is not intended to come to an end upon ceasing to employ Ratings. Although what Mr Simmonds says about the relevant passage from the Proposal is true, namely that the 2001 Regime moved over to an obligation to fund the shortfall in the Scheme on the basis of the Scheme’s liabilities as at 31 October 1999 in respect of Members of the Scheme whilst in service with that Employer rather than based upon current service, in my judgment, this does not affect the meaning and effect of the passage itself. It follows immediately on from a statement that the “percentage share of the shortfall attributable to each Current Employer  . . . will not subsequently be recalculated . . . ” and is in the present tense. This is consistent with the inclusion in the Proposal under section 2 in outline and at Appendix 3 of the Proposal in some detail, of the section 148 revaluation to be offered. These are the provisions which are reflected in Rule 4 itself. It seems to me that this is all consistent with Rule 5.2 and a construction of Rule 5.5 read against that background which excludes an ECE.</span>

It seems to me that this is also consistent with the fact that the Current Employer’s  Percentage is defined in a way which only makes reference to its modification under Rule 30.8 upon such a withdrawal. It seems to me therefore, that the narrow construction of Rule 5.5 is consistent with the framework of the Rules as a whole and with the passage from the Proposal to which I have referred. This conclusion is not inconsistent with the sentence of the Proposal which follows immediately after the passage which I have already quoted. It is consistent with Rule 5.5 being a scheme apportionment rule. </span>

Suffice it to say for these purposes that I do not consider that the apparent omission leads to the conclusion that Rule 5.5 should be construed to include an ECE.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">If I am wrong about this, it is necessary to consider Issues 4 and 5. If an ECE is included within the terms of Rule 5.5, is the effect to reduce the Current Employer’s Percentage to zero and as a further result to reduce the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage to zero? In this regard, I agree with Mr Green. First, in my judgment, the natural meaning of Rule 5.5 relates to section 75 only. It seems to me that in the light of the Rules as a whole that Rule 5.5 is concerned solely with section 75 debts which is to be contrasted with Rule 5.2 which is concerned with contributions pursuant to the Schedule of Contributions. In fact, there is little or no dispute in relation to this, at least as far as the first part of Rule 5.5 is concerned. It is the second part which Mr Simmonds characterises as a re-apportionment rule for all purposes. However, I agree with Mr Green that the reference to “</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Current Employer’s Percentage” in the second part of Rule 5.5 is a reference back to the immediately preceding wording which deals with the Current Employer’s Percentage for the purposes of section 75. In my judgment, therefore, the natural meaning of Rule 5.5 is that of a section 75 debt apportionment rule which was permitted under the legislation in force at the date on which the 2001 Rules were executed. </span>

It seems to me that if it had been intended that Rule 5.5 operate in the way for which Mr Simmonds contends, reference would have been made not only to Rule 30.8 but also to Rule 5.5 in the definition itself.  Equally, there is no cross reference to Rule 5.5 and the potential for re-allocation and consequential change in Current Employer’s Percentage as a result, in Rule 5.2.  </span>

I come to this conclusion despite the passage in Section 3 of the Proposal which refers to re-allocation upon insolvency and which otherwise does not appear to be given effect in the 2001 Rules. As Mr Green says, rather than seek to contort the wording of Rule 5.5, this may be something to be dealt with by way of rectification.  </span>

Mr Simmonds’ construction is also inconsistent with the entire and detailed withdrawal regime. In my judgment therefore, the Current Employer’s Percentage is unaffected by Rule 5.5. As that definition and Rule 30.8 make clear the Current Employer’s Percentage is only altered once a withdrawal has taken place. I come to this conclusion despite the last sentence of Rule 30.2 which envisages that the liability to contribute of a company or companies which with the consent of the Trustee is or are substituted for a company which is allowed to withdraw, is reduced by any payments made by the Withdrawing Current Employer. I agree with Mr Green that it is couched in terms of credit being given and not in terms of a change in the Current Employer’s Percentage. It seems to me that this is consistent with the “second sentence” in the Proposal which also refers to liabilities being “reduced” by a section 75 debt rather than extinguished.  </span>

If the Current Employer’s Percentage cannot be altered except by the means set out in Rule 30.8 then the same is true of the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage. That percentage is described in Rule 30.5 as the Current Employer’s Percentage of the total liabilities of the Scheme as at the date of withdrawal. Therefore, one is defined in terms of the other. I agree with Mr Green that if Mr Simmonds were correct, an outgoing Employer could evade the detailed withdrawal provisions which were foreshadowed in the Proposal by engineering an ECE if it disliked the terms being imposed under Rule 30. This is an implausible construction and is contrary to express statements in the Proposal about the effect upon the obligation to contribute of ceasing to employ Ratings. </span>

He says that the wording of Rule 30.4 does not support such a contention. First, the imposition of a premium is stated to be in the “absolute discretion” of the Trustee. Secondly, he says that Rule 30.4(i) is looking to the security of benefits in the future and therefore, the fact that a Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage may be nil at a particular time is nothing to the point. To put the matter another way, he says that the strength of the covenant does not rest upon the level of contributions currently demanded but relates to the whole life of the scheme and as the Scheme has a last man standing provision, the premium reflects the fact that there will be one less man. Thirdly, he refers to the fact that Rule 30.4(ii) requires the Trustee to have regard to the impact of the withdrawal on remaining Employers. In this case, the ExxonMobil companies are strong employers. He points out that all of the Historic Employers contributing under the New Regime will have ceased to employ persons in seagoing employment (and some of the Current Employers will have too), so that there is no reason why ceasing to employ persons in seagoing employment and then going through the withdrawal mechanism should be allowed to place the ExxonMobil companies in a better position than those other companies by being able to bring to an end without cost its contribution obligations.</span>

He says that Rule 30.3 envisages that a Current Employer may only withdraw where there is a transfer of its Members under r 30.3(v) to (x) and the Trustee is able to consider whether to demand a premium. He says that reading the withdrawal mechanism as International Marine would have it, would be to allow a certain class of Current Employers being those who happened to cease to employ persons in seagoing employment on a date after 31 May 2001 uniquely to exit at zero cost leaving their Members behind to have their benefits funded by others. Lastly, he says that in such circumstances, the requirements of Rule 30.3(vii) and (ix) the terms of which are in the imperative, are not capable of satisfaction and therefore, the provisions are not engaged.  In particular, in relation to Rule 30.3(vii) he points out that the Trustee must be satisfied that the transfer is in the interests both of the transferring beneficiaries and those who remain.

It seems to me that Rule 30.4 makes clear that the purpose of the premium is to compensate for the extra strain upon the Scheme caused by the withdrawal of an Employer. That strain may take the form of the effect upon the security of benefits and/or the strain on the remaining Employers caused by the reduction in their number: (i) and (ii). It seems to me that this is a way of recognising the effect upon the overall covenant from a last man standing point of view. In addition, Rule 30.4(iii) makes clear that account may also be taken of the extra strain on remaining Employers as a result of there being one less Employer to bear the costs of administration of the Scheme. It seems to me that that is not necessarily another aspect of the covenant from a last man standing point of view as much as on an ongoing basis and arises from general fairness.

I come to this conclusion precisely because I do accept Mr Simmonds’ submission that when considering the relevant matters under Rule 30.4, the Trustee will need to consider the effect upon the Scheme of the loss of the Employer gauged against the ability of that outgoing Employer to meet its liability or its former liability together with the liability on a last man standing basis under the Scheme as well as its ability to meet the costs of the Scheme.  Even if the present Percentage is zero, there may be an additional strain upon the Scheme on a last man standing basis and as to costs for which the premium is intended to compensate. If the Withdrawing Employer had no ability to meet such liabilities, then of course, it would be likely that as a result the premium would be nil. The answer to Mr Simmonds’ rhetorical question therefore, is that in the absolute discretion of the Trustee, the premium could amount to nil where the ability of the withdrawing Employer to meet the extra strain on the Scheme was nil or was so weak that there was no real effect upon the Scheme as a whole as to the strain placed upon the remaining Employers or security of the benefits as a result of the exit.   </span>

The difference in approach arises not only from Mr Green’s concession in this regard. The concession arises from the terms of Rules 30.5, 30.6 and 30.7 all of which when dealing with the value of the transfer, make express reference to “a value equal to” the Current Employer’s Percentage of the total liabilities of the Scheme at the date of withdrawal. This as I have already mentioned is in contrast to the provisions in relation to premium which make no reference at all to the percentages. </span>

Accordingly, in my judgment, it is clear that the only other way to withdraw is to comply with the remainder of the Rule to the extent that it is applicable. Accordingly, if a premium is properly demanded it must be paid. However, if it is not demanded, it seems to me that the terms of Rule 30.3(v) are such that the withdrawal mechanism is not precluded from operation as a result. Although Rule 30.3(v) is imperative, it makes express reference to a premium “(if any)”. It would not be practical and purposive to construe Rule 30 and Rule 30.3 in particular, to mean that where in the exercise of its discretion the Trustee decides not to demand a premium in so doing it prevents the Employer from withdrawing.  </span>

The requirements in Rule 30.3(vi) (vii) (viii) and (ix) are governed by and make express reference to Rules 30.5- 30.7 which turn upon the value of the Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage. To put the matter another way, it seems to me that the requirement to nominate a scheme set out in Rule 30.3(vi) is dependent upon there being a transfer payment calculated pursuant to Rules 30.5-30.7. I consider that it would be perverse to construe Rule 30 in a way which requires the nomination of a transfer scheme where the transfer value is nil or in a way which would allow the withdrawal mechanism to operate where there is a Withdrawing Employer’s Percentage of 0.001% but not where it is nil. </span>

That approach requires a case that an amending power has been cut down, without any change in its own language, to be closely examined, all the more so where Rule 29.1 of the 2001 Rules expressly contemplates that further deficit repair measures might have to be taken after March 2006, including by way of further amendment of the Deed and Rules.  That provision expressly recognises the possibilities (a) that the 2001 Regime might not in fact remedy the deficit within the contemplated timeframe (i.e. by 2006) and (b) that it might do so, but that a further deficit might arise thereafter.  Mr Spink submitted that deficits existing after March 2006 could simply be repaired by Schedules of increased Contributions on the Current Employers, without any amendment.  So they could, at least in theory, but 2001 Rule 29.1 expressly contemplates that amendment might be necessary.</p>

Although it has not been suggested that this was the reason for the present application, for the purposes of interpretation the question is what possible future events might justify an amendment of the Deed and Rules, viewed as at 2001, looking forward.</p>

In the circumstances, and as a result of the duty of full and frank disclosure before Blackburne J, Mr Simmonds says that the Trustee having obtained the approval of the Court to the Proposal was not in a position on 1 June 2001 to amend the Scheme in order to change the circumstances in which an Employer could withdraw and the Trustee was in no better position in 2012 when it sought to prevent further use of the Rule 30.3 notice mechanism. He says therefore that the Trustee cannot pick and choose how to amend whilst the 2001 regime is in force, although it can be replaced entirely. He says that this is consistent with the decision of Briggs J and the Court of Appeal because it was recognised the 2001 regime itself contemplated further deficit repair if necessary, after 31 March 2006.

Furthermore, as intended, the 2001 Rules contained Rule 29.1 which envisaged the possibility of amendment after 31 March 2006 in order to deal with a deficit in any way.  He also emphasises that it is the Rules which are to be construed and not the Proposal and points out that although Mr Simmonds is forced for this purpose to submit that the new Rule 5.6 may be invalid, he had relied upon it as part of his earlier argument in relation to Rule 5.5. </span>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“I made the point above that, when a clause is simply repeated with no change or virtually no change, that may well suggest that in truth its meaning has not changed.   In this case, that inference is underscored by the fact that clause 30 contains a number of restrictions and exceptions, and the restriction for which the appellant submits does not form one of them. Moreover, the structure of clause 30 suggests strongly that this list was intended to be an exhaustive list and that no other implied limitation was to be found from any other part of the trust deed or rules, let alone any implied limitation by virtue of something that had since ceased to form part of the trust deed. Mr Spink submits that clause 30 was not materially different prior to 2001 and that it was possible that the new proviso was not adopted because the existing clause was simply renewed, but in my judgment there was clearly an opportunity to amend clause 30 in 2001 and the question of protection for the Specified Employers was not obscured from view as the 2001 scheme involved the removal of OR 31.0(ii). In those circumstances clause 30 as readopted in 2001 cannot reasonably be interpreted as subject to the implied restriction for which the appellant contends.”</p>

First, there is nothing in the relevant background in the form of the Proposal which suggests that such a limitation should be placed upon clause 30 whether as a matter of interpretation or implication. That background includes the fact that it was itself part of the Proposal which was implemented in the 2001 Rules and that both the Proposal and in turn Rule 29 of the 2001 Rules envisaged the possibility of amendment after 31 March 2006. Furthermore, as pointed out in the 2009 Proceedings, clause 30 contains express provisos. If it had been intended that its use be limited in the way which is now suggested, there would have been nothing to prevent the introduction of express terms to that effect. On the contrary, clause 30 was re-adopted in a form which does not include the kind of limitation which is now put forward. In this regard, I do accept that it may be said that the failure to do so is the very reason for the need for implication in the first place. </span>

However, the inevitable consequence of Mr Simmonds’ submission is that the 2001 Rules and in particular the amendment power should be construed against the background of the Proposal to mean that the Trustee is unable to amend the Scheme in any way unless all of the Employers accept that the amendment is within the four corners of the Proposal, they all otherwise agree to the amendment or the Court’s approval for the amendment is obtained.

Having just obtained the approval of the Court for a particular package of amendments, no doubt, the Trustee would have been called upon to show good reason for the further exercise of the power, in order to show that the exercise had been proper and not capricious.

It was made clear by Briggs J that the 2001 Regime was not irrevocable. Further, it must be borne in mind that the Trustee is not required to seek and obtain the approval of the Court before an exercise of the power of amendment however momentous. There is no further implied restriction upon the amendment power which requires the approval of the Court for its exercise whether to amend the Scheme in a way considered by the Employers to be consistent with their interpretation of the Proposal or in a way which they consider to be contrary to it.</span>

Even if as Mr Simmonds says there were only three weeks from notification to the execution of the Deed of Variation, I cannot see that such a period would be insufficient if in fact, the company wanted to make what it considered to be a momentous decision. </span>
