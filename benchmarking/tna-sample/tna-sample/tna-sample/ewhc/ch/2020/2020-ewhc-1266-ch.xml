SML also seeks certain ancillary relief including an account of profits, rescission of a debenture and certain declarations.  Any entitlement to that ancillary relief flows from the circumstances in which SML is entitled to damages and/or an indemnity. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim for damages relates to a number of different breaches of duty said to have been committed by those directors at various times between 2013 and 2016.  The claim that they are liable to indemnify SML arises out of a substantial property transaction, by which SML sold a major part of its assets to companies controlled by those defendants on 1 April 2016.  It is also pleaded that, by procuring SML to enter into that transaction, those directors committed breaches of duty. </p>

The relevant asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) also made provision for the sale and leasing by SML to SFP and SGP of certain real property from which SML had until then carried on its business.  The APA and the leases were constituent elements of a wider transaction (the “Transaction”) by which the shares in Continental Express Transport Limited (“CET”), a company in the same ownership as SML, were sold to Logistic Partnerships Limited (“LPL”), a company which was owned and controlled by the same directors who owned and controlled SFP and SGP. </p>

SML contends that this conduct gave rise to breaches by the Director Defendants of one or more of their general duties under Part 10 Chapter 2 of the 2006 Act, including their duty of care under section 174.  It is then said that SML was caused loss as a result of the Director Defendants’ breaches of duty both in the amount of the value of the assets misapplied and by reason of trading losses sustained through their negligence. </p>

The principal problem with Mario’s evidence was that he often found it difficult to concentrate on the precise point about which he was being asked without constantly reverting to one or other of the main themes in SML’s case.  He also found it difficult to remember how particular events fitted into their proper place in the chronology of what occurred and was prone to become very excitable when it became apparent during his cross-examination (as it did on a number of occasions) that his recollection of the details was faulty.   Nonetheless, with one exception, I do not think that he set out to mislead.  The occasions on which his evidence was misleading, and I regret to say deliberately so, were when he sought to play down the role which his own son, Salvi, played in the management of the business and the design of the Transaction.  On the occasions that he was wrong, he was often very reluctant to accept that he was, but for the most part he tried to tell the truth as he remembered it to be. </p>

He only featured at the time of the Transaction, but he was the leading objector to what it was that the Director Defendants wanted to do.  It is clear that he thought they had been incompetent in their management of SML’s business since their appointment, that they had been misleading his father (Mario) for some time and were trying to strip the maximum value out of SML to the detriment of its remaining shareholders.  On the whole, his evidence was credible, but it was given in a manner which displayed a rather unattractive enjoyment in exposing what he thought of as Peter’s and Sammy’s misconduct.  This gave the impression that he had something to prove and caused me to approach what he had to say with some caution. </p>

The first was Mr Randall who was SML’s financial controller between 2002 and March 2015 when he left on extended sick leave as a result of what he said was work-place stress caused amongst other things by the bullying behaviour of Peter and Mr Smith.  After his sick leave started, he opened a formal grievance which included a wide range of complaints against the Director Defendants generally and more specifically against Peter and then began proceedings against SML in the employment tribunal.  A number of those complaints featured in these proceedings, as did the circumstances in which the employment tribunal proceedings were compromised and the amount that Mr Randall was then paid.  He has since been reemployed by SML and has been a director since September 2016 when this dispute had already begun and shortly before proceedings were actually commenced. </p>

I agree with the submission of Ms Anderson QC for the Director Defendants that it was clear that Mr Randall had an axe to grind bordering on vindictiveness.  In part his attitude was driven by a genuine belief that the Director Defendants had been mismanaging SML and running it into the ground, but there were occasions on which he was not wholly frank about the attitude that he had had to the Director Defendants at the time of many of the events of which complaint is now made.  In short, I have had to approach his evidence with caution, and have often not found it possible to rely on his uncorroborated evidence on issues relating to the conduct of the Director Defendants. </p>

I do not think that either of them was wholly dishonest, but I think that they were prepared to give a spin on what happened which did not reflect the true position.

Where her evidence was of relevance, I was able to accept it as being both honest and a bona fide attempt to assist the court. </p>

It was very much a family business with many members of the family participating in different activities:  working in the greenhouses, visiting other local growers, packing the produce and so on.  Peter and Sammy in particular went straight into the business after leaving school without any formal qualifications.

Mario was managing director, Pauline was finance director (and also acted as company secretary) and Tony was responsible for the growing.

The packhouse at the WX Hub was extended in 2004 to meet the requirements of the supermarkets which were SML’s main customers.  After the acquisition of the WX Hub, SML redeveloped the old greenhouses at Waltham Abbey and continued to expand its acreage under glass.  In 1998, it bought some land at Fen Drayton in Cambridgeshire (“Fen Drayton”) on which it initially built some 8 acres of greenhouses, expanding to 18 acres of glass on 52 acres of land over the course of the next 10 years.  Fen Drayton also included four houses and a staff hostel.  This growth meant that, during the course of the 1990s, SML had become one of the UK’s largest suppliers of salad produce to supermarkets. </p>

Some idea of the size of the operation at this stage can be gleaned from the fact that the combined workforce of SML and CET was over 600 staff at peak times, and in 2004, which was the last financial year in which all of the shares were held by the original shareholders, SML had sales of £82.3 million and made pre-tax profits of £2.8 million. </p>

Article 7 contemplates that a Group Class Representative can be appointed either generally or for a specific general meeting.  Under Article 7.7 the appointment of a Group Class Representative required a majority vote at a Group Class Meeting.  The combined effect of Articles 7.11, 9.1 and 10.1 is that each Group Class Representative is entitled to one vote at general meetings of SML and that no business can be transacted at a general meeting of SML unless a quorum consisting of one Group Class Representative from each Group Class is present. </p>

He thought that the source of this belief was looking at the Articles (i.e. the provisions for Group Class Representatives) and what he was told by the Director Defendants and Salvi.

To the extent that Peter, Sammy and Pauline said that they were, they failed to distinguish between other representative roles of importance and influence in the conduct of SML’s affairs, and they were wrong in the views that they expressed.  If any such appointment had been made, I am satisfied that it would have been regarded as an important technical matter that would have been recorded in some way.   </p>

It seems that, up until then, Peter and Mario worked together as the principal managers of the business.  In October 2009 a surprise retirement party was held in Peter’s garden for all three of the original shareholders, and Mario did in fact then retire at which stage Peter took over as managing director of SML and Sammy took over as managing director of CET. </p>

He had been very much the face of the business and he lived on the Waltham Abbey site.  He continued as a director until December 2014 and maintained an office at the WX Hub.  He popped in quite regularly and continued to take an active interest in what was going on.  All of the younger members of the family, and Mr Randall, sought his advice, guidance and help and the impression I had was that when he made suggestions, they were given considerable weight, and that his views when he expressed them were highly influential. </p>

Peter gives a number of examples of Mario’s role in his witness statement, including specific events that he helped to organise and one-off tasks such as registering SML with the environment agency for waste exemptions in 2013.  He also describes how Mario continued to present himself, particularly in the local Italian community, as chairman of SML and to put himself forward as the front man for the business when a senior member of the family was required.  I am sure that Mario was a strong character and may well have found it difficult to let go, but I am not satisfied that the instances which are given reflect anything other than an involvement by Mario in particular projects where his long experience and seniority were thought to be appropriate.  It was more a question of him taking on the role of figurehead on occasions when he or they considered that it would be useful. </p>

To that extent he was out of touch with the detail of what was going on.  Indeed, when Mr Randall described a meeting at Waltham Abbey in January 2015 to which I will return later in this judgment, he said that this was the first time that he had seen Mario for over a year.  Mario had also stopped asking Mr Randall for financial information and management accounts, which it had been his practice to ask to have printed out for him before he resigned as a director.  Although Mario accepted that he could always have asked for the information if he wanted to, and would have received it, he said that he did not need to do so once he had retired.  That changed in the run up to the Transaction, when Mario complained that financial information, and more particularly management accounts that he wanted to see, were not forthcoming. </p>

However, the Director Defendants do not accept that he did not play a full role in the events for which they are now sued by SML and rely on the disparity in treatment in defending this claim.  They also rely on the fact that he was privy to information relating to the planning of the restructuring (which eventually became the Transaction) as support for a submission that Mario and his branch of the family knew much more about what was proposed than they now admit to be the case.    </p>

Salvi himself did not give evidence but Mario said that he stuck to procurement where he was happy, that (like Spider Sam) he was only a director so that each branch of the family had a member on the board and that the business was really run by Peter and Sammy.  Mario said that Salvi “<span style="font-style:italic">would probably say yes to anything</span>”, and Mr Randall said that, although Salvi was a director throughout the relevant events, he was carried along by the Director Defendants and did not really know much of what was going on.  Mr Randall accepted, however, that it would not be right to describe Salvi as being bullied into doing what he did not want to do. Mario and Mr Randall both also said that Salvi was not involved in any discussions with Barclays, that he was not copied into e-mails with Barclays and that he did not receive any management accounts. </p>

Indeed, there are even examples of occasions when it was Salvi who initiated confirmatory correspondence about the new commercial strategy and occasions (for example in January 2015) when it was Salvi who set up the meetings at which that strategy was to be discussed. </p>

He was also identified by Mr Randall in his employment tribunal proceedings as a director whose conduct in altering purchase orders amounted to breaches of duty and in some respects fraud.   Salvi did not give evidence, and it is not necessary for me to make any formal findings, but it is appropriate for me to say that there are a number of respects in which the evidence points to SML having claims against Salvi to the same extent as it has claims against the Director Defendants. </p>

I do not accept this evidence, which was in any event speculative hearsay.  I think that the impression which Mario was trying to convey in his evidence was that no member of his branch of the family was involved to any material extent in developing or implementing the strategy which led to the events of which SML complains in these proceedings.

I have formed the view that Mario’s evidence on this point was both speculative and inaccurate.  In my view, Salvi had available to him much more financial information, and participated in the development of the Transaction on an informed basis, to a much greater extent than Mario was prepared to admit.  The obvious inaccuracies in the evidence given by Mario and Mr Randall when dealing with the role of Salvi means that I have had to adopt a cautious approach to relying on their uncorroborated evidence of events in which Salvi appears to have participated. </p>

I shall be referring to his role on a significant number of occasions later in this judgment.

The consequence of this is that, while it is difficult for me to identify all of the matters on which SML’s case would have been likely to be harmed by his evidence, I have had to adopt a particularly critical scrutiny of SML’s case on disputed events where his evidence could have assisted. </p>

It included what Peter described as an expensive interest rate swap.  The idea was that this would provide money to fund the retirement of the original shareholders, and in any event, it made sense for the land to be owned by the operating company.

Precision on this issue is not necessary but what does seem clear is that, from about the mid-2000s, the market was increasingly challenging, and SML was starting to lose some of its traditional business.  Thus, it lost the Safeway business when that chain was purchased by Morrisons in 2004 and the Somerfield business declined when it was purchased by Co-op in 2008, eventually ending altogether in 2011. </p>

It was a very profitable relationship, with annual sales peaking at around £45 million, but in 2010 Asda told SML that it was intending to build up its own direct model, packing through a subsidiary International Produce Limited (“IPL”), which led to a gradual reduction in sales to Asda between 2011 and 2015 from c.£30 million to c.£11 million.  However, although the sales reduced, Sammy said in his evidence that on the growing side SML retained the more profitable parts of the business i.e. the produce which was more difficult to grow. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">One of SML’s complaints in these proceedings is that the Director Defendants were negligent in the approach that they took to replacing the business lost as a result of the decline in the orders from Asda.  In particular, SML complains that inadequate steps were taken to reduce overheads and prepare for the anticipated loss of business, notwithstanding the notice that Asda had given.  This is disputed by the Director Defendants, and Peter’s evidence describes the steps that SML took to try to rectify the situation.  He lists out a number of things that they did, including continuing to work with Asda and IPL, making the most of the surviving period of the contract, securing new contracts with Suncrop, Ocado, and Pret a Manger and working to increase their sales to Co-op and Costco.  Mr Randall in his evidence for SML accepted that this showed that the directors of SML, and indeed he himself had “<span style="font-style:italic">actively looked for other business</span>”. </p>

In my view, however, it has not been established that, during the period of decline in the Asda business (between 2010 and 2014), the directors did not take steps to replace the Asda contract.  This four year period of decline in the Asda-related turnover is important background to a more focused complaint that is made about what happened between December 2014 when the Directors Defendants received a warning from Mr Randall that the import business was loss-making and the end of November 2015 when that business was eventually brought to an end.  I shall revert to this issue later in this judgment when I deal with agreed issue 12. </p>

There was at least one further covenant breach, this time of the debt service covenant, later the same year.  Barclays reserved its rights in relation to these breaches and put SML under the monitoring of its business support unit (“BSU”).  Mr Pickford said that SML was placed in the first of three escalating warning lists.  One of the things that Barclays did at this stage was to take security over some of the real property (Fen Drayton) over which its charges then needed to be perfected. </p>

Shortly thereafter, it advanced £550,000 to SML to purchase some property adjacent to the WX Hub, which was thought to contribute to an increase in the overall value of the site.  At about the same time Barclays and SML agreed a new facility letter with new covenants.  There was some debate as to whether or not these were more relaxed, but whether or not they were, Barclays continued to show every indication that it was happy to continue to support SML, which was by then a long-established customer. </p>

The question then arose as to the appropriate level at which SML could continue to make payments to the original shareholders.  In the event, SML agreed to pay £60,000 per annum to each original shareholder, described by Peter as a form of pension.  The evidence points to this being a difficult decision because on the one hand their parents had what Peter said was “no more income” while on the other the business was under some pressure.  Payments at this level continued until the APA was signed in April 2016. </p>

Mario accepted in his evidence that SML did not really have a marketing department at this stage.  It was put to Peter in cross-examination that the suggestion to hire a nonexecutive director did not come from Mr Farrow, but Peter was clear that it did, and I have no reason to doubt his evidence on this point, not least because it was consistent with what both Mr Pickford and Mr Randall said in their evidence.  They were also at the meeting with Mr Farrow.  However, Mr Pickford also said that the non-executive assistance suggested by Mr Farrow was for a somewhat different purpose, i.e. to help with good practice in what was a family business.  A similar point was made by Mr Randall who said that Barclays’ suggestion was that SML should look for a nonexecutive who was an independent and experienced businessperson.  He said that Barclays made no specific suggestion that that person should have marketing experience. </p>

I do not consider that the precise nature of the suggestion made by Mr Farrow adds a great deal to the case one way or the other, but Peter’s evidence that this suggestion was part of the reason he invited Mr Smith to become involved in the business was not very convincing.

I do not think that is a fair summary of the position.  In my view, there is no reason to conclude that Ms Newcombe did not know the sort of things that would be known by “<span style="font-style:italic">anyone would who lives with someone for 15 years</span>”, even if her understanding of the detail of his business affairs was limited.

After that meeting, which was held on 10 May 2013, Peter asked the others to let him know what they thought, and Mr Randall’s views were expressed in an email on which he was cross-examined.

It is not a central issue in the case, but I did not find Mr Randall’s evidence on the views that he then had about Mr Smith to be very convincing.  I do not think that he was then, any more than he is now, as biddable as this evidence would suggest.  There are a number of other occasions to which I will refer in this judgment when Mr Randall does not seem to have had any difficulty in giving unpalatable news to Peter and I think that if he had thought that hiring Mr Smith was a bad idea he would not have expressed himself in the way that he did.  I think it is quite possible that he has realised that the tone of this e-mail is inconvenient to SML’s case that a marketing man such as Mr Smith was unnecessary, and he has difficulty in admitting that that is not what he thought at the outset. </p>

When pressed on this point by Ms Anderson QC, he accepted that he was not able to support an assertion that Peter made or even encouraged Salvi to send the e-mail.

In that e-mail he commented on the interrelationships between SML’s directors and management and the conclusions he drew from that on two different strategies for developing the business.  The two possibilities were the establishment of autonomous companies and a restructuring with three distinct profit centres.  His view was that the better way forward was to restructure the business into three clearly defined profit centres under the continuing single corporate entity, i.e. SML, and then move to a corporate restructuring with autonomous legal entities running separate parts of the business at some stage thereafter (he suggested that a decision for stage two could be made in 2016).

It is also the case that no evidence has been adduced to show that Kore Creative, through whom it is now said that Mr Smith was to charge these consultancy fees, had accounted in its own books and records for debts due from SML in respect of the period prior to June 2014. </p>

This is significant because other aspects of Mr Smith’s work (through Kore Creative and Kombbi subsequent to June 2014) were invoiced and paid at or about the time it was carried out.  In assessing the significance of this factor, I bear in mind that Mr Smith has died, and that Ms Newcombe has had some difficulties in obtaining access to all of the information about their affairs.  Nonetheless, and in large part because her inability to find any invoices is matched by the evidence that none were recorded by SML either, I am satisfied that none were in fact rendered. </p>

It also points out that Peter’s notes of a meeting with Barclays held on 28 June 2013 make no reference to the fact that SML had just hired a consultant at £1,300 per day, which Mr Roe QC suggested that it would have done if the agreement with Mr Smith had been reached.  He pointed out that there was no mention of this substantial commitment even though the notes referred to a “record high cost” of +500k and suggested that there would have been mention of it if any such agreement had been reached.  Mr Roe QC made a similar point in relation to Peter’s notes of a meeting that he had with Barclays on 23 September 2013 where Mr Smith was mentioned as a new director but there is no indication that Peter told Barclays about the arrangement for consultancy fees. </p>

Based on the way in which the note of the June meeting was written, Peter thought that the reference to high costs was probably a reference to energy costs, from which I took it that energy fixed costs were more likely to be the type of cost in which Barclays would have had an interest than discretionary consultancy costs. </p>

Even if any mention of Mr Smith’s hiring was in fact made, I do not think it at all surprising that any fee was not discussed and, even if it had been, the notes were made by Peter and there is no particularly obvious reason why he would have recorded it unless it became an issue with Barclays, which it may well not have done.  This is particularly the case when it is not clear to me how much time it could be seen at this early stage in the relationship that Mr Smith was likely to be spending on SML’s affairs. </p>

In my view, the mere fact that it was sent to solicitors by Mr Smith gives the Schedule very little additional evidential quality.  I should also add that, although Ms Newcombe said that she understood that there was an agreement between Peter and Mr Smith that the consultancy fees would be deferred, it became apparent during her oral evidence that her understanding came from Peter, not from anything that was said to her by Mr Smith at the time. </p>

This is to be contrasted with his annual earnings from selfemployment for the four tax years ending 5 April 2012 to 5 April 2015 (when declared on a mortgage application dated 24 July 2015) as being £39,770, £52,449, £38,899 and £50,000 (estimated) respectively.

Of course there may have been costs to set against any consultancy fees, but it seems most improbable, given the nature of the activities then carried on by Mr Smith, that they explain the whole of the difference, more particularly as it seems that, during this period, he was also carrying out other work.  It is right to say, however, that the evidence as to what else Mr Smith was doing while he was also providing assistance to SML is sparse, and it is difficult for me to make findings with any degree of certainty. </p>

Quite apart from Peter’s evidence to this effect, the way that Mr Smith was presented by Peter to the outside world, and the way that he presented himself, are inconsistent with that being the case.  There is a consistent theme throughout the documents that in the early summer of 2013, what had been a relationship in which Mr Smith gave occasional, informal advice became a relationship established on a rather more formalised footing.  </p>

I accept that Mr Smith told Peter that that he would want to try and charge £1,300 per day, but I do not accept that the arrangement went any further than that.  If it had, it would have been recorded in some way, Mr Randall would have known about it and invoices would have been rendered.  I should also add that I think it is most unlikely that Mr Smith (as a consultant with experience in a number of business activities) can have thought that this was not something that he would be expected to do in order to be paid what he was owed.  The absence of any invoices or any other contemporaneous documentary evidence is particularly significant, and it is telling that later on there were a number of other contexts in which Mr Smith knew that invoices were required and rendered them through Kore Creative and Kombbi. </p>

Mr Smith was content to proceed on the basis that his relationship with Peter was sufficient to ensure that, when the time came, a reasonable figure would be agreed between them.  At that stage he was confident that he and Peter would be able to reach an accommodation and he certainly did not anticipate that he would need to agree it with anyone else.  On that basis he was prepared to proceed on trust and commence more formal work on SML’s affairs. </p>

I am satisfied however, that if and to the extent that Mr Smith had been able to establish that specific instructions to do particular pieces of work could be shown to have been given or subsequently approved, he would be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for that work.

Put another way I infer that the supply of an invoice properly describing the work carried out was a necessary precondition to the accrual of a current liability.

It relates to the true value of the WX Hub at the time of the Transaction.  Peter accepted in his evidence that at that meeting, when discussing SML’s financial situation with Barclays, he might have thought that the WX Hub was worth about £11 million.  The notes of the meeting disclose that he had that discussion in the context of valuing SML’s assets (£11 million for the WX Hub, £3 million for Waltham Abbey and £7 million for Fen Drayton) to set against its £6.5 million of borrowings, and he agreed that he and others believed that the WX Hub was then worth much more than the value of £8.6 million for which it was included in the books.  Peter was quite defensive when he was questioned about his recording of the value of the WX Hub at the June 2013 meeting and I do not accept his tentative suggestion that he was simply writing down a figure put forward by someone else.  I do not think that he would have recorded it in the way that he did if £11 million was not an amount that he believed it was worth. </p>

This was variously described in the evidence as a “quick fix” decided on by Peter, and a “one off boost” to SML’s accounts.  The proceeds of sale amounting to some £2.5 million were used to pay off SML’s £1.7 million overdraft, although it kept a £1.5 million facility with Barclays (down from £4 million) thought to be desirable to cover the seasonal planting costs at Waltham Abbey and Fen Drayton. </p>

Mr Randall also explained that the cash surplus which was generated on the sale of Cardiff Nursery was used up, and the overdraft was utilised far more quickly than it should have been over the course of the next 15 months.

With varying degrees of emphasis, he continued to be keen to do more to develop the traditional supermarket business. For example, he pointed to opportunities with Aldi and Lidl, saying that although their product range was more limited and sold for lower prices, the cost of inputs was lower as well.  Whether Mario was right of wrong about that, the raw data points to a decline and then a levelling off in turnover both before and after the one-off injection of cash achieved on the sale of the Cardiff Nursery.  The figures which I have seen show that, for the five accounting periods from the year ended 30 June 2008 to 30 June 2012, SML’s turnover decreased year-on-year from c.£79 million to c.£50 million. There were then two years of relatively small increases in turnover which took the figures back up to the levels they were at in the year ended 30 June 2011 (c.£56 million) by 30 June 2014. </p>

He attended a meeting (including dinner) at Canary Wharf with Mr Pickford, where SML was also represented by Peter, Sammy and Mr Randall.  The developing commercial strategy was discussed, which involved a move away from the supermarket business where the margins were beginning to shrink and a focus on small box sales to smaller customers where the profit margins should have been significantly higher.  Peter said that this strategy was very much Mr Smith’s idea, but that it was supported by the directors including at that stage Pauline and Mario.  A presentation was made to Barclays which included two new logos for the growing and food partnerships divisions that had been designed by Mr Smith.

What does seem to have been discussed however was the strategy, originally floated by Mr Smith in June, under which the business would be divided into separate cost centres.  As I understood the evidence, that process had already started by the time of the meeting with Barclays in December.  There seems to have been a sense of optimism as to SML’s prospects after the meeting at Canary Wharf, and the contemporaneous e-mails reflected a belief that SML had a clear business strategy which went down well with Barclays, whatever the views which Mario had and Mr Randall now says he had about the right way forward.

Initially it was called Stubbins Food Partnership Limited (singular) and remained dormant, although Stubbins Food Partnerships was used as an SML trading name.  Another relevant development in December 2013 was that SML entered into an agreement to acquire a 50% interest in SGS, a local grower of salad produce owned by the Faranda family.  Salvi was then appointed a director of SGS.  In the event this was not a profitable venture for SML in the sense that SGS never paid a dividend.  However, the treatment of SML’s shareholding under the terms of the APA and the Transaction more generally is one of the agreed issues and a matter to which I shall have to return later in this judgment. </p>

In Sammy’s case the property was at 122 Bramfield Road, Datchworth (“Bramfield Road”).  It is not in issue that such work was done and paid for by SML, but the costs and amount of the work was a contentious matter between the parties.

By this stage Peter had confirmed to Mr Smith (he did so in an e-mail of 8 March 2014) that SML had agreed to a £15,000 per month marketing budget for the 14-month period from the beginning of March (i.e. totalling £210,000).  Mario confirmed in his evidence that SML supplied fresh produce to every stall at the Taste of London event and Peter said that SML’s presence there “<span style="font-style:italic">was brilliant exposure and allowed us to demonstrate to the industry how we were positioning SML for the future</span>”.  The evidence was that Mr Smith was heavily involved in the preparation for this and at the beginning of Ms Newcombe’s evidence, videos were played of the presentations, towards the preparation of which Mr Smith made a significant contribution.  Peter also explained how SML’s presence at the London Produce Show was instrumental in agreements that SML was able to reach with Grocery Delivery E-Services Ltd (“Hello Fresh”) for its food boxes, and new supply contracts with CH Robinsons Fresh, Costco and Asda/IPL. </p>

There was agreement between the parties that by June 2014, i.e. the time of the first of these invoices, Mr Smith had become a <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> director of SML.

This evidence is peculiar, because Mr Smith had already been using the title Innovation and Marketing Director during the course of 2013, although it may be that this use had not been agreed by the directors.  In the event, the date was not challenged in cross-examination, and nothing very much turns on it.  But what was challenged in cross-examination was Peter’s evidence about a manuscript note prepared by Mr Smith which seems to reflect a meeting between Peter and Mr Smith on this subject which was held on 18 December 2014.

His remuneration package was to have retrospective effect to 1 October 2014, and from that date would be £135,000, paid as to £60,000 by way of salary via PAYE and as to £75,000 by way of consultancy fee.  The fact that Mr Smith’s remuneration package took effect from 1 October 2014 is also consistent with the fact that the Schedule which was prepared by Mr Smith before his death (albeit in contemplation of litigation) does not seek to claim for a period beyond the end of September 2014.  As I understand the evidence, the payments in relation to this agreement started to be made in January 2015.   </p>

I do, however, accept that Peter and Mr Smith had discussions at that stage for Mr Smith to participate by way of a 25% stake in a hived-off food partnerships business, and that much of what then happened is only explicable on the basis that a structure of this part of the business going forward would include an equity participation of some sort for Mr Smith. </p>

This agreement featured in the evidence for reasons to do with the proper valuation of the assets transferred as part of the Transaction.  Amongst other things, Hello Fresh agreed to take a minimum purchase amount of an average 8,000 boxes per week for 2015 and SML agreed to invest up to £75,000 p.a. in the purchase of new equipment to enable it to supply the services that it had contracted to provide.  The agreement was entered into for an initial term of 24 months.  The initial 24 month term was of relatively minor significance because the contract was automatically renewable until terminated by either party and was terminable by either party without cause on 6 months’ written notice to the other, and with cause (the precise details of which do not matter for present purposes) by written notice either forthwith or on the expiry of 7 days depending on the nature of the cause. </p>

This was a reference to SML’s proposals to focus on Hello Fresh and similar contracts with premium products and higher profit margins.

Mr Randall said that David Platt LDA provided haulage services to SML, although Peter and Sammy said that the real relationship was with CET which is consistent with them both being in the same business.

He said that “<span style="font-style:italic">This was an excellent opportunity to acquire a business for no upfront cost and no risk, unlike all the other previous investments made by Peter</span>”.

Some progress was made by the lawyers and I was shown e-mail correspondence which indicates that preliminary work was done in both England and Portugal.  Sammy said that he did not know about the instruction at the time it was initially given, but both he and Peter said that when they were asked by Mr Randall to authorise the instruction of solicitors a little later on, Sammy said that he had by then decided to do nothing about the opportunity to proceed and told Mr Randall accordingly.

Sammy said that, because they could both fit their work for David Platt LDA around their work for CET he had no concerns about this arrangement.

The reason he said this was not because he had any independent knowledge of the intention, but because of what he had later read in an e-mail from Mr Smith to his personal accountant, Mr Alan Heywood, at the beginning of February 2015.  I think that it is right that this was the intention at one stage and, more importantly, that this continued to be the intention after the time at which Sammy told Mr Randall that they were not doing anything at the moment.

The relationship is also evidenced by some handwritten notes written by Peter, recording a meeting that was held in October 2017 between the Director Defendants and Mr Heyes.  The notes appeared to show that the four of them were discussing the return of the money which had been paid and how it was then going to be distributed between the Director Defendants and Mr Ayres.  The way in which the note was prepared indicates that the payment which was being referred to was some form of investment in David Platt, although Mr Heyes’ evidence on the point was that he was not sure that any acquisition of shares in David Platt LDA ever actually happened. </p>

In SML’s skeleton argument it is submitted that the shares in Beneli were in fact held on trust for the Director Defendants and Mark Ayres, but the evidence comes nowhere near establishing that that was the case.

He attached the November management accounts and said that the most important thing to mention was that the low level of SML’s gross profit before overheads meant that, even with significant cost-cutting by reduction of the overheads, SML was loss-making; a problem caused entirely by the size of the margin between the buying and selling price of its products.

This led to a meeting, which Mr Randall says took place immediately after he sent the e-mail, and in which there was a discussion with Peter and Sammy about the problems which included the lack of margin selling to the supermarkets with overheads of £400,000 per month, the weaker pound and the fact that the nurseries were having a bad year again.  Mr Smith joined the meeting a bit later, at which stage Peter and Sammy told him that Mr Randall had said that SML was bankrupt and that it would run out of money in 6 months.  Mr Smith’s response was that SML had £20 million of assets and would not run out of money.  Mr Randall subsequently withdrew the comment that he had made about the risk of SML going bust. </p>

In that e-mail he suggested that the directors might wish to take advice as to their position, as SML should cease trading if they believed that SML was not going to be able to meet all of its liabilities as they fell due.  Mr Randall also raised the issue of what Barclays would be likely to require as a condition for advancing further funds, an issue that he suggested should be discussed with the shareholders.  He also expressed a concern that it would be wrong for what he described as Food Partnerships to be hived off to a different group of shareholders (including it appears Peter, Sammy and Salvi) without compensating or at least obtaining the approval of SML’s shareholders as a whole.  Mr Randall says that he made his views on this point clear because, as I have already mentioned, he had been told by Mr Smith that Peter had promised him 25% of the Stubbins Food partnerships business, and he felt very strongly that this was wrong. </p>

He supported this with the figures prepared by Mr Randall which demonstrated the likely realisations on a winding up of SML and CET as at the beginning of December 2014 and as at the beginning of May 2015.  These were the figures prepared at the request of Sammy made at the 16 January meeting and showed a reduction of shareholder value from approximately £6 million in December to zero in May caused for the most part by the costs of planting up the nurseries for the year, but also by an additional discount on the realisation values of the fixed assets and 6 months of anticipated trading losses.  Mr Randall summarised the position in his covering e-mail: “<span style="font-style:italic">I currently value the shareholder value in the business as zero</span>”. </p>

Mr Randall described how he considered that the whole purpose behind them was to persuade the original shareholders that they would lose everything if they did not go along with the new cost reduction strategy and a change of bank.  I have formed the view that the way this was described by Mr Randall in his evidence was broadly correct, although I am not persuaded that he prepared the figures as a result of what can properly be described as bullying.  I think it is clear that Peter instructed him to present the unvarnished reality of SML’s financial situation to the shareholders and that what he produced was based on a forecast for the position as at 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>May because that was the worst point in the annual cash flow cycle.  I have also formed the view that this was done to enable the shareholders to see what the position was on a worst-case basis, and to give substance and impetus to the Director Defendants’ proposals for the way forward.  I do not, however, consider that this was all part of a deliberate long-term strategy to mislead the other shareholders for the purpose of facilitating the ability of the Director Defendants and Salvi to pick up parts of the business on the cheap. </p>

One of the aspects of the discussion which was stressed by a number of the witnesses and is reflected in the notes of the meeting taken by Sammy was the importance of protecting the family assets, by which was meant the properties, more than the business then carried on from the properties. </p>

I am sure that Mario was unhappy with this, but he went along with it, and at this stage anyway he was apportioning no blame for the difficult situation in which SML found itself.  Mario also denied that there was any form of discussion about a management buy-out at the 26 January meeting, by which he meant a restructuring strategy which involved SML’s business being transferred to a new company or group which was owned or controlled by the existing members of the management team (i.e. the Director Defendants and Salvi). </p>

However, I did not understand him to dispute that he knew that the new strategy involved some form of splitting the business from the property assets because he remembered a discussion about Keith Sadler (SML’s commercial director) and Mr Randall staying on to work for the newco.   </p>

The important thing was an agreement that SML should be prepared to move to another bank if it was advantageous to do so.

I also think it is clear that the members of SML’s management team, by which I mean the Director Defendants, Salvi and Mr Randall had all bought into a way forward for SML in the light of its cash flow difficulties which involved a short term, a medium term and a long-term strategy.  This included moving the packing operation from the WX Hub to the nurseries, concentrating on Hello Fresh and SGS and looking at ways of raising additional funding in the short term.  It also involved considering the sale of a major asset (such as the WX Hub or the Waltham Abbey nursery) and investing in new business areas away from growing for supermarkets in the medium term and focusing on a marketing led organisation with a larger number of smaller customers (both retail and internet based) in the longer term.

It was also the case, however, that the Director Defendants and Salvi had started at this stage to formulate their ideas for a short term containment strategy to be run through SML, while also planning for the role that SFP would be taking in a medium to long term strategy for sustainable growth and long term profit.  Mr Randall says that he was not part of the discussions about this aspect of the plans for the future, and it is now SML’s case that he was deliberately kept out of the picture because the Director Defendants and Salvi were planning to develop that part of the growth strategy for their own benefit (through SFP) without involving SML. </p>

I am bound to say that I was left with the impression that Mr Randall’s evidence on this issue was driven more by a reluctance to concede points which he knew would not help SML’s case than  it was by a straightforward approach to explaining the situation as it appeared at the time.  </p>

This was a reference to the loan to FPIL which he had earlier said was to be “<span style="font-style:italic">ring-fenced for this purpose away from Barclays to progress the new strategy</span>”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">SML says that at this stage, the contemporaneous evidence supports its case that Mr Smith was being paid up to date for all of the work which he was carrying out on behalf of SML, which is inconsistent with the existence of any unpaid invoices.  By way of example, Mr Smith had correspondence in February with both Mr Randall and Mr Heywood dealing with amounts that he was owed.  On neither occasion was there any suggestion that amounts which had not been invoiced remained outstanding, despite the fact that the context of the correspondence meant that it is likely to have been mentioned if that were to have been the case.  This is I think correct.  As, however, the building work on Mr Smith’s house, which is said by the Director Defendants to have been carried out in lieu of payment to Mr Smith of consultancy fees for his pre-June 2014 work for SML, seems to have been finished by then, the fact that payment was said to be up to date in February 2015 throws no light on the question of whether there was any agreement in 2013 to pay Mr Smith at £1,300 per day, or in 2014 to discharge SML’s obligation by doing building work on his house. </p>

I need to describe the circumstances of his departure, and what occurred thereafter, in some detail.  The reason for this is that the settlement which was eventually reached between SML and Mr Randall gives rise to one of the agreed issues, i.e. that the settlement sum which was eventually paid to him was excessive and a breach of duty, being paid for an improper purpose. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">When Mr Randall left there was a dispute as to whether he had resigned or whether he was simply off work on health grounds, not formally resigning until much later on in the year.  It is not necessary for me to resolve that question, but I think it is clear that he was ill.  He described his illness as work-related stress.  I do not have sufficient evidence to justify a finding that that was the case, but there is no reason to doubt Mr Randall’s belief that stress at work was the cause of his own illness and there is no doubt that he was under very considerable pressure.  It is also clear that Mr Randall did not get on at all with Mr Smith or Peter and the strains in their relationship had a significant impact on Mr Randall’s ability to do his job properly.  Pauline had the impression from Peter and Sammy that Mr Randall was jealous of Mr Smith and felt threatened by the role that he was playing in the business.  That may be an oversimplistic assessment because part of the problem was the strain of being financial controller in a company subject to real financial pressures.  Nonetheless, what Pauline had to say about one of the causes had a ring of truth about it. </p>

Shortly after he did so he raised an internal grievance identifying a number of the issues, which have now been taken up by SML in its claim against the Director Defendants in these proceedings.  It was conducted by members of SML’s human resources department and was eventually dismissed at the end of September.  It is plain that while this was going on SML was preparing to make Mr Randall redundant. </p>

Pauline said that the papers for employment tribunal proceedings which Mr Randall was proposing to take against SML had already been prepared and Mr Randall brought them with him.

He denied that he made any threats but said that he did talk about concerns he had with the way that SML was being run.  His concerns, which in general terms were justified, included the way in which the Director Defendants were using SML’s resources to pay for their own personal expenditure (such as the building works I have already described).  He accepted that the figure of £650,000 was mentioned, but not at this meeting; it was only mentioned much later on in the context of a mediation after employment tribunal proceedings had been issued. </p>

There were times during the course of Pauline’s evidence when she was quite clearly confused about important matters, but this meeting quite evidently made a significant impact on her and the way that she expressed herself about it carried conviction.  It is also consistent with the fact that the likely purpose of the meeting from Mr Randall’s point of view was to try and achieve a result without having to commence the employment tribunal proceedings which he was on the point of issuing, and in which he was making serious whistleblowing allegations against SML.  This was one of the occasions on which I was left with the impression that he was trying to play down the way in which he expressed himself at the time in order to bolster SML’s case.  As Ms Anderson QC explored with him in cross-examination, the impression which he sought to convey in his oral evidence was not reflected by (or a complete reflection of) the way in which Mr Randall described the meeting in the employment tribunal proceedings which he subsequently issued. </p>

I do not accept that this figure only emerged much later as an amount that he was advised by Slater &amp; Gordon was the kind of figure he should be looking for in a mediation.  Come what may, I think that Mr Randall made quite clear to Pauline that he was expecting a pay-off of very substantially more than the £150,000 which I am satisfied that Pauline offered to pay him. </p>

Peter said that Mario called to say that SML simply needed to get rid of him, and I accept his evidence on this point.

Even if Peter had not volunteered information about the progress of what was happening, it was sufficiently significant to the future of SML’s business and to the reputations of the original shareholders (as well as the younger generations of the family) that I am sure that Mario and Pauline would have ensured that they kept abreast of developments. </p>

The evidence was not very precise as to the chronology, but Peter, Sammy, Pauline and Mario all agreed that SML needed to try and do a deal with Mr Randall.

A few days later, Mr Randall’s lawyers came back with another proposal which led to SML reiterating its £300,000 offer, which Peter says was again discussed with and agreed by Pauline and Mario, although there was disagreement from Mr Smith and Mr Heyes that this was the right thing to do.  In the end a settlement was reached with Mr Randall for a staged payment of £300,000 (£150,000 within 28 days and £150,000 in 12 monthly instalments). </p>

Mario said by this point that he had ‘<span style="font-style:italic">no choice</span>’ but to agree it because the amount had already been agreed.  I am sure that Mario thought that £300,000 was far too much money, but I do not think that he said that £300,000 should not be agreed.

I also have little doubt that one of the reasons why everyone wanted it closed down was because of the nature of the allegations that were being made by Mr Randall.  Everyone in the family was well aware of what those allegations were, and that they included allegations of impropriety and fraud.

This payment was heavily criticised by SML, and I shall return to it when dealing with agreed issue 2 as it relates to payments to Kombbi.  For present purposes it suffices to say that there was no specific documentary evidence about the role which Mr Smith played in the proceedings brought by Mr Randall, and as will appear I have concluded that the payment to him which was made in July 2016 was wholly unjustified. </p>

At this stage Mario thought that the WX Hub was probably worth about £10 million and the two nurseries were worth between £7 and 8 million.  It seems to have been anticipated that the rental income for SML would have been somewhere in the region of £1.2 million per year. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was disagreement about whether a second option was also discussed at that meeting: to sell Fen Drayton and rent out the WX Hub and Waltham Abbey to the newcos, clearing off some or all of the debt from the sale of Fen Drayton.  Mario had no recollection of any discussion of the second option, perhaps because it had always been his position that he did not want any of the property assets to be sold.  Nonetheless I think that the point was probably raised although it was not front and centre of the discussion. </p>

At this stage, however, Mario seems to have thought that SFP, the company that was going to rent the WX Hub, was a company owned by SML and this was an important aspect of both his approach and his reaction to what he was told by Peter and Mr Smith.  I did not understand there to be any challenge to what followed from that, namely that he did not then know of the steps taken to activate SFP that I have described above. </p>

On the SML side, the meeting was attended by the Director Defendants, Salvi and Mr Heyes, the latter of whom was fulfilling some of the functions of a finance director.  In preparation for the meeting, Mr Heyes had put together some figures which presupposed that SFP, SGP and LPL, the entity which was to acquire CET, would be trading going forward with SGP paying rent for its occupation of the Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey nurseries.  It is apparent from Mr Heyes’ evidence that two aspects of the proposed restructuring were by then becoming clearer.  The first was that all of the new companies were to be owned and controlled by the Director Defendants and Salvi.  The second was that it was being proposed by Mr Smith that the WX Hub would be acquired by SFP from SML on the basis that it had an assumed value of £8.6 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add that there is some evidence that Peter at least had been contemplating the acquisition of the WX Hub from some time earlier in the summer of 2015 and possibly for no more than £6 million.  However, although SML had originally contended that this was at the time of the July meeting with Pauline and Mario, the evidence on the point was inconclusive and I am not satisfied that the manuscript note, which appears to evidence that this was a possibility that Peter wanted to investigate, dates from then. At the same time the Director Defendants were being advised by Quintons that the market rental value for Fen Drayton was £457,600 per annum, but that it could be marketed for rather more (they suggested £475,000 for the glasshouse and £57,600 for the hostel accommodation).  It is not clear precisely when this valuation was received, although it was dated 9 October 2015.  There is no evidence that it was provided to the shareholders, and Peter’s evidence seemed to confirm that it was not. </p>

The proposed CHP deal (also called the energy deal or the PUG deal) was discussed at an important shareholders’ meeting in November after which agreement in principle was concluded, and I shall describe its terms at that stage in the chronology.  The deal also features quite heavily in the dispute about the terms of the Transaction and I shall return to it in that context as well.  For present purpose what matters is that the proposal would generate an upfront payment of £3.5 million from the sale and leaseback of the CHP engines but there would then be a premium payable on future energy costs.  Mr Heyes proposed that part of the proceeds would be used to purchase the WX Hub and part would be used as business development capital. Barclays indicated that, as they were part of its security, it would expect the proceeds to be used to pay down the existing debt. </p>

On the trading side he told Barclays that SML’s borrowing requirements for the winter would not exceed the current £3.5 million limit, but Mr Pickford was concerned that Mr Heyes did not seem to have a proper grasp of the numbers and raised the issue of the failure to supply management accounts in a timely manner.  Mr Pickford was also concerned about the proposal that was put to them for a structure which contemplated that SML would retain the nurseries on a debt-free basis with the debt being transferred from SML to SFP.  The problem from his perspective was that this would reduce Barclays’ security position by a significant amount (he estimated from £30 million to £15 million) and he was not prepared to recommend this where there was what he described as no visibility of the current trading of SFP. </p>

In summary their concerns were the increasing cash flow pressure and trading losses with a consequential increase in the overdraft requirement, the breach in financial covenants, a need to strengthen the financial function in the absence of a financial controller (Mr Randall), the lack of management information and cashflow forecasts and the age of Barclays’ security valuations for Waltham Abbey, Fen Drayton and the WX Hub.

This was fleshed out further in a phone call between Peter and Mr Pickford the following day when Mr Pickford said that he thought that Mr Heyes’ advice was quite aggressive, that it was very important for the CHP energy deal to be done to plug the cash requirement (although he did not think that the cash on offer would be sufficient) and he expressed concern about what SML would be losing once SFP started trading and the impact which the split might have on the financial covenants that Barclays had from SML.  In short, as he said in his oral evidence, the business was unable to articulate how and whether it would become profitable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Notwithstanding these concerns about the structure going forward, Mr Pickford disagreed with the suggestion that Barclays was pretty pessimistic and unhappy with the proposals.  As Mr Pickford explained in his evidence “<span style="font-style:italic">This was a longstanding Barclays client with 40 years’ standing, well-secured, we would have no reason to not support but needed to understand how it worked to be able to work up a new funding strategy</span>.”  This is consistent with the way in which Barclays continued to support the business while the proposals were being developed.  Thus, shortly after the meeting it confirmed an extension of the £3.5 million working capital overdraft facility for another month on the basis that it would then be reduced at the beginning of December. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">One aspect of what was going on was not, however, discussed with Barclays at this stage.  From the beginning of October, the Director Defendants and Salvi had started to trade through SFP, operating an account with Barclays that had been opened in September in SFP’s name.  This trade was also reflected in VAT returns for SFP showing sales for the 3 months ending 31 December 2015 totalling £1.63 million and sales for the 3 months ending 31 March 2016 totalling £2.22 million.  The fact that this was happening is central to one of the agreed issues to which I will return later in this judgment and I will deal with its full significance at that stage.  Initially SML, through evidence from Mr Randall, contended that it had suffered losses from the misappropriation of stock worth £126,237 and the diversion of contracts which were profitable to the tune of £457,036 during the six-month period up to the completion of the APA.  That claim has now been refined, and totals £236,196.97. </p>

Peter told Mr Pickford that the trade reflected by this activity was new business won by SPL and did not relate to SML’s customers, but Peter and Sammy have both admitted that the reason they started trading through SFP was to put assets outside the Barclays security envelope at a time when the business was under very significant cash flow pressure and Peter accepted that he did not tell Barclays at the time the trade started.  Although Peter said that he thought this was a commercially proper thing to do, I have difficulty in understanding how he can have thought that was the case.

Thus, Mario wondered whether SML was able to get more supermarket business, a suggestion that was treated with astonishment by Sammy (he said “<span style="font-style:italic">are you having a laugh</span>”).  I cannot resolve this divergence in view about the most sensible way forward for the operational aspects of the business towards the end of 2015, but what matters for present purposes is that the differences between Mario and the Director Defendants both existed and were known to each other to exist.  Indeed the Director Defendants had always known that Mario was very unhappy with the move away from growing and selling to supermarkets, and their appreciation of that fact may go some way to explaining why they were not as forthcoming as they should have been in explaining to the other shareholders the background to and the true nature and extent of their proposals.  In my view, they should in fact have taken the opposite approach – the more that they knew about Mario’s unhappiness with their proposals, the more forthcoming and open they should have been about the detail of what they proposed to do. </p>

She was clearly very concerned that SML was in serious difficulties and that Barclays was not giving the support that she expected. However, in the light of subsequent events, it is relevant that this meeting did not approve a move from Barclays to another bank.  Despite Pauline’s view, no decision to move SML’s business from Barclays was made by the meeting, nor were the Director Defendants and Salvi authorised to move banks if that was what they decided to do.  The only decision was to present to other banks in order to solicit alternative funding and, although there was considerable dissatisfaction with Barclays, there is no reason to think that the shareholders other than the Director Defendants were left with the impression that a move from Barclays would take place come what may. </p>

In his witness statement Mario said that the position of CET was discussed and that he was told by Wayne and Peter that it (as well as SML) was in a bad situation.  In cross-examination Mario insisted that CET was never mentioned despite what he said in his witness statement.  I think that he was wrong, and I am satisfied that CET was discussed, although I accept that it was not a major part of the discussion, which is why Mario may not have remembered.  His insistence in cross-examination that it was not, may have been driven by the fact that he remembered (correctly) that CET was not subject to the same financial pressures as SML. </p>

Likewise, I think he was wrong to say that there was no mention of the proposal that part of the WX Hub purchase consideration might be deferred.  I think it is unlikely that the figures for the amount of the proceeds of the energy deal that would come to the shareholders were discussed in any detail, not least because the Director Defendants probably did not know the precise figures themselves.  I also think it is unlikely that anything was said about the amount of the purchase price that would be deferred or the nature of any loan notes that were then under consideration.  I am satisfied, however, that both issues were mentioned at the meeting as part of the existing restructuring proposal, but they were only mentioned in outline terms. </p>

Peter did not agree that this had not been said, but I think that Sammy is right on this point.  This was the meeting after which the process which led to the Transaction really started, but Mario said that he would have to think about it and talk to Tony and I do not think that he was fully reconciled to the plans which had been being developed by the Director Defendants and Salvi, and I think that they must have known that was the case.   </p>

This proposal was made to SFP, not to SML, but Peter and Sammy both said that the proposal always was that if the deal went ahead SML would be getting £1.5 million from the deal and £1.85 million would go to SFP, reflecting the 12% increase in the wholesale price of the gas payable over 15 years.  In economic terms, SFP would gain a cash flow benefit, as the £1.85 million was received immediately in compensation for which PUG received a 12% uplift in the price of the gas it supplied over a 15-year period.  The terms of this deal were subsequently heavily criticised by Mario on the basis that the receipt of cash up front by SFP left SML very vulnerable to paying for gas at 12% for a long time into the future, in the event that SFP was no longer able to pay. </p>

Barclays had a long-standing relationship and knew quite a lot about the business.  It was in a better position to probe, which Mr Pickford seems to have done, in some large part because he was unhappy with the quality of the figures which had been produced.

He said that he and Mr Copson were still continuing to look into how they could best support SML by obtaining the funds required to cover the maximum exposure figures that were now being forecast by the directors.

This was a reference to the fact that SFP had been trading as a separate legal entity since the beginning of October.  Mr Heyes sought to play down its significance because of the extent of Barclays’ fixed asset security cover, but Mr Pickford was obviously concerned that SML was being deprived of liquidity by this and that it would have been much more appropriate for some form of cross-guarantee structure to be put in place.

It is clear that HSBC was trying to take on the Stubbins business, while Barclays was continuing to apply pressure on SML to reduce its overdraft and was treating the energy deal as pivotal to SML’s cash requirements.  In particular Mr Pickford could not understand how those cash requirements were going to be satisfied unless agreement was reached with PUG in short order.  He was also looking for BDO or FRP Advisory to be instructed to report on SML’s financials and forecasts, which eventually led to BDO’s production of a limited scope cash flow review on 23 February 2016.  Mr Pickford also told SML that Barclays needed a valuation of the property assets to be carried out and in the event Bidwells were appointed. </p>

Mr Pickford was pressed in cross-examination on how supportive Barclays was actually being but was clear that the short overdraft extensions were a deliberate policy which was not inconsistent with long term support.  I accept his evidence when he said: “<span style="font-style:italic">The bank’s policy, or strategy, at this time was to mark the limit forward in short, monthly breaks so that we had a continued dialogue with the directors of the business</span>”.

The proposal was for a £6 million 10-year loan and a £500,000 overdraft secured on the WX Hub and a security package from SFP and SGP, leaving SML outside the security envelope.  It was a term of the loan that the deferred element of the consideration for SFP’s purchase of the WX Hub from SML was to be formally deferred behind HSBC for a period of 5 years (although Paul Tarn of HSBC indicated that there might be some room for negotiation on the timing).  There was some evidence that Mr Smith, although chairman and a director of SML, was pleased with the prudence shown by HSBC in requiring a 5-year deferral on payment of the balance outstanding to SML after discharge of the existing indebtedness to Barclays.  I agree with SML’s submission that this demonstrated a clear focus on the benefit to SFP and SGP going forward (which was all that HSBC was likely to be interested in) rather than in ensuring that SML received full value for the assets to be transferred.  </p>

However, the Director Defendants had a meeting with Barclays on 5 January, which Mr Pickford explained was for the purpose of introducing them to Mark Andrews and Tony Nygate of BDO and to agree the scope of their report.

On one level that is correct and there is some evidence that Sammy was under considerable pressure from creditors seeking payment.  Barclays was not, however, making any threats to foreclose or place SML in administration.

Peter said in his evidence that this was simply a case of managing the situation.  I do not agree.  In my judgment it was part of a deliberate policy of minimising the information flow to Barclays while waiting for the HSBC proposal to be formalised, an approach that was effectively admitted by Mr Heyes in an e-mail to the Director Defendants: “<span style="font-style:italic">We can send December numbers.

That is certainly true in the sense that there was no formal facility letter prepared, but I do not agree that this was an indication that Barclays was not serious about its proposal, subject to the conditions on Mr Cassell’s “shopping list”.  I think that it was, and I think that the Director Defendants knew that the facility would be forthcoming if the other conditions were satisfied.  The real point was that Barclays was not supportive of the proposed restructuring going ahead at that stage, and this was a deal-breaker for the Director Defendants so long as they could find some other source of funding (such as HSBC) which was prepared to support what they wanted to do.  The failure to explain this to the shareholders (and to Mario in particular) is one of the issues that is at the root of the claim made in these proceedings. </p>

However, I do not think that that is what they genuinely believed, because they did not think that Barclays had bought into their proposed restructuring and it is plain that they did not regard any proposal from Barclays as a long-term solution.

There was no note of the meeting and so what occurred is dependent on the recollections of Mario, Peter and Sammy who gave evidence about what was said.  Mario accepted that the purpose of the meeting was for him and Pauline to be updated on the discussions with Barclays and said that they were told that Barclays had (in Mario’s words) “<span style="font-style:italic">put a lot of restrictions</span>” onto SML including “<span style="font-style:italic">putting an accountant</span>” into SML.  Sammy, who gave a more detailed account of this meeting in his witness statement than Peter, said that Mario was angry with Mr Smith, and seems to have taken the view that Mr Smith had not done enough to keep Barclays on side.  Sammy also said that they told Mario and Pauline that the £3.9 million overdraft was only on offer for another two weeks until the end of the month. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mario agreed that he and Pauline were told that the situation was very serious, in response to which his position was that SML could not go into administration after 40 years of trading.  The core of Mario’s complaint is that they were not told by the Director Defendants that Barclays was willing to lend £5.1 million on terms, nor were they given a full explanation of the recent correspondence.  He said that the substance of what they were told was that “<span style="font-style:italic">we will be bankrupt</span>” because Barclays had said that they would put SML into administration.  Furthermore, Mario was quite clear that, although he was told that the situation was very serious, there was no agreement by the shareholders to switch SML’s banking to HSBC.  I am satisfied that there was a conversation about the possibility of administration at this meeting.  I think that it is improbable that anybody said that a specific threat had been made by Barclays to put SML into administration, but I am also satisfied that the Director Defendants deliberately left Mario with the impression that they believed that Barclays was prepared to do so.  </p>

The discussion was all about how Mr Smith was going to try and get Barclays to extend the temporary £3.9 million overdraft.  Peter and Sammy said that it was agreed at the end of the discussion that another meeting was required with all of the senior shareholders present, i.e. including Tony.  That meeting eventually took place on 9 March in circumstances to which I will come shortly, although even then not all of the shareholders were invited or attended. </p>

In my view, the silence of the Director Defendants on this point was motivated by their desire to minimise the chances of anything getting in the way of the restructuring that they had decided was the best way forward for the future of the business.  It was not suggested by the Director Defendants in closing that the valuation figure for the WX Hub which Sammy had received from Bidwells the day before was disclosed to Mario and Pauline at this meeting and it is clear that it was not.   </p>

It was described as a limited scope Financial Due Diligence Review for HSBC.  A few days later, on 23 February, the BDO report, prepared by Mr Nygate for Barclays, SML and CET, was completed.  Amongst other matters it expressed the view that Barclays should only agree to the proceeds of the energy deal being used to reduce the borrowing: this of course meant that it could not be used as working capital going forward nor could it be made available to the shareholders (whether through SML or otherwise).  Although it forecast a return to profit in April, which was an important conclusion, I agree with Ms Anderson QC’s description of the report as very lukewarm and cautious, and it expresses some doubts over the integrity and reliability of the cash flow forecasts. </p>

He said that “<span style="font-style:italic">Barclays is looking to support the business with an increased overdraft facility to £5.1m until 1 June 2016”</span> at which stage it would reduce again to £3.5m, but that Barclays “<span style="font-style:italic">would be looking at longer term facilities, once the full business review is complete</span>”.  This e-mail was followed up the same day with an e-mail from Mr Pickford to Mr Smith which made clear that the only two conditions for the £5.1 million facility would be a cross-guarantee and debenture and the employment by SML of turnaround assistance.  He confirmed that the increase in the overdraft was in response to the recommendation made by BDO and also that Barclays thought (with the benefit of the advice from BDO) that this would be sufficient to tide SML over the existing cash flow crisis.  As he put it: “<span style="font-style:italic">The additional overdraft limit should provide sufficient leeway within the business and alleviate cash pressure</span>.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Barclays also made clear that, although it was not yet ready to support the proposed restructuring and in particular was concerned that the original shareholders “<span style="font-style:italic">need their own legal advice as the transition needs to be handled as professionally and sensitively as possible</span>” in which context he referred to the “<span style="font-style:italic">£25 m of balance sheet assets to be carved up”</span>, it was certainly not ruled out in the longer term.  Its position was not inconsistent with the fact that Barclays remained willing to continue to support SML while a full examination of the restructuring was carried out.  While the Director Defendants cannot have assumed on the basis of this correspondence that Barclays would certainly continue to support the business while it stabilised, I think that the bank was giving every indication that it wanted to do so if it could.  I also think that the Director Defendants knew that this was the case.  As Mr Smith put it in an e-mail to Peter, Sammy and Mr Heyes on 1 March: “<span style="font-style:italic">Barclays are now all over me trying to tie us in, it’s almost a bit awkward / embarrassing at points</span>". </p>

At one stage there was some doubt as to the electronic version of the valuation for the WX Hub because it does not seem to have been enclosed with the same e-mail as the valuations for Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey, and in one part of her closing submissions Ms Anderson QC seemed to have been submitting that the WX Hub valuation was only ever sent to the Director Defendants in hard copy on 16 March.  I do not think that is right.  Sammy made clear in his witness statements that all three valuations were received by him in electronic form on 1 March, and he then explained in oral evidence that they had to be sent to his private e-mail and were printed out from that because SML’s server could not deal with the size of the enclosures. </p>

Sammy’s evidence on the point was muddled and inconclusive.  In his witness statement he said “<span style="font-style:italic">I recall that we printed these and gave them to Mario, although I cannot recall exactly when that was</span>.”  In cross-examination he said that what he meant by giving them to Mario was not that he actually physically gave them to him, but that he “<span style="font-style:italic">would have put it in the office</span>”.  He could not however remember if he drew them to his attention.  Despite not saying in his witness statement when he had given them to Mario, he said in his oral evidence that he was “<span style="font-style:italic">sure</span>” that they had been given (in the sense described above) that day. </p>

In his witness statement he simply said that, after the valuations for the nurseries (i.e. Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey) had been received on 1 March: “<span style="font-style:italic">I spoke to mum and Mario and told them what the report said the valuation numbers from Bidwells</span>” – this was a reference only to the valuations for the nurseries, not the WX Hub.  In cross-examination he went further in relation to the WX Hub.  His evidence was that the valuation for the WX Hub came through first and that he revealed to Mario what the valuation had been, although he did not say that Mario ever saw the valuation itself. </p>

This would be consistent with the fact that the way in which Mario was cross-examined about this by Ms Anderson QC was that Peter had discussed the valuation with him on 24 February, when he and Mario were looking at the Land Registry entries for some of the sites, i.e. at a time before the formal valuations were received on 1 March.  In the event, however, Peter’s own evidence did not clarify this aspect of the case.  </p>

I accept this evidence.  He was clear and consistent in his denials on this point and there is not a single piece of contemporaneous documentation which demonstrates or evidences that he saw the valuation for the WX Hub before the Transaction completed or when he did so.  This includes the fact that there is no reference in any of the notes of subsequent meetings to the fact that, although the price for the WX Hub to be sold by SML under the proposed Transaction was £10 million, its actual value was materially more.  In my view, it is inevitable that it would have been raised, explained and recorded if Mario had been aware of the difference. </p>

In my view that slightly misses the point, and not just because there is no evidence that any of those professionals did in fact discuss the difference with Mario or the other shareholders.  I think that the Director Defendants’ position on this was consistent with their general approach to information disclosure, which was to drip feed material facts as and when they felt that they had to, but reducing to a minimum the information that they made available to the other shareholders in order to maximise the prospects of their restructuring proposal getting through.  Even if they recognised that unhelpful material might come out, that did not mean that they were going to volunteer it unless it was necessary to do so.  Some of this general attitude was also revealed in the approach that they took to keeping Barclays warm while going all out to conclude a funding deal with HSBC. </p>

They also thought that this was the only sensible way forward and that the strategy contemplated by what was on the table from Barclays would not lead to the long-term survival of the business unless there was an immediate restructuring which Barclays was not at that stage prepared to support.  As Ms Anderson QC put it in a question to Mr Pickford with which he agreed “<span style="font-style:italic">In stark terms, the position was this: HSBC was prepared to fund the new strategy, and on terms that were more favourable viewed as a package, and Barclays was not</span>”.  This vision of the future was not, however, a vision which was shared by Mario with the benefit of the same information that was available to the Director Defendants, nor is there any evidence that it was shared by other members of the family who had not been involved in the negotiations with the banks on a fully informed basis. </p>

SML’s communication of its decision to switch immediately pre-dated a meeting which was attended by a number of shareholders including Mario, but there was never a satisfactory explanation as to why the decision was communicated to Barclays before that meeting was held.  It was said on behalf of the Director Defendants that nothing turned on the point, but in my judgment a great deal does, because it enabled the Director Defendants to give the impression that the impetus for the withdrawal of banking support was Barclays itself not SML’s decision to proceed with HSBC’s funding offer.  It is also striking that Peter told Mr Pickford that there had been a family meeting the previous week and that “<span style="font-style:italic">Based on the wishes of the family, we will now be switching our banking to HSBC</span>”.  This was untrue because the previous family meeting had been on 16 February (not the previous week) and no decision to go with HSBC was made at that stage.

Mario said that the other shareholders (including in particular his children) were not invited and that, so far as he was aware, they did not know about it.  It was said that one of the main purposes of the meeting was to ensure that Tony was brought up to date with what had been happening as he had not had any direct involvement in any of the recent discussions either about the proposed restructuring or about SML’s financial condition, nor had he been present at the meetings held on 9 November 2015 or 16 February 2016. </p>

As Mr Heyes put it in an e-mail he wrote to Mr Cassell and Mr Pickford in which he referred to the decision that had been communicated to them by Peter the day before: “… <span style="font-style:italic">the family have reached the decision to refinance with HSBC through [SFP], as part of the ongoing turnaround and business development process in order to take the business forward under the new commercial structure. … We have a Board / Shareholders meeting this afternoon at which everything will be confirmed and a timeline of two weeks to 22 March to complete the legal agreements</span>.”  As with what Peter had said the day before, this was not a very accurate way of putting the position, because it is plain that the Director Defendants were some way from getting all of the shareholders on board with what they wanted to do. </p>

The note of the meeting recorded that Mr Heyes said that Barclays had confirmed that they would not lend any more money and would “<span style="font-style:italic">pull the plug on SML by the end of the month</span>”.  Mr Heyes did not accept that he put it in quite those words, but he accepted that the meeting was told that if they did not go along with the MBO, Barclays would appoint administrators and they would lose everything.  It was said that on a fire sale the family would be left with just £6 million.  Pauline gave evidence that she remembered that Mr Heyes said words to the effect of Barclays pulling the plug and that the meeting was told that SML really had its back to the wall because Barclays was not interested.

I am also satisfied that as part of the process of persuading them that this was the right way forward the Director Defendants set out to leave the impression that it was inevitable that SML would be driven into administration at the end of the month if their proposed restructuring funded by HSBC did not go ahead, because that is what had been threatened.

Thus, the evidence is that this meeting was not told about the Bidwells valuations generally, nor more specifically that the valuation of the WX Hub had come in at £11.45 million.  It was not recorded in the note of the meeting and the upshot of Sammy’s rather hesitant evidence on the point was that he did not think that the valuation itself was even mentioned.  Although Peter says that he remembers telling Mario and Pauline about the figure, he did not remember telling the other shareholders, so even on his own case it is improbable that there was any mention of this on 9 March because Tony, John and Spider Sam were also present at this meeting.  As I have already mentioned Mr Heyes confirmed that the note of the meeting prepared by Sammy was correct in general terms.  He also said that if it had been discussed he thinks that it would have been mentioned in the note and I agree.  I am sure that if this point had been raised or discussed it would have been recorded in the note, which it was not. </p>

As to the issue of deferred consideration more generally, I have already explained that I think that this was discussed in outline at the meeting on 9 November 2015, but I do not accept that any figures were given or discussed either then or at the meeting on 9 March 2016, and there is no real evidence that they were.  It certainly does not appear that the shareholders were told at this stage that the unpaid element would be deferred for 5 years and would be payable behind HSBC, both of which were aspects of the HSBC deal of which each of the Director Defendants was well aware. </p>

In particular, they did not know that the change from Barclays had already been initiated by the Director Defendants nor did they know Barclays’ real attitude to funding SML going forward.  They did not know of the differences between the valuations proposed to be used for some of the assets and their likely open market values and at that stage they did not know all of the figures to be included in the Transaction or the precise form that it would take. </p>

This was followed up with a written management buy-out summary prepared by Mr Heyes in which he explained that in simple terms SFP had obtained financing from HSBC in the form of a £6 million loan and a £500,000 overdraft to acquire the trade of SML and the WX Hub and for LPL to acquire the shares in CET.  The summary was worked up with the assistance of Mr Smith and to a lesser extent Peter and Sammy.

As I have already mentioned, although I am sure that Salvi knew that the true value of the WX Hub was more than £11 million I do not accept the underlying submission.  My assessment of what was going on was that the Director Defendants knew that this type of detail might be revealed, and were prepared to tough it out if it was by stressing the absence of any alternative options, but they had no desire to be full and frank with the other shareholders by presenting any more detail on the development of the terms of the Transaction than was absolutely necessary. </p>

Initially he stood by this explanation and asserted that he thought that the earlier valuation may have been a couple of years earlier although he accepted that he had not checked before signing his statement.  However, during the course of his oral evidence it transpired that the earlier valuation can only have been one carried out by Glenny LLP in July 2008 (i.e. 7½ years earlier) which valued the WX Hub at £9.2 million (not £8.6 million).  This length of time and the proportions: £9.2m / £10m and £10 / £11.45m makes this explanation for picking £10m as an appropriate figure very difficult to support.  The £8.6 million seems to have derived from the discussions in October 2015 which I have already described. </p>

This e-mail was the first occasion on which the suggestion had been made that a split between the two valuations might justify a £10 million valuation, and although Mr Heyes thought that it might have been mentioned earlier, he agreed that this approach to valuation was not to his knowledge discussed with the SML shareholders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This leads me on to the first part of the allegation in the Director Defendants’ pleadings as to how the £10 million figure was reached, i.e. the fact that there was an agreement between the SML shareholders.  In one sense this is consistent with the explanation Mr Heyes gave to V&amp;S in his management buy-out summary where he referred to “<span style="font-style:italic">an agreed £10m</span>”, but there is no documentary evidence for any such agreement having been reached and Peter who was also cross-examined on the point was unable to explain why it was that there was no record of Pauline and Mario being told about the reason for picking £10 million any more than he could explain why it was that there was no record of Mario being provided with a copy of Bidwells’ £11.45 million valuation.  Indeed, the absence of any documentation in relation to either point strengthens the conclusion that I am unable to accept his evidence in relation to both. </p>

There was nothing capable of amounting to a proper “<span style="font-style:italic">estimated valuation</span>” at £10 million, and the exercise that is now advanced as the averaging process pleaded in the Defence was not one that was carried out at the time.  It was only carried out subsequently and then in the context of trying to put forward what might justify a fair value for tax purposes, not as a reflection of what the Director Defendants thought that its real market value might be.  In my judgment the real explanation is relatively simple.  £10 million had been the value for the WX Hub that HSBC were seeking, and the true market value was too high to make the figures work on the back of the HSBC funding offer.  As Mr Roe QC suggested in his cross-examination of Peter the £10 million was “<span style="font-style:italic">just worked out by reference to what HSBC could lend</span>”.  Peter had no credible answer to that suggestion and all of the evidence points to it being true. </p>

She was an Italian-speaking private client lawyer who came from Mario’s own village in Sicily and had helped various members of the family for some time on a number of different matters.  A meeting was arranged for 14 March at Mario’s home which was attended by all three of the original shareholders and the four members of the family who were also directors: Peter, Sammy, Salvi and Spider Sam.  At this meeting Ms Lever was told that “<span style="font-style:italic">Barclays seem to want to foreclose on them, but HSBC have come to the rescue</span>”. She gave a concise summary of the structure and the proposals including the fact that the new businesses would be owned by the younger generation but that the land would be retained by the older generation “<span style="font-style:italic">so that at least they will have some income during their old age</span>”.  She told the original shareholders that she was not a commercial lawyer but would do the best that she could to assist the family and that she would focus on looking after the interests of the older generation.  The information that her note shows that she was given about Barclays wanting to foreclose on SML was consistent with what Mario said he had been told by the Director Defendants at the 9 March meeting. </p>

At that meeting Mr Moffat agreed to assist with the drafting of the documentation for the Transaction.  He was told that the timescale for what he understood to be a management buy-out funded by HSBC was very tight and that their existing solicitors, V&amp;S, were not in a position to do the work required because of holiday commitments.

The first was the short timescale and the fact that Mr Goldsmith was about to go on holiday, but the second was that he (Mr Thompson) was concerned about the instruction to include an overage arrangement based on a value of £11.45 million when the purchase price for the WX Hub under the terms of the APA was to be £10 million.  He did not wish to be part of an agreement which appeared to be depriving the SML shareholders of overage (at 30%) on the difference between £10 million and £11.45 million.  He said that Peter removed the instruction when he made this clear.  In the absence of any challenge by the Director Defendants there is no reason to think that this evidence is not accurate. </p>

In particular, he was instructed that the WX Hub was to be sold to SFP for £10 million, that the non-produce trade, related assets and liabilities were to be sold to SFP for a nominal figure (initially zero but changed to £1) and the produce trade, related assets and liabilities were to be sold to SGP for the same nominal £1.  He said in his evidence that he did not think that he ever saw the Bidwells valuation.  There is no reason to think that he was mistaken about that. </p>

His initial understanding was that she had been instructed by all of the shareholders of SML, but she subsequently clarified that she was acting for the original shareholders only.  Later the same day Mr Heyes sent to Mr Moffat a summary of the financial position for both SFP/SGP/LPL on the one hand and SML/CET on the other.  Mr Heyes made clear that the purpose of sending the summary to Mr Moffat at this stage was to forearm him with the figures for a meeting that he was to have with Ms Lever the following day.

She recorded as well that it was designed to facilitate the transfer of the businesses to the next generation, which was a good thing from a family perspective, albeit for a largely deferred consideration which the SML shareholders would not see for some time.

He was concerned that, once the leases came to an end, SML would have 10 years during which it would be burdened with the obligation to pay for gas at an inflated price in circumstances in which most of the up-front benefit of doing the deal in the first place had gone to SFP not SML.  The fact that this issue was only being raised at this late stage is reflective of the Director Defendants’ drip-feed approach to the provision of information which I have already mentioned. </p>

The difficulty with that submission is that it is based on words which do not quite reflect what Mario said.  What he in fact said was that he wrote it with the help of Mr Smith.  It is also of note that he does not say that he now thinks that the restructuring is a good idea – what he says is that in the light of what he now understands, he is happy to proceed.  That is not that same thing.  In my judgment what actually happened was that Mario was persuaded to send this e- mail by what he was told of the attitude of Barclays in relation to continuing support for SML.  All of those present took part in this but the insistence on the need to go ahead with the restructuring came particularly from Peter and Mr Smith because they were at the forefront of its design and development.  I also think that Peter’s evidence is accurate in the sense and to the extent that the e-mail was probably actually typed in by Salvi, but I think that it is likely that Mr Smith and Peter had a fair bit of input in what it needed to say. </p>

The way that Mr Heyes described what he had been told by Peter and Mr Smith (“<span style="font-style:italic">I recall discussing this with Peter and Wayne later, and that they said they had met with Mario on the evening of 23 March 2016 and allayed Mario’s concerns</span>”) reflected what Mr Heyes was told by them, but it rather missed the point of what Mario had said.  It was not that his concerns had been allayed.  It was simply that he found himself in a position where he decided, based on what he had been told by Peter and Mr Smith, that there was no other option. </p>

None of the professionals shared that expectation, however, and Mr Moffat made clear at the outset that he was only instructed by the purchasing companies (SFP and SGP), not by the existing shareholders.  He explained that he understood that the shareholders had been assembled together for the purposes of signing the documents in escrow with the intention of completing the documents on the following Thursday (31 March).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems that Antony was taken by surprise by the terms of the Transaction because it was much worse than the deal which his father had briefly described to him before the meeting.  Expressing himself in very forceful terms, he made clear that he had no confidence in the ability of the new businesses to generate sufficient cash to pay off the deferred consideration.  He criticised Peter and Sammy (and I think Salvi as well) for having run SML’s business at a loss for the last 5 years and Mr Smith for not turning it around and said that his questions needed answering before he would sign anything.  Although he did not put it this way in the meeting, he said in his evidence that he did not understand why the Director Defendants and Salvi could not have negotiated a similar funding deal for SML to the deal which they had negotiated for SFP and SGP.  He said though that he would listen to Mario, Pauline and Tony. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In response to this outburst from Antony, who by this time was dominating the meeting, Pauline said that “<span style="font-style:italic">If you don’t close this deal we fucking lost Stubbins</span>”, a colourful turn of phrase which reflected the heated nature of what was going on.  Mr Moffat then intervened in an apparent attempt to explain what he understood to be the realities of the situation and said “<span style="font-style:italic">Can I just point out one thing Barclays bank have said they’re going to foreclose on the businesses at the end of this month, and pull the plug, if they do that the likelihood is that you will lose almost everything</span>.”  Mr Moffat then said that the employees would be unemployed, nothing would be preserved for the old family and that this deal was the only way that the shareholders were going to come out with some assets behind them “<span style="font-style:italic">If it doesn’t happen on Thursday, you are going to lose the lot</span>.”  Neither Peter, nor Sammy nor Salvi intervened to qualify or contradict what Mr Moffat said about the attitude of Barclays, and none of them explained either that Barclays had made no actual threat to foreclose or that it was the Director Defendants’ and Salvi’s decision to stop banking with Barclays which had led to the need to repay the overdraft at the end of the month or that an alternative offer from Barclays (albeit one which did not support the proposed restructuring at this stage) had been on the table. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At this stage in the meeting, Peter and Sammy said that the shareholders (and I think that this was particularly directed at Antony) had a choice, but the only choice was between the deal that was on the table and closing the business tomorrow.  Antony then referred to the fact that he had the possibility of alternative funding of £3 million to clear the overdraft, a reference to the fact that he had had an outline discussion with the father of his partner, who was a successful businessman and might have been prepared to assist with an alternative funding structure.  Peter closed off that line of enquiry making plain that £8.6 million was required.  It may well have been the case that there was no real prospect of this alternative source of funding being productive at this stage, but the way that the discussion went made it apparent that Peter for one was not prepared to consider anything other than the deal which was on the table. </p>

For the most part the position was described by Mr Wilson Smith, who had come into the meeting part way through, and gave evidence that when he did so he found the atmosphere to be quite hostile.  He used a number of phrases all of which were allowed to pass without comment by Peter, Sammy and Salvi and which would therefore have been taken by the remaining attendees as an accurate reflection of the true position. </p>

He then emphasised the adverse impact on market confidence if word were to get out about SML’s potential inability to perform on its contracts and in that context said “ …<span style="font-style:italic"> and Barclays have made their position very clear that they’re not interested, they don’t want to get involved in the re-financing, they don’t want to get involved in the re-packaging of the business</span>.”  He then made the same point again, albeit in slightly different words towards the end of the meeting: “<span style="font-style:italic">that Barclays just, not so much that they are pulling the plug, they are just not extending, they got to the point where they’ve said its never going to turn round, we don’t even want to hear the story, just find another bank.”</span></p>

He then asked for her to obtain the necessary authority to use the signatures of the shareholders on the Transaction documents but was told that he needed to liaise with Mr Harrison.   Rather more generally the solicitors do not seem to have been kept up to date with what was going on in the family.  In particular it was not clear to Mr Moffat who had instructed Mr Harrison and so he wrote to him: </p>

It was clear that Mr Harrison was being told that completion of the Transaction was being driven by the terms laid down by HSBC and that there was no alternative.  Whether Barclays would have been prepared to extend their lending at this late stage had they been asked must be doubtful, but what was misleading was the way that this letter reinforced the impression that there had never been any alternative because the attitude of the funders meant that the only two options that were ever on the table were the HSBC-funded restructuring on the one hand or a Barclays-driven administration on the other. </p>

Mario was armed with the letter from Mr Harrison and was clearly very unhappy.  Pauline said that she was summoned by Peter when they turned up unannounced.  The issue with which Mario was most concerned was the base value of the WX Hub for overage purposes, which he wanted to be £10 million rather than £11.45 million.  Pauline said that if he was so concerned about it, she would pay.  There was a dispute about whether she said that she would reimburse Mario from the difference out of her share of the proceeds of the WX Hub if it was sold, but for present purpose the precise nature of her promise does not matter.  What matters is that the value of the WX Hub and how the overage would work remained controversial. </p>

Peter said that they should have carved out the land where the CHP equipment stood but did not do so.  As he explained, if the PUG deal was to go ahead, the land where the CHP equipment was located would need to be sub-let to PUG and PUG would need access to the wider site in order to install the new CHP engines.  It was therefore necessary to prepare new leases so that SML was then leasing the CHP engine sites to SFP under 20-year leases and the remainder of the land at the Waltham Abbey and Fen Drayton nurseries except for the CHP engine sites to SGP under 5-year leases.  The rent paid for each nursery remained the same but was divided between the carvedout land on which the CHP engines stood and the remainder of the nursery.  The rent payable to SML was £24,000 for both Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey CHP engine land, £344,500 for the remainder of the land at Fen Drayton and £76,000 for the remainder of the land at Waltham Abbey. </p>

The meeting took place just after the first attempted requisition for a general meeting had been received by Peter.  By this stage it was clear that some at least of the shareholders (including in particular Antony and Mario) were very unhappy about what had occurred both under the Transaction and as a result of the conduct of the Director Defendants before it was entered into. </p>

So far as the consultancy agreement with Mr Smith was concerned, he told Mr Moffat that he was worried that he would not be paid what he said were some fairly large sums that were owed to him because of the SML shareholders’ attitude to the Transaction.  The consultancy agreement was eventually entered into between Kombbi and SML on 21 July 2016.  It made provision for a monthly fee of £2,750 in consideration for making Mr Smith available to provide what were described as Services, namely “<span style="font-style:italic">To serve as Chairman of the Board</span>”.   It also made provision for the payment of a lump sum of £250,000 plus VAT in the event of either the termination of Kombbi’s engagement by SML under the terms of the agreement or the termination of what was described as Mr Smith’s directorship with SML.  I shall explain the detail of what occurred in relation to the consultancy agreement when considering the questions which arise under the second agreed issue.   </p>

I shall explain the surrounding circumstances in more detail when I consider the third agreed issue.  It is self-evident that, by the time the consultancy agreement and the Kombbi Debenture were entered into, the concerns which Mr Smith had expressed at the May meeting with Gisby Harrison had greater substance because the requisitioning of the general meeting meant that the Director Defendants knew that control of SML was highly likely to pass out of their hands and into the hands of those who considered that the Transaction had operated in a manner which was contrary to their interests and who blamed the Director Defendants for the form that it had taken.  In these circumstances it is perhaps not surprising that neither the consultancy agreement nor the Kombbi debenture was approved or sanctioned by SML in general meeting. </p>

It only emerged towards the end of May 2016 that this had not been dealt with at the time of completion and so steps were taken to give effect to the intention to transfer this 50% interest to SFP.  In the end, the shares were transferred for a nominal consideration and SML’s claim for the loss sustained as a result of that decision is the subject of the tenth agreed issue.  It is convenient for me to describe what actually occurred when I give my conclusions on that issue. </p>

Rather, the question is whether the director honestly believed that his act or omission was in the interests of the company. The issue is as to the director’s state of mind.

Fully informed shareholder consent would have been a defence to both of those claims.  As to the former, it would have supplied the necessary approval within the meaning of section 190(2) of the 2006 Act.  As to the latter it would have constituted ratification of what would otherwise have been a breach.  What then were the legal mechanisms by which the necessary consents are said by the Director Defendants to have been given? </p>

In my view, those doubts are less likely to emerge where the proxy or representative assent is given by a person entitled to vote as a Group Class Representative because their entitlement arises under and in accordance with the very contract (the Articles) which governs the relationship between company and shareholder.  In that situation the only question is whether, on their true construction, it can be said that the representative has been given and retains authority to exercise that part of the bundle of shareholder rights which entitles the shareholder concerned to attend and vote.   </p>

It followed as I understood the submission that <span style="font-style:italic">Duomatic</span> assent could not be given or inferred either.  I am doubtful that that is the case and I think that the more likely conclusion is that the unanimous informed consent of all shareholders would be sufficient and would overcome a failure to appoint Group Class Representatives.

Nor do I consider that he was making the point in the sense that the original shareholders retained any form of legal entitlement to exercise shareholder rights if or when it came to the need to do so.  Likewise, I do not think that Pauline’s evidence justifies a conclusion that there was any formal or legal entitlement to exercise the shareholder rights of members of their branch of the family.  The way that she put the point in her evidence was that she and her brothers were “<span style="font-style:italic">the senior, decision making shareholders of SML</span>”, but she said this both in the context of decisions relating to the management of SML, and in the context of a company that had been run for many year without any perceived need to consult the shareholders in their capacity as such. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">More generally, I am satisfied that both Mario and Pauline said what they said about their role as shareholder representatives in the context of the influence which they regarded themselves as having retained through their majority shareholdings and their status as the founders of the business and the most senior members of their respective branches of the family.  This was fortified by consistent evidence that the junior generation deferred to the views of the senior generation, i.e. the original shareholders, and was a point that was made in slightly different ways by many of the witnesses.  In my view this is not particularly surprising in the context of a family business which had been established by the original shareholders.  It is plain that members of the family were ingrained with a culture which involved the children demonstrating respect for their parents (as it was put by Mario) and respect for their elders (as it was put by Mr Randall).  They continued therefore to have the influence which flowed from that respect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless I consider it to be clear that the assent of the original shareholders would only have been sufficient to satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Duomatic</span> principle if the Director Defendants had proved that all the other members of the individual families, whether formally or through their conduct, had delegated the exercise of their shareholder rights to their respective head of family.  In a related context, the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Dickinson v NAL Realisations (Staffordshire) Limited </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 2146 stresses (a) that the delegation must be sufficient to render the consent of the delegate the consent in law of the legal owner and (b) that all shareholders means exactly what it says – all must approve.  <span style="font-style:italic">Dickinson </span>was a case about the right of a beneficiary to assent on behalf of the pension trustee legal owners of the relevant shares, and so is not on all fours with the present case, because there is no allegation that the younger generation held their shares on trust for the original shareholders.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On this point I think that the evidence is clear.   As I have already described, several years earlier deliberate decisions had been made by the original shareholders to transfer proportions of their shareholdings to the next generation, albeit in the case of Mario and Pauline while maintaining a majority stake.  There is no evidence that they intended to retain some part of the bundle of legal rights to which the shareholders were entitled, i.e. a legal right to vote the shares they transferred.  The only legitimate inference is that they relied on a combination of the family culture of showing respect for elders and, in the case of Mario and Pauline their majority stakes, to exercise such continuing influence as they wished to retain.  Their gradual withdrawal from the operating aspects of the business so as to enable the younger generation to take things forward is consistent with no retention of legal voting rights in relation to the shares transferred.  This was particularly the case with the B Shares held by Tony’s branch of the family, because Tony only retained 25%, he had withdrawn much earlier on from active involvement and by common consensus his son Spider Sam was less engaged in the general conduct of SML’s business than any of the other directors.  </p>

They also each executed the ICA in their capacity as loan note creditors of LPL to whom they were selling their shares in CET for a deferred payment of £1.484 million.  While the CET share sale was not part of the Transaction in respect of which SML shareholder assent was required, CET and SML were intimately inter-connected and seem to have been treated by the family in practice as separate divisions of the same group more than as individual entities in their own right.  It is most improbable that the original shareholders were free to exercise their children’s shareholder rights in relation to SML in circumstances in which they would not have been regarded as free to do so in relation to their children’s shareholdings in CET. </p>

It carried with it the clear inference that, while he was heavily influenced in the way he intended to vote by the views and position of the original shareholders, he regarded himself as the person who had the legal right to do so, a position from which nobody else in the room dissented.

If there had otherwise been a full and frank description of the Transaction and its surrounding context, it may have been possible to infer assent from the fact that the documentation would have been available for inspection had they chosen to take advantage of that opportunity.  This is because they would have known from the description which they should have had that the documents which they signed were only part of the whole Transaction.  However, the fact that several of the shareholders were not shown all of the documents increased the burden on the Director Defendants to ensure that the terms of the Transaction itself and the relevant surrounding circumstances were explained in a full and frank manner. </p>

It follows that the events subsequent to the signing meeting (but before the time of completion on 1 April 2016) are also relevant to the question of whether or not the shareholders gave fully informed consent.  I shall return to that question shortly, but before I do so I shall explain my findings in relation to each of the material matters in which full disclosure was not made by the Director Defendants to the other shareholders at the time of the signing meeting itself. </p>

In my judgment, in order to ensure that the other shareholders gave informed consent to the Transaction, it was necessary for them to understand what had actually been done in relation to the leases.  In order for their assent to the Transaction to be fully informed, it was necessary for the Director Defendants to have explained to all of the shareholders (a) the basis on which the rent payable under the two leases had been calculated, (b) that the amount payable under the Fen Drayton lease was less than the amount for which it had been valued a few months earlier and (c) that no independent valuation had been obtained for either Fen Drayton or Waltham Abbey for the purposes of the Transaction. </p>

The APA made provision for the purchase price to be £10 million, while the Bidwells valuation which had been produced at the end of February valued it at £11.45 million.  I have already explained earlier in this judgment why I am not satisfied that this valuation was drawn to the attention of Mario, as alleged by the Director Defendants.  What is not really in dispute, however, is that the valuation was certainly not drawn to the attention of the shareholders as a whole and the difference between it and the figure included in the Transaction documents was not drawn to their attention or explained.  Indeed, there were a number of occasions on which the clear impression was given not just that the WX Hub was being transferred at an agreed value of £10 million, but also that £10 million was what it was worth. </p>

It is appropriate however, for me to summarise in a little more detail, why it is that the approach of the Director Defendants to the true value of the WX Hub was so misleading.  I do so against the background of the information other than the Bidwells valuation which was available to them and which should in my judgment have caused them to be much more open with the shareholders than they were about the likelihood that the transfer of the WX Hub was for a figure which was very significantly less than its true value.  Their lack of openness is illustrated by the confusing evidence as to how Mr Heyes came to his £10 million figure which I have already described when explaining what he told V&amp;S at the time they were instructed at the beginning of March. </p>

I have already explained a little more of the detail of what occurred, but I should reiterate that Peter was very defensive when he was questioned about his recording of the value of the WX Hub at the June 2013 meeting and I do not think that he would have recorded it in his note of the meeting in the way that he did if he had not then believed (some 3 years earlier) that it was worth £11 million. </p>

The letter raised questions about the value attributed to the WX Hub under the Transaction, although the focus (in this letter and the draft letter to Gisby Harrison which accompanied it) was more on the discrepancy in the Overage Deed between the £11.45 million figure at which the overage payment became payable and the figure of £10 million for which the WX Hub was to be transferred under the Transaction  This overage issue was also the point by which Mario was most exercised when he went to the WX Hub the following day. </p>

While I agree that on this point it is surprising that he did not simply assume that the WX Hub had been valued at £11.45 million, I do not think that he made that assumption.  More importantly for present purposes I am satisfied that the burden remained on the Director Defendants (as the effective recipients through their ownership of SFP and SGP of the assets to be transferred under the Transaction) to ensure that full information on this point was given to Mario, and indeed each of the other shareholders.

This was an important factor because it was something which continued to operate on the mind of Mario even after the advice that he was given by Mr Harrison on 29 March 2020.  Mario’s assessment of the risk of administration or some other form of formal insolvency eventually outweighed all of his other doubts about the Transaction.  As my factual findings have already indicated, I agree with the broad thrust of SML’s case that the Director Defendants were not straightforward with the shareholders on this issue.  They did not give them the full picture and left them with a highly misleading impression of what had occurred. </p>

As I have already described in some detail, this was said with particular insistence both at the 9 March meeting and the signing meeting on 24 March 2016 and I have no doubt that what was said reflected what each of the Director Defendants intended to convey whether or not they said it themselves.   The impact of the way that this was expressed has to be seen against the background of similar expressions of Barclays’ general attitude which had been conveyed to Mario and Pauline by the Director Defendants and Salvi on 16 February 2016 when they were told in terms that the Transaction funded by another bank was the only alternative to administration. </p>

Mario made clear at the signing meeting that this was what he understood the position to be and he would not have said what he said if that was not what he thought was likely to happen, and that was not contradicted by Peter or Sammy.  He also would not have expressed himself in the way that he did if he had realised that the catalyst to terminate SML’s facilities was not Barclays’ own decision to withdraw support (as the Director Defendants sought to portray), but was rather their own preference to proceed with the Transaction on the terms which reflected the funding made available by HSBC. </p>

More seriously they then entered a mindset which led them to structure the Transaction around the funding that was available rather than working out the true value of the business and the assets and then seeking to see if they could obtain the funding they required to take matters forward.  This also led them to adopt an attitude of mind which focused more on how to fund the new business, rather than having regard to the question of how they ensured that a full and fair value was paid by the new business for the assets to be transferred by SML. </p>

In his letter of 29 March 2016, Mr Harrison advised the original shareholders to whom it was addressed that it was unclear how real the threat of Barclays pulling its financial support actually was.  It is plain that this, amongst other things, caused Mario to think again, but it is also clear that as a result of what he was then told by the Director Defendants (and more particularly Mr Smith) at the WX Hub on 30 March, he formed the view that there was no alternative but to proceed.  Doubtless by this stage, pulling the Transaction, and going back cap in hand to Barclays would have been difficult (although it is noticeable that Mr Harrison was unsure how real Barclays’ threat actually was).  However, what matters is that even then the full story had not been told by the Director Defendants, and the burden remained on them to do so.

The first breach is simply that they failed to obtain informed shareholder approval for the Transaction.  On one level this adds little to the statutory liability to indemnify under section 190, but I agree with SML’s submission that it amounts to a freestanding breach of duty because the Director Defendants all participated in the design and implementation of the Transaction without obtaining full shareholder consent, thereby causing SML to commit an unlawful act.  Put another way, the facts which I have already set out as to why there was no fully informed shareholder assent to the terms of the Transaction meant that the Director Defendants were not acting with the proper ambit of their powers because the disclosures that they made and failed to make (as already described) did not give the full picture to which the shareholders were entitled. </p>

I agree that the Director Defendants owed a duty to SML to ensure that proper independent advice was obtained, because separate representation would have gone some way towards ameliorating the consequences of the conflict of interest which they had as directors of SML on the one hand and directors and shareholders of SFP and SGP on the other.  In my judgment it is elementary that in a transaction of this type and size, directors of the selling company will normally come under a duty to ensure that it has separate legal advice from the advice being given to the purchaser.  This may not be necessary where those interested in the vendor and purchaser are exactly the same people, but where the nature of the transaction is such that legal advice is required and there is a divergence in ownership or other stakeholder interest, the directors of both entities are likely to be in breach of duty if they simply rely on the legal advice being given to the other. </p>

It was submitted that the reason that the Director Defendants did not obtain independent valuations was because they were not approaching the Transaction with the intention of paying the market value for SML’s business and assets,  and they valued the business and assets of SML in order to fit the level of finance they had been offered by HSBC. </p>

In short, the complaint is that, having fixed on this solution at an early point in time, they did not give proper and continuing consideration to whether a market asset sale would not achieve a better result. </p>

This was intended to demonstrate that the restructuring deal which the Director Defendants devised was in everyone’s interests including in particular the original shareholders.  She said that, before the Transaction, SML had had three sites worth c.£20 million (in fact I think they were worth £22 million plus development potential at Fen Drayton worth another £1.8 million) with liabilities of c.£9.5 million, while the effect of the Transaction was to leave SML with Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey (worth £10.65 million plus the development potential) and a substantial and secure income stream.  She then said that SFP took all the risk ending up with the WX Hub, debt to HSBC, rental obligations and the need to turn the business around.  This she said was a good deal all round, and particularly for the original shareholders who wanted to retire. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that these types of benefit were significant factors to go into the mix when the Director Defendants were considering the right way forward.  But the overarching problem with this analysis is that the Director Defendants arrogated to themselves the responsibility for taking the ultimate decision by driving the proposal forward in such a way that they removed the effective decision-making power from the shareholders by presenting to them a situation in which they had no alternative but to agree or accept an administration of SML (the latter of which was not in any event accurate).  The legislation leaves with the shareholders collectively the right to approve or disapprove the terms of a substantial property transaction within the meaning of section 190.  The conduct of the Director Defendants cut across this principle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, one of the principal deficiencies in the approach adopted by the Director Defendants was that they had no proper regard to alternative asset realisation strategies which focussed on maximising value for each of the assets, but instead became focussed on how the business was to be carried on by SFP and SGP going forward.  The most tangible manifestation of this approach is the clear evidence which I have already outlined that the Transaction was designed around the available funding, rather than working out what the best value was that could be achieved for the assets and then pursuing that solution unless and until the shareholders, on a properly informed basis, resolved that that course of action was no longer to be pursued.  It is also supported by the evidence that the Director Defendants were stringing along Barclays whose support would have been predicated on an alternative approach while waiting for the HSBC offer which they knew (as and when it came) would be designed around the form of Transaction which they had set their minds on implementing.  The conflict of interest between the Director Defendants as directors of the vendor and their position as directors and owners of the purchasers is an illustration of why a transaction of this sort needs shareholder approval. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not think that the Director Defendants and Salvi set out to defraud the other shareholders.  I do however think that they developed an idea of what they wanted to do at quite an early stage.  They then convinced themselves that a restructuring of that type could be designed so that it generated what they regarded as an adequate return for SML’s shareholders and a healthy income stream for the original shareholders in particular.  Having been through that thinking process, they then concentrated on how to maximise their own beneficial return from SFP and SGP in the future and closed their eyes to the possibility that as the restructuring developed so the return for SML’s shareholders might become increasing unattractive.  This was apparent as aspects of the Transaction such as the impact of the deferred consideration and the proper value of the WX Hub developed.  It is clear to me that as that happened, they completely lost sight of what they should have been doing all along which was keep the interests of SML in the maximisation of its assets clearly in mind. </p>

They also rely on the fact that they were trying to do their best while the other two directors (Salvi and Spider Sam) abrogated their responsibilities and they point to the fact that the experts agreed (as they did) that the separation of the trading business from the land and property which SML owned was a reasonable commercial and financial strategy. </p>

They failed to take this approach at every stage and that was very clearly unreasonable conduct.

Mr Frenkel’s final position after some adjustments was that (a) the WX Hub was worth £11.45 million not the £10 million at which it was valued for the Transaction, (b) rather than net liabilities of £2 million being taken over by SFP and SGP from SML, they in fact acquired net assets of £1,574,577 and (c) the value of the remaining assets transferred to SFP and SGP as part of the Transaction, comprising in large part the benefit of profitable contracts and goodwill was not the nominal £2 provided for by the Transaction but was in fact £3,475,423. </span>

The figure for the value of the remaining assets was reached by a different process of reasoning.  It involved Mr Frenkel adopting an earnings-based valuation – i.e. applying an appropriate multiplier to a weighted average EBITDA - in order to establish the total value of the businesses transferred.  The value of the remaining assets referred to in (c) above was then the difference between the total value of the businesses transferred and the assets referred to in (a) and (b) above.  His conclusion was that the total value of the businesses transferred was £16,500,000 which led to the figure for goodwill of £3,475,423 that I have already mentioned. </span>

	      <span style="color:#212121">I can take the value of the WX Hub relatively shortly.  I am satisfied that Bidwells’ valuation of £11.45 million should be accepted as the market value of the WX Hub at the time of the Transaction, and the Director Defendants did not advance a positive case that it was not.  It was well-reasoned and was produced at the request of Barclays for lending purposes so will not have been subjected to any client pressure to maximise value.  The value is also entirely consistent with the previous assessments which I have outlined earlier in my judgment.  On this element of the calculation, SML sustained a loss from the Transaction of £1.45 million. </span>

The first is relatively straightforward.  I have already mentioned that the figure actually reached by Mr Heyes was £1,686,150, not the £2 million included in the computation of the consideration to be paid.  There has never been any explanation of that discrepancy apart from the inference that it was simply a rounding-up.  I can see no basis on which that rounding should not be reversed as part of the computation of the true value of the assets transferred to SFP and SGP. </span>

	      <span style="color:#212121">The next adjustment made by Mr Frenkel was that the assets and liabilities taken over as part of the APA did not include the fixed assets included in SML’s fixed asset register as at 29 February 2016. He said that these should have been included because they were all transferred to SFP and SGP as part of the Transaction.  He quantified the necessary adjustment at £521,943.  The Director Defendants did not dispute that this figure was not included in the £1,686,150 calculation of assets and liabilities taken over as part of the APA, but it was Mr Heyes’ evidence that their value was included in the £10 million which was paid for the WX Hub.  Furthermore, the fixed asset register was concerned with a net book value of cost less depreciation and did not reflect a separately realisable asset value. </span>

	      <span style="color:#212121">I was not taken through the nature of these fixed assets in any detail, and it is not clear to me whether or not they would have been included as part of the Bidwells’ £11.45 million calculation of the value.  However, such evidence as there was from Mr Heyes is that they were necessary as part of the WX Hub and to run the business of WX Hub.  On that basis it would not be surprising to find them included in the valuations of the WX Hub reached by both Mr Heyes and Bidwells.  When Mr Heyes gave this explanation in cross-examination, Mr Roe QC said that he might come back to the point but did not in the event do so.  Ms Anderson QC did not challenge the evidence on this point given by Mr Frenkel in his report, but that may be because she did not consider it necessary to do so, as all that he had said was that Mr Heyes had not accounted for any fixed assets taken over by SFP and SGP and Mr Roe QC did not challenge Mr Heyes’ evidence that he had, albeit in the £10 million for the WX Hub.   Neither party addressed the point in their closing submissions.  In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the £521,943 should be added back in the way suggested by Mr Frenkel.  The only safe basis on which I can proceed is that they were accounted for in the respective figures given for the value of the WX Hub. </span>

The core of their point was that it could be seen from the Bidwells’ report that Bidwells were not including plant and machinery, motor vehicles or office equipment in their valuation.  Ms Anderson QC responded in writing, objecting to the approach which SML had adopted on the basis that this was an unfair attempt to persuade me to make findings of fact which had not been argued out at trial, and at a stage in the decisionmaking process when parties’ comments are meant to be restricted to typographical corrections and other obvious errors.  She also drew my attention to a number of parts of the Bidwells report in which it appeared that some of the fixed assets had been taken into account in reaching the £11.45 million figure in any event. </span>

This is partly because it is clear that the Bidwells’ valuation was prepared on the basis that some at least of the fixed assets were included (see in particular the way in which they describe their valuation methodology in paragraph 14.2 of their report).  The author of the report was not called to give evidence at trial, and no means was suggested by which I could have reached an accurate assessment as to the respective values of what was included and what was not.  It is also because SML’s case was that the value of the fixed assets transferred under the APA was what I have described above as a net book value of cost less depreciation.  Whilst this may give an acceptable valuation for some accounting purposes, I cannot safely assume that it provides an adequate reflection of a separately realisable asset value such as would be required for the purposes of assessing the quantum of the claims made in these proceedings. </span>

The only material part of this reduction was a figure of £2,155,149 representing an amount owed to CET.  The reason that SML says that this amount should not be included in trade creditors is that while taking account of this as a liability of SML’s, Mr Heyes was at the same time not treating it as an asset of CET’s for the purposes of valuing CET’s shares.  This was explained in Mr Randall’s evidence and Mr Frenkel said that he regarded this as a fundamental inconsistency in Mr Heyes’ approach to valuing on the one hand CET’s assets and on the other hand SML’s liabilities, both of which were required to be valued for the purposes of arriving at proper figures for different elements of closely linked transactions. </span>

Mr Heyes’ evidence is also consistent with the fact that the liability continued to be shown in SFP’s accounts.  The mere fact that the liability was not taken into account in the valuation of CET does not establish that it did not remain a liability of SML that was taken over by SFP. </span>

As acknowledged by Mr Heyes in the passage I have quoted above, the only reason that it was not written off was because the Transaction was not with a genuine third party and, if it had been, the purchaser would almost certainly have required that to be done.  Furthermore, this liability was not treated by CET as an asset that it was entitled to recover for the purposes of working out the potential earnings from its business going forward.  To that extent it is difficult to see why it should be treated as a liability of SML’s so as to depress the purchase price, where the sale of the shares in CET and the sale of the relevant part of the business of SML were all part of the same overall transaction.  This was the essence of the point made by Mr Frenkel in his report and I agree with it. </span>

All of these assumptions were challenged by the Director Defendants, so I must reach a conclusion on whether SML has proved that the calculations made by Mr Frenkel led to the conclusion that the value of its business as at the time of the Transaction was £16,482,077 which Mr Frenkel then rounded up to £16,500,000.  Having carried out that exercise, he then deducted the value of the WX Hub and the value of the net liabilities assumed on acquisition in order to reach what he called (not entirely accurately) the value of SFP and SGP.

At first blush, and by comparison to the sales made in the previous periods ending 31 March 2014 and 30 June 2015, this does not appear to be unreasonable.  However, the factor which makes this approach suspect is the assumption that the sales to Hello Fresh would have increased significantly during the period.  As to this Mr Frenkel estimated £8 million for the year ended 31 March 2017, as against £3,939,201 for the year ended 31 March 2016 (of which £1,041,797 was for the first 6-month period and £2,897,404 was for the second 6-month period).

In my view this casts doubt on whether £49.9 million was realistic, rather more than giving it support, particularly when taking into account the fact that the overall picture was one of declining sales, while Mr Frenkel’s projected £49.9 million was almost exactly the same as the annualised figure for sales for the year ending 30 June 2015. </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Historically, and according to SML’s statutory accounts, its profit margins for the period 2008 to 2015 had ranged between 3.9% and 9.1%, with the three most recent years (those ending 30 June 2013, 30 June 2014 and 30 September 2015) being 7%, 6.9% and 3.1%.  This made Mr Frenkel’s assumed profit margin for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 14% seem very high.  He justified this figure by reference to management accounts for the 6-month period ending 31 March 2016 which disclosed an overall profit margin of 19.5% on the Hello Fresh and Frozen Sales of £3.9 million for that period.  He said that he had reduced the profit margin from 19.5% to 14% to reflect the fact that these two parts of the business were the most profitable parts.  They also amounted to less than 20% of overall sales.  The experts agreed that supplies to supermarkets, which still constituted a very significant part of the remainder of SML’s business, were continuing to be under significant margin pressure. </p>

Overall, however, they indicated that Mr Frenkel’s 14% was right at the top end of what was being achieved by other companies in the market and that gross profit margins were just as likely to be reducing as they were to be increasing.  On this issue I had the very clear impression from Mr Frenkel’s evidence that he was seeking to justify the highest profit margin that he thought was sustainable.  In my judgment that is not the correct approach.  I think that my task is to identify the figure which a hypothetical reasonable purchaser would use and I have no doubt that 14% was exaggerated.  I think that the right figure to apply is 11%.  That is a realistic and sustainable margin which reflects an appropriate short-term increase in the more profitable Hello Fresh business, while giving weight to the conclusion which I have already reached that it was known that this particular contract would terminate before the end of the applicable period and to the profitability of other parts of the business. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to weighting the EBITDA for each of the four periods, I have already explained the approach which Mr Frenkel took.  He accepted that it was very unusual to apply the highest multiple to a projected figure and then the lowest to the most recent actual figure.  He also accepted that the usual approach would be to apply a weighting of three to the most recent year, two to the year ended 30 June 2014 and one to the oldest year and that it would be pretty unusual to apply the lowest weighting to the most recent period.  However, he said that his approach was justified because of the fundamental changes which the business was undergoing.  By this he meant amongst other things the extent of the loss-making in the period ended 30 September 2015 some of which was exacerbated by matters to which I have referred elsewhere in this judgment.  These included the reduction in the Asda business which had been causing much of the losses and the cessation of the loss-making import business which stopped in November 2015. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On this issue, I accept Mr Frenkel’s approach.  It seems to me that there were good reasons for him to attribute only a very limited weighting to the losses for the period ended 30 September 2015, and to treat whatever may be the appropriate projected adjusted EBITDA for the period ended 31 March 2017 as the figure to which the most significant weighting ought to be applied.  This means that in my judgment the proper computation of a weighted average EBITDA leads to a figure of £837,026, to which it is necessary to apply an appropriate multiple in order to identify the value of the business on an earnings basis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the multiple, Mr Frenkel said that he used the Business Valuation Benchmarks (“BVB”) publication for 2017 which recorded details of actual sales transactions that took place in 2016.  Ms Anderson QC cross-examined by reference to the 2016, 2017 and 2018 versions of the publication which evidenced a median multiple for food manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of 5.1 in 2015, 11.5 in 2016 and 7.7 in 2017 respectively.  Mr Frenkel accepted that he did not take into account the 2015 figures or the 2017 figures and confirmed that his starting point was the 11.5 for 2016 recorded in the 2017 version even though a number of the transactions post-dated the 1 April 2016 date of the Transaction.  The comparables for the first quarter of 2016 taken together gave a median multiple of 8.5.  If he had looked at the 2015 figures (which he said that he did not do), he would have seen that the comparable multiples for 2015 gave a median of 5.1, although as Mr Frenkel pointed out the lower figures were in the earlier part of the year and those in the second half of 2015 gave a median of 10. </p>

He said that this was not comparable because its turnover was significantly smaller than that of SML (c.£8 million as compared to £50 million for SML). When he was asked about the size of the examples from which his 11.5 starting point was taken, he accepted that they were significantly larger than SML, but was clear that this differential was accounted for by the 1.5 reduction from 11.5 to 10 which he applied. The essence of his evidence was that the difference between a £90 million turnover business and a £50 million turnover business was much less pronounced than the difference between a £50 million turnover business and one such as SGS which turned over only £8 million.  </p>

The figure which is eventually reached by vendor and purchaser will depend on a more specific analysis of the potential that a particular business has than can be achieved by comparing multiples applied in other deals which may or not be closely equivalent.  But it is important to appreciate that the multiple eventually applied reflects what a businessman sees as the potential going forward and when an expert such as Mr Frenkel is expressing views about what he thinks is the correct multiple there is an element of judgment based on experience involved.  It is not a precise or predictable exercise. </p>

But I do not think that a multiple anything like as low as 3.5 would be justified.  I think that the right figure is 9.  This maintains a closer proximity to the £90 million turnover business where the median multiple was 11.5 than to the smaller SGS business.  It also reflects more happily the BVB comparables for the first quarter of 2016.  Applying that to the weighted average EBITDA, the value of the business on an earning basis was £7,488,234. </p>

However, SML asserts that it was never given security for the loan and Mr Frenkel said that it would be a reasonable commercial requirement for a loan of this sort to be adequately secured.  I accept all of those statements, although it is difficult to construe the way in which Mr Frenkel expressed himself as amounting to an opinion that it would be unreasonable for a company in the position of SML not to ask for security, and there is no indication that, once the shareholders knew of the deferred element of the consideration, they then mentioned the need for security to be provided.</span>

There is also no evidence as to whether SML might make any form of recovery from SFP’s administration.

I do not have the evidence to reach a conclusion on this point and the mere fact that SFP was a newly incorporated company which has gone into a formal insolvency process does not mean that it can now be seen that a loss of an identifiable amount was sustained at the time or certainly as a result of the Transaction.  It follows that SML has not shown that the amount of the deferred purchase consideration should not be taken into account as part of the purchase price paid at the time of the Transaction.

Not surprisingly, it also appears that older glass is worth less than newer glass.  As with many valuations, one of the exercises conducted by Mr Catley was to rely on comparable figures for the rental achieved in other rental deals, although as he put it in a colourful phrase: “<span style="font-style:italic">rental evidence for glass is as rare as hen’s teeth</span>”.   </p>

Mr Catley disagreed with that but did accept that it was less efficient than the newer glass, which he said was taken into account by the fact that he attributed a value of 2/3rds of the value of the newer glass. I see no reason to doubt Mr Catley’s evidence on that point.  She also challenged the state of the CHP engines, and it emerged that Mr Catley had no knowledge that they were old at the time of the valuation (April 2016) and subject to the terms of the CHP deal.  He had simply relied on what he had been told by Mr Randall, who was an unreliable source of information as he had not been around at the time.  In my view this was a more significant deficiency in Mr Catley’s approach, and I did not find his attempt to justify it to be either objectively expressed or particularly helpful. </p>

In broad terms I do not agree with this criticism although I do think that he was too ready to accept what he was told by Mr Randall and had an unfortunate tendency to make assumptions without explaining on the face of his report why he had done so.  She argued for a valuation of £70,835 for the glass at Waltham Abbey (as opposed to Mr Catley’s £208,497) and £37,513 for the transport yard and workshop (as opposed to Mr Catley’s £100,159). </p>

In my judgment both the newer and old glass are overvalued in Mr Catley’s valuation by about 10%.  I do not agree however that the criticisms in relation to the transport yard and the workshop were made out, and I accept Mr Catley’s view as to their market value.  It follows that in my view the market rental value which Mr Catley came to for Waltham Abbey was overvalued by £20,850.

Initially he justified the differential on the grounds that the 4m glass was good for cucumbers while the 4.5m glass was ideal for vine tomatoes. He then accepted that 5m eaves were the industry standard for vine tomatoes but maintained his position that the differential was still justified. This came to a total of £319,000 p.a.  He also valued the four dwellings and the hostel on the site at £86,400 p.a. for the dwellings (based on a monthly rental for each dwelling of £1,800 pm) and £30,000 p.a. for the hostel (based on 70% occupancy) respectively.

The argument was that an open market rental was not the appropriate comparator because they were rented out to staff, and Ms Anderson QC said that SML actually earns much less than the open market value from doing so.  Mr Catley did not agree with this challenge and it seems to me that his evidence on this point was logical and correct.  The question is the open market rent, not the amount that might actually be paid by staff, because there will be many reasons why a business might wish to charge its staff less for their accommodation than the market would bear.  That does not mean to say that the open market value is not the amount for which a landlord is entitled to look if it is renting the whole property out to a business tenant on arms-length terms. </p>

I do not agree with the approach adopted by Ms Anderson in relation to the glass or the Bubbles greenhouse.  I think that Mr Catley’s valuation for this part of the Fen Drayton site was justified and that his figure of £319,403 is accurate.  Likewise, I have also reached the conclusion that the rental value that Mr Catley attributed to the houses and the hostel is appropriate as well.  It is a fair valuation of the market value of Fen Drayton as at the time of the Transaction, and has some corroboration from the earlier valuation which had been obtained from Quintons in October 2015. </p>

While the tax losses were an asset of SML’s they were not an asset that SML was able to realise without retaining the trade and utilising them against its own future profits or transferring them to a special purchaser who was also acquiring the trade.  It follows that the starting point is that, as a result of this not being properly considered at the time of the Transaction, SML suffered a potential loss of up to half of what the tax losses themselves were worth if all fully utilised (i.e. up to £514,800) </p>

For SML to have considered that there was value in them sufficient to be shared 50/50, it would have had to take into account whether it considered that it would be profitable going forward, and also whether SGP would be profitable because, whatever they might theoretically have been worth it could not have extracted very much from a purchaser unless there were objectively sound grounds for thinking at the time of Transaction that the asset was of value both to it and to the purchaser.  Of course, these kinds of speculative considerations are why Mr Frenkel expressed the view on value that he did. </p>

But nor do I agree with the approach adopted by SML, viz that the value to it of the tax losses transferred was 20% of £5,148,000.  Indeed, that approach is not even justified by its own expert evidence.  In my judgment, and doing the best I can on very thin evidence, the state and condition of the underlying businesses of SML (before and after the Transaction) and of SGP (after the Transaction) were such that the directors of SML, if they had been acting on an arm’s length basis, would have given them value of 50% of £1,029,600 of which, applying Mr Frenkel’s approach half (i.e. £257,400) should have been apportioned to SML and half to SFP.  It follows that the only loss that I am satisfied that SML has established through not attributing any value to the losses as part of the Transaction, when it would have extracted value if a proper arms-length negotiation had taken place, is £257,400. </p>

Likewise, there was no challenge to the amounts (£68,553) paid to Mr Heyes’ firm, Rayner Essex.

In my view Mr Randall is wrong to say that they were incurred in relation to a transaction which was only ever going to be executed in breach of duty in the way that he does.  I also do not agree that all of the Rayner Essex fees between October 2015 and January 2016 should not have been paid by SML. At that stage Mr Heyes was providing services to SML and to SFP / SGP and there was no particular reason why they should not have been charged equally to SFP / SGP on the one hand and SML on the other.  </p>

Yes, they did. Yes.</span>”  It follows that any findings as to breach of duty in relation to these payments would serve no purpose because no separate loss is claimed.  It is apparent, however, that what occurred is a further aspect of the Director Defendants’ conduct which is open to legitimate criticism.

The connection arises because the Director Defendants claim that the building work carried out at SML’s expense on Mr Smith’s home at Griffins Cottage was payment in kind for sums which Peter agreed to pay him at the time he was originally hired by SML in June 2013.  My conclusions on what actually occurred have already been expressed earlier in this judgment.  In short, I am not satisfied that there was a legally enforceable agreement reached between Peter and Mr Smith for him to be able to charge, or for SML to pay, for the periods identified in the subsequently prepared Schedule.  I am satisfied however, that if and to the extent that Mr Smith had been able to establish that specific instructions to do particular pieces of work could be shown to have been given or subsequently approved, he would be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for that work. </p>

The second is that there was evidence to the effect (as Ms Anderson QC put it) that “<span style="font-style:italic">Kore Creative was not simply Wayne Smith or undertaking work which related to his role as a director</span>.”  It also seems to have outsourced work to others, and I was told by Ms Newcombe about Phil Nobo who carried out some of this work and there seem to have been others. </p>

This work is described as marketing, digital media and creative services relating to the Stubbins Memorial Cannon and various aspects of a part of the business called Lovi Sweets.  In the light of SML’s case, the issue is not whether the work described was done by Mr Smith but is rather whether he has in effect been paid twice for it.  As I have concluded that Mr Smith had no free-standing independent claim to charge £1,300 per day for consultancy fees over and above the amounts actually invoiced, SML’s concession means that it has no claim for breach of duty in respect of these invoices. </p>

The fact that Mr Smith’s remuneration package took effect from 1 October 2014 is also consistent with the fact that the Schedule which was prepared by Mr Smith before his death (albeit in contemplation of litigation) does not seek to claim for a period beyond the end of September 2014.

The evidence one way or the other on this issue was sparse, but I saw some of the work which had been done.   I accept that some of it was relatively unsophisticated.  However, I cannot conclude that these invoices did not reflect Mr Smith charging through Kore Creative a reasonable fee for work that was done for SML, nor can I conclude that they replicated payments for services for which he had already been paid (or became entitled to be paid) under the terms of the agreement that he reached with Peter.   </p>

It is necessary to keep the distinction clearly in mind because the payments challenged by SML give rise to claims against the Director Defendants for losses it claims to have sustained as a result of their breaches of duty, while the possible existence of undischarged liabilities is one of the points which affects the claim for rescission of the Kombbi debenture.

It was also fairly obvious by this stage that the majority of the shareholders in SML had taken the view that the Transaction had not been in SML’s interests but was only in the interests of SFP and SGP.  For that reason alone, it is clear that the Director Defendants should have given very careful consideration to the source (i.e. SML or SFP/SGP) from which any form of bonus for work done on the Transaction should be paid.

The evidence is that the agreement reached in November was that Mr Smith would be paid the uplift through Kombbi.  It is also difficult to reach a clear conclusion as to what the agreement contemplated that Mr Smith would be doing for his extra fee.

Such services as Mr Smith provided as chairman were part of the means by which he satisfied his duties as a director. </p>

As Peter makes quite clear in his evidence the impending possibility of Mr Smith’s removal was the actual reason for including the clause.  Furthermore, this is corroborated by the fact that by the time the consultancy agreement was signed a requisition to hold the general meeting to remove Mr Smith had been received and the Director Defendants had been advised that it was valid.

It was drafted sufficiently widely to secure sums which arose under the consultancy agreement which had first been discussed at the May meeting.  Clause 6.1 of the Kombbi Debenture contained a negative pledge in standard terms which prevented SML, without the consent of Kombbi, from creating, purporting to create or permitting to subsist any security over any secured asset.

Mr Moffat said in terms that Mr Smith said that he was concerned that, given the comments made by the SML shareholders, he would not be paid.  However, although Mr Moffat’s advice was that the grant of the Kombbi Debenture appeared to be in the best interests of SML, it was given in the narrow context of whether or not security granted to forestall a creditor from making demand for his debt could be in the chargor’s interests.

If a demand were to be made by Kombbi, it was in SML’s interests for its validity to be appropriately investigated and to be defended if there was a defence but conceded if there was not.  In this particular situation, I am satisfied that the grant of security can only have weakened SML’s position in protecting its own interests as against the claims made by Kombbi.

Mr Smith cannot be said to have been unaware of the fact that it was not in SML’s interests for the Kombbi Debenture to be granted.  I am satisfied that he knew of all of the surrounding circumstances which gave rise to the breach and in particular he must have known that, by procuring the grant of a debenture through threats to make demand for payment in respect of liabilities that would be disputed, he was advancing his own interests in a manner that was adverse to the interests of SML. </p>

The only persons who consented on behalf of SML (the Director Defendants) were themselves acting in breach of duty, which is plainly insufficient.  For the reasons that I have already explained, the fact that they received some advice from Mr Moffat on the point does not affect that conclusion. </p>

It is also right to say at the outset that the Director Defendants gave some evidence which seemed to be directed at showing a culture which was tolerant of personal expenses being funded out of SML’s assets or using its resources.

However, it is self-evident that any such practice is open to abuse and, where it happens, it is particularly important that the original obligation itself is properly recorded, that the asset or resource expended by the company in discharge of the obligation is given full value and is also properly recorded and that all necessary internal procedures are complied with.  It will also always be relevant for the directors to give careful consideration to whether the utilisation of the company’s resources in this way is the best way of using those resources in the light of the other business pressures to which it may be subject.  Otherwise it cannot be said that the payment-in-kind will involve the use of the resource in a manner which is most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. </p>

It was contended by SML that the way in which this information was recorded meant that SML was in breach of sections 386, 393 and 413 of the 2006 Act.  There may well be force in this contention, but I do not propose to make any specific findings to that effect because none are necessary for the relief sought in these proceedings.  Nonetheless, this case illustrates the importance of a company’s records being sufficient to show and explain its transactions.

As I have already said I do not accept this way of putting it because no invoices had been rendered.  Even if they had been, the Schedule on the basis of which this part of the claim is defended by the Director Defendants stated that, as at the end of 2013, £70,850 (ex VAT) was chargeable but unpaid.  Peter said that he therefore suggested to Mr Smith that SML’s building division, which did not have much work on at the time, could help to build an extension to Griffins Wood the cost of which (agreed at £120,000) would be charged to Mr Smith, but then set off against the outstanding invoices in respect of consultancy fees.  Apparently, the planning permission which Mr Smith had for a redevelopment of the property was about to expire, which meant that this was advantageous to him. </p>

In fact, SML incurred very substantially more in the way of expenditure on this work.  Thus, it is now not in issue that the sum of £164,212.92 was spent by SML on various labour and material costs for the building of Griffins Wood, plus a further sum which relates to the value of the inhouse labour provided by SML. </p>

The gist of Peter’s evidence was that this was better than paying Mr Smith’s invoices, although this is difficult to reconcile with his evidence that the amounts chargeable by Mr Smith for his consultancy services were only payable when SML was in a position to do so.  Even on Peter’s own evidence as to when SML would have come under a liability to Mr Smith, SML would have had to be free of its financial difficulties for the liability to have arisen.  I should add that Peter continued to maintain in his oral evidence that he believed there were such unpaid invoices, although as I have already explained none emerged in the course of preparation for the trial.   This evidence was inconsistent with what Sammy had to say (as I shall explain) and I do not accept that Peter’s evidence on this subject was true. </p>

This meant that it was not in fact in a position to do all of the work on Mr Smith’s house from its own in-house resources.  This became clear from SML’s records, and in particular from the recording of the expenditure under the specially created codes set up by Mr Randall, 1GWC and 2GWC.  Much of the work in fact carried out was done by third party contractors who would have had to be paid in any event.  To that extent there was no cash saving for SML. </p>

Although this is evidenced by the GWC coding set up by Mr Randall and is agreed, there is greater controversy about the value of the work provided by SML’s in-house employees.

Mr Randall was asked about the assumption and accepted in cross-examination that the figure of £256,050 was only based on an estimate made by him.  SML made no further attempt to substantiate this figure in a conventional manner by (for example) putting in evidence from the workmen themselves as to how long they had spent on the site or adducing time sheets or equivalent contemporaneous documentation.  Ms Newcombe said that while she knew the Edwards brothers who were there from time to time (she said they were “<span style="font-style:italic">at my house but not frequently</span>”), she did not recognise the other names.

It is only once the value gained has been established, that there could be any question of the presumption of the type apparently relied on by SML.  In my view the evidential burden remains on SML to prove the periods for which its employees worked at Griffins Wood, the cost to SML of that work and (if necessary) the value of it to Mr Smith.

I do not think that the figure is as low as that, but nor do I think that SML has come anywhere near showing that it was £256,050.  On the evidence I have seen the figure claimed by SML is very substantially inflated.  Having regard to the size of the project (and I saw some photographs), the fact that much of the work was done by outside contractors and falls within the £164,213 and the fact that Ms Newcombe accepted that at least some of the work was carried out by in-house employees, I think that the evidence points to four full time employees spending most but by no means all of their time (I estimate 75%) on the project over 9 months to the end of September 2014, two of whom were paid £30,000 and two of whom were paid £45,000.  It is quite possible that it may have been more, but SML has not discharged the burden of showing that it was. </p>

This means invoiced work carried out by Mr Smith during the period between June 2013 and March 2014 when he was given a budget by Peter which was spent through the Kore Creative charges which I have already mentioned.  As none had been invoiced, and there is no evidence of specific authorisations, it is difficult to see how SML had any contractual obligation to pay.

I have little regard to the Schedule in making this estimate, but I think it is clear that if a dispute were to have arisen at the time, Mr Smith would have been able to make some recovery against SML, even if only on the back of a claim to a quantum meruit.  There is little for me to go on, but doing the best I can, and notwithstanding the prima facie breach of duty committed by Peter and Sammy in permitting this building work to be carried out (of which Mr Smith was on notice), my best estimate, based on what I have been shown that he was doing during this period, is that a minimum of three weeks’ consultancy work at £1,300 per day would have been allowed notwithstanding the lack of invoices.  Accordingly, I think that £27,300 must be deducted from the £96,019 which is the loss that SML sustained from this breach of duty. </p>

It follows that the total personal claim for breach of duty is £68,719.  SML does however contend that it has a proprietary claim to recovery of the full amount (which I have now quantified at £232,932) as a proprietary claim against Mr Smith’s estate.  Mr Roe QC bases this claim on the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Foskett v McEwan</span> in the Court of Appeal ([1998] Ch 265), but the argument as to this was not developed and I am not satisfied that it has been fully made out. </p>

The first is that SML’s claim to be able to trace into a property such as Griffins Wood can only succeed if it can show that the value of the property concerned has been enhanced by the expenditure (Lewin on Trusts (20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn) at para 44-104).  The evidence focussed on what was spent by SML.  There was no evidence on the extent to which the value of Griffins Wood was actually enhanced by the expenditure incurred, and it is difficult for me to assume that it was, not least because there was a certain amount of credible evidence that there were serious deficiencies in the work that was carried out by SML’s workmen. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason is that, to the extent to which SML’s claim was transferred to SFP under the APA, I am not satisfied that a proprietary remedy is available. In particular it has not been explained to my satisfaction how it is that SML can on the one hand concede (correctly as it seems to me) that an element of the claim has been transferred under the APA, but on the other hand maintain a proprietary claim to recovery of that same amount out of the property on which SML expended the money so claimed.  At one stage the point was going to be further developed by SML, but in the event that course was not taken. </p>

Their bonus entitlements were not in dispute and arose because the effect of the sale of the Cardiff Nursery, which as I have explained took place in November 2013, had been to trigger £70,000 bonuses for Peter, Salvi, Sammy and Mr Randall under a scheme that had been put in place by Mario.  Peter then said that it was agreed at Mr Randall’s suggestion that Peter, Sammy and Salvi would each defer £49,000 of those bonus entitlements and that subsequently Mr Randall suggested that the deferred amount be paid off by the building work.  Sammy said much the same thing and added that the suggestion was made because SML had insufficient cash at that time to pay the bonuses in full.  It is not in dispute that they were both only paid £21,000 of this bonus and that £49,000 remained outstanding. </p>

What matters is that Peter and Sammy were both directors of SML and I am quite sure that they were both well aware of the rights and wrongs of using SML’s resources for their own personal benefit.  I shall come to the amounts spent shortly, but it is now clear that the way in which the invoices were drawn up and the work was recorded was deliberately misleading.  In particular some of the invoices referred to the building work as having been done at Fen Drayton, and this was the way in which that expenditure was recorded in SML’s books and records.  There was evidence from Peter that this was done (anyway in part) to facilitate a reclaim of VAT and Sammy also gave evidence that it was VAT related, but in their witness statements they both sought to give the impression that it was all down to Mr Randall. </p>

At the end of the day this issue goes to credit rather more than it does to a matter at the centre of the dispute between the parties, but it is necessary for me to record that the way in which Peter and Sammy behaved in relation to the building work at their properties reflected a propensity to be untruthful in relation to matters affecting their own personal interests and to have scant regard to their legal obligations in relation to benefits they received from work carried out for them at the expense of SML. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">SML does not accept this explanation. It says that SFP was a separate legal entity with different shareholders to SML. It also relies on the fact that SFP sent notices to customers explaining that from now on they would be dealing with Stubbins Food Partnerships Limited and not SML trading as StubbinsFP.  It points out that invoices were sent out with SFP’s details on them and that SFP filed VAT returns.  SML submits that the relevance of this is that by 1 October 2015, when SFP started trading on its own account, the Director Defendants had a settled intention to take over the trade of SML pursuant to a management buyout. It was therefore wrong of Mr Heyes and the Director Defendants to certify that SFP was dormant prior to the APA.  I think that there is force in this submission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Of equal significance is the admission by Peter and Sammy that the reason they started trading through SFP was to put assets outside the Barclays security envelope.  Peter said in evidence that he thought it was a commercially proper thing to do at the time, although he accepted that he did not tell Barclays.  As SML submits, part of the significance of this admission is that Peter and Sammy were thereby demonstrating low standards of commercial probity, but this conduct is also likely to have had an impact on SML’s long-term relationship with Barclays, a relationship which was at the centre of what occurred at the time of the Transaction.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the real question, as SML accepts, is whether or not it suffered any loss from this conduct.  The reason that this is in doubt is because the SFP trading was largely accounted for at the time of the Transaction and SML’s loss in respect of the diversion of trade relates only to unpaid stock taken over on 1 October 2015 worth £128,236.98 and retained funds in its bank account of £107,959.9, which should have been treated as an asset of SML’s at the time of the APA.  The Director Defendants do not challenge these sums.  In relation to the unpaid stock, Peter says in his evidence that he ‘<span style="font-style:italic">was not aware of this</span>’ and there is no positive evidence which challenges the stock figure and the experts agree that the bank balance should have formed part of the assets accounted for through the APA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">SML does not contend that this is deliberately misfeasant conduct by the Director Defendants, but it alleges that, if the Director Defendants had put their minds to it, then these items would have been included in the valuation of the assets transferred.  It follows that SML is entitled to recover the value of the stock that was never paid for and the bank balance taken over but not treated as an asset of SML’s for the purposes of the APA.  I agree with SML’s case on this point, and in my judgment, it was a breach of duty by the Director Defendants not to ensure that these two items, both of which had the value I have stated above, were accounted for in the APA.  This claim for £236,197 is accordingly made out. </p>

He wanted to be paid £650,000.

There is, however, no allegation that the amount was hidden from any of the shareholders, nor is it said that any of them were misled as to the nature of the allegations that had been made by Mr Randall.  In his closing submissions, Mr Roe QC said that the real mischief was that the £300,000 was only agreed by the Director Defendants to hide their own discreditable conduct from a public airing and from HMRC, but he did not contend that it was paid to hide any of the allegations from any of the shareholders.  The evidence would not in any event have justified any such argument being made.  The way that it was put in the schedule of loss was “<span style="font-style:italic">the Director Defendants wished to avoid a public airing of the fact that they had been causing SML to spend its money on enriching them personally through works on their homes</span>”. </p>

It was of course a very large sum of money by reference to Mr Randall’s salary, but it was half what Mr Randall was demanding and there is no doubt that everybody including Pauline and Mario appreciated that the claim was complex and raised many issues several of which would not have constituted actionable wrongdoing by SML against the Director Defendants even if they were to have been justified.  I do not think that payment of this amount was a greater sum than could objectively be justified; fighting Mr Randall’s claim was likely to be immensely distracting, and everybody (including Mario) had formed the view that they wanted it closed down. </p>

Ms Anderson QC built on this evidence in her submissions by saying that consideration of the nature of the payments in dispute and the general context in which the dispute arose makes clear that this head of claim is no more than a claim for the reconciliation and payment of an inter-company debt by SML against SFP or SGP.  She also says that the situation was exacerbated by the hostile stance adopted by SML immediately after the appointment of Mr Randall as a director, which made it difficult for agreement on the reconciliation to be reached and made a submission (which Mr Roe QC criticised as being wholly unsubstantiated by any evidence) that the loss was only ever sustained because SML drove SFP and SGP into administration thereby leading to a situation in which any balance on the inter-company account could not be paid. </p>

The reason for this, as Mr Roe QC accepted in his closing submissions, is that there is no evidence that any of the three of them procured any payment by SML for something that should properly have been charged to SFP or SGP after the time they ceased to hold office.  After their removal the nature of their continuing duties to SML changed in the sense that they no longer had positive obligations to ensure that SML’s assets not passing through their hands were properly secured. </p>

However, I do not accept that the mere fact that a Director Defendant was a director means that liability can be attributed to him.  SML must prove that the nature of each payment which it challenges was more than simply a non-deliberate appropriation to the wrong company.  It must go on and show that the Director Defendant concerned was either involved in the authorisation of the payment being on notice that it was attributed to the wrong company or knew that it had happened and took no steps to reverse it.  In my judgment it is not sufficient for SML simply to prove that the payment was made.  In other words, the mere taking of an account as between SML and SFP / SGP showing a net balance in favour of SML is not sufficient to demonstrate that SML’s directors are liable for breach of duty.  As matters stand the submission made by SML is that the payments should not have been made and therefore the Director Defendants are liable.  That is not sufficient. </p>

It is wrong in principle for a company to pay the debts of an associated company unless there are good business reasons to do so (sufficient to amount to conduct in good faith likely to promote the success of SML) and the director concerned is satisfied with good reason that repayment (if not otherwise netted off) is adequately secured.  In my judgment, proof to that effect may well render the original payment out of the wrong account not a breach of duty at all, and if it is a breach, a case in which relief from liability would be appropriate under section 1157 of the 2016 Act. </p>

As I have already mentioned, Mr Heyes had produced a valuation of £209,689 for the 50% holdings in SGS on 18 March, i.e. a few days before the Transaction was completed, and it is clear that he did so for the purpose of including the SGS shares in the businesses to be sold.  That valuation was based on a three-year profit average, adjusted for market rent and a multiple of 4 times maintainable profits.  He stressed that it was an indicative valuation as a basis for negotiations with HMRC and that the actual amount to be paid by SFP and SGP must ultimately be decided by the directors “<span style="font-style:italic">changed for any adjustments you want to make and the shareholders agree to”</span>.

It follows that for present purposes, (and this was the way in which the issue was argued in the parties’ closing submissions), the question which matters is the value which was then attributed to the SGS shares, and whether or not that value reflected a fair value for the asset transferred, as and when the transfer actually took place. </p>

So far as Peter is concerned it is incorrect, because he had referred in his third witness statement to the fact that SML was heavily indebted to SGS, although he seemed to be making a different point.  He also made the point, albeit in abbreviated form, in his fourth witness statement.  Furthermore, the force of SML’s criticism is undermined by the fact that the point is clearly pleaded in paragraph 122B of the Director Defendants’ Re-Amended Defence which was before the court at the PTR on 14 October and was verified by statements of truth signed by them on 30 October shortly before the trial commenced. </p>

Mr Heyes said in his evidence that he would have expected the liability to SGS to have been transferred to SFP (or presumably SGP) under the terms of the APA and it seems to me that it is plain that it was.  SML’s liability to SGS was either within Produce Liabilities or Non-Produce Liabilities as defined and as such was or should have been taken into account in valuing the businesses transferred under the APA.  This may have an impact on the proper value of SML as at the time of the Transaction, because its value should have taken into account its indebtedness to SGS, but, having been transferred to SFP and SGP under the terms of the APA, the existence of that liability cannot then be utilised again to reduce the amount otherwise properly payable by SGP for its acquisition of the shares in SGS. </p>

On this point in particular it is right to mention that Salvi’s role was such that this is a particularly clear example of one of the instances in which there is strong likelihood that Salvi would have been liable to the same extent as the Director Defendants were SML to have chosen to sue him.  The extent of their liability is the value of the asset so transferred, i.e. the value of the SGS shares. There was no evidence that any of the other shareholders were told about the transfer of the SGS shares, let alone the value at which the transfer was to take place, and Peter’s evidence was that he did not think that they were. </p>

This means that there is a higher chance that Mr Tilby’s approach to the right multiple (anyway to the extent that it depended on a full understanding of the underlying business) is correct.  I think it is also right to take into account the fact that on the evidence before me Mr Heyes was closer to the Director Defendants than Mr Tilby and also was intimately concerned in the design of the Transaction from the perspective of SFP, SGP and the Director Defendants.

For that reason alone, it seems to me that it has much less evidential weight on the question of the true objectively ascertainable value of the 50% SGS shareholding in the context of the right price as between SML and SFP/SGP.  I also think that this renders the Heyes second valuation less reliable as well, because the chances are that Mr Heyes’ views were affected by the consideration that he had already given to the value in the middle of March. </p>

It was at the end of the day a valuation produced on the instructions of the Director Defendants through SFP.  Furthermore, I do not think that it is appropriate to make a reduction from that figure for the possibility that SGP might decide no longer to take produce from SGS or anyway the amount of produce which had historically be purchased by SML; i.e. the point footnoted to Mr Heyes’ second valuation.  While it is no doubt the case that SGS was vulnerable to being supplier to one important customer, there was no evidence that there was any possibility that SGP would stop purchasing from SGS and indeed the very fact that the Director Defendants were keen to include the acquisition of an interest in SGS in their new group indicates that the prospects of that being the case should be given little weight in assessing the true value of the SGS shares. </p>

Mr Frenkel said that the omission by Mr Tilby was justified because “<span style="font-style:italic">this could realistically be valued on a quasi-partnership basis</span>”.  I do not consider that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that this was the nature of the relationship between SML and the Faranda family.  In my judgment, and in the absence of any real exploration of the issue at trial, SML has only demonstrated that the loss it suffered was the amount of the Infantino valuation prepared by Mr Tilby but discounted by 15% for the way in which the shares were held as explained in the second Heyes valuation.

SML also clarified that the amounts which had originally been claimed as input tax by SML were for the benefit of SFP and SGP because they were “paid” by SML to SFP and SGP by means of inter-company accounting.  The figure in issue has now been revised in SML’s Schedule of Loss to £74,213.36.

As for Sammy his role was such that if he were still in office at the relevant time, he would have been involved in its preparation.  However, I not able to draw that inference because the dates of the relevant invoices fall within the periods of July, August and September 2016, and Sammy was removed as a director on 18 August. As monthly VAT returns do not have to be submitted until a month plus a few days after the end of the relevant period I cannot infer that he had any responsibility for submission of the relevant returns while he was still a director.  Sammy gave evidence that that was indeed the case.  He said that the July/August return would have been done in September and that “<span style="font-style:italic">we would not have done the September VAT return</span>”.

As SML accepts, it would be wrong to include the months of October, November and December 2014 in which losses totalling £771,884 were made, and so the total loss incurred for the period during which it is contended that the import business should not have been carried on was £1,955,958. </p>

The views which were there being expressed by Mr Heyes, McIntyre Hudson and Mr Pearson have to be set in the context of the debate which had been going on for some time within the family about whether to present a more modern image and experiment with new business opportunities (which was what the Director Defendants wanted to do) or whether to continue to find ways of servicing the traditional supermarket base (which was Mario’s preferred approach).

SML submits that this was a reflection of internal blame being attributed to Mr Randall without justification.  Nonetheless, this was a matter to which MacIntyre Hudson were prepared to put their name in the context of a due diligence report for HSBC, and in my view SML has not adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it was without foundation.  </p>

The burden of proof was on SML and the evidence boiled down to reliance on historic poor performance of which Mr Randall had made sure that the Director Defendants were well aware and the fact that looking back after the end of the period it could be seen that the import business did in fact continue to make losses for reasons that were consistent with those which underpinned the making of the making of the historic losses in the first place. </p>

He said that he was surprised by Sammy’s rejection of the opportunity because “<span style="font-style:italic">SML was supposed to be looking for new sources of income</span>”, but there was no evidence which explained why and how SML could have made money from it, and the question arose at a stage when it is SML’s case that it was under increasing financial pressure and now says that it should have been withdrawing from its import business which is not consistent with it being a good idea to invest in a haulage company based in Portugal.  Even if the Director Defendants did “invest” in David Platt LDA, which they seem to have done in some unidentifiable way, it is very difficult to identify from the evidence why this was an opportunity which ought to have been pursued by SML. </p>

Whatever its nature, the evidence is equally consistent with the investment opportunity being a speculative one for the Director Defendants, in which it would have been quite wrong and inappropriate for SML to engage.  Indeed, the note of the 2017 meeting with Mr Heyes which I referred to earlier in my judgment is if anything more consistent with an attempt to get back something from an investment or loan which had not made a profitable return than it is with an investment or loan which would have generated any form of meaningful benefit for SML. </p>

Mr Ayres was on the logistics side of the combined business (looking at the Stubbins Group as a whole) and the opportunity if it existed was an opportunity related to the haulage business not the part of the business operated by SML.  This conclusion is both consistent with the business area to which the opportunity related and also with the fact that when V&amp;S were approached by Mr Randall in early 2015, they thought that they were acting for CET. </p>

The first is that the context of the APA was the takeover of SML’s business by SFP and SGP. It did not concern SML’s rights to bring present or future claims against its officers. The second point was that the Director Defendants are not parties to the APA and nor are they named or otherwise identified in it.  It is submitted that there is no reason why the APA would confer on them a personal benefit.  The third is that the reference in the definition of claims to “<span style="font-style:italic">third parties</span>” should be read in a common sense rather than a legalistic way to mean complete strangers to the APA and not the owners and directors of the purchasing companies (SFP and SGP). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In support of these submissions, SML points out that the obvious purpose of that part of the APA which provided for the sale of Business Claims was to ensure the transfer of a necessary incident to the sale of contracts and stock.  It points out that without such a sale SGP and SFP would be unable to pursue claims or other legal remedies against suppliers to or customers of the Produce Business and the Non-Produce Business.  SML also submits that the majority of its claims do not in any event arise out of or in connection with the operation of the Produce Business or the Non-Produce Business.  It also contends that the construction of “<span style="font-style:italic">Business Claims”</span> advanced by the Director Defendants would mean that SML has lost its common law and statutory rights to bring claims against its own officers for wrongdoing however serious and damaging that wrongdoing may be. It says that the court will not reach a conclusion on construction of a contractual provision of this type which would reach such a result (which it characterised as “unfair”) unless it contained clear words to that effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment SML’s submissions on the question of construction are correct. The context in which the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">Business Claims”</span> in the APA falls to be construed is (a) the sale of two going-concern businesses and (b) the sale of a property asset (the WX Hub) and the grant by the vendor of leases over other property (Fen Drayton and Waltham Abbey) to facilitate the continuing conduct of those going concern businesses.  The acquisition was a business acquisition by way of management buy-out focussing on the continuing conduct of business activity, including what was required to enable those businesses to be carried on in the future.  It was always envisaged that SML would continue to function as an operating corporate entity with its own assets and liabilities and through which all of its shareholders (including in particular the original shareholders) would be able to continue to make a return. </p>

In that context the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">Business Claims”</span> contains two categories of characteristic or limiting qualification to the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">rights, entitlements and claims</span>”.  The first is the persons against whom the claims must be made (“<span style="font-style:italic">third parties”</span>) and the second is the matters out of which the claims must arise (“<span style="font-style:italic">the operation of the Produce Business or … the Non-Produce Business”</span>) or to which they must relate (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Produce Assets or … the Non-Produce Assets”</span>).  Each characteristic or limiting qualification takes its true meaning from its juxtaposition to the other and must be read in the context of the draftsman’s use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">Business</span> in the defined term itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, this means that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">third party”</span> must be read as a third party to the relevant business activity.  It does not extend to claims against those who were themselves acting for or on behalf of SML, rather than as a counterparty to SML in respect of a relevant business activity.  If the person against whom a claim is sought to be made was not a person with whom SML was carrying on business but was in fact an officer, employee or agent of SML criticised for the wrongful carrying on of business activities on its behalf, they are most unlikely to be a third party for the purposes of the definition. </p>

They are all formulated as claims for breach of duty or compensation for losses sustained as a result of non-compliance with statutory provisions concerned with the internal management of a company’s affairs.  Such claims are internal to SML and are concerned with the operation of its internal management.  They are different in concept from claims against persons with whom SML has carried on business, or who may be liable to SML as a result of activity related to its business but in respect of which they were a counterparty to SML. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The reason for this is that a term to that effect would have amounted to the disposition of an asset without consideration being given to its value and without attributing any value to it.  There is no evidence that, in assessing the value of the assets being transferred to SFP and SGP any consideration was given to the value of the claims.  While there might have been room for legitimate disagreement about the merits of the claims, in my view it would have been a breach of duty by the directors of SML to procure their transfer for no consideration (if that is what the APA had done) without satisfying themselves as to the nature of the claims which might exist and reaching a reasonable and bona fide conclusion that they had no value.  To the extent that such claims might have given rise to causes of action against the directors themselves, which in large part they did, the court would have required clear evidence that in agreeing to their transfer, they reached their decision unaffected by the conflict of interest.  The loss would be the value of the claims which, on this hypothesis, SML would have been deprived of the ability to pursue. </p>
