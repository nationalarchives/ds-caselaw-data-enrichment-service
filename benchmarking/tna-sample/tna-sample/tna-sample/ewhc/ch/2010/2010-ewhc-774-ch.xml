	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The background to these claims is that, before the relevant events occurred, the Defendant companies (except for the parent company, Cable &amp; Wireless plc, which is the First Defendant) were monopoly telecommunications operators in various jurisdictions in the Caribbean. The governments in those jurisdictions passed primary legislation providing for the ending of those monopolies and for new operators to be able to enter the telecommunications markets to compete with the former monopolist. That legislation, and regulations made under it, and the terms of the telecommunications licences granted to the former monopolist, provided in various ways for the new world of competition in telecommunications and, in particular, provided for the new entrant to be able to interconnect its network to the existing network of the former monopolist. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In various jurisdictions in the Caribbean, a subsidiary company in the Digicel group applied for and obtained a telecommunications licence for a mobile telecommunications network which would allow it to enter the relevant market and compete with the former monopolist. The Digicel subsidiary wished in every case to interconnect with the existing network. It considered that it could not hope to survive as a mobile telecommunications operator without such interconnection. The Digicel subsidiary sought to rely on the provisions of the legislation, and of the regulations, dealing with such interconnection. Jamaica was the first jurisdiction where a Digicel subsidiary sought interconnection from a Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary. Matters appeared to have proceeded without difficulty in Jamaica.   The Digicel subsidiary entered the mobile telecommunications market in Jamaica and its business flourished.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Following interconnection in Jamaica, and over a period of some 4 years, a Digicel subsidiary sought interconnection from one of the Defendant companies in a further 7 jurisdictions. In date order, the relevant jurisdictions were St Lucia (“SLU”), St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines (“SVG”), Grenada, Barbados, the Cayman Islands (“Cayman”), Trinidad &amp; Tobago (“T&amp;T”) and, finally, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands (“TCI”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In each of the above-mentioned 7 jurisdictions, the Digicel subsidiary did, in time, interconnect with the relevant Defendant company. Interconnection required the purchase and installation of specialist equipment at the Digicel end of the interconnection and at the Defendant operator end of the interconnection. Speaking generally, interconnection also requires the interconnecting parties to enter into a detailed interconnection agreement. The relevant parties did enter into such an agreement in each jurisdiction, except in the case of T&amp;T where the matter was dealt with, on an interim basis, by a ruling from an arbitration panel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Digicel subsidiaries say that the Defendant operators delayed the process of interconnection in many different ways. The Digicel subsidiaries say that the conduct of the Defendant operators in causing such delay was a breach of the primary legislation and/or of the regulations and/or of the Defendant operator’s telecommunications licence. The Digicel subsidiaries say that these breaches are actionable as breaches of statutory duty. It is then said that other companies, such as C&amp;W plc, are liable as joint tortfeasors together with the Defendant operating company. It is also said that there was an actionable conspiracy involving the Defendant operator but also including others, in particular, C&amp;W plc. The alleged conspiracy is a conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Initially, it was said that there had been a conspiracy between the operating company in T&amp;T and C&amp;W plc and Cable &amp; Wireless (West Indies) Limited. The relationship between the Cable &amp; Wireless companies and the operating company in T&amp;T was investigated in detail at the trial. When the Claimants made their closing submissions, this allegation of conspiracy was abandoned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Digicel companies say that they have suffered heavy losses by reason of the enforced delay in their entering the relevant market. They say that if the Defendant operator had complied with its duties, interconnection would have been completed much earlier. They say that if interconnection had been completed much earlier, then the Digicel subsidiary would have entered the market much earlier. The first part of the trial of this action was for the purpose of determining questions of liability and causation and the extent of any delay caused to the Digicel subsidiary but not for the purpose of determining the quantum of any damages. The Claimants have pleaded that they have suffered losses in excess of US $ 100 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I will deal first with the broad issues which arise in 5 of the jurisdictions, leaving Barbados and T &amp; T for separate mention. In SLU, SVG, Grenada, Cayman and TCI, the first issue is as to the meaning and effect of the primary and secondary legislation in those jurisdictions. The second issue is whether the relevant Defendant acted in breach of that legislation. The third issue is whether any breach of such legislation is actionable by any Claimant?   The fourth issue is whether there was a breach of a telecommunications licence in any of these jurisdictions. The fifth issue is whether a breach of a telecommunications licence was a breach of the legislation and, if so, whether any such breach was actionable. The sixth issue is, if any breach of such legislation is actionable by a Claimant, which Defendants are liable? Are there joint tortfeasors, and, if so, who are they? The seventh issue is whether a breach of such legislation constitutes “unlawful means” for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. The eighth issue is whether a breach of a telecommunications licence (which is not also a breach of the legislation) constitutes unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy. The ninth and tenth issues arise in TCI only. The ninth issue is whether the relevant Defendant was in breach of contract in relation to interconnection in TCI. The tenth issue is whether any such breach of contract constitutes unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy. The eleventh issue is whether there was a combination between some or all of the Defendants with an intent to injure a Claimant by any such unlawful means. The twelfth issue is whether any intent to injure was negatived by the existence of an honest belief that the actions complained of were lawful and, if so, whether such an honest belief existed in fact. The thirteenth issue is whether any unlawful conduct on the part of a Defendant delayed the completion of interconnection. The fourteenth issue is whether any delay to the completion of interconnection due to an unlawful act of a Defendant delayed a Claimant’s launch of its network in the relevant jurisdiction. The fifteenth issue relates to SLU alone: is the claim in conspiracy in relation to SLU brought outside the relevant limitation period? The sixteenth issue concerns the approach the court should take to exemplary damages and restitutionary damages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In Barbados the issues can be broadly summarised as follows. The first issue is as to the meaning and effect of the primary legislation. The second issue is whether the relevant Defendant acted in breach of that legislation. The third issue is which Defendants are liable? Are there joint tortfeasors, and, if so, who are they? The fourth issue is whether there was a combination between some or all of the Defendants with an intent to injure the Fourth Claimant by unlawful means. The fifth issue is whether an intent to injure was negatived by the existence of an honest belief that the actions complained of were lawful and, if so, whether such an honest belief existed in fact. The sixth issue is whether any unlawful conduct on the part of a Defendant delayed the completion of interconnection. The seventh issue is whether any delay to the completion of interconnection due to an unlawful act of a Defendant delayed the Fourth Claimant’s launch of its network in the relevant jurisdiction. The eighth issue concerns the approach the court should take to exemplary damages and restitutionary damages.  The ninth issue is whether a statutory limitation period in relation to any statutory tort of conspiracy bars a claim based on an alleged common law tort of conspiracy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It may be helpful to emphasise the following point which emerges from the above statement of the issues in the six jurisdictions referred to above. The question in this case is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> whether the relevant Defendant did everything in its power to expedite the launch of the relevant Claimant’s telecommunications network. If that had been the question, the answer would have been simple: the relevant Defendant did not do everything in its power to expedite the relevant Claimant’s launch. Instead, what the court has to determine is: (1) what duty was placed on the relevant Defendant by the legislation or by the licence in the relevant jurisdiction; and (2) did the relevant Defendant cross the line so as to commit a breach of that duty. If the relevant Defendant did not cross the line so as to commit a breach of duty, then that is the end of the claim. If the relevant Defendant did cross the line and did commit a breach of duty, then the further questions arise as to whether the relevant Claimant has a claim in law for loss suffered as a result of that breach of duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In T &amp; T, the position is somewhat different from the position in the other six jurisdictions. In T&amp;T, in certain circumstances, the relevant legislation prohibits conduct which is “contrary to honest practices”. The first issue is as to the meaning and effect of that legislation. The second issue is whether the relevant Defendant acted in breach of that legislation. The third issue is whether any unlawful conduct on the part of a Defendant delayed the completion of interconnection. The fourth issue is whether any delay to the completion of interconnection, due to an unlawful act of a Defendant, delayed the Sixth Claimant’s launch of its network in the relevant jurisdiction. The fifth issue concerns the approach the court should take to exemplary damages and restitutionary damages. There originally was, but no longer is, a claim based on the tort of conspiracy in T&amp;T.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I will make some preliminary comments on the above issues. The Defendants say that in four of the seven jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned (SLU, SVG, Grenada and Cayman), the Claimants have no cause of action at all, whatever the facts might be. In relation to TCI, the Defendants say that the only cause of action is for breach of contract and that claim was introduced by amendment during the trial. The Defendants accept that the Claimants have a cause of action in Barbados and T&amp;T. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Although I have tried to set out the issues in a logical order, I have sometimes found it convenient later in this judgment to deal with the issues in a different order. Further, as will be seen, it sometimes emerges that my decision on one issue means that a later issue does not arise. However, in such a case, I will make findings of fact on issues that do not strictly arise, in case that would be helpful to the parties or an appellate court, save where the burden of making findings of fact is disproportionate to the benefit or where there are other difficulties such as the need to make assumptions of fact, contrary to my actual findings, which would make the process unhelpful and/or burdensome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the course of my judgment, it will be necessary to set out the facts in considerable detail and, unfortunately, this judgment will be long. The parties addressed me at considerable length on the facts; the written closing submissions (much of which dealt with matters of fact) exceeded 2000 pages and I had the advantage of several days of oral submissions in addition. The principal reason for this is that the case involves allegations of delay. As will be seen, there are many steps which need to be taken before interconnection between a new entrant and an incumbent is completed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants have exposed to scrutiny virtually every step in that process in all of the seven relevant jurisdictions. The Claimants say, in relation to many of those steps, that the relevant Defendant was guilty of delay and that that delay was in breach of a duty owed to the Claimants. The Defendants deny that they were guilty of any delay and further deny that any delay was in breach of duty. The positions taken by the parties means that I have to examine a large number of steps which were taken on the way to completion of interconnection and make my findings as to the fact of delay and whether any such delay was in breach of duty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The matter does not end there. If I were to find that the Defendants were guilty of delay in breach of a duty to the Claimants, then I need to consider the consequences of that delay. The Claimants’ case is relatively straightforward. They say that the Defendants delayed in many different respects and if all of that delay were eliminated, then interconnection would have been completed much earlier. They say that the launch of the new network in the relevant jurisdiction would have followed almost immediately on the completion of interconnection. The Defendants deny that there was any delay in breach of duty so that causation does not arise but if it were to arise, the Defendants say that the Claimants have failed to prove the necessary causal link between the breach of duty and the time when interconnection was completed. The Defendants go further. They say that even if the Defendants unlawfully delayed interconnection, the Claimants have failed to prove that a delay in interconnection delayed any of the Claimants’ launch. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The questions of causation in this case require considerable attention to be paid to all of the factors in play which caused the interconnection process to take the time which it did take. An issue which arises in some of the jurisdictions is: where the time taken to achieve interconnection was attributable to a large number of factors in combination and some of those factors did not involve any unlawful behaviour on the part of a Defendant, while other factors did involve a breach of duty, have the Claimants proved that the breaches caused delay to the completion of interconnection, or would the time for completion of interconnection have been much the same, by reasons of the factors which did not involve any breach? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is a further reason, in relation to T&amp;T, for it being necessary to set out the facts in detail. In T&amp;T, the Claimants alleged that TSTT acted dishonestly or otherwise in a reprehensible manner. That allegation is strenuously denied. The Claimants’ written closing submissions ran to some 212 pages. The Defendants retaliated with 179 pages of their own. In addition, I heard oral submissions on this point and the parties then provided further written submissions.  Further, in relation to T&amp;T, there are major issues as to the causal effect, if any, of any unlawful conduct of TSTT and whether such conduct made any difference in the event to the time when interconnection was completed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants have brought these proceedings in London in relation to events which occurred, or which principally occurred, in seven Caribbean jurisdictions. When permission to serve these proceedings out of the jurisdiction was sought and obtained, the justification for the Claimants suing in London was said to be that, at the centre of the claim, was an allegation of a conspiracy to injure the Claimants, where the seat of the conspiracy was London. The Claimants have throughout maintained that assertion except in relation to the claim in T&amp;T. There is no longer any allegation of a conspiracy in relation to the events in T&amp;T. The case in relation to T&amp;T now involves an examination of events which occurred in T&amp;T and the application of a T&amp;T statute to those events. There is no connection with the claim and England and Wales. Nonetheless, there has not been a challenge to my jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim in relation to T&amp;T. Similarly, if I were to hold that there was no conspiracy in relation to the other six jurisdictions, or that the seat of any such conspiracy was not in England and Wales, again there is no challenge to my jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters arising.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">With one exception (the point as to limitation in SLU), there is no disagreement as to the law applicable to these claims. The issues as to the extent of the obligations in relation to interconnection in a particular jurisdiction are governed by the primary and secondary legislation in that jurisdiction. The issue as to whether that primary or secondary legislation creates a cause of action for breach of statutory duty is also governed by the law of that jurisdiction. Thus, in the case of a claim by (for example) Digicel SLU for damages against CWWI for the tort of breach of statutory duty in relation to interconnection in SLU, it is clear that the claim is governed by the law of SLU. The same applies as to the law as to joint tortfeasors in relation to such a tort.  I have not been given any evidence as to the law in the various jurisdictions. This is because the parties have agreed that the principles of law which apply in those jurisdictions are identical to the principles of English law (with the exception of the argument as to the limitation point in relation to SLU, to which I refer below). Thus, when I come to construe the primary and secondary legislation in a particular jurisdiction it is agreed that I should construe the legislation as if it were legislation in England and Wales. Similarly, when considering whether a breach of a duty in the legislation is actionable, I am to apply English law. Similarly, with the principles as to the liability of joint tortfeasors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The position is not so clear in relation to the alleged tort of conspiracy. If (taking the example of SLU) C&amp;W plc and CWWI conspired together to cause damage to Digicel SLU in SLU, by the use of unlawful means in SLU, there is an issue between the parties as to whether the claim is governed by the law of SLU or some other system of law. This issue does not in general cause any difficulty because the parties are again agreed that the law as to conspiracy in the different jurisdictions, or any other system of law which might be relevant, is identical to English law. However, there is one issue where the parties are in dispute as to whether the relevant part of the claim is governed by the English law as to limitation (or possibly by Jamaican law) or conversely is governed by SLU law. If I were to hold that there was a conspiracy involving C&amp;W plc and CWWI to cause damage to Digicel SLU in SLU, the cause of action in conspiracy will be statute barred if it is governed by the law of SLU but not statute barred if it is governed by English law (or Jamaican law). Accordingly, if I reach that point, it will be necessary to decide which system of law applies.</p>

I will also refer to the Claimants collectively as “the Claimants” even where I am discussing a claim that is put forward by one of the Claimants only. It is often more convenient to do so rather than specifying on every occasion which Claimant is the relevant Claimant. As will be seen I usually find it convenient to refer to submissions made on behalf of one or other of the Claimants as “the Claimants’ submissions”.</p>

In the course of hearing that application, I raised with the parties the desirability of splitting the trial so that issues as to quantum would be tried after the trial of issues as to liability and causation. Following argument on that subject, I directed that the first trial in this action should be restricted to issues of liability and causation with any issues as to quantum to be postponed to a later stage. In particular, I directed that the issues to be tried at the first stage were (a) issues as to liability; (b) issues as to causation, including ascertaining the period of delay (if any) suffered by each Claimant to the launch of its mobile network service for which the relevant Defendant(s) is/are liable; (c) issues of principle as regards any Claimant’s entitlement to recover: (i) compensatory damages, (ii) restitutionary damages and/or an account of profits, including whether any Claimant is entitled to restitutionary damages and/or an account of profits and, if so, the basis upon which the same is to be calculated and/or assessed, and (iii) an award of exemplary damages, including whether any Claimant is entitled to exemplary damages as against any of the Defendants.

The documents which were sought were admitted to have been, initially at any rate, the subject of legal professional privilege, as they contained legal advice given to the Defendants by their lawyers. Nonetheless, it was argued that privilege in those documents had been waived. That argument was advanced on two bases. The first was that the Defendants had referred to the contents of the legal advice and had waived privilege therein. The second basis involved the assertion that the Defendants were putting forward a positive case as to their state of mind on a matter of law, in circumstances where they had received legal advice on that matter, and the result was that the Defendants had waived privilege in such legal advice. I declined to order disclosure on either basis, for the reasons given in my judgment of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2009: [2009] EWHC 1437 (Ch).</p>

Across the world, numerous state-owned telecommunications operators were privatised. A wave of pro-competitive and deregulatory telecommunications policies swept the globe. Competition was perceived to be beneficial as a spur to technological innovation, as leading to reduced prices and leading to growth in the economies of countries with advanced telecommunications. The process of opening up the market to competition was called “liberalisation”.</p>

That would mean that the customers of the new entrant could telephone other customers of the new entrant but they could not telephone customers (fixed or mobile) of the incumbent, or indeed anyone else.

On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003, CWWI entered into an interconnection agreement with Digicel SLU. This agreement consisted of the principal agreement to which were attached 6 schedules. The principal part was the Legal Framework agreement extending to 26 pages. The clauses of the Legal Framework agreement dealt with such matters as duration, the nature of interconnection, forecasting, ordering and provision of interconnection capacity, testing, operation and maintenance, charges, billing and many other matters. Schedule 1 consisted of 10 pages of Definitions. Schedule 2 consisted of 28 pages of Service Descriptions. Schedule 3 was the Service Schedule, running to 6 pages. Schedule 4 was the Parameter Schedule consisting of 4 pages. Schedule 5 was the Joint Working Manual consisting of 52 pages. Schedule 6 was the Tariff Schedule and ran to 9 pages. The tariffs set out in that schedule include a tariff for a Digicel call terminating on the CWWI fixed network (payable to CWWI), a tariff for a Digicel call terminating on the C&amp;W Caribbean Cellular (Saint Lucia) Ltd mobile network (payable to CWWI), a tariff for a CWWI call from its fixed network terminating on the Dicicel network (payable to Digicel), a tariff for a call from the C&amp;W Caribbean Cellular (Saint Lucia) Ltd mobile network terminating on the Digicel network (payable to Digicel) and a tariff for a Digicel call crossing the CWWI fixed network to terminate on a mobile network (whether the mobile network of C&amp;W Caribbean Cellular (Saint Lucia) Ltd or another network provider) (payable to CWWI). </p>

The regulator plainly has regard to interests other than the interests of the negotiating parties. An obvious example of the interests which will be considered by the regulator will be the public interest, in particular the interest of consumers in avoiding high prices. The interests of the negotiating parties and the public may well be conflicting on that question. In Barbados and TCI, the parties may enter into an interconnection agreement but the agreement must then be submitted to the regulator for its review. In Cayman, the parties  may enter into an interconnection agreement but the agreement must then be filed with the regulator who has power to reject the agreement. It is only in Trinidad and Tobago that there is no express provision in the legislation for prior approval, or subsequent review, by a regulator.</p>

I will now expand a little on that description. The fixed termination rate is paid for calls from a mobile network to the fixed network; the originating mobile network pays the termination rate to the fixed network. The mobile termination rate is paid for calls either from one mobile network to another mobile network or from a fixed network to a mobile network. The originating network pays the charge to the recipient mobile network for terminating the call. Where there is no direct interconnection between one mobile network and another mobile network (and that was the case in the jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned), it is necessary for such calls to cross or “transit” the fixed network to which both mobile networks are connected. A transit rate is in such a case payable by the originating mobile network to the fixed network. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I will next attempt to give an overview of what is involved in physical interconnection. I stress that this is only a brief summary and it may be necessary when considering what happened in the individual cases to discuss in a more technical way some of the steps involved. Nonetheless, an overview is helpful at this stage. This process can be broken down into a number of key steps.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The first step is for the representatives of the incumbent and the new entrant to exchange technical information about each other’s network. It is essential that each party understands the network topology or layout of the other’s network so that interconnection between the two networks can take place at the right level in the network hierarchy and is simple and efficient. The parties also need to assess the technical standards applied to their networks and the capacity of those networks. The two networks must be compatible or made to be compatible. This process of exchanging information should lead to the selection of an appropriate point of interconnection (“POI”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The next step is to consider the appropriate method of connecting the switch site of the incumbent to the switch site of the new entrant. This may, and usually will, involve a survey of the sites. The options to link the sites are either by a digital microwave link or by fibre optic cable. The latter method is usually preferred and was chosen in each of the cases with which I am concerned. This method of connection can be speedy if there is an easy access point on an existing fibre route but a longer period of time may be required if a new cable has to be laid between the sites. It will then be necessary to dig a trench. It may be necessary to obtain permissions and approvals from the local authority. It may even be necessary to obtain the consent of a third party land owner whose land is being crossed by the trench. There is an issue in this case as to whether the incumbent ought to have started work on digging the trench and laying the cable before the parties had entered into a binding interconnection agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The next step in relation to physical interconnection is the assessment of the equipment required to make the interconnection. The parties must first assess the capacity of the incumbent’s existing switch equipment. Additional equipment may be needed to increase that capacity to handle the traffic following interconnection. It is also necessary to consider what interconnection-specific equipment is needed. It is normally necessary to have multiplexor (“MUX”) equipment and its associated cabling. The MUX is a key piece of equipment. The parties need to assess the type of MUX and the size of MUX. The type of MUX varies with the standard applicable, American or European, but this is a simple matter to determine in any case. The type of MUX also depends on the supplier of the MUX. The size of the MUX depends on forecasts as to future volumes of traffic across the POI. In some of the jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned, there was argument as to whether a forecast from the entrant should be for a three year period or whether a forecast for a lesser period (perhaps one year) would suffice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The most usual method of interconnection involves using an existing digital distribution frame (“DDF”) or optical distribution frame (“ODF”) at the fixed network operator’s switch and at the proposed site of the entrant’s switch. This is the equipment which allows cables connected to one side of it to be routed to wiring on its other side. The incumbent’s existing equipment may have sufficient capacity or may need to be enhanced. Normally, this interconnection specific equipment for both the incumbent and for the entrant will need to be ordered from a supplier, unless there is spare equipment in store and available to either the incumbent or the entrant. If ordered from a supplier, the equipment will need to be delivered to the state in question, to clear customs and to be collected by, or delivered to, the purchaser of the equipment. There is a major issue between the parties as to whether the incumbent should have ordered the necessary equipment before the parties entered into an interconnection agreement.</p>

There is a number of very important aspects of the interconnection that need to have detailed testing before the interconnection can “go live”. The tests must be two-way tests to ensure network integrity. The tests should include the following: (1) service tests; (2) routing tests; (3) tests of the charging mechanism; (4) tests as to billing; and (5) tests of the procedures as to maintenance and error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Much of the legislation and regulations in relation to interconnection between an incumbent and a new entrant owes its origin to the 1997 WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications (formally known as the Fourth Protocol of the General Agreement on Trade in Services or “GATS”). This was the first widely accepted multilateral trade agreement to include binding interconnection rules. These rules were included in a document called the Reference Paper which set out regulatory principles negotiated and agreed by WTO members. Mr Logan, an expert witness instructed by the Claimants, prepared a report which stated that the signatories to the WTO agreement included St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago whereas Mr Webb, an expert witness instructed by the Defendants prepared a report stating that, of those five states, only Grenada, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago were bound by the terms of the Reference Paper. Those statements are not necessarily inconsistent for reasons which I need not explain and it is not essential to investigate that point of detail any further. The Reference Paper’s central principles were non-discrimination, transparency and the availability of reasonable interconnection terms, including cost-oriented rates and unbundled access from persons defined as “major suppliers” or persons with a relevant dominant position in relation to essential infrastructure. </p>

If the Claimants had wanted to say that the Defendants had failed to disclose something which they ought to have disclosed, then the proper course was for the Claimants to seek disclosure of the allegedly missing disclosable documents.  Indeed, the Claimants did make such applications and the court ruled on all such applications. There is no outstanding application by the Claimants based on an allegation that an order for disclosure has not been complied with. In these circumstances, I will proceed on the basis that this litigation is to be decided on the basis of the documents which have now been put before the court. I do not draw any inferences, one way or the other, as to what has happened to documents which might at one time have existed but which no longer exist, according to the disclosure statements of the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Defendants have claimed legal professional privilege in relation to certain classes of documents. One such class related to documents which might have revealed the legal advice given to various of the Defendants as to: (1) the existence or non-existence of an obligation to negotiate with a new entrant, on the subject of interconnection, before that new entrant had a telecommunications licence; and (2)  the existence or non-existence of an obligation to order interconnection equipment and do other things, such as civil works to join the parties’ switch sites, before the parties had entered into an interconnection agreement dealing with such matters. As I have already explained, the Claimants applied to me in the course of the trial for an order for disclosure of such documents and I rejected that application. In accordance with the established law in this area, I do not draw any adverse inferences against the Defendants by reason of the fact that they have claimed legal professional privilege. In particular, I do not reach the conclusion that the documents, if disclosed, would show something adverse to the Defendants’ case. Conversely, as the Defendants fully accept, since they have chosen not to put these documents before the court, the Defendants are not in a position to ask the court to infer that the contents of these documents support the Defendants’ case. When the Claimants made their application for disclosure of this class of documents, although I rejected the application, I was concerned that the Claimants might be placed at a disadvantage because they were facing an allegation by the Defendants that some of the Defendants had an honest belief as to the legal position, in relation to the existence or non-existence of the obligations referred to above, but yet the Claimants would not be able to see, and cross-examine upon, relevant documents. I was also concerned as to the ability of the court to make findings of fact on the alleged honest belief in this respect when the court was not able to see documents which might be relevant to such findings. As it has turned out, I have made findings on this question of honest belief and I did not find it difficult to do so. I have fully taken into account the fact that the Claimants were not able to cross-examine witnesses by reference to such documents. However, in making my findings, I was assisted by the inherent probabilities of the matter and the conduct of the individuals concerned and the degree to which that conduct was consistent with the existence of such a belief.</p>

All of the documents disclosed were copied electronically and a hard disk containing all of the electronic copies was provided to the court. This source was also used for the purpose of cross-examining witnesses. I was provided with a screen on which was displayed any document being put to a witness. The witness and counsel and the solicitors also were provided with screens. This meant that it was not necessary to prepare a witness bundle containing these documents. I indicated at an early stage that electronic copies of documents would not suffice for my purposes. The Claimants had anticipated this indication by preparing for my use, some 50 or so lever arch files of these documents, in addition to many other files containing pleadings, witness statements, experts’ reports and yet further documents. In the course of the trial further documents were regularly supplied to be placed in the 50 or so files to which I have referred. When the parties prepared closing submissions, they added to the documents which had earlier been provided. The Claimants provided three further lever arch files and the Defendants provided one further file. In the course of considering my judgment, I asked the parties to make further submissions which provoked the delivery of another file of documents, in addition to the submissions. </p>

When the court is provided with bundles of documents, the court can, if it thinks it is appropriate, read documents in those bundles even though they are not referred to in the course of the trial, either by the witnesses or by counsel. It is sometimes useful for the court to see what happened before and what happened after a particular event, which is examined in detail at the trial, even though the parties do not themselves invite the court to review that material. In this case, I have read documents in the bundles in addition to the documents to which I was specifically referred. I have made my findings on the documents which are in the bundles which were provided to me. However, I considered it to be impracticable and disproportionate to make any attempt to explore what was in the tens of thousands of pages of documents which existed in electronic form on the disk supplied to me, when such pages had not been provided in the court bundles.</p>

On some issues of fact, these internal documents were of great assistance to me in seeking to discover what was really going on, what people really thought and what their motives were. It was possible to contrast statements made for internal consumption with statements made to the other party to the dispute or to a regulator or to a government minister or official. Speaking generally, the internal comment was likely to be more reliable than any public statement on the same subject. This comment is not only applicable to statements which are adverse to a particular party’s interest. If it is said that a particular person was acting or failing to act for a reason hostile to the opposing party and the contemporaneous internal documents clearly show the reverse, I believe that I am entitled to rely upon the supportive documents to make my findings on the issue. The internal documents, which were not prepared to be used as self serving documents, are not to be dismissed on account of the fact that they support the case now being put forward by the maker of the document.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In this litigation, there have been very many allegations that representatives of the Defendants said one thing to the Claimants or publicly, but privately acted in a different way. For example, it is said by the Claimants that more or less throughout the relevant period the Defendants were plotting to cause delay to the Claimants while at the same time the Defendants were protesting that they welcomed the arrival of competition and were doing all that they properly could to facilitate interconnection and the resulting competition. Further, many witnesses for the Defendants said in evidence that they were in favour of competition and wished to facilitate interconnection. On an issue such as that, I have obviously looked closely at the Defendants’ internal documents in order to form an assessment of the situation. I have also been on my guard against the possibility that any plotting which might have been going on is obscured from the court under the cloak of legal professional privilege. It is a fact that legal advisers were involved with some of the matters in dispute and legal professional privilege has been claimed for communications between the legal advisers and others. I do not draw any adverse inference against the Defendants because of the assertion of this privilege. Nonetheless, I believe that I am entitled to bear in mind, when I consider the internal documents of the Defendants and seek to compare those documents with the external statements and conduct of the Defendants, that I may not have been given a complete set of all internal documents, privilege in some having been successfully claimed.</p>

I will discuss the position of Mr Francis, Ms Turner and Mr Taylor separately below. The other witnesses for the Claimants were generally persons who were acting as employees or officers of the Claimants at the relevant time. The Defendants made sustained and sometimes fierce attacks on the credibility of these other witnesses for the Claimants. It is not necessary to set out at this point my assessment of such witnesses. As it turns out, when making my findings of fact, I was not very often required to consider the evidence of the Claimants’ witnesses. There were some disputes of fact which I have to resolve and on which these witnesses gave evidence. It is more helpful to leave any necessary assessment of such a witness until the point in this judgment where I address the necessary finding of fact on the issue. As will appear, it has not even then generally been necessary to form a view as to the reliability of these witnesses for the Claimants because the resolution of the issue of fact is usually possible by reference to the documents. Even if a witness is shown by the documents to have misremembered some matter of fact, that does not mean that the evidence of that witness is entirely to be discounted. These witnesses for the Claimants spoke of their frustration at what they saw as the delaying tactics of the various Defendants. These witnesses offered their views as to the motives or other intentions of the representatives of the Defendants. If the motives or the intentions of the Defendants are relevant in this case, then it is for the court to make findings based on the evidence of such representatives, their cross-examination and the documents. I am not assisted by the opinions of the Claimants’ witnesses as to what they think should be the appropriate findings of fact based on that material. I am of course assisted by the submissions of counsel for the Claimants but not by what are essentially the submissions of the Claimants’ witnesses. In any event, many of these witnesses were caught up in the events at the time and they tended to be influenced by the feelings of hostility which were running at the relevant time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants called Mr Pinkley Francis who had been employed by CWWI from a date in the 1990s until September 2005. From 2000 to 2004, Mr Francis worked in the Carrier Services Team as Service Provider Operations Manager in the OECS. He was involved with the interconnection negotiations in SLU and SVG and attended a number of meetings with Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG. Although Mr Francis was dismissed by CWWI in 2005 for misconduct, it was not suggested by the Defendants in their closing submissions that Mr Francis’s evidence should be rejected on that account. The Defendants accepted that “for the most part”, he was a straightforward witness. They said that his evidence was of limited relevance. I have certainly no difficulty in accepting parts of his evidence. He referred to the steps which the CWWI business unit in SLU took to compete with the new entrant Digicel SLU. I find that the business unit wanted the new entrant to enter the market later, rather than earlier. In particular, it wanted the new entrant to enter after, rather than before, Christmas 2002. In the period before the entry into the market of Digicel SLU, the business unit wanted to improve its competitive position. This attitude is exactly what one would expect of the business unit facing the likelihood of new competition. I also accept Mr Francis’s evidence to the effect that the carrier services team would have been aware of the general aspirations of the business unit in this respect. As it was reasonably obvious that the business unit would want Digicel SLU to enter the market later, rather than earlier, then this is likely to have been obvious to the carrier services team also. Mr Francis also said that the approach of the carrier services team to the interconnection negotiations with Digicel SLU was one of “orchestrated inefficiency”. There are two aspects to this statement. The first is that the carrier services team was inefficient; the second is that the inefficiency was orchestrated. Dealing first with the suggested inefficiency of the team, I will in due course examine the detailed allegations which the Claimants make as to the progress of the negotiations in SLU and SVG. When I do so, I will bear in mind Mr Francis’s assessment that the carrier services team was inefficient. The second allegation is that the inefficiency was deliberate and on the part of more than one person and “orchestrated”. Mr Francis’s detailed evidence supported his suggestion that the inefficiency was deliberate, and on the part of more than one person, but did little to support his suggestion that the inefficiency was orchestrated. A fair reading of his evidence was to the effect that it was obvious that an incumbent, negotiating interconnection with a potential new entrant, would not want to put itself out to help speed up the process of interconnection. His evidence does not support the conclusion that this attitude on the part of members of the carrier services team was the result of discussion and agreement or combination and conspiracy. Rather it was simply that it was obvious to all members of the team that that was a desirable attitude to adopt. In any event, whether the carrier services team or others in SLU and SVG did cause delay and/or set out to cause delay will be the subject of detailed examination when I consider the detailed allegations as to SLU and SVG and I will approach the evidence bearing in mind Mr Francis’ comments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants called Ms Vonciel Turner who had been employed within the C&amp;W group of companies. It is not precisely clear which C&amp;W company was her employer at any particular time. She worked for a C&amp;W company from approximately July 2001 to May 2003, although her contract of employment continued until August 2003. Ms Turner gave evidence over a video link from the United States. The Defendants say that Ms Turner was over-confident, over-bearing and bombastic. They add that she was inspired by animosity towards C&amp;W, had a selective recall and misunderstood what was involved in the interconnection process. I find that I can accept much of what Ms Turner said. Much of what she said is inherently likely and rings true. However, she had comparatively little to say about the interconnection process as distinct from the wider subject of competition between the relevant C&amp;W company and the relevant Digicel company. In so far as her evidence bears upon the interconnection process, it is somewhat general and I do have some reservations about the accuracy of her generalisations. I think I ought to bear her general evidence in mind but test it against the specific evidence which describes the detail of what happened in relation to a particular feature of interconnection which is now a matter of complaint by the Claimants. I think there is force in the Defendants’ criticism that Ms Turner was over ready to describe matters, which were open to interpretation, in a way which was unfavourable to the Defendants. I think it is likely that her attitude to C&amp;W is influenced by a feeling that she was not well treated by C&amp;W, when she worked for them. Based on her evidence, I am prepared to accept that the C&amp;W business units saw themselves as on a war footing with Digicel as the likely new entrant. The C&amp;W business units were determined to prepare themselves for the very stiff competition which Digicel would bring. The C&amp;W business units saw competition as more of a threat than an opportunity, although Ms Turner herself tried to persuade the business units of the positive consequences of competition. The business units would have liked Digicel to enter the market later, rather than earlier. The business units wanted to use the time until such market entry to prepare themselves for competition from Digicel. Ms Turner stressed that the carrier services department were supposed to be separated from the business units by a Chinese Wall. I accept her evidence that the Chinese Wall was not a wholly effective barrier to communication between carrier services and the business unit and that the carrier services team probably knew of the attitudes of the business units in relation to competition. I can readily make that finding because the attitudes of the business units were entirely predictable and it is likely that with or without a Chinese Wall, the carrier services team would have worked out what those attitudes were. I also find that the business units were aware that the carrier services team were, generally, not prepared to negotiate interconnection with a possible new entrant until that new entrant had obtained a formal licence to provide a telecommunications service and that the carrier services team were not prepared to order the equipment needed for the C&amp;W side of the interconnection until the parties had agreed the terms as to interconnection. The business units welcomed those stances on the part of the carrier services team because they did nothing to advance the time when the Digicel would enter the relevant market. Based on Ms Turner’s evidence, I am not able to find that the carrier services team declined to give information to Digicel SLU or SVG after those companies had obtained their licences; her evidence appeared to describe the situation before the licences were granted. As regards her suggestion that the carrier services team would deliberately spin out the negotiations by causing difficulties with personnel being unavailable for meetings and/or sending unauthorised personnel to the negotiations with Digicel, I will bear that in mind when I consider the specific evidence as to what happened at specific meetings. I am very doubtful about her evidence that the carrier services team proposed unreasonable rates and/or terms for the principal purpose of causing delay but I will again keep it in mind when I consider the specific evidence which is relevant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants called Mr Kevin Taylor in connection with the claim in relation to T&amp;T. At the relevant time, Mr Taylor had been employed by Nortel who was to supply interconnection equipment and other equipment to TSTT. In March 2009, Mr Taylor had given evidence on deposition in Florida when he was cross-examined by counsel for TSTT. Initially, the Claimants stated that they intended to rely upon the evidence given by Mr Taylor on that occasion. Later, the Claimants stated that they would tender Mr Taylor for cross-examination by TSTT at this trial. Later still, the Claimants delivered a witness statement signed by Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor was called as a witness, cross-examined and re-examined. He gave evidence on a number of topics which are relevant in relation to T&amp;T. I discuss all of that evidence in detail in Annex F to this judgment, dealing with the claim in relation to T&amp;T. One of the topics dealt with by Mr Taylor concerned  a day on which there was an alleged conversation which Mr Taylor heard taking place between Ms Bejar of Nortel and Mr Espinal, the CEO of TSTT, followed by a conversation between Ms Bejar and Mr Taylor, followed by a conversation between Mr Taylor and a Mr Davy of Nortel. Mr Taylor’s account of these events conflicted with the evidence of Mr Davy, who was called as a witness by TSTT. The nature of the dispute of fact is such that either Mr Taylor or Mr Davy is wrong in his evidence. Indeed, I find that there is no real possibility of one of these witnesses being wrong as a result of faulty recollection. The witness who is giving incorrect evidence must be doing so deliberately. As between Mr Taylor and Mr Davy, I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of Mr Taylor. I find that Mr Davy had a substantial motive for giving untruthful evidence. It is possible that Mr Taylor had an incentive to give evidence on behalf of the Claimants but I think it is very unlikely that Mr Taylor would have deliberately given untruthful evidence on these issues. Further, Mr Taylor’s evidence is supported by other contemporaneous material. In addition, when Mr Espinal was cross-examined, he provided further material, albeit somewhat reluctantly, which supports Mr Taylor’s version. Mr Taylor also gave evidence on a question as to whether Nortel was in a position in late 2005 to expedite the manufacture and delivery of equipment ordered by TSTT for interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T. In relation to parts of this evidence, I found Mr Taylor’s evidence less reliable. I find that he was basing himself to a significant extent on his reading of documents which are material to this issue and less on his recollection of any involvement he might have had in the relevant events at the time. I will base my findings on this part of the case on my own reading of the relevant documents and any other reliable evidence and not on what Mr Taylor has said about that matter. This approach does not necessarily apply to more general evidence which Mr Taylor gave about the difficulty of assessing whether Nortel could, in certain hypothetical circumstances, have manufactured and delivered interconnection equipment more quickly than it actually did.  It can be said against Mr Taylor that the part of his evidence, which was based on his reading of the documents and which might not be right, diminishes his reliability on other matters, such as the conversations I have referred to above. I agree that this is so. Nonetheless, although I have been cautious for this reason amongst others about believing Mr Taylor on his evidence about the relevant conversations, I still conclude that that part of his evidence is reliable and certainly to be preferred to the evidence of Mr Davy. I discuss the evidence on all these matters in more detail in Annex F to this judgment. </p>

I will discuss the evidence of Mr Barnes, Mr Espinal and Mr Davy separately below. I will make some general comments as to the other witnesses called by the Defendants, without mentioning all of them by name. Many of these witnesses appeared reasonable and measured in their oral evidence. They were cross-examined at length about the various allegations in this litigation. It was put to them that they had a motive to cause delay to the Claimants, that they deliberately did cause delay to the Claimants and that they repeatedly made statements to the Claimants and to the regulator and to government ministers and officials pretending to welcome competition and to be ready to facilitate interconnection, which statements did not represent their true intentions or views.  Speaking generally, in their oral evidence, these witnesses adhered to the public views they expressed at the time. Where it is relevant to make findings as to the true motives and intentions of these witnesses when involved in the relevant events, I will pay far more attention to the contemporaneous internal documents which throw light on those matters than to the way matters were described in evidence from these witnesses. If those internal documents show that the public statements did not represent the true intentions of a witness, then I will give more weight to the internal documents than I will give to the public statements which were made and, similarly, than I will give to repetitions in evidence at the trial of the public statements made at the time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As regards the Defendants’ business units, I think that it is inherently likely that the business units wanted to see a new entrant enter the market later, rather than earlier. First of all, I think that that attitude is to be expected. Secondly, in most if not all of the jurisdictions, there were specific reasons why the incumbent business unit wanted time to get itself more ready than it previously was to face competition. The Digicel  company, which was the intended new entrant in each case, was well understood to be likely to be a formidable competitor. The incumbent business unit was usually handicapped by the fact that it had been the monopoly provider in the past and had not previously been challenged by competition. There were often technical matters concerning its network that needed attention before the incumbent business unit would feel itself ready to face competition. </p>

I find that it was the preference of the carrier services team that interconnection should be completed later, rather than earlier. One of the reasons that the carrier services team had for not negotiating with a possible new entrant before that new entrant had a licence, was that this approach would cause interconnection to happen later, rather than earlier. I do not say that this was the only reason. It was possible for the carrier services team to put forward other reasons for this attitude and they did so. Some of those other reasons may have been genuinely believed by the carrier services team. But that does not negative my finding that one of the reasons was the desirability, as they saw it, of interconnection happening later, rather than earlier.</p>

I will in due course make a finding that C&amp;W plc was not involved in the detailed steps in the interconnection process. The senior management of C&amp;W plc left such details to the carrier services team and, to the extent appropriate, to the business units. Some senior management of C&amp;W plc may very well have seen competition as a good thing. Others may have regarded it as inevitable so that it was not worth their while bothering with the question whether it would happen a little bit later or a little bit sooner. At this stage, I record my finding that in the case of the senior management of C&amp;W plc, I do not approach the evidence with any expectation that they wished to postpone the completion of interconnection and the arrival of competition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Defendants called Mr Barnes as a witness. He was a highly qualified technical member of the CWWI carrier services team. His evidence is relevant in a number of the jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned. The Claimants were critical in a number of specific respects of Mr Barnes’s conduct at the time and of his evidence at the trial. In particular, the Claimants said that Mr Barnes had behaved improperly and untruthfully in relation to Cayman. I have therefore had to assess Mr Barnes’ evidence on a large number of topics. I have available to me a considerable amount of internal documentation involving Mr Barnes at the relevant time and throwing light on his behaviour and the reasons for it. With the assistance of that material, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Barnes generally behaved in a very responsible fashion and not with a view to delaying the Digicel new entrant for the purpose of gaining a benefit through such delay. I will discuss the detailed findings of fact I make in relation to Mr Barnes, including in respect of Cayman, when I consider the detailed evidence on the matters of complaint.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr Espinal was the CEO of TSTT. His evidence is only relevant in relation to the case concerning T&amp;T, but there it is of central relevance. As will be seen, I will have to consider Mr Espinal’s evidence in detail and to decide how much of it I can accept. Mr Espinal was plainly highly intelligent. Although his first language was Spanish, he had a very good grasp of English. Much of his evidence was quite frank about TSTT’s desire to have time to get itself ready for competition with Digicel T&amp;T. However, I do not think that Mr Espinal was prepared to be candid in all respects when giving evidence. I found that he tended to give explanations which were designed to draw the focus away from the real point in issue and he would decline to accept things which were obviously correct. An example of this tendency came at the very beginning of his evidence. Mr Espinal gave oral evidence in chief in addition to the evidence contained in his witness statement. The reason he was asked to do so was that during the trial, before Mr Espinal was called to give evidence, the Defendants disclosed documents which had not earlier been disclosed. These documents included appraisals of the performance of a number of employees of TSTT, including Ms Agard and Mr Kurleigh Prescod. The self-assessement part of Ms Agard’s appraisal included under “Performance Highlights” the comment: “Successfully delayed the introduction of interconnection”. Under the heading “Targets Missed” was the comment: “Competition delayed the ability to sell interconnection services but has resulted in an enormous benefit to the Company overall”. The parties agreed that this last comment should be understood as if it were preceded by the words: “Lack of” or “Delay in”. Ms Agard’s self-assessment was written by her in March 2006 and it was shown to Mr Espinal at that time. The appraisal documents in relation to Mr Prescod contained the same comments in relation to his performance and his missed targets. His appraisal form was counter-signed by Ms Agard in May 2006. These appraisals clearly showed that TSTT had wished to delay interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T and had believed that it had been successful in achieving that delay. It is also clear to me that these comments correctly described the situation.  It is apparent from the documents before the court that TSTT did not do things which it could have done which would or might have brought forward the time when Digicel T&amp;T were ready to launch in T&amp;T. An obvious example is that when Digicel T&amp;T requested interconnection as early as 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2005, TSTT responded that it would be premature to discuss interconnection. Of course, TSTT was right in the sense that it was not at that stage under a legal obligation to discuss interconnection but the principal reason for not discussing interconnection was that TSTT did not at that stage wish to take action to bring forward the date of Digicel T&amp;T’s launch. As I have described, Mr Espinal was asked about the appraisal documents when giving evidence in chief. He explained at great length how the appraisal system worked. This explanation was obviously designed to suggest that the comments in the appraisal documents, to which I have referred, were somehow not significant and they could be ignored in this litigation. To my mind, this evidence was largely pointless and did nothing to encourage me to be receptive to other explanations which Mr Espinal gave, instead of facing up to the real issue which needed to be addressed. I bear in mind, in Mr Espinal’s favour, that the questions in examination in chief were selected by counsel and it was Mr Espinal’s job to answer the specific questions put to him. However, I do not on that ground acquit Mr Espinal of what I have described as the tendency to give explanations which were a distraction from the real point. When he was cross-examined directly about the appraisals, he built on his evidence in chief about the way in which the system worked and avoided the real point which clearly emerged from the appraisals. Given that the case which is made against Mr Espinal is that he said one thing publicly, and privately thought and did the reverse, I was very much on my guard as to whether I was also being treated to self justificatory explanations which were not wholly candid. As will be seen, when I consider the detailed evidence in relation to T&amp;T, I have not felt able to accept everything that Mr Espinal told me. Indeed, I find in that part of the judgment that Mr Espinal acted “contrary to honest practices”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The last witness to whom I refer is Mr Tony Davy, called by the Defendants. I have considered something of his position when discussing the evidence of Mr Taylor, called by the Claimants. I am satisfied that Mr Davy deliberately lied to me about the conversation he had with Mr Taylor about Mr Espinal’s instruction to Ms Bejar of Nortel that Nortel was to provide for interconnection between TSTT and the new entrants, not earlier and not later than the end of March 2006. I find that Mr Davy gave untruthful evidence out of a desire to help TSTT, which he regarded as being in his own interests also. Mr Davy gave further evidence on other topics. Although I will reject his evidence on the conversation he had with Mr Taylor and topics closely associated with that evidence, it does not necessarily follow that I must reject his evidence on all points. For example, he gave evidence which I will have to consider in relation to the issue whether Nortel were in a position in late 2005 to bring forward the date of delivery of interconnection equipment to TSTT. I can unreservedly accept one statement which I find Mr Davy did make to Mr Taylor, although Mr Davy denied it in evidence, that he would “sell guns to the Indians”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr Logan stated that the answer to the question posed was a minimum period of seven weeks and a maximum period of thirteen weeks. He identified six specific assumptions which he made for the purpose of answering the question posed. In particular, he assumed that the parties involved in the interconnection process were reasonable commercial parties negotiating in good faith and were not intent on delaying the interconnection process. In the course of his report he stated that if the parties were having difficulty in agreeing termination rates (the tariffs) then it would be reasonable for them to enter into an interim agreement which allowed interconnection to take place, with the final position on the termination rates to become established by further negotiation or in some other way. He also stated that it would be reasonable for the incumbent to carry out the necessary civil works before conclusion of the negotiation of the interconnection agreement. Similarly, he stated that it would be reasonable for the incumbent to order the interconnection equipment before the conclusion of those negotiations. Indeed, he added that it would not be rational to wait for the conclusion of the negotiations in respect of the interconnection agreement. In a joint statement issued by the 3 experts, Mr Logan added, in relation to the assumption to be made about the attitude of the parties, to which I have referred above, that the commitment of both parties to conclude the interconnection agreement was key to their joint success in the future. He took the view that reasonable parties would conduct hard but fair negotiations, but not obstruct the process, and they would be aware that they would both benefit from a timely conclusion to the negotiations.</p>

He stated that physical interconnection was a complex process requiring exchange of detailed information, careful planning, construction, testing and implementation. He identified a number of factors which could impact on the time taken to complete the process. Accordingly, he concluded that it was not possible to set firm minimum or maximum periods for physical interconnection. He referred to experience in various other countries, mentioning one case which took three months and another which took twelve months. He suggested that a more typical time scale would be in the region of five to seven months.</p>

Mr Webb dealt with these incentives in some detail. It was not submitted that his comments on those matters were inadmissible on the ground that they were not truly expert evidence. It might have been said in response to any such challenge that Mr Webb was able to describe his experience of a large number of interconnection negotiations around the world. In any event, I found his comments useful in seeking to understand the reasons for the behaviour of the various participants in the interconnection process. Further, I found his comments well expressed and apposite in relation to the detailed events which occurred in the jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned. Although the passage is a lengthy one, it is useful to set out an extract from Mr Webb’s report which records his view as to these incentives. Mr Webb wrote: </p>

As noted above, the prevailing model for interconnection negotiations as reflected in the WTO Reference Paper, the EU Directives and the APEC Principles  is  one  where  the  incumbent  operator  is  obliged  to  provide interconnection to an entrant in a timely fashion. This model relies upon direct negotiations between the parties, commonly with the backdrop of a RIO  and  of  general  principles  for  interconnection  either  set  out  in legislation  or  prescribed  by  the  national  regulator.  Should  the negotiations fail, either party may request the regulator to intervene. The form of intervention may include a direction from the regulator to resume negotiations  or  to  complete  negotiations  within  a  prescribed  period,  or alternatively,  or  as  well  as,  mediation,  arbitration,  or  a  regulatory determination of the matters in dispute. </span>

Faced with a legal obligation to interconnect, coupled with obligations to negotiate in good faith and to provide interconnection in a timely fashion, an  incumbent  fixed  network  operator  providing  both  wholesale  access services  and  retail  services  has  an  incentive  to  comply  with  those obligations and to avoid losing influence over the negotiation process as a  result  of  a  compliance  failure.  In  addition,  where  governments  are committed  to  market  liberalization,  as  in  the  territories,  incumbent operators  face  a  material  reputational  risk  if  they  should  fail  to  achieve physical and contractual interconnection with credible entrants . [Footnote: In  my  experience,  it  is  common  for  entrants  to  actively  use  the  media  and  to  lobby  politicians  and  officials  with complaints concerning the pace of interconnection negotiations.] </span>

As I have noted above, generally, the most difficult commercial issue to be resolved in contractual interconnection is the charge to be made by a terminating  operator  to  the  originating  operator  for  the  termination  of  a call. I am instructed that in each of the territories, there were three main termination  rates  to  be  negotiated:  termination  on  the  relevant  Cable  &amp; Wireless  fixed  network  of  a  call  from  a  Digicel  mobile  customer  to  a Cable  &amp; Wireless  fixed  customer  (fixed  termination);  termination  on  the relevant  Cable  &amp;  Wireless  mobile  network   of  a  call  from  a  Digicel mobile  customer  to  a  Cable  &amp;  Wireless  mobile  customer  or  vice  versa (mobile-to-mobile  termination);  and  termination  on  the  Digicel  mobile network  of  a  call  from  a  Cable  &amp;  Wireless  fixed  customer  to  a  Digicel mobile customer (fixed-to-mobile termination).   [Footnote: I am instructed that in each of the territories, Cable &amp; Wireless offered only interconnection with its fixed network.  As a result, calls from a Digicel mobile customer to a Cable &amp; Wireless mobile customer would transit the fixed network before  termination  on  the  Cable  &amp;  Wireless  mobile  network.    Calls  originating  from  a  Cable  &amp;  Wireless  mobile customer to a Digicel mobile customer would be handled in the same manner and would transit the Cable &amp; Wireless fixed network before presentation to Digicel for termination.] </span>

Mobile-to-mobile  and  fixed-to-mobile  termination  rates  are  commonly  the  same,  absent  regulatory intervention,  as  both  call  types  make  the  same  use  of  the  terminating mobile  network.

This incentive  reflects  the  potential  benefits  of  market  entry  at  a  time  that  is favourable to the entrant, such as prior to an important marketing period, or  prior  to  the  potential  entry  of  other  competitors.  It also reflects  the benefit of earlier revenues to offset set-up costs. It would be rational for an  incumbent  operator  to  use  the  incentive  of  the  entrant  to  conclude negotiations  by  withholding  agreement  on  issues  where  an  improved outcome from the perspective of the incumbent may be available. </span>

Second,  entry  will  inevitably  reduce  the  market  share  of  the  incumbent operator  and  will  probably  lead  to  a  reduction  in  retail  margins  as  price competition erodes monopoly rents. The length of the bargaining process determines the monopoly rents retained by the incumbent operator. The incumbent  operator  has  a  weak  incentive  to  support  interconnection for the  opportunity  to  receive  interconnection  revenue,  but  this  is  typically outweighed by the benefits of later competitor market entry. Competition will  usually  also  expand  the  market  through  the  introduction  of  pricing and  service  differentiation  to  target  under-served  potential  users. Again though, it would be rational for an incumbent operator to seek to retain its market dominance and monopoly rents for as long as possible within the requirements of the law and the regulatory framework.  </span>

The  trade-off between  the  incentive  of  the  incumbent  operator  to  preserve  its monopoly position for as long as possible and that of the entrant to refer a dispute to the regulator is the middle ground that will generally result in an agreed, rather than a regulated, outcome.  </span>

I will only be required to consider what is “reasonable” behaviour, if on the true construction of the legislation in question there is a legal duty on the incumbent to act in a reasonable way. If the legal duty is expressed in different terms, then I must address myself to those terms to assess whether the incumbent has complied with its duty or whether it has crossed the line into committing a breach of its duty. </p>

There did not seem to be much difference between the parties as to the meaning of the three verbs, “refuse”, “obstruct”, “impede”. Although section 46(1) is clearly expressed, as a matter of language, as a negative prohibition on refusing, obstructing or impeding, both sides in this litigation proceeded on the basis that section 46(1) in substance imposed positive obligations on CWWI. The Claimants submitted that the duty created by section 46(1) was a duty on CWWI to provide the specialist equipment needed to be installed at a CWWI switch site for the purpose of completing CWWI’s end of physical interconnection. As regards the specialist equipment needed for the Digicel SLU end of the interconnection, the Claimants did not suggest that CWWI was obliged to provide that equipment; the Claimants accepted that it was for Digicel SLU to provide that equipment. The Defendants accepted that CWWI was obliged, at an appropriate time and, in particular, after an interconnection agreement had been entered into, to provide the specialist equipment needed for the CWWI end of the physical interconnection. Both parties appear to agree that CWWI’s duty to provide this equipment could extend to a duty to identify the equipment which was needed, to order that equipment, to pay for that equipment, to take delivery of the same, to install the same and to test the same. </p>

The Claimants stressed the use of the word “making” in section 46(1). This was said to be a strong pointer to the conclusion that the subsection was dealing with physical interconnection only. The Claimants also referred to section 46(4), pursuant to which the parties were to agree a date when interconnection would be effected; it was suggested that such a provision made good sense if it applied only to physical interconnection but made less sense, or no sense, if it applied to both physical and contractual interconnection. The Claimants also referred to the different words used in other parts of the 2000 Act which referred to “interconnection service” rather than “interconnection”; it was suggested that a reference to interconnection service was apt where the physical equipment used in the interconnection was operating to permit the carriage of live traffic. Conversely, it was argued, the word “interconnection” referred to physical interconnection alone. The Claimants also submitted that section 48, dealing with the costs of establishing any interconnection, was dealing only with physical interconnection and that demonstrated that the word “interconnection” was confined to physical interconnection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Defendants, as I have indicated, submitted that “interconnection” in section 46(1) of the Act and in regulation 5 referred to both physical and contractual interconnection. The Defendants also drew my attention to various other provisions in the 2000 Act and in the regulations. They dealt with the various linguistic points made by the Claimants. They drew attention to section 46(7) of the 2000 Act which refers to “providing an interconnection service in accordance with this section”. They submitted that “an interconnection service” must entail the passing of live commercial traffic and that was only permissible when there had been an interconnection agreement: see section 47(1). Section 46(7) referred to the service being provided “in accordance with this section” i.e. in accordance with section 46. The Defendants submitted that that was a clear pointer to section 46(1) creating a duty as to the provision of an interconnection service with the result that section 46(1) was not confined to physical interconnection to the exclusion of contractual interconnection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Before attempting to resolve this difference as to the scope of the duty imposed by section 46(1) of the Act and regulation 5, it is useful to consider the fact that section 46(1) of the Act is expressed as a negative prohibition rather than as a positive obligation. On any view, section 46(1) is not well drafted. In fact, it is not wholly grammatical. Section 46(1) seems to impose three negative prohibitions. The first prohibition is that a telecommunications provider “shall not refuse… another telecommunications provider from making an interconnection…”. The second prohibition is that a telecommunications provider “shall not obstruct… another telecommunications provider from making an interconnection”. The third prohibition is that a telecommunications provider “shall not… in any way impede another telecommunications provider from making an interconnection”. It would have been more grammatical for the subsection to say that a provider should not refuse a request from another provider to make an interconnection and to refer to a provider not obstructing or impeding another provider in making an interconnection. Alternatively, the subsection might have stated that the provider should not “prevent” another provider from making an interconnection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The second comment is that if section 46(1) is construed literally as a negative prohibition, CWWI’s compliance with that prohibition i.e. not refusing, obstructing or impeding Digicel SLU would suggest a result whereby Digicel SLU could make an interconnection with CWWI’s network. That result would only follow if Digicel SLU had a pre-existing right to make an interconnection which was not to be refused or obstructed or impeded by CWWI. Of course, as a matter of general law, Digicel SLU did not have a pre-existing right to install specialist equipment at CWWI’s switch site. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have therefore considered whether the 2000 Act conferred such a right upon Digicel SLU. Although this argument was not relied upon by either party, it is possible that section 50(1) (notwithstanding its somewhat limited heading) would allow Digicel SLU to go to CWWI’s switch site and install equipment at that switch site for the purpose of interconnecting Digicel SLU’s network with CWWI’s network. Section 50(1) refers to a “site”. That word is defined in section 4 of the 2000 Act to refer to land or a building on land or a structure on land. If section 50(1) were to be interpreted to give Digicel SLU the right to go to CWWI’s switch site in that way, then section 46(1) could be construed literally to impose on CWWI a negative prohibition on any obstructing or impeding of Digicel SLU, in the exercise of that right. Read that way, section 46(1) would not impose a positive obligation on CWWI at any time to order, install and test specialist equipment to use at CWWI’s end of physical interconnection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have also considered whether section 46(1) might be read as dealing primarily, if not exclusively, with contractual interconnection so that the duty upon CWWI, if there were to be such a duty, to order, install and test specialist equipment at its end of the interconnection would be a duty undertaken as one of the express terms of an interconnection agreement rather than a duty imposed by the statute itself. </p>

The Defendants have been prepared to accept that section 46(1) refers to physical interconnection as well as contractual interconnection and have further been prepared to accept that section 46(1) imposes on the Defendant a positive obligation, at an appropriate stage in the process, to order, install and test the equipment at its end of the physical interconnection. Accordingly, I will now make my choice between the stances adopted by the parties in this case and give my reasons for that choice. </p>

The definition of “interconnection” in section 4 of the 2000 Act is the connection of two systems etc “involving a physical link or interface”. I read “involving” in the sense that interconnection must contain a physical link or interface as a necessary part. That does not mean that interconnection refers only to that physical link and not to anything else. If it had been intended to define “interconnection” to refer only to the physical link the definition would have been expressed so that interconnection meant “the physical link or interface between two or more separate telecommunications systems etc.”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The principal difficulty with the Claimants’ construction of section 46(1) is that, if the Claimants were right, then the Act would not have imposed on the incumbent network operator any duty in relation to contractual interconnection. If the Claimants were right, the incumbent would be obliged to provide physical interconnection between the two networks but then could refuse absolutely to agree any terms for interconnection and, in the absence of an agreement as to those terms, the incumbent could refuse to permit the passage of live traffic from the new entrant onto the incumbent’s network. If that were the result, it would be clear that the Act had failed to achieve what was evidently its object, namely, to produce an outcome whereby the new entrant could pass live traffic through the interconnection onto the incumbent’s network. When this point was put to the Claimants in argument, they appeared to accept that this was the result of their argument. Indeed, I understood them to accept this was the position under the regulations also, although I think that is less clear.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants appeared to be relatively unconcerned about a conclusion to the effect that the Act did not achieve anything in relation to contractual interconnection. That was because it suited the Claimants’ case, as they saw it, to make their principal attack on the Defendants that the Defendants had failed to achieve physical interconnection as required by section 46(1), because the Defendants had refused to take any step towards physical interconnection and, in particular, had refused to order the necessary equipment, until the parties had negotiated the terms of an interconnection agreement. Although the Claimants’ construction of the provisions might suit the Claimants’ purpose in the present litigation, a court when construing these provisions should consider which of the rival constructions makes better sense, having regard to the evident purpose of the provisions. In this way, I readily conclude that the Claimants’ construction is difficult to justify when measured against the purpose of these provisions and the court would only be minded to accept the Claimants’ construction if it were driven so to do. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I do not feel driven to accept the Claimants’ interpretation of section 46(1). I do not regard the reference to “making an interconnection” in section 46(1) as being expressed in such clear terms that it is restricted to physical interconnection only. In any event, the grammatical infelicity of section 46(1) does not encourage me to place undue weight upon the word “making” alone. The reference in section 46(4) to the parties agreeing a date when interconnection will be effected might be thought to be a little unrealistic, whether the section is dealing with physical interconnection alone or with both physical and contractual interconnection. In the case of physical interconnection, to some extent, matters could be outside the complete control of the network owner. The equipment may have to be ordered from a third party supplier. The fact that section 46 and other sections refer, some of the time, to “interconnection” and other times to an “interconnection service” is a point which merits consideration but, at the end of the day, I do not find there to be such clarity in the various uses of those phrases as to restrict “interconnection” to physical interconnection only. Indeed, section 46(7) proceeds on the basis that an “interconnection service” is to be provided in accordance with section 46 which, elsewhere, refers to making or effecting an “interconnection”.</p>

This means that section 46(1) and regulation 5 are not restricted to dealing with physical interconnection but refer to both physical and contractual interconnection. In view of the fact that the Defendants have accepted that section 46(1), notwithstanding its negative language, imposes on the Defendants a positive duty in relation to physical interconnection, requiring the Defendants to take action at an appropriate stage in the process, I will proceed on the basis that section 46(1) does indeed impose that obligation. </p>

However, there are four important subjects which require separate consideration. The first is whether the 2000 Act and/or the regulations imposed any relevant duty on the incumbent operator before Digicel SLU obtained a licence to operate a mobile telecommunications network in SLU. The second is whether the 2000 Act and/or the regulations imposed a duty on CWWI to order and, as appropriate, to install and test the specialist equipment needed to complete CWWI’s side of physical interconnection before the parties had made an interconnection agreement. The third is whether the 2000 Act and/or the regulations imposed on CWWI a duty to carry out what had been described as the civil works (for example digging a trench and laying fibre to connect Digicel’s switch site with CWWI’s switch site) before the parties had made an interconnection agreement. Finally, the fourth subject concerns what has been called “leverage”, which I will describe in more detail below.</p>

The Claimants then say that if the specialist equipment had been ordered by CWWI, and installed and tested thereafter, in parallel with continuing negotiations in respect of the interconnection agreement, then the date by which the parties would have achieved both physical and contractual interconnection would have been an earlier date, as compared with the result of a process whereby the parties negotiated an interconnection agreement and only following completion of those negotiations and/or approval of the agreement by the regulator, did CWWI order the necessary equipment for its side of the interconnection.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">At the trial, the Claimants accepted that the equipment to be ordered by CWWI for its side of the interconnection would ultimately be paid for by Digicel SLU: see section 48 of the Act. The Claimants also accepted that CWWI could reasonably ask Digicel SLU to provide security for CWWI’s right to be reimbursed the cost of the equipment. Indeed, Digicel SLU went further and accepted that CWWI could insist on more than mere security for reimbursement and could require payment up front, or a cash deposit, so that CWWI would not suffer a cash flow disadvantage by having to pay for the equipment in the first instance and then wait for reimbursement. In this way, the Claimants came to accept that if the parties, by agreement, were to take the course of ordering and installing and testing equipment before the conclusion of negotiations on an interconnection agreement, it would be necessary to agree a certain number of matters. If CWWI were to be content with security for reimbursement of the costs, then an appropriate contract providing for that security would have to be negotiated. If CWWI wished to have payment upfront or a cash deposit then again an agreement to that effect would have to be negotiated. If CWWI agreed upon a figure for payment up front, or a cash deposit, the possibility would exist that the overall charge might subsequently turn out to be higher than foreseen and even with payment up front, or a cash deposit, there might need to be further terms agreed as to any shortfall that might later emerge. As regards installation and testing, there would need to be agreement as to the standards to be adopted for those purposes although the Claimants suggested that, on the evidence, those matters would have been relatively straightforward and, indeed, much more straightforward than would be suggested by the length of the documents dealing with those matters, which were in fact later agreed as part of the interconnection agreement. </p>

In summary, the Claimants contended that there was, in effect, an obligation upon CWWI to order the technical equipment it needed unless CWWI could satisfy the Court that it had a good commercial reason for not proceeding in that way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I can readily understand why the terms of a full interconnection agreement have to be approved by the regulator. The regulator will want to ensure that those terms are not against the public interest, even where they are perceived by the parties to the agreement to be in their private interests. This has particular relevance in connection with the rates chargeable by one party to the other party, which rates will influence the amount of the charges ultimately paid by the consumer. It is less clear why the regulator would wish to consider and, if appropriate, withhold approval to any other form of agreement, such as an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement dealing with ordering equipment or installing and testing equipment. Indeed, regulation 20, which requires the parties to submit an agreement to the regulator for approval, refers only to a proposed interconnection agreement and this phrase is more apt to refer to an agreement which deals with physical interconnection and the ongoing provision of an interconnection service. Nonetheless, it was submitted by the Defendants that an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement as to ordering equipment might deserve to be scrutinised by the regulator to ensure that the parties had complied with section 48 of the Act, which required the cost of establishing an interconnection to be based on cost oriented rates which had been arrived at in a transparent manner. Accordingly, I can see the possibility that section 47(1) might have contemplated that an agreement, which falls short of a full interconnection agreement, might need to be submitted to the regulator. That possibility is, if anything, made more likely because section 47(1) uses the phrase “the proposed agreement” and that suggests that the agreement in question might not be an interconnection agreement but some other <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I am not wholly satisfied that section 47(1) does apply to a case where the parties agree limited terms as to the ordering of equipment, before they conclude their negotiations on an interconnection agreement. I reach a similar view as to an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement providing not only for ordering equipment but also for installation and testing of equipment. If, contrary to those reservations, section 47(1) does apply to an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement providing for ordering of equipment before the conclusion of negotiation for an interconnection agreement, then in my judgment section 47(1) does not impose an absolute prohibition on the parties making such an agreement but only requires them to submit that <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement to the regulator for approval before the <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement is carried into effect. On that basis, section 47(1) does not prohibit pre-ordering of equipment as the Defendants contended but it would, or might, impose the requirement of prior approval by the regulator of an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement before that agreement was implemented. It must be recognised that any such requirement for approval from the regulator would introduce some element of delay into the pre-ordering process and that might be seen as discouraging the parties from bothering with pre-ordering and might encourage them instead to concentrate upon concluding the negotiations on all aspects of the interconnection agreement rather than seeking to make an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement as a step on the way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Putting the possibility of a prohibition on pre-ordering pursuant to section 47(1) of the Act on one side, the Defendants submitted that the express terms of the Act and, even more so, the regulations showed that it was contemplated that the parties would conclude an interconnection agreement, which agreement would provide for the subsequent ordering, installation and testing of equipment and then that agreement would be implemented in accordance with its terms. The Defendants submit that since section 46(1) of the Act refers to interconnection, meaning both physical and contractual interconnection, there is no express direction there, or elsewhere, in the Act that physical interconnection is to be dealt with as a priority matter in advance of negotiations on the interconnection agreement. When one turns to the regulations, it is again submitted that regulation 5 contains no direction that physical interconnection is to be attended to first. Indeed, the Defendants submit regulation 16 clearly contemplates that the parties will enter into an interconnection agreement, which will provide for the subsequent ordering, installation and testing of equipment, and those steps will then be taken by way of implementation of the agreement. The Defendants refer in particular to paragraph (b) of regulation 16(1) which refers to the capacity of the interconnection service level, to paragraph (e) which refers to “forecasting, ordering, provisioning and testing procedures”, to paragraph (g) which refers to various aspects of the points of interconnection, to paragraph (p) which refers to technical specifications and standards, to paragraph (q) which refers to terms of payment, to paragraph (t) which refers to the scope and description of the interconnection services to be provided, to paragraph (u) which refers to various other technical matters and, finally, to paragraph (y) which refers to the obligations and responsibilities of each party in the event that inadequate or defective equipment was connected to a network.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I can now express my conclusions as to the effect of the Act and the regulations on this question of a possible obligation on CWWI to order and install and test equipment prior to the conclusion of negotiations on the interconnection agreement. My overall conclusion is that there is no provision in the Act or the regulations which specifically requires CWWI to order first and conclude negotiations on the agreement second. Conversely, there is no provision in the Act or the regulations which prohibits CWWI from acting in that way save, possibly, the provisions of section 47(1) which might mean that CWWI had to submit any <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement on ordering (and installation and testing) to the regulator before it was implemented. The way in which the parties were to be expected to address these matters, and in particular, the way in which the parties were to use the time available to them is provided for in section 46(1) by use of the words “obstruct” and “impede” and in regulation 5 by use of the phrase “as soon as reasonably practicable”. In section 46(1) the word “obstruct” has the sense of making progress or activity difficult. The word “impede” has the sense of restricting or retarding action or progress by hindering or obstructing. Accordingly, the word “impede”, at least, has some content which is concerned with the use of time. </p>

Section 47(3) of the Act refers to the parties negotiating an interconnection agreement. Regulation 28(1) refers to the parties negotiating in good faith for a reasonable period following which either party might request the assistance of the regulator in resolving their dispute. In such a case, the regulator might direct the parties to continue interconnection negotiations and under regulation 28(5) the regulator was able to set a time limit within which negotiations were to be completed what should happen if agreement was not reached within that time limit.</p>

The parties have used the term “leverage” to refer to a reason which CWWI had for taking the position in negotiations with Digicel SLU that CWWI would not order the equipment needed for its side of physical interconnection (and would not carry out the necessary civil works) until the parties had agreed the terms of an interconnection agreement, which provided for the ordering of equipment and the carrying out of civil works. CWWI was influenced in taking this position by the belief that this stance would help CWWI to negotiate favourable terms with Digicel SLU, because Digicel SLU was in a hurry to complete interconnection and would therefore be under more time pressure to agree the terms of an interconnection agreement, if those terms had to be agreed before the process of ordering equipment and the carrying out of civil works would even be started.  The question is whether it was permissible for CWWI, in the course of commercial negotiations, and in compliance with the duties upon it, to act in this way. </p>

Both of these provisions, insofar as they contain a time element, must be applied to a process which contemplated that the parties would conduct commercial negotiations with a view to concluding an interconnection agreement but that there was a possibility that such negotiations might not succeed and other steps might need to be taken to arrive at contractual terms binding both parties.</p>

This seems to be a submission of law as to the content of the obligations imposed by section 46(1) of the 2000 Act and regulation 5 of the regulations. The Claimants submit that the use of this leverage is an unlawful collateral purpose. They say that interconnection negotiations are not like “pure” commercial negotiations in that the parties are not entitled to act in an entirely self-interested fashion. In particular, the incumbent has a statutory obligation to enter into such negotiations. The negotiations are to be against the background of the regulatory controls in the 2000 Act and the regulations. CWWI cannot use what might be otherwise normal negotiating tactics to place Digicel SLU at a disadvantage. That would be anti-competitive. The Claimants submit that CWWI’s approach “inevitably” caused delay. Whilst it might be appropriate to delay ordering equipment if there were a difference between the parties as to the terms on which physical interconnection was to be allowed, this leverage must not be used to influence the negotiations as to rates. It is submitted that the illegality of CWWI’s behaviour is demonstrated by the fact that CWWI was not prepared to own up to this strategy at the time. </p>

It may be worth asking why this is normal commercial behaviour. If parties in the course of negotiating a contract seek to anticipate the result they may arrive at by taking steps which will later be governed by the concluded agreement, difficulties can arise. What rights and obligations govern those steps before the parties reach a concluded agreement on their relationship? What happens if the parties fail to reach a concluded agreement and the negotiations break down? It is of course possible for the parties to make two agreements; the first agreement being an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement dealing with the steps being taken in anticipation of a wider concluded agreement and the second agreement being the wider concluded agreement. However, it may in fact take more time to attempt to agree an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement as well as a wider agreement, as compared with simply getting on with the negotiations for the wider agreement, leading to its later implementation. Of course, if both parties want early action before they conclude the wider agreement then both parties may choose to take those steps and to take any risks that might be involved. However, if one party wants action to be taken in advance of the wider agreement and the other party has no reason of his own to want to take those steps then the second party may see that he has a considerable bargaining advantage in insisting upon the conclusion of the wider agreement before the first party gets the benefits of the implementation of that agreement. In my judgment, these general commercial considerations would appear to be relevant considerations in the present context also. </p>

It was suggested by the Claimants that this evidence had no relevance to the jurisdictions with which I am concerned. It was suggested that the regulatory framework which was the background to Mr Batchelor’s evidence was quite different from the regulatory position in the seven jurisdictions in this case. However,  I am relying upon this evidence only to the extent that it confirms the conclusion that one would reach in any event that: (1) the process of negotiating an interconnection agreement involves each party taking advantage of its bargaining points; and (2) an incumbent operator has a bargaining advantage, when negotiating the terms of an interconnection agreement, if he declines to give to the new entrant the benefit of the equipment being ordered before the interconnection agreement is finalised. Any differences in the regulatory framework do not prevent me reaching those conclusions based on his evidence.</p>

The parties are agreed that I am free to accept or reject expert evidence if I have good reason to do so, even in a case where the relevant evidence of the expert was not challenged by cross-examination. I do not reject the evidence of Mr Logan in so far as he describes the position in the cases that he has encountered.

In such negotiations, the second party has a bargaining advantage which it is ordinarily legitimate for that party to use to encourage the first party to agree terms which might be more favourable to the second party, so that the agreed terms can then be implemented and the step which the first party wants to see taken can then be taken in accordance with the agreed terms. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is a further consideration which needs to be addressed. The criticism of CWWI is that its negotiating stance inevitably lengthened the period of time taken by the parties to complete contractual and physical interconnection. Digicel SLU submits that negotiating terms and ordering equipment in parallel will inevitably be faster than negotiating terms and ordering equipment in sequence. At first blush, this sounds right but the submission assumes that the time taken for negotiations is the same in each case. The submission ignores the possibility that CWWI’s stance in the negotiations could also cause the negotiations on the terms to proceed more quickly. If Digicel SLU truly was in a hurry to complete interconnection then it might be expected to conclude negotiations by agreeing terms quickly so that it could move on to the stage of CWWI ordering and installing equipment. There is a lot of conflicting evidence as to the time taken from ordering until delivery of the necessary equipment. Let us assume that in a particular case, that period is 8 weeks. The time taken for concluding negotiations was not predictable in advance but could take some months. If CWWI’s negotiating stance caused the negotiations to be concluded more quickly, by more than 8 weeks, then the result would be that its stance had led to the conclusion of both contractual and physical interconnection more quickly. The point may also have partial, if not total, validity. One might have to set off the time saved in completing negotiations against the delay caused by only ordering equipment after the completion of negotiations.  Indeed, on the facts in the case of SLU, it can be argued that CWWI’s insistence on agreeing the terms of an interconnection agreement before ordering equipment contributed to the parties breaking the deadlock in their negotiations in January 2003. It could be said that if the equipment had been ordered by CWWI before January 2003, Digicel SLU would have been less prepared to agree the terms which it did agree in January 2003. Of course, there are other possibilities. If the CWWI equipment had been ordered and delivered, then Digicel SLU might have been able to persuade the Ministers in SLU or the regulator to put even more pressure on CWWI to install the equipment and allow traffic to be carried. These various possibilities are speculative but the point remains that amongst the possibilities, there is the chance that CWWI’s  stance in the negotiations about ordering equipment did in the end speed up the point when the parties managed to bridge what had earlier been an unbridgeable gap in the negotiations about rates.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have found this fourth question difficult. There are strong competing arguments. However, my conclusion is that the 2000 Act and the regulations contemplate that the parties will engage in ordinary commercial negotiations and, if they do not agree, the relevant terms will be determined by the regulator. I conclude that there is nothing in section 46(1) or regulation 5 which says one way or the other whether a party is able to adopt, or disabled from adopting, a negotiating stance which would be a rational negotiating stance in the context of ordinary commercial negotiations. It follows that these provisions do not outlaw the negotiating stance, based on the leverage described above, adopted by CWWI in SLU. CWWI did not break the duty placed on it by section 46(1) or regulation 5 by adopting that stance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants made a further point in connection with the leverage argument. They said that CWWI was not only influenced by a desire to improve its negotiating position as against Digicel SLU, it was also influenced by a desire to pressurise the regulator into approving the terms which CWWI and Digicel SLU would eventually agree. It was said that the way in which this pressure would come about was as follows. It would inevitably take a considerable time for the parties to agree terms. Those terms would have to be approved by the regulator. Only after approval was given, would CWWI be prepared to order the equipment. The regulator would be eager to see the completion of interconnection and would not want to withhold approval as that would mean that the equipment could not be ordered until the parties agreed revised terms, and those terms were approved, or the regulator stepped in and itself determined the terms. The Claimants submitted that, whatever the position about the use of leverage against Digicel SLU, it must have been a breach of the duties in question for CWWI to seek to pressurise the regulator. On the facts, I accept that CWWI did have in mind not only that its negotiating stance might improve its position as against Digicel SLU but also that it might encourage the regulator to approve the terms ultimately agreed by the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The first point to make in relation to this submission about pressurising the regulator is that CWWI’s tactic should not have any adverse effect on the time taken for the parties to reach agreement on the terms of an interconnection agreement. It is even conceivable that this tactic would speed up the time taken by the parties to reach an agreement. That time taken to reach an agreement should not be lengthened because CWWI is influenced by two considerations, namely, leverage against Digicel SLU and, in addition, a desire to put pressure on the regulator as compared with CWWI being influenced by only the first of those two.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The third point is that the Claimants’ criticism of CWWI’s desire to pressurise the regulator is being put forward to show that CWWI acted in breach of a duty not to delay interconnection. But the way the submission is put by the Claimants shows that, if it were possible that CWWI’s tactic might work with the regulator, it would produce the result that the tactic would speed things up in some respects, rather than slow them down (as well as giving CWWI and Digicel SLU the benefit that the agreed terms would be approved). The possibilities of the tactic being successful would be that the regulator would approve the agreed terms more quickly or that he would approve them rather than decline to approve them. Both possibilities involve that aspect of the matter proceeding more quickly. Accordingly, one would have to consider whether the delay caused by not ordering equipment after the parties had agreed terms was counterbalanced in whole or in part by any time saved in relation to obtaining the regulator’s approval to the agreed terms. </p>

I also conclude that insofar as CWWI’s behaviour was influenced by the possible effect on the regulator, that did not affect the passage of time up to the point when the parties agreed terms and, on the facts, CWWI did not delay ordering the equipment after making the interconnection agreement (as it in fact ordered the equipment just before making that agreement).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The next question is whether any breach of the primary or secondary legislation in SLU gives rise to a cause of action for that breach.

To answer the question, it is necessary to consider, first, the general legal principles which apply in this area and then to consider the detailed provisions in SLU itself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In my judgment, the 2000 Act was primarily passed in the public interest rather than for the benefit of telecommunications operators. That appears clearly from the provisions of the ECTEL Treaty and section 3 of the 2000 Act. Section 3 spells out in some detail the objects of the Act. As regards the object of the particular provision, section 46(1) of the 2000 Act, in my judgment, that provision was enacted to advance the general purposes of the Act as a whole. The primary object of section 46(1) was to advance the public interest although it is clear that compliance with the statutory duty is also for the benefit of the telecommunications provider who requests interconnection. </p>

Whilst the sub-section is challenging to construe, I would not on that account hold that the duty is not suitable for actionability. The construction I have placed on section 46(1) does not mean that section 46(1) is to be re-written as an obligation to negotiate in good faith as the parties from time to time have argued in this case. If the duty had been a duty to negotiate in good faith, that would be a reason for my hesitating before holding that there was an intention to make a breach of that duty actionable.</p>

Consistent with my conclusion that the primary object of section 46(1) is to benefit the public, then the public will suffer harm if the duty is broken. In addition, the particular telecommunications provider who requests interconnection will suffer harm to its enterprise. The harm is economic loss rather than damage to the person or damage to property. The person on whom the duty is imposed is not a public authority administering public welfare legislation, but is a private entity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The 2000 Act does impose a sanction for a breach of section 46(1). That sanction is not a criminal sanction but a sanction exists pursuant to section 41 of the 2000 Act, whereby the Minister may suspend or revoke the licence of the incumbent operator if the licensee contravenes section 46(1) of the Act. This sanction is an important deterrent against a contravention of section 46(1). It may be that the Minister would hesitate before suspending or revoking the licence of the operator of the fixed telecommunications network and this consideration may lessen the impact of the deterrent of suspension or revocation. However, the Minister may be persuaded to revoke the existing licence and offer a new licence to the operator on more stringent terms and that could operate as a worthwhile deterrent. The power to suspend or revoke a licence conferred by section 41 is a penalty provision by reason of the contravention and is not designed to be a remedial provision. A remedial provision would be a provision which directly provided for the party in breach of duty to perform the duty. The fact that section 41 is not a remedial provision is shown by the fact that if the fixed network operator’s licence was revoked then that operator would cease to be under the duty imposed by section 46(1) until the time came when the operator was granted a new licence, possibly on more stringent terms as referred to above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is of the greatest significance, in my judgment, that the 2000 Act provides in considerable detail for a means of enforcement of the relevant duty, principally through the involvement of the regulator. The 2000 Act contains numerous relevant provisions, the principal ones being section 12(1)(k), section 13(2)(c), sections 16 to 24 and the power to make regulations in section 74(2) (see, in particular, paragraphs d), e), n), o).) In addition to these provisions, it is necessary to consider carefully the meaning and effect of sections 58 and 72 of the 2000 Act, to which I refer in more detail below. On the question whether the means of enforcement through the medium of the regulator could raise questions of discretion or policy with the result that actionability in the courts would proceed on a different basis, I refer to section 15 and section 24 which do indeed give rise to this possibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 58 provides that the court may on the application of the Commission, “or an interested party”,  “grant an order restraining a person from engaging in activities contrary to this Act”. In a case where an intending new entrant has requested interconnection in accordance with section 46(1) of the Act and the incumbent operator has contravened section 46(1), there would seem to be little doubt but that the intending new entrant is “an interested party”. Section 58(b) refers to an order “restraining” action contrary to the Act. This is the language of a prohibitory injunction rather than a mandatory injunction. However, the particular duty currently being considered is the duty in section 46(1) which refers to “the operator not refusing or obstructing or impeding the making of an interconnection”. There must be considerable room for doubt whether section 58(b) allows the court to make a mandatory order but in view of the fact that section 46(1) is itself expressed in negative terms, that consideration somewhat lessens the doubt on that score. Thus, there are two possible conclusions as to the applicability of section 58(b) in relation to a breach of section 46(1). The first is that section 58(b) does allow someone such as Digicel SLU to seek an order requiring CWWI to comply with section 46(1). The other possibility is that section 58(b) would permit the court to make such an order but only in a negative form and would not permit the court to make a mandatory order against a party in default. Either way, the result is that section 58(b) does provide a means of enforcement in relation to breaches of the Act including a breach of section 46(1). If section 58(b) is given a wider interpretation then the availability of the remedy of an injunction is highly relevant. If section 58(b) is interpreted narrowly, then it follows that the legislature in SLU intended to confer a remedy to the extent of prohibitory injunction but has decided not to confer a remedy in the form of a mandatory injunction. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 58 does not mention damages or compensation for breach of duty. It is not clear, on the material before me, whether a court in SLU has power to grant damages in lieu of the grant of an injunction, in the same way as can be done in England and Wales, pursuant to section 50 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. In their written closing submissions, the Claimants argued for the existence of this power for the court in St Lucia. The Defendants argued against the existence of such a power. In their oral closing submissions, the Claimants withdrew the contention that the court in SLU had such a power. In view of the way the matter has been argued, I am not able to decide one way or the other whether the court in SLU does have a power to award damages in lieu of an injunction. Of course, a power to award damages in lieu of an injunction can in some circumstances be a narrower power than the power to award damages for an actionable breach of statutory duty. It seems to me that I ought to consider section 58 on alternative bases, first, that there is a power to award damages in lieu of an injunction and, secondly, that there is no such power. </p>

Further, even if the court in SLU does not have the power to award damages in lieu of an injunction, the fact that the legislature had set out in section 58 the extent to which the court is given an express power to intervene in a case of a breach of statutory duty suggests to me that the legislature did not intend to make a breach of statutory duty a tort and thereby entitle the court to award an injunction or damages in respect of that tort.</p>

Section 72 does not say that where there is a breach of the Act, the person in breach of the Act is liable to pay damages or is liable in any other specified way. The Claimants say, however, that section 72 does place civil liability on certain individuals and it is inconceivable that those individuals would be liable without there also being civil liability on the part of the corporate body with which that individual is connected and which corporate body is directly under the duty imposed by the Act. In order to see whether the civil liability of the person subject to the duty is implicit in section 72, one has to attempt to understand what section 72 does expressly provide. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 72 refers to a breach being committed “by a person other than an individual” and then refers to “any individual including a public officer”. It seems unlikely that there will be a public officer connected with the telecommunications provider so the reference to a public officer would seem to be a reference to the case where there is a public officer responsible for the activities of a public body, where that public body has a duty under the Act or under a licence. If the implication contended for by the Claimants is correct then it must apply in the case of a public officer as it applies in the case of other individuals. The Claimants’ implication must therefore be that if a public body commits a breach of the Act or a breach of the licence then not only is the public officer liable in damages for the breach but so is the public body itself liable in damages for the breach. The 2000 Act does in various places impose duties on a public body but I am far from satisfied that it could have been the intention of the legislature to give a claim in damages against the public body, and against the public officer, in the event of a breach of any such duty. Section 72 also refers to a breach of a licence. The second schedule to the Act identifies the conditions that may be included, and the conditions that must be included, in such licences. Again, it is not clear what type of duty would be imposed on a public body under a licence and it is even less clear that the legislature would have intended that a breach by a public body of any such condition would give the telecommunications provider a right to sue the public body, and its public officer, in damages for that breach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Turning then to the other way in which section 72 might operate, how does it apply to a case of a breach of the Act or a breach of a licence committed by a telecommunications provider? Section 72 provides that an individual including a director, manager, supervisor, partner or other similarly responsible individual, can be individually liable for the breach. Thus, the Claimants argue, if a director of a company which is a telecommunications provider contravenes section 46(1) of the Act then that director is “individually liable” for that breach. The Claimants then argue that it is inconceivable in such a case that the telecommunications provider, the corporate body, would not also be liable for the breach. I would agree that it would be surprising if the individual were liable for a breach to a different extent from the liability of the telecommunications provider. The question therefore arises to what extent are the telecommunications provider and the individual “liable”. Are both liable for a tort of breach of statutory duty or are both liable to the remedies which a court can grant under section 58, or are they liable in some other way?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is a further difficulty with section 72 referring to the liability of an individual which arises from the reference to a breach of a licence. The conditions that may, and the conditions that must, be included in the licences are in the second schedule to the Act. One of the important liabilities of a licensee is to pay a fee to the Government. I find it difficult to envisage that the legislature intended that a responsible individual would be liable for the fee in addition to the liability of the licensee itself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Defendants submit that section 72 is not concerned with civil liability at all but is concerned with criminal liability. The Defendants are able to point to examples of a section not wholly dissimilar from section 72 which imposes criminal liability on a responsible individual. Examples are section 67 of the Information and Communications Technology Authority Law 2002 in Cayman and section 59 of the Telecommunications Ordinance 2004 in TCI. Indeed, a provision of that kind appears to be a relatively usual provision; reference can be made to section 29 of the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934, considered in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Limited </span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">[</span>1949] AC 398. To my mind, there are considerable difficulties in saying that section 72 is dealing with criminal liability and, indeed, criminal liability only, to the exclusion of civil liability. Nothing in section 72 expressly refers to criminal liability. Further, section 72 is in part VII dealing with miscellaneous matters and not in part VI dealing with offences. Further, if section 72 is dealing with criminal liability then the reference to a public officer being responsible is only explained if the Act or a licence created a criminal offence for a public body and there is no sign in the Act of that possibility. Further, even if section 72 did extend to criminal liability, I do not see any real warrant for restricting section 72 to criminal liability only to the exclusion of civil liability. </p>

On 5 March 2006, Mason J decided the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cariaccess Communications (St Lucia) Ltd v Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Ltd.</span> Amongst the several points dealt with in her judgment, the learned judge considered whether section 46 of the 2000 Act created an actionable duty in tort. She referred to the decisions of the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd </span> [1949] AC 398, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2) </span>[1982] AC 173 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">X v Bedfordshire CC </span>[1995] 2 AC 733. She held that the 2000 Act was passed for the benefit of the public interest and not for the benefit and protection of private rights and interests. She concluded that a breach of section 46 of the 2000 Act was not actionable as a breach of statutory duty. It is not necessary to spend any time considering whether her decision was part of the ratio of the case or was obiter. Both sides in the case before me have accepted that I am not strictly bound by that decision but I am free to decide for myself the extent to which the decision has persuasive authority in the present case. </p>

When considering whether the sanctions provided for in the legislation and/or the means of enforcement are adequate to secure the objects of the legislation, or whether they are inadequate for that purpose so that they need the addition of actionability of the duties to make the consequences of a breach adequate to secure those objects, it is relevant to note the following. It is a somewhat odd thing to hold that the legislature, when considering what to specify as the consequences of a breach of duty and when making detailed provision for sanctions for breach of the duty and means of enforcement of the duty, must have understood that those sanctions and those means of enforcement were inadequate, from which one can deduce that the legislature must also have intended to make the breaches of duty actionable, even though it did not expressly provide for that consequence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants also contend that the duty imposed by regulation 5 of the Telecommunications (Interconnection) Regulation is actionable. It is appropriate, again, to consider the general matters which are relevant for the purposes of determining this question. In my judgment, the purpose or object of the regulations, including regulation 5, was primarily to benefit the public interest. I reach the same conclusion in this respect in relation to the regulations as I did in relation to the 2000 Act. The regulations are made pursuant to section 74 of the 2000 Act “to give effect to this Act”. The way in which regulation 5 is expressed does not make it inappropriate for the imposition of actionability. The persons who might suffer harm as a result of a breach of regulation 5 are, first, the public and, secondly, the interconnecting operator. Regulation 5 imposes a duty on a private entity. The loss to the requesting operator will be economic loss. The regulations do not impose a criminal sanction and the power contained in the 2000 Act to suspend or revoke a licence does not arise unless the breach of the regulations is a breach of the licence or suspension or revocation is necessary for reasons of public interest: see section 41(2)(b) and (f). The regulations do provide a means of enforcement: see regulations 28 to 30, 32 and 34. It is possible that the guidelines imposed by regulation 32 on the regulator would not apply to the determination of a dispute by the court (if that were possible) and so there is a possibility of a different approach being taken by the regulator when resolving a dispute and by the court when determining liability for the alleged tort of breach of the regulations. Looking at the matter in the round, in my judgment, the factors in favour of non-actionability are considerably stronger that the factors in favour of actionability. My conclusion is that a breach of regulation 5 is not actionable.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">My conclusion as to the actionability of any breaches of the legislation in SLU means that I could not find that CWWI was liable for any breach of that legislation. Nor could I find that C&amp;W plc was a joint tortfeasor with CWWI in relation to any such breach. This means that it becomes essential, in order for the Claimants to succeed in SLU, that they establish that a breach of the legislation in SLU, or a breach of CWWI’s telecommunications licence, amounts to “unlawful means” for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Of course, because all claims in SLU except (the Claimants argue) the conspiracy claim are statute barred, it has always been essential for the Claimants’ success in relation to SLU for them to establish their conspiracy claim. The first requirement of the conspiracy claim is that the matters complained of amount to “unlawful means”. If the Claimants do not establish that matter, then they have no cause of action in SLU. Although I will, in any event, make findings of fact on the matters of complaint that have been been argued in SLU, I have decided that it would be convenient to deal with the issue as to the scope of “unlawful means” before I make my findings of fact in SLU.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants also argued that C&amp;W plc conspired with CWWI to injure Digicel SLU by unlawful means. I have already held on the facts and on the law that there were no unlawful acts and therefore no unlawful means. The legal principles as to what amounts to a combination for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy are set out in Annex I to this judgment. It is difficult to discuss in the abstract the question of whether C&amp;W plc combined in a relevant way with CWWI when I have held on the facts that there were no breaches of the legislation in SLU. However, in view of the considerable amount of time taken at the trial in investigating the nature of the involvement of C&amp;W plc in the process of interconnection in SLU and the other jurisdictions, I will make the following comments. These comments apply not only in SLU but also to the other jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned and I will not repeat them when I come to consider the other jurisdictions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Claimants make a number of submissions as to the role of C&amp;W plc. They say that C&amp;W plc was the 100% owner of CWWI and therefore had effective control over the telecommunications business in the Caribbean. It is said that “head office tentacles reached far and wide”.  Conversely, it is accepted that there was no formal or visible head office presence in the negotiations in relation to interconnection. The Claimants seek to rely on the absence of any apparent involvement in the negotiations as actually supporting their case in that they say that it showed that C&amp;W plc did not wish to be seen as involved in connection with interconnection while it in reality controlled matters “behind the scenes”. The Claimants then say that C&amp;W plc had an obvious vested interest in delaying competition in the various jurisdictions, that it had been involved in the negotiation of the terms as to liberalisation with the various governments and that it developed cost models and pricing strategies. It is also said that C&amp;W plc can be detected as being involved in a strategic debate as to levels of rates payable for interconnection and it is said to have been involved in a strategic retreat from obstructive positions in Barbados.</p>

In this context I ought to record one important point which is that the Claimants accepted that the work of the carrier services team was to be identified with CWWI and not with C&amp;W plc, even though the latter was the formal employer of some of the individuals who were part of the carrier services team.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In my judgment, the Claimants have failed to show that C&amp;W plc combined in any relevant way with CWWI in SLU, or indeed with CWWI or the other C&amp;W subsidiaries in any of the jurisdictions with which this litigation is concerned. The fact that C&amp;W plc owned 100% of CWWI does not of itself say anything about whether C&amp;W plc combined with CWWI in any relevant respect. The fact that C&amp;W plc wanted to put itself into a strong position to face the competition, when the competition arrived, is entirely to be expected. That behaviour is the consequence of the arrival of the competition which the various jurisdictions wished to introduce and is inherently lawful. The fact that C&amp;W plc may have been involved in devising the retail strategy to be adopted following competition is to be regarded in the same way. Those facts do not themselves show that C&amp;W plc involved itself in anything which was unlawful. The fact that C&amp;W plc would have preferred to have time before the competition arrived is again to be expected and does not show it combined to commit unlawful acts. The evidence showed that C&amp;W plc was not generally involved in the question of interconnection in any of the jurisdictions. This is what I would have expected. The process of interconnection was a detailed one. Senior management at C&amp;W plc did not generally concern themselves with that level of detail in the operations of its subsidiaries and, consistently with its general approach, they did not concern themselves with the details of interconnection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This general finding is subject to four further comments. The first is that, at one stage, Mr O’Brien of the Digicel Group wrote on a number of occasions to the Chairman of C&amp;W plc complaining about the conduct of the carrier services team in relation to interconnection. The senior management of C&amp;W plc replied to Mr O’Brien’s letters seeking to answer his concerns and stating that the carrier services team were not acting in any way improperly. I do not regard that limited involvement on the part of senior management of C&amp;W plc as involving them in a combination with the carrier services team in any relevant way. The second comment is that the public relations department of C&amp;W plc were called upon by the local subsidiaries to assist in countering a publicity campaign waged by the Digicel companies. The third comment is that there clearly was some contact between the carrier services team and employees of C&amp;W plc in London. These employees were described as “high level” regulatory lawyers or economists. I find that the carrier services team used these employees of C&amp;W plc as a resource to be consulted on technical and specialist matters. The use of the C&amp;W plc public relations department and the regulatory lawyers and economists did not involve C&amp;W plc combining in any relevant way to commit unlawful acts. The fourth comment concerns the involvement of Mr Loosemore in Barbados. Mr Loosemore was a director of C&amp;W Barbados so it may not even be right to regard his involvement in Barbados as the action of C&amp;W plc.  Further, his involvement, if it relates to C&amp;W plc at all, is consistent with senior management of C&amp;W plc not endorsing in one respect the conduct of the carrier services team of which the Claimants complain.</p>

Although the Claimants seek to make a virtue out of this feature and suggest that C&amp;W plc was trying to create an impression that it was not involved in interconnection, I find that the truth of the matter accords with the appearance, namely, that C&amp;W plc had little or no involvement in the process of interconnection in SLU and the other jurisdictions. Even if I had held that CWWI or another C&amp;W subsidiary had been guilty of conduct which constituted unlawful means, I would not have been able to find on the evidence presented to me that C&amp;W plc had combined with CWWI or any other C&amp;W subsidiary to injure a Digicel company by the use of unlawful means. </p>

They both gave evidence to that effect. There was no, or next to no, cross-examination in relation to that evidence. I appreciate that the Claimants might have been hampered in relation to such cross-examination because I had refused an application by the Claimants for disclosure by the Defendants of documents which would have revealed the legal advice which the Defendants obtained on this subject. Nonetheless, I must make my findings of fact on the basis of the evidence before me. In any event, I find that the evidence is overwhelmingly likely to be correct. I have already held that there was no such obligation on CWWI. The Claimants sought to outflank the evidence which was given by asserting that the two witnesses had not applied their minds to the possibility that it was the licence to CWWI, rather than the legislation, which imposed on CWWI an obligation to negotiate with Digicel SLU before it obtained its licence. Thus the Claimants say, if I were to hold that there was such an obligation in the licence to CWWI (which I do not), then I should hold that the relevant witnesses did not have an honest belief that there was no such obligation. In my judgment, even if the witnesses did not apply their minds to the argument now advanced by the Claimants as to the effect of the licence to CWWI, that would not negative the fact that they believed that there was no legal obligation of the kind now alleged, whatever is now alleged to be the source of  that obligation.</p>

The Claimants said that Digicel SLU was delayed in relation to its launch for more or less the full period of any delay in relation to interconnection. CWWI said that Digicel SLU had many other matters to deal with, apart from interconnection, before it could be ready to launch and, on the detailed facts, Digicel SLU was not ready to launch before it actually did so. Accordingly, any delay on the part of CWWI in relation to interconnection had not made any difference to the date when Digicel SLU launched in SLU. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have decided that I will not attempt to determine the very many issues which arose in this respect. First of all, I have determined that there was no delay to interconnection in breach of any obligation on CWWI . Secondly, I have held that even if CWWI had been in breach of its obligations, the Claimants would not have had a cause of action. Thirdly, I have held on the facts that there was no conspiracy between CWWI and C&amp;W plc in relation to SLU. Fourthly, I have held that even if there had been a conspiracy in relation to SLU, it would not have been actionable. Fifthly, if there had been an actionable conspiracy it is likely that any claim in relation to it would be statute barred (I deal below with the law in relation to that topic). Further, if I attempted to deal with the many points of detail as to a possible delay to the launch in SLU, I would immediately face the difficulty of having to make an assumption of fact, which I have not held to be well founded, as to when interconnection should have been completed and then to ask whether interconnection on such an assumed date would have allowed Digicel SLU to launch earlier than it actually did. Indeed, I think that I would have to deal with a number of possible assumed dates depending on what conduct on the part of CWWI is to be assumed (contrary to my actual findings) to have been a breach of duty on its part. The assumed dates of interconnection could have a bearing on the effect of the allegedly delayed interconnection on a planned launch. Any attempt to make findings of fact on the question of a possible delayed launch in SLU would involve a very considerable amount of time and delay in concluding my judgment. In these circumstances, I conclude that it is not proportionate to go further than I have done and I will not make findings on the allegation that a delay in interconnection did cause delay to Digicel SLU’s launch.</p>

If I were otherwise minded to make findings of fact as to a possible delay to the launch in SLU, it would be necessary to set out in some detail the procedural history in relation to this question and to examine the legal basis for the Defendants’ proposition. This is an additional reason why it is disproportionate to go further into the facts as to any such delay to launch.</p>

When the Claimants delivered their written closing submissions, they also delivered three lever arch files of documents which they said were relevant to this question of when the relevant Claimant company would have been ready to launch its network in the jurisdictions with which this litigation was concerned. The Claimants acknowledged that these documents had not been referred to at any earlier stage of the trial and, in particular,  had not been spoken to by any witness in evidence in chief and had not been put to any witness in cross-examination. The Claimants suggested to me that I should simply read my way through this material and draw my own conclusions as to its relevance to the present issue. The Claimants suggested that the documents tended to support their case on the matters in dispute. In my view, taking that step would be burdensome and in view of all the other reasons why it would be disproportionate to make findings on some hypothetical basis as to when Digicel SLU would have been able to launch its network, I decline to take on this additional burden.</p>

They say that the law as to the limitation period for that claim is the law of England &amp; Wales, or the law of Jamaica, and applying either of those laws, the claim in conspiracy is not statute barred. The Claimants say that the case is governed by sections 11 and 12 of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 and applying section 11(2)(c) to this case I should reach the conclusion that the most significant elements of the events on which the claim in conspiracy is based were not in SLU but were in England and Wales, or in Jamaica. To advance that proposition, the Claimants say that the most significant element in the relevant events is the combination between CWWI and C&amp;W plc and that event did not occur in SLU or did not occur only in SLU. The other events which would have to be considered for this purpose would include the conduct of CWWI which was said to be unlawful and the harm to Digicel SLU, all of which did occur in SLU. </p>

It is therefore difficult to discuss how significant such a combination might have been and whether it was a more significant element than the other relevant elements. For that purpose, I would have to make assumptions as to what the combination might have consisted of and where it took place. Accordingly, I will not decide, even on a hypothetical basis, what answer would be produced by applying section 11(2)(c) of the 1995 Act to possible versions of hypothetical facts. I will however comment that the Claimants would have had an uphill task in persuading me that for the purposes of section 11(2)(c) of the 1995 Act the limitation period for the conspiracy claim was not governed by SLU law. Similarly, I will not discuss how section 12 of the 1995 Act would apply to the hypothetical facts of a combination which was not made in SLU, or not only in SLU, and how taking account of “all the circumstances” referred to in section 12, I would have decided what was more appropriate as to the choice of law. Again, I will comment that the Claimants would have had an uphill task in persuading me that it was more appropriate to hold that the relevant law was not SLU law.</p>

My conclusion in relation to section 72 of the 2000 Act in SLU applies equally to section 70 of the 2001 Act in SVG.

I have held that if the draft interconnection agreement had been provided earlier, this would not have changed the date when the interconnection agreement in Grenada was ultimately finalised.

The Defendants initially contended that there were Chinese Walls between the carrier services team of CWWI and the business unit of C&amp;W Grenada. However, by the end of the trial it was clear that any suggested restrictions on the passage of information between the carrier services team and the business unit were not fully effective. If I had held that C&amp;W Grenada had committed breaches of the legislation in Grenada, it would then have been necessary to consider whether CWWI had combined with C&amp;W Grenada in a relevant way so that CWWI would also be liable for such breaches. In view of my finding that there were no breaches which caused any delay to the completion of interconnection, it does not seem to me to be helpful to discuss any further the application of the legal principles (which were not seriously in dispute) to possible findings of fact which I have not made.</p>

The Claimants said that the Digicel Grenada was delayed in relation to its launch for more or less the full period of any delay in relation to interconnection.

Further, the legislation in Barbados provides for persons acting jointly with the licensee, who contravenes the legislation, or who is conspiring with that licensee to contravene the legislation to be liable to pay damages, in the same way as C&amp;W Barbados would be liable. </p>

Sections 25 and 28 of the 2001 Act are in part VI of the Act. “Licence” is defined to mean “a licence referred to in this Act”. “Licensee” is defined to mean “a person who is a holder of a valid licence granted under this Act”.</p>

Section 25 requires a carrier to provide interconnection services to another carrier. Interconnection service is a service provided pursuant to an obligation to provide interconnection. Interconnection is the linking of networks to allow users of one carrier to communicate with users of another carrier. The definition of “interconnection” starts by referring to the physical link but continues by referring to the physical link “to allow” the specified use of the link. In my judgment, this definition of interconnection is not restricted to physical interconnection but is apt to refer to both physical and contractual interconnection. I understand that the parties are agreed that this is indeed the meaning of “interconnection” in the 2001 Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I now turn to the dispute between the parties as to the meaning and effect of section 28 of the 2001 Act. The Claimants draw attention to the fact that section 28(1) and (3) referred to “a person” and that section 28(2) and section 28(5) referred to “the person”. The Claimants emphasised that section 28 does not use the words “a carrier”. “A carrier” is defined for the purpose of the 2001 Act as a person who has a licence under the Act. Therefore, the Claimants argue that the obligation created by section 28 is owed to a person, whether that person is a carrier or not and whether that person has a licence or not. Accordingly, the Claimants argue, the obligation created by section 28 was owed to Digicel Barbados prior to 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 when that company was granted a licence under the Act. The Defendants say that if one reads section 28 in the context of the statute as a whole, it was not envisaged that “a person” would mean any person, whether licensed under the Act or not and, in effect, the only person relevant for the purposes of section 28 is a carrier, that is, a person licensed under the Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">For the purposes of considering the rival positions of the parties, it is necessary to refer to further provisions of the 2001 Act. Section 2 of the Act defines “a person” to “include an individual, a partnership, an unincorporated organisation, a Government or Government agency”. Part IV of the Act deals with licensing requirements in respect of public telecommunications. By section 10(1), no person may own or operate a telecommunications network without a carrier licence under the Act. Section 11 deals with the procedure to be followed when applying for a licence. By section 11(2), an applicant for a licence is required to satisfy the Minister on a number of specified matters. These include a requirement that the applicant will comply with all interconnection obligations and licence limitations, that the licensee possesses the technical qualifications necessary to perform the obligations attached to the licence and that the applicant satisfies certain financial requirements. Section 12 deals with the grant of a licence under part IV of the Act. The Minister is required to consider, amongst other things, whether an applicant is a person of fit and proper character and whether the applicant has had a licence revoked or is affiliated with a person who has had a licence revoked. By section 19 of the Act, the Minister may suspend or revoke a licence granted under part IV of the Act where the licensee has contravened the Act or a term in the licence or on other specified grounds. </p>

By section 26(1), a dominant carrier is required to file a RIO with the regulator. A RIO is described as an offer which sets out the terms and conditions “upon which other licensed carriers will be permitted to interconnect”. Accordingly, a RIO is a document to be entered into between a dominant carrier and another licensed carrier. By section 27(1), a RIO does not take effect unless it is approved in writing by the regulator.</p>

Accordingly, it is said, C&amp;W Barbados owed to Digicel Barbados the duties defined in section 28 of the Act. The Claimants say that there is a deliberate change in the language from section 25 which refers to “a carrier” to section 28 which refers to “a person”. If the Court were to read section 28 so that it only applied to a carrier, that would involve a re-writing of the Act which the Court could not and should not do. The Claimants say that there is nothing unworkable or even surprising in their interpretation. If a person came forward, seeking to rely on section 28, in circumstances where that person had no prospect whatever of later acquiring a licence under the Act then the content of the obligation under section 28(3) would be easily satisfied by the incumbent carrier.   Both parties are obliged by section 28(3) to negotiate in good faith and it would soon become apparent in the case of a person who had no prospect of a licence that that person was not negotiating in good faith. The Claimants also distinguished between sections 25 and 28 in that section 25 deals with interconnection services whereas section 28 refers to interconnection. It is said that the phrase “interconnection services” refers to the time when interconnection is in use whereas “interconnection” can occur even before the person who requests interconnection is able to operate a network. The Claimants also submit that there is very good sense in their reading of section 28 because it allows an intending new entrant like Digicel Barbados to make progress with negotiations on an interconnection agreement even before the grant of its licence. </p>

They submit that section 28 is not concerned with the class of persons who are entitled to request interconnection. That question is determined by section 25. What section 28 is dealing with are the statutory requirements as to the making of a “request”. If the Claimants were right, the obligation under section 28 would be owed to the world at large, subject only to the making of a request. Such an obligation would be impossibly wide-ranging, burdensome and would serve no useful purpose. The Claimants’ suggested solution, which uses the obligation in section 28(3) to negotiate in good faith, to limit the class of persons who could rely on section 28, is not in fact a solution. Even with a person who requests interconnection under section 28 and who has only a limited prospect of later obtaining a licence, it would not be possible, alternatively it would not be easy, to say that such a person was not negotiating in good faith. The Defendants also point to section 28(2) which contemplates that a “person” might enter into a RIO so that there would be a contractually binding agreement between the incumbent operator and a person who does not have a licence under the Act. The Defendants point out that a RIO is defined in section 26 as an agreement made between carriers. The suggested distinction between section 25 dealing with interconnection services and section 28 dealing with interconnection is not a real distinction. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The parties also referred in this context to regulations 4 and 7 of the Telecommunications (Interconnection) Regulations 2003. Under regulation 4, no person is to be “granted” interconnection unless that person holds a relevant valid licence. There is room for argument as to when a person is “granted” interconnection; it may be that a person is only granted interconnection when the interconnection service is provided. Regulation 7 provides that an interconnection seeker must produce a valid carrier licence as proof of being the holder of such a licence as of the date “the interconnection commences”. Again, it is open to argument when interconnection “commences”; it may be that interconnection commences when the interconnection service begins to be used. In my judgment, it is not necessary to determine whether these Regulations can be relied upon as an aid to the interpretation of the Telecommunications 2001 as I do not find that any clear indication either way is to be found in the terms of the Regulations. </p>

Section 25 is quite clearly restricted so that the duty it imposes is only owed to a carrier licensed under the Act. Section 25 requires such a carrier to make a request for interconnection services. Section 25 does not itself identify the form of, or the immediate consequences of, such a request. That topic is dealt with by section 28 which deals with requests for interconnection. The purpose of section 28 is to provide that a request for interconnection must be in writing and must be supported by information. Where there is a request for interconnection the parties can either agree to enter into a RIO or negotiate an agreement on terms different from those of the RIO. In my judgment, it is implicit in the language of section 28 that the only request which is relevant for the purposes of section 28 is a request which conforms to section 25, that is, a request from a licensed carrier. </p>

Section 26(1) defines a RIO as an agreement to be entered into between licensed carriers. Section 28(2) contemplates the parties entering into a RIO. The Claimants’ interpretation of section 28 could produce the result that a RIO was entered into and was binding upon a dominant carrier on the one hand and someone who is not licensed under the Act on the other hand. Such an agreement would not satisfy the definition of RIO in section 26. </p>

That means that, if the Claimants are right, the incumbent carrier must negotiate the terms of an agreement with someone who has no licence and has no prospect of getting one. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If a person, who does not have a licence, has a statutory entitlement under section 28 to request interconnection and engage in negotiations on the terms of an interconnection agreement then, in some cases at least, those negotiations will result in an agreement. Such an agreement would have to be submitted to the regulator for approval and the incumbent carrier would be obliged to perform the terms of the agreement. The Claimants submit that the incumbent carrier could easily terminate the agreement because the other party would not be able to perform its side of the agreement. That would depend on the terms of the agreement but, in any event, it seems a strange result to place the incumbent carrier under a statutory obligation to negotiate and, if necessary, agree the terms of an interconnection agreement with a view to the incumbent carrier immediately terminating that agreement. Further, disputes between the parties to the negotiation could lead to a referral to the regulator under section 31.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I also bear in mind the point that the compliance provisions of the 2001 Act, and even more so, the criminal penalty provisions of the Act are likely to be wholly inappropriate in a case where the person requesting interconnection does not have a licence and does not have a prospect of obtaining one. I do not regard the arguments as to section 28 as being evenly balanced but if I did I would incline to read section 28 narrowly, rather than widely, given that a contravention of section 28 is a criminal offence under section 78. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">My conclusion on the dispute as to the meaning of section 28 of the 2001 Act is that section 28 when it refers to “a person” or “the person” is referring to a person who is entitled to make a request under section 25 of the Act, that is a carrier with a licence under the Act. It follows that the duty created by section 28 was not owed to Digicel Barbados prior to it obtaining its licence on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Fair Competition Act 2002 is a general statute dealing with the subject of competition. The long title to the Act states that the Act was passed to promote and maintain and encourage competition, to prohibit the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition and the abuse of dominant positions and to ensure that all enterprises have the opportunity to participate equitably in the marketplace. The Fair Competition Act 2002 does not deal specifically with the telecommunications market. The Fair Competition Act 2002 was passed in November 2002 and came into force on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2003. The relevant telecommunications statute in Barbados was the Telecommunications Act 2001, to which I have already referred in detail. The Telecommunications Act 2001 came into force on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. The Fair Competition Act 2002 does not refer to the Telecommunications Act 2001 and is not expressed as involving any amendment of the Telecommunications Act 2001. The regulator under the Telecommunications Act 2001 was the Fair Trading Commission which was established under the Fair Trading Commission Act. Under the Fair Competition Act 2002, it is also the Fair Trading Commission which is responsible for the administration of that Act: see section 4 thereof.</p>

Further, any claim that the Claimants may have had for damages for conspiracy within section 44(1)(e) is also statute barred. However, the Claimants wish to say that a breach of  section 16 of the Fair Competition Act 2002 amounts to the use of unlawful means for the common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. The Claimants also say that a combination to do something which infringes section 16 would be a combination to lessen competition in the supply of services and would unduly restrain or injure competition so as to amount to a breach of section 34 which, the Claimants again say, amounts to unlawful means for the common law of tort. The Claimants then submit that Section 44(2) does not impose a limitation period of 3 years for the common law tort of conspiracy because, they say, section 44(2) only applies to an action under section 44(1) and an action for the common law tort of conspiracy is different from an action arising out of a statutory conspiracy within section 44(1)(e). Accordingly, it is necessary, in the first instance, to consider the scope of the obligations in sections 16 and 34 of the Fair Competition Act 2002.</p>

The requirements of a pleading which alleges an abuse of a dominant position under article 82 of the EC Treaty (now article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) are described in Bellamy &amp; Child, European Community Law of Competition, 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition at paragraphs 14.151-14.152. The text book states that as a matter of pleading a party raising an issue under article 82 must expressly state that fact in his pleading and adequately set out full and proper particulars of his case on that issue, including the essential facts. Particular care is expected of a party pleading competition law infringements as they are notoriously burdensome allegations, leading to excessive evidence and lengthy trials. Mere assertion in a pleading will not do. Unparticularised allegations may be struck out. The degree of particularity required will depend upon the nature of the allegation. The text book points out that the court should not make it too easy for a party to raise what turns out to be a baseless allegation of article 82 infringement but on the other hand it would be wrong to make it too difficult for a party with a valid case of article 82 infringement to put its case before the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It appeared to me from the Claimants’ closing submissions that the Claimants’ case on the application of the Fair Competition Act 2002 did not really add anything to the Claimants’ reliance on the Telecommunications Act 2001. As I understand it, the only circumstances in which the Claimants might wish to contend that the Fair Competition Act 2002 gave them an additional claim to their claim under the Telecommunications Act 2001 was in relation to the period of time before Digicel Barbados was granted its licence on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 in the event that I held (as I have held) that neither section 25 nor section 28 of the Telecommunications Act 2001 imposed a duty on C&amp;W Barbados prior to this date. When questioned about reliance on the Fair Competition Act 2002 in such circumstances, it seemed to me that the Claimants’ Counsel did not press the point. At that stage, I drew attention to the position under article 102 of TFEU (formerly article 82 of the EC Treaty) and the European competition law as to the possibility of an abuse of dominant position where a dominant telecommunications operator refuses to grant access to an essential facility, such as its existing network. Having referred to the principles in that respect, I was then addressed by Counsel for the Defendants as to why the Fair Competition Act 2002 did not impose any obligation upon C&amp;W Barbados in relation to the period before the grant of the licence to Digicel Barbados on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003.</p>

The text book draws upon the detailed discussion of the topic in the Commission Notice on the Application of the Competition Rules to Access Agreements in the Telecommunications Sector; (1998) OJ C265/02. That notice identifies the circumstances in which a dominant telecommunications operator may be required to give access to its network to enable a new entrant to the market to launch its telecommunications service. The Commission Notice draws on a number of cases dealing with transport infrastructure and harbour facilities, in particular, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sea Containers v Stena Sealink </span>[1993] OJ 1994 L15/8.

The Directive identifies the nature and the scope of the obligation on a dominant operator to allow interconnection to its network. It is clear that the obligation is owed to another operator who has a relevant licence to operate a telecommunications network and is not owed to persons who do not have such licences: see recital (5) and article 4 of the directive. The position is the same in relation to the UK regulations: see regulation 3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The question in the present case is not directly as to the position under European competition law but is, instead, a question as to the combined operation of the Telecommunications Act 2001 and the Fair Competition Act 2002 in Barbados. In my judgment, section 16 of the Fair Competition Act 2002 outlaws abuse of a dominant position. A denial of access to essential facilities can in some circumstances be an abuse of a dominant position. However, this case is specifically about interconnection between telecommunications operators. That topic is dealt with by the specific provisions of the Telecommunications Act 2001 and sections 25 and 28 of that Act, as I interpret them, place duties upon the incumbent operator but those duties are owed only to another licensed operator and are not owed to a person in the period before that person becomes a licensed operator. In my judgment, the way in which Barbados has chosen to give effect to the general duty of a dominant operator to provide access to essential facilities to a new entrant is, in the specific case of interconnection to an existing network, dealt with by the specific provisions of the Telecommunications Act 2001 and is not extended by the general provisions of section 16 of the Fair Competition Act 2002. The position is the same in relation to section 34 of the Fair Competition Act 2002.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have already referred to some of the detailed provisions of the legislation in Barbados. On the present questions, I draw attention to the way in which the legislation provides for the parties to negotiate an interconnection agreement and the expected terms of such an agreement in so far as those terms are relevant to the topic of ordering equipment and carrying out civil works. Sections 25(2)(b) and (e) of the Telecommunications Act 2001 refer to the terms on which interconnection services are to be offered or made available. Section 25(2)(d) of the 2001 Act requires interconnection services to be made available in a timely fashion. Section 25(3) of the 2001 Act refers to the parties agreeing the relevant terms through commercial negotiations. Section 26 of the 2001 Act refers to a dominant carrier filing a RIO which will set out the terms on which interconnection is to be provided. Section 28(1) of the 2001 Act refers to a person requesting interconnection and under section 28(3) the parties are then to negotiate in good faith the terms of an interconnection agreement. I comment that the obligation to act in good faith is in relation to the negotiation of the terms of the agreement. The subsection does not in terms impose an obligation to act in good faith in relation to its handling of the process of interconnection. </p>

I have discussed above the interplay between this provision and the detailed provisions of the Telecommunications Act 2001. In my judgment, section 16 of the 2002 Act does not require any specific behaviour in relation to ordering equipment and carrying out civil works which is not required by the 2001 Act. Further, in my judgment, section 16 of the 2002 Act does not have any implications for the debate as to whether it is open to a party to commercial negotiations to use the bargaining advantages open to it such as the bargaining advantage, referred to as leverage, which is relevant for present purposes. The same reasoning applies to section 34 of the Fair Competition Act 2002.</p>

I conclude that there is nothing in the legislation which specifically required C&amp;W Barbados to order equipment and carry out civil works before finalising the terms of an interconnection agreement. Similarly, there is nothing in the legislation which prohibited C&amp;W Barbados for doing either or both of these things. The legislation contemplates that the parties will conduct commercial negotiations as to an agreement which will provide for all relevant aspects of interconnection. The negotiations must be conducted in good faith. The use of the leverage in question is, in my judgment, normally a legitimate part of commercial negotiations. I do not see that the use of such leverage is a breach of the obligation to conduct commercial negotiations in good faith.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is one further point which arises on the legislation in Barbados. The issue is whether it is open to the parties to finalise, as between themselves, the terms of an interconnection agreement and to implement those terms, even before the terms are approved by the regulator. The question of approval by the regulator is dealt with by section 29 of the 2001 Act. By section 29(1), where the parties agree the terms of an interconnection agreement, the agreement must be filed with the regulator within 30 days of the date of the agreement, for the purpose of seeking the regulator’s approval to the agreement. By section 29(2), the regulator may approve the agreement as filed or may require it to be varied. Section 29(4) deals with the consequences of the parties failing to comply with such a requirement by the regulator. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In my judgment, these provisions do not prohibit the parties from implementing the interconnection agreement, which they have agreed between themselves, before the agreement is approved by the regulator. However, conversely, these provisions do not prevent the parties making an agreement on terms that it is not to take effect until it receives the approval of the regulator. On this reasoning it is, in principle, open to a party either to agree terms subject to such a suspensive condition, or not so subject. If a party insists in the course of negotiations on such a suspensive condition, which is not acceptable to the other party, then a question could arise whether such insistence is being put forward in good faith, as required by section 28(3) of the 2001 Act or is in bad faith, for the purpose of delaying the time when the agreement may be implemented.</p>

Section 73 (e) refers to a person “conspiring with any other person to contravene any provision under this Act”. Questions might arise as to whether all of the ingredients of the common law tort of conspiracy apply to this statutory tort of conspiracy.

I have earlier held that sections 16 and 34 of the 2002 Act do not add anything to the obligations of C&amp;W Barbados under sections 25 and 28 of the 2001 Act. If the Claimants could establish a breach of sections 16 or 34 of the 2002 Act, then by virtue of section 44 of the 2002 Act, such a breach would have been actionable, but the limitation period for such a claim was 3 years from the time when the cause of action arose and the Claimants accept that any claim under sections 16 or 34 was statute barred when they brought these proceedings. Section 44 also extended the class of persons who might be liable for a breach of section 16 or section 34 of the 2002 Act to persons who aided and abetted or counselled and procured or induced such a breach or were parties to such breach or who conspired to contravene sections 16 or 34 of the 2002 Act. However any claim of this kind under section 44 was also statute barred. The only relevance, therefore, of the 2002 Act would be if a breach of sections 16 or 34 amounted to unlawful means for the purposes of the common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. However, I have already held that sections 16 and 34 of the 2002 Act do not add anything to the claims based on sections 25 and 28 of the 2001 Act. The Defendants also submitted that in view of the statutory tort of conspiracy created by section 44(1) of the 2002 Act, there was no room for the common law tort of conspiracy to contravene sections 16 or 34 of the 2002 Act; alternatively, the three year limitation period in section 44(2) of the 2002 Act also applied to any common law tort of conspiracy. In view of my findings as to sections 16 and 34 not adding anything to the claim based on sections 25 and 28 of the Telecommunications Act 2001, it is not necessary to consider those arguments.</p>

If I had held that C&amp;W Barbados had acted in contravention of the legislation then various questions would have arisen as to whether CWWI and/or C&amp;W plc were liable under these express statutory provisions. Further questions would arise as to whether CWWI and/or C&amp;W plc were liable for a common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. In view of my actual findings that C&amp;W Barbados did not contravene the legislation, I will not discuss these questions in any detail.

The Claimants said that the Digicel Barbados was delayed in relation to its launch for more or less the full period of any delay in relation to interconnection. C&amp;W Barbados said that Digicel Barbados had many other matters to deal with, apart from interconnection, before it could be ready to launch and, on the detailed facts, Digicel Barbados was not ready to launch before it actually did so. Accordingly, any delay on the part of C&amp;W Barbados in relation to interconnection had not made any difference to the date when Digicel Barbados launched in Barbados. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have decided that I will not attempt to determine the very many issues which arose in this respect. My reasons for this decision are somewhat similar to the reasons which I have already set out for reaching a similar decision in relation to SLU, although some of the points which led me to my conclusion in SLU do not apply in Barbados. In Barbados my reasons are as follows. First, I have determined that there was no delay to interconnection in breach of any obligation on the part of C&amp;W Barbados, so the question of any delay to Digicel Barbados’ launch does not arise. Secondly, if I attempted to deal with the many points of detail as to a possible delay to the launch in Barbados, I would immediately face the difficulty of having to make an assumption of fact, which I have not held to be well founded, as to when interconnection should have been completed and then to ask whether interconnection on such an assumed date would have allowed Digicel Barbados to launch earlier than it actually did. Indeed, I would have to deal with a number of possible assumed dates depending on what conduct on the part of C&amp;W Barbados is to be assumed (contrary to my actual findings) to have been a breach of duty on its part. The assumed dates of interconnection could have a bearing on the effect of the allegedly delayed interconnection on a planned launch. Thirdly, any attempt to make findings of fact on the question of a possible delayed launch in Barbados would involve a very considerable amount of time and result in delay in concluding my judgment. Fourthly, there were significant arguments as to whether I should permit the Claimants to advance a case that they were delayed from a specified date or alternative specified dates when those dates were not pleaded and the date of commencement of delay, which was pleaded in relation to Barbados, was not contended for by the Claimants in their closing submissions. If I were otherwise minded to make findings of fact as to a possible delay to the launch in Barabdos, it would be necessary to set out in some detail the procedural history in relation to this question and to examine the legal basis for the Defendants’ proposition. Fifthly, the Claimants proposed a particularly burdensome course of action which, they suggested, required me to read a substantial quantity of further documents which had not been referred to at any earlier stage of the trial solely for the purpose of answering the question of whether Digicel Barbados would have been able to launch its network earlier in certain hypothetical circumstances. For all these reasons, I conclude that it would be disproportionate to go further into the facts as to any such delay to launch. Accordingly, I will not make findings on a hypothetical basis as to whether a delay in interconnection did cause delay to Digicel Barbados’ launch.</p>

Whilst it is true that there are similarities between some of the wording in the SLU Act and some of the wording in the 2002 Law, it seems to me to be desirable to analyse and discuss the 2002 Law afresh, and without any preconceptions arising from the earlier discussion of the SLU Act. There are obvious differences between the wording of the 2002 Law and that of the SLU Act, and those differences may well mean that similar wording in the 2002 Law should not automatically be given the same meaning as that wording in the SLU Act.</p>

This definition refers to physical interconnection, and I do not read it as referring to both physical and contractual interconnection.

This subsection makes clear that the duty imposed on an incumbent licensee is owed to another licensee. "Licensee" is defined by the 2002 Law to mean a person to whom a licence is granted by ICTA under the 2002 Law. In this case, Digicel Cayman was granted such a licence, and so became a licensee as defined, on the 17th October 2003. Prior to that date, Digicel Cayman was not such a licensee. It is clear, therefore that the duty imposed on C&amp;W Cayman by section 44 (1) of the 2002 Law did not apply in relation to the period prior to 17th October 2003.</p>

Because “interconnection” is defined by the 2002 Law to mean physical interconnection, section 44 (1) refers to obstructing and impeding physical interconnection, rather than obstructing and impeding contractual interconnection. However, it is clear from the provisions of the 2002 Law taken as a whole, that the parties were expected to make an agreement in relation to the use of physical interconnection, that is, the use of the interconnection service. If the incumbent licensee proposed that the parties negotiate and agree an interconnection agreement before taking steps to achieve physical interconnection, that stance on the part of the incumbent licensee would not, in my judgment, necessarily mean that the incumbent licensee was obstructing or impeding the making of a physical interconnection. If agreement as to the terms of interconnection agreement were necessary, or even desirable, for the purposes of achieving physical interconnection, a proposal to agree such terms could be seen as making progress towards physical interconnection rather than obstructing or impeding it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When discussing section 46 (1) of the SLU Act earlier in this judgment, I recorded my difficulty in interpreting an obligation expressed in the negative so as to create a positive obligation to take action. I then referred to the possibility that section 46 (1) of the SLU Act might be given effect as a true negative obligation on the basis that the new entrant licensee would enjoy, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, a right of access to the incumbent's switch site. The new entrant licensee could rely on that right of access to install interconnection equipment on the incumbent’s switch site and it was that process which the incumbent was not to obstruct or impede. The position in Cayman is different for a number of reasons so that this possible interpretation does not arise. The first is that there is no provision comparable to section 50 of the SLU Act which provides for the new entrant licensee to have access to a site owned by the incumbent. The second difference is that it is, in any event, not necessary to interpret section 44 (1) of the 2002 Law as imposing any kind of positive obligation to take action. That is because other provisions in the 2002 Law do impose a positive obligation to take action. In those circumstances, I incline to the view that section 44 (1) does operate in accordance with its express terms as a negative prohibition on obstruction of, and impeding, the making of physical interconnection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 44 (3) obliges the incumbent licensee, subject to subsection (5), to "provide the interconnection service in a reasonable time". "Interconnection service" is not defined but, in my judgment, interconnection service is a reference to the use of the physical interconnection. Other provisions of the 2002 Law make it clear that the parties are expected to agree terms on which the interconnection service may be used. In this way, section 44 (3) places an obligation on the incumbent licensee to provide interconnection service and, for that purpose, to take the steps that are necessary to enter into an interconnection agreement and to complete the work needed to achieve physical interconnection. Accordingly, section 44 (3) does clearly impose on the incumbent licensee a positive obligation in relation to both physical and contractual interconnection. Section 44 (5) refers to "interconnection" as being provided at reasonable rates and on certain terms and conditions. Section 44 (5) goes on to provide in various ways for controls on the parties’ freedom of action in relation to rates, terms and conditions. On the basis that "interconnection", as defined in the 2002 Law, is a reference to physical interconnection, section 44 (5) should be understood as requiring that physical interconnection is to be provided on certain contractual terms, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the 2002 Law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When discussing sections 44, 45 and 46 of the 2002 Law, I have referred to the various ways in which those sections refer to physical interconnection and to the terms of an agreement on which physical interconnection is to be provided. Those provisions suggests to me that the draughtsman of the 2002 Law contemplated that the ordinary way in which the parties would go about providing physical interconnection and agreeing the terms on which physical interconnection could be used was that the parties would agree the terms of an interconnection agreement and then implement that interconnection agreement by providing physical interconnection. When the physical interconnection was in place, it could be used by the parties on the terms of the interconnection agreement. I do not see anything in these provisions which places an express obligation upon an incumbent licensee to order the necessary equipment for its side of the interconnection and/or to install and test that equipment prior to the parties agreeing the terms of an interconnection agreement. Similarly, there is no provision which obliges the incumbent licensee to carry out civil works to connect the two switch sites (of the incumbent and the new entrant respectively) prior to the parties agreeing the terms of an interconnection agreement. Conversely, there is no express provision in these sections, which prohibits the parties, if they both so wish, from ordering and/or installing and/or testing the equipment to be used on the incumbent licensee’s side of the interconnection, or the carrying out of the civil works prior to the making of an interconnection agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When I considered the position in SLU, I discussed the question whether it was permissible for the incumbent licensee to withhold its agreement to ordering necessary equipment and/or installing and/or testing that equipment, and to decline to carry out civil works, prior to the parties entering into an interconnection agreement, with a view to obtaining leverage over the new entrant licensee in relation to the negotiations as to the terms of the interconnection agreement. It was seen that such leverage might arise for the benefit of the incumbent licensee, because the new entrant licensee would generally be in a hurry to achieve physical and contractual interconnection in order to be able to launch its telecommunications service. In relation to SLU, I commented on what was generally involved in the conduct of commercial negotiations. I concluded that the use of that kind of leverage could be seen as part of ordinary commercial negotiations. I also concluded that the use of that kind of leverage was not contrary to the express provisions of the SLU Act. I reach the same conclusions in those respects in relation to the 2002 Law.</p>

The interconnection process had already begun by that date and the regulations only apply to the later part of that process. Regulation 2 defines "interconnection" in the same way as that word is defined in the 2002 Law. Accordingly, in my judgment, "interconnection" in the 2003 Regulations refers to physical interconnection.</p>

The obligation imposed by regulation 4(1) is said to be "in accordance with the provisions of section 44 of the Law”. There is, however, a difference between the obligation imposed by section 44 and that imposed by regulation 4 (1). Both provisions use the verbs "refuse, obstruct or impede". However, in the case of section 44 (1) of the Law, the thing which is not to be obstructed or impeded is "the making of any interconnection". In the case of regulation 4 (1), the thing which is not to be obstructed or impeded is "the making of any interconnection ... arrangement". I acknowledge that this is not the only possible reading of regulation 4 (1). Another reading would be that regulation 4 (1) prevents the obstruction or impeding of "the making of any interconnection". That reading of regulation 4 (1) would simply repeat the obligation in section 44 (1) and would not add anything. I prefer the reading of regulation 4 (1) which describes the thing which is not to be instructed or impeded as "the making of any interconnection ... arrangement". That way of reading the phrase "the making of any interconnection or infrastructure sharing arrangement" appears to be more consistent with the later provisions in regulation 4 and the terms of regulation 5. Further, that reading of regulation 4 (1) does not mean that regulation 4 (1) is not "in accordance with the provisions of section 44 of the Law "; it will be remembered that section 44 (3) of the Law required the parties to provide the interconnection service in a reasonable time, and in accordance with that requirement, as I see it, regulation 4 (1) will oblige a licensee not to obstruct or impede the making of an interconnection arrangement. On that reading of regulation 4 (1), an interconnection arrangement would mean an arrangement which provided for the achievement of both physical and contractual interconnection.</p>

In my judgment, this regulation means what it says and does not pose any real difficulties of interpretation. The arrangements for interconnection are to be concluded as quickly as possible. The arrangements which are referred to involve both the making of an interconnection agreement and achieving physical interconnection. Regulation 5 does not dictate whether the parties should go about the performance of this obligation by making, in the first instance, an interconnection agreement followed by the implementation of the agreement or, conversely, taking steps to achieve physical interconnection prior to the conclusion of an interconnection agreement. The Claimants have sought to rely upon regulation 5 in their closing submissions and they allege that C&amp;W Cayman acted in breach of regulation 5. However, the Claimants do not plead any breach of regulation 5 in their pleaded case. As the Claimants were permitted on three occasions to amend their pleaded claim in relation to Cayman and as they did not on any of those occasions put forward a claim that C&amp;W Cayman had acted in breach of regulation 5, I will not consider in this judgment any allegation by the Claimants of a breach of regulation 5.</p>

Regulation 6 (a) imposes on each licensee an obligation to negotiate interconnection agreements and to provide interconnection services "in good faith". It is not necessary at this point in the judgment to discuss the precise meaning of the phrase "in good faith". Regulation 6 (b) refers to the parties “in the first instance” attempting to reach agreement on interconnection by negotiation. The phrase “in the first instance” is used primarily to distinguish the negotiations stage from a possible later dispute resolution stage. However, in my judgment, regulation 6 (b) also suggests that in the ordinary way the parties will go about arranging interconnection by negotiating the terms of an interconnection agreement, which will then be implemented so as to provide physical interconnection and which will identify the terms on which the physical interconnection may be used. The same indication can be found in regulation 6 (e), which refers to interconnection being provided on certain terms and conditions. Regulation 6 (g) refers to the party who is to bear the cost of providing interconnection; the sub-paragraph provides that the costs are to be borne in accordance with the interconnection agreement. Again, in my judgment, this suggests that what was expected in the ordinary way was that the parties would make an interconnection agreement and then implement it so that costs would be incurred and borne in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The same point can be made in relation to regulation 6 (k).</p>

The remainder of regulation 8 specifies a detailed timetable, which proceeds by the following stages: a request from the new entrant to the incumbent for  a quotation pursuant to which the incumbent will provide interconnection; an acknowledgment by the incumbent of the request; a statement by the incumbent that the request is complete and accurate or that there is a need for further information; the provision by the incumbent of a quotation as to the rates terms and conditions for obtaining the requested service of interconnection; following the provision of the quotation, the parties are to undertake good faith negotiations for the purpose of producing an interconnection agreement. Regulation 8 (11) identifies five matters, which will be regarded as violating the obligation to act in good faith. It is not necessary to discuss the meaning of regulation 8 (11) at this point in the judgment as its provisions are clear. My reaction to the wording of the timetable in regulation 8 is that it was expected that the parties would conclude an interconnection agreement and then implement that interconnection agreement by, for example, ordering and installing and testing the equipment which was needed on the incumbent’s side of the interconnection and carrying out any necessary civil works.</p>

It identifies, at a minimum, a number of matters which are required to be specified in an interconnection agreement. Amongst those matters are: the capacity and service levels agreed between the parties; "forecasting, ordering, provisioning and testing procedures"; geographical and technical characteristics and location of each point of interconnection; measures anticipated for avoiding interference with damage to the networks of the parties involved or those of third parties; methods for measuring service quality; provision of network information; technical specifications and standards; the procedures to detect and repair faults; the scope and description of the services to be provided; the technical characteristics of all the main and auxiliary signals to be transmitted by the system; the obligations and responsibilities of both parties in the event that inadequate or defective equipment is connected to their respective networks, and any other relevant issue. The details contained in regulation 19 and, in particular, the reference to the interconnection agreement dealing with matters such as forecasting, ordering, provisioning and testing procedures suggests that it was expected that, in the ordinary case, the parties would make an interconnection agreement, and then implement that agreement in relation to those ordering, installation and testing procedures and the carrying out of any civil works.</p>

The 2002 Law does contain a sanction for breach of section 44, in that, under sections 32 and 33 of the 2002 law, ICTA may suspend or revoke a licence held by the licensee who is acting in breach of section 44. Thus, sections 32 and 33 provide a sanction for contravention of section 44. Further, sections 32 and 33 have a remedial function in that section 32(4) and section 33(4) permit ICTA to give the defaulting licensee an opportunity to remedy the breach within a reasonable time before the sanction is imposed. </p>

Section 46 is supplemented by sections 55 and 56 dealing with a review of a decision by ICTA and an appeal to the court.

In such a case, the court may make an order for the payment of compensation to any person for any damage caused by the offence. By section 69(2), the making of an order for compensation does not prejudice any right to a civil remedy for the recovery of damages beyond the amount of compensation paid under the order. It is not necessary to refer to the detailed provisions as to offences under the 2002 Law. However, it can readily be seen that the facts which give rise to such offences could give rise to civil liability under the general law, for example, for assault or for trespass. Section 69 is relevant to the extent that it shows that the legislature considered the circumstances in which a court should be empowered to order payment of compensation and the 2002 Law did not expressly provide for a general right to damages for breach of any provision of the Law.</p>

ICTA can issue a cease and desist order under section 35 for a breach of the regulations. The court can act on the application of ICTA for a breach of the regulations: see section 36(c). The court’s powers on an application under section 36 are provided for in section 37. A decision of ICTA to make a cease and desist order can be appealed to the court under section 56. Regulation 26 also allows disputes as to interconnection to be submitted to ICTA for resolution in accordance with the Information and Communications Technology Authority (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2003. </p>

However, there is a point which arises in Cayman, in relation to this tort, which does not arise in relation to the other jurisdictions. Regulation 30 of the regulations in Cayman provides that a contravention of any provision of the regulations constitutes an offence. In Annex I to this judgment, I discuss the authorities on the question as to whether all crimes are unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. I there explain that I incline to the view that all crimes are unlawful means for this purpose. On that basis, the commission of an offence pursuant to regulation 30 would constitute unlawful means for the purposes of the tort. As explained in Annex I, I did not in the end feel that it was necessary to decide this point in view of the fact that I hold on the facts that C&amp;W Cayman did not commit an offence contrary to regulaton 30. In the remainder of this main judgment, dealing with Cayman, I will assume in favour of the Claimants that the commission of an offence contrary to regulation 30 would constitute unlawful means for the purposes of the tort.</p>

As I have already explained, I am not prepared to extend the scope of “unlawful means” in this context so that it covers a breach of a statute or a regulation, when such breach is not actionable and not a criminal offence. It seems to me that it is consistent with that approach to hold that a breach of a public licence, such as the telecommunications licence in this case, similarly does not constitute unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy.</p>

The Claimants said that the Digicel Cayman was delayed in relation to its launch for more or less the full period of any delay in relation to interconnection. C&amp;W Cayman said that Digicel Cayman had many other matters to deal with, apart from interconnection, before it could be ready to launch and, on the detailed facts, Digicel Cayman was not ready to launch before it actually did so.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have decided that I will not attempt to determine the very many issues which arose in this respect. My reasons for this decision are somewhat similar to the reasons which I have already set out for reaching a similar decision in relation to SLU, although some of the points which led me to my conclusion in SLU do not apply in Cayman. In Cayman my reasons are as follows. First, I have determined that there was no delay to interconnection in breach of any obligation on the part of C&amp;W Cayman, so the question of any delay to Digicel Cayman’s launch does not arise. Secondly, I have held that Digicel Cayman did not have a cause of action in relation to all its matters of complaint but only in relation to matters which involved an allegation that C&amp;W Cayman had conspired with others to commit a breach of the regulations, which would have been a criminal offence and therefore unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Thirdly, if I attempted to deal with the many points of detail as to a possible delay to the launch in Cayman, I would immediately face the difficulty of having to make an assumption of fact, which I have not held to be well founded, as to when interconnection should have been completed and then to ask whether interconnection on such an assumed date would have allowed Digicel Cayman to launch earlier than it actually did. Indeed, I would have to deal with a number of possible assumed dates depending on what conduct on the part of C&amp;W Cayman is to be assumed (contrary to my actual findings) to have been a breach of duty on its part. The assumed dates of interconnection could have a bearing on the effect of the allegedly delayed interconnection on a planned launch. Fourthly, any attempt to make findings of fact on the question of a possible delayed launch in Cayman would involve a very considerable amount of time and result in delay in concluding my judgment. Fifthly, there were significant arguments as to whether I should permit the Claimants to advance a case that they were delayed from a specified date or alternative specified dates when those dates were not pleaded and the date of commencement of delay, which was pleaded in relation to Cayman, was not contended for by the Claimants in their closing submissions. If I were otherwise minded to make findings of fact as to a possible delay to the launch in Cayman, it would be necessary to set out in some detail the procedural history in relation to this question and to examine the legal basis for the Defendants’ proposition. Sixthly, the Claimants proposed a particularly burdensome course of action which, they suggested, required me to read a substantial quantity of further documents which had not been referred to at any earlier stage of the trial solely for the purpose of answering the question of whether Digicel Cayman would have been able to launch its network earlier in certain hypothetical circumstances. For all these reasons, I conclude that it would be disproportionate to go further into the facts as to any such delay to launch. Accordingly, I will not make findings on a hypothetical basis as to whether a delay in interconnection did cause delay to Digicel Cayman’s launch.</p>

The new entrant who obtained a “concession” (the term in T&amp;T which is used for a telecommunications licence) was Digicel T&amp;T. In T&amp;T, Digicel T&amp;T’s claim is against TSTT alone. The claim is not based on the provisions of the Telecommunications Act in T&amp;T nor on the terms of the concession granted to TSTT. The claim is that TSTT acted “contrary to honest practices” and is liable under section 4 of the Protection Against Unfair Competition Act 1996 (“PAUCA”) to pay damages for the resulting loss to Digicel T&amp;T. Digicel T&amp;T originally claimed, in addition, against CWWI and C&amp;W plc on the basis of an allegation of conspiracy between TSTT, CWWI and C&amp;W plc. Digicel T&amp;T maintained that claim until it was abandoned in its written closing submissions. Up to that point, the allegation of conspiracy had been investigated in detail at the trial and, to some extent, the allegation of conspiracy in T&amp;T involved different issues from those arising in the other jurisdictions. One reason for that was that TSTT was not a subsidiary of CWWI or C&amp;W plc; CWWI had a 49% stake in TSTT.</p>

This was because I took the view that an allegation of conduct contrary to honest practices is a serious allegation and the matters which were pleaded as proposed amendments were not always sufficient to disclose a prima face case of such conduct and/or because it was clear to me that Digicel T&amp;T did not have material which would be available to it to support the allegation. In the case of some amendments which I permitted Digicel T&amp;T to make, the allegations were later abandoned and removed in later amendments. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The relevant telecommunications legislation is the Telecommunications Act 2001. Unlike the legislation which applies in the other countries and which has been considered above, this Act does not directly impose duties on a telecommunications provider in relation to interconnection with a new entrant into the market. The Act requires the operator of a public telecommunications network to have a “concession” as it is called (rather than a “licence”): section 21. The Act then provides that the concession must contain terms and conditions dealing with certain matters: see sections 22 and 24.  Interconnection is dealt with in section 25. By section 25(1), a concession must include conditions obliging the concessionaire to provide for interconnection. In respect of that obligation, the regulatory authority, the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (“TATT”) (set up by section 4 of the 2001 Act as amended by the Telecommunications (Amendment) Act 2004, section 5) shall require the concessionaire to comply with a large number of specific guidelines, standards and other matters. Thus the direct source of any obligation in relation to interconnection will not be the 2001 Act but will be the terms of the concession or (following the grant of the concession) the guidelines of TATT or specific requirements of TATT. Accordingly, there can be no claim that the 2001 Act directly imposes duties on TSTT, giving rise to a cause of action against TSTT if the duties are broken. Finally, in relation to the 2001 Act, section 65 (as amended by the Telecommunications (Amendment) Act 2004) makes it an offence for a person to commit a material breach of a condition contained in a concession.</p>

The Claimants submit that the test as to whether something is contrary to honest practices is an objective test. That formulation, by itself, is not particularly helpful as it leads only to the real question as to what precisely the test is. The Claimants then submit that the test is not one of dishonesty, even objectively considered. To assist with the interpretation of section 4 of PAUCA, the Claimants rely upon the treaty obligations of the Government of T&amp;T and a large number of decisions dealing with intellectual property matters, in particular trademarks. The Claimants ultimately submitted that the duty imposed by section 4(1) of PAUCA was a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests involved. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 4(1) begins by referring to “any act or practice”. “Practice” is defined by section 3 of PAUCA to include an omission to act.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 4(1) refers to “in the course of industrial or commercial activities”. This phrase is defined in section 3 to include “the activities of professionals and other such persons”. The meaning of “commercial activities” is reasonably clear and certainly creates no difficulty in the present case. There may be more room for doubt as to the meaning of “industrial”. I imagine that most, if not all, industrial activities would also be commercial activities. Given that PAUCA is, in other sections, concerned with intellectual property it might have been thought that the word “industrial” is being used in the sense it has in the phrase “industrial property”, which was an earlier term for intellectual property. The present case does not involve intellectual property. The Defendants certainly do not submit that industrial activities are confined to intellectual property matters. Such a submission would not have taken the Defendants very far in view of the fact that section 4 is not confined to industrial property or industrial activities but extends to any act or omission in the course of commercial activities. Not only is the phrase “any act or practice” a wide one, so too is the reference to “commercial activities”. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The phrase “that is contrary to honest practices” is a key phrase in section 4(1). In view of the width of the phrase “any act or practice in the course of industrial or commercial activities”, it is essential to focus on the phrase “that is contrary to honest practices” in order to find what is permitted and what is prohibited by section 4(1). The reference to honest practices is thus the essential definition as to what is within section 4(1).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 4(1) states that the act or practice which infringes section 4(1) constitutes an act of unfair competition. It is important to notice that section 4(1) does not use the concept of “unfair competition” to define what is permitted and what is prohibited by section 4(1). The reference to unfair competition is for the purpose of describing the consequence of behaviour which infringes section 4(1). Once one has determined that an act or omission infringes section 4(1), one then calls that act or omission “an act of unfair competition” and that gives rise to a right to claim under section 4(2); under that sub-section a claim may only be brought in relation to damage from “an act of unfair competition”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Section 4(1) refers to matters which are “contrary to honest practices”. I have considered what, if anything, is added by the reference to “practices” in this phrase. In some contexts, a reference to a “practice” might refer to something which is continuous or which occurs regularly. It seems unlikely that this is the meaning intended in the present case because section 4(1) refers to “any act or practice” which effectively means any act or omission. Accordingly, infringing behaviour can consist of a single act which does not continue and which is not repeated. The Claimants say that the word “practices” suggests an objective standard which pays little or no attention to the particular circumstances of the person who carries on the act or practice in question. The difficulty about that submission is that section 4(1) does not refer to practices in general but refers to honest practices. In my judgment, in order to assess whether a practice is honest or not, one needs to look at all the circumstances and that would ordinarily extend to the state of mind of the person responsible for the act or omission in question. In my judgment, the ordinary meaning of the phrase “contrary to honest practices” requires there to be dishonesty involved in the act or omission in question. The thing which is contrary to honesty is dishonesty and in this context the act or omission which is contrary to honest practices is equally an act or omission involving dishonesty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is, of course, essential to consider the meaning of section 4 of PAUCA in the context of the act as a whole. The short title to the act refers to “Protection Against Unfair Competition”. This concept is repeated in the long title which stated that the Act was “to provide for protection against unfair competition”. Section 4 is headed “General Principles” and states that section 4(1) prohibits certain acts or practices “in addition to the acts and practices referred to in sections 5 to 9”. Section 4(1) appears to prohibit an act or practice “contrary to honest practices” which is expressed in general terms whereas the prohibitions in sections 5 to 9 relate to more specific matters. Section 5 deals with causing confusion with respect to another’s enterprise or its activities. Section 6 deals with damaging another’s goodwill or reputation. Section 7 concerns an act or practice which misleads the public. Section 8 deals with discrediting another’s enterprise or its activities. Section 9 is concerned with unfair competition in respect of trade secrets.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Part of the drafting style used in section 4 of PAUCA is repeated in the other sections. The phrase “any act or practice in the course of industrial or commercial activities” is used in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 whereas section 8 refers to “any false or unjustifiable allegation, in the course of industrial or commercial activities”.   In all of the sections, 4 to 9 inclusive, the prohibited conduct is said to “constitute an act of unfair competition”. This particular point emphasises that the act which is prohibited by section 4(1) is not “an act of unfair competition” but is an act or practice “contrary to honest practices”. The reference to “an act of unfair competition” in section 4, as in the other sections, is the stated consequence of the prohibited conduct and not the definition of the prohibited conduct. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The phrase “contrary to honest practices” is used only once in PAUCA although section 9(1) refers to “contrary to honest commercial practices”; it may be that there is no difference between these two phrases, given that both sections 4 and 9 refer to acts or practices in the course of industrial or commercial activities. In any case, I do not find the use of a similar phrase in section 9(1) throws any particular light on the meaning of “contrary to honest practices” in section 4(1). Section 9(2)(e) refers to a third party acquiring a trade secret in circumstances where the third party knew or was grossly negligent in failing to know that a certain act was involved. Whilst that refers to knowledge or the means of knowledge I do not get any very clear guidance from it as to the intended meaning of honest practices in section 4(1). Section 9(4)(a) refers to “an unfair commercial use”. This is a specific example of the prohibited conduct being expressed in terms of its unfairness. Again, I do not get any assistance from section 9(4)(a) for the purpose of construing section 4(1).</p>

This is an objective standard. At first sight this may seem surprising. Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence. Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct not inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety. However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual. If a person knowingly appropriates another’s property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothing wrong in such behaviour. In most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others’ property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Nor does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.”</p>

In summary, she said that liability for dishonest assistance requires a dishonest state of mind on the part of the person who assists in a breach of trust. Such a state of mind may consist in knowledge that the transaction is one in which he cannot honestly participate (for example, a misappropriation of other people’s money), or it may consist in suspicion combined with a conscious decision not to make enquiries which might result in knowledge: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Manifest Shipping Co Limited v Uni-Polaris Insurance Co Limited</span> [2003] 1 AC 469.

In this way, the information which the trader had was material. The question was whether others would regard what he was doing as honest and his personal state of mind was irrelevant. It did not matter whether the advertiser believed the statements were true; the question was whether an honest man, given the information the advertiser had, would have been prepared to make those statements.</p>

The Bill was then passed in the Senate on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1996 and the Senate amendments were agreed to by the House of Representatives on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 1996. I was shown the debates on the Bill in the Senate on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1996. I was shown these debates for the purpose of informing me that T&amp;T was a signatory to the Paris Convention and that the Bill was brought forward for reasons which included a wish to give effect to T&amp;T’s international obligations under that Convention. If the Claimants wish to rely upon the debates in the Senate for wider purposes, then I am far from clear that they are able to do so. I did not receive any submissions as to whether the decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pepper v Hart </span>[1993] AC 593 applies to legislation in Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Assuming that the rules laid down in that case do apply in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, then parliamentary material may be introduced as an aid to statutory construction where (a) the legislation was ambiguous or obscure or led to absurdity; (b) the material relied upon consisted of one or more statements by a minister or other promoter of the bill together if necessary with such other parliamentary material as was necessary to understand such statements and their effect and (c) the statements relied upon were clear. I doubt if these requirements are met in relation to the debates in the Senate in T&amp;T. In particular, if the Claimants had wished to rely upon those debates for the purpose of showing the court that the Senate intended that the conduct prohibited by section 4(1) of PAUCA would extend beyond dishonest behaviour to any behaviour which was unfair competition or unfair behaviour in relation to the legitimate interests involved, I do not find the statements in the Senate to be clearly to that effect. Indeed, during the debate on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1996, there appears to have been concern expressed as to the possible width of clause 4 of the Bill. The draughtsman of the Bill had departed from article 10 bis (2) of the Paris Convention by changing “any act of competition” to “any act or practice”. Clause 4 was amended but the amendment did not alter clause 4(1); instead, it sought to limit the persons who could claim under clause 4(2). As regards the Paris Convention being the source of the Bill, it was stated at page 19 of the official report of the debate on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1996 that there was no single model for the Bill in that it had been drawn from the unfair competition law of several jurisdictions and put together. At pages 16 to 17 of the report of that day’s debate, when referring to honest practices, it was said that the notion of honest practices would have to be interpreted by the judicial authorities in Trinidad and Tobago and the judiciary could be assisted by the case law of other nations with similarly worded legislation.</p>

The claim was for interim relief in the form of various injunctions against TSTT. The claim was put on various bases and it is not necessary to refer to all of the claims which were made. In particular, the claimant relied on section 4 of PAUCA. There was also reliance on section 6 of PAUCA which provides that any act or practice, in the course of commercial activities, that damages or is likely to damage the goodwill or reputation of another’s enterprise constitutes an act of unfair competition. At paragraph 26 of his judgment, the learned judge stated that he did not propose to embark on any great exposition of the law, although that comment may have been principally directed at the law relating to the grant of interlocutory injunctions. He dealt with the claims under PAUCA at paragraphs 32 to 36 of his judgment. At paragraph 33, he stated that claims under PAUCA were “very much uncharted territory in Trinidad and Tobago” and that there was no direct authority on such claims. At paragraph 33, he stated that the phrase “act or practice” was to be interpreted broadly. At paragraph 34, he stated that in connection with the provision of interconnection, TSTT was required by PAUCA “to treat fairly with Digicel and to engage fair practices in the course of competing with Digicel.” He added: “[t]his would include affording to Digicel the same treatment it affords its own mobile network in relation to its landlines and vice versa.” At paragraph 36, he held that the claimant in the proceedings before him had an arguable case that it was subjected to “acts of unfair competition”. The learned judge did not at any stage discuss the meaning of the phrase “contrary to honest practices”. It is not clear whether the judge had in mind the provisions of section 6 of PAUCA, rather than section 4, when he made the remarks I have quoted. I acknowledge that in paragraph 40 of his judgment he stated: “Given the breadth of section 4 of [PAUCA], it is more than arguable that such a practice is unfair”. Taking that sentence in isolation, it suggests that he was approaching section 4 on the basis that it prohibited anything which the court considered was an unfair practice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Having considered the language in which section 4 of, and the remainder of, PAUCA is expressed and considering all the material put before me by the Claimants, I can now state my conclusions. Section 4(1) of PAUCA is clear in its expression. The phrase “any act or practice” is very wide indeed. The phrase “in the course of industrial or commercial activities” provides some limitation on the earlier phrase but does extend to all commercial activities of whatever kind. Section 4(1) is not confined to acts of competition. Section 4(1) is not confined to intellectual property. This means that section 4(1), until one comes to the phrase “contrary to honest practices”, is potentially very wide in its reach. The phrase “contrary to honest practices” is therefore a key phrase in order to define the scope of section 4(1) and to divide permitted activities from prohibited activities. As a matter of language, contrary to honest practices is referring to acts or omissions which involve dishonesty. The Claimants’ approach to the phrase “contrary to honest practices” gives that phrase a very wide ambit. If I held that the phrase prohibited any act or omission which was unfair having regard to the legitimate interests involved in the commercial activities in question, that would prohibit a vast range of behaviour. It would not be confined to unfair use of a trade mark, or unfair use of intellectual property or even unfair acts of competition. If I held that section 4(1) imposed a liability for honest behaviour which was careless (as the Claimants submit that I should) then, again, the scope of section 4(1) would be excessively wide. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have considered with care the background to PAUCA as represented by the Paris Convention and I have also considered the body of case law on the meaning of “contrary to honest practices” in the specific case of trade marks. If that body of law was lifted out of its context and grafted onto the different context of section 4 of PAUCA then, as explained above, the width of the prohibition which resulted would be unacceptable, at least to my mind. I am not prepared to foist onto Trinidad and Tobago an interpretation of that width particularly when the language used in the provision is clear and is much narrower. The ordinary meaning of the words used in section 4 is limited to acts of omissions involving dishonesty. Accordingly, I hold that section 4(1) of PAUCA refers to any act or practice in the course of industrial or commercial activities which involves dishonesty, in accordance with the meaning of that word given in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan</span>.   </p>

First, TSTT acted contrary to honest practices when Mr Espinal telephoned Ms Bejar of Nortel in late September 2005 and instructed her not to complete the process of interconnection between TSTT and the new entrants in T&amp;T, including Digicel T&amp;T, before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. Secondly, TSTT’s involvement in the composition of Mr Davy’s letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 and TSTT’s later use of that letter was contrary to honest practices.</p>

My conclusion in relation to the first breach of section 4 of PAUCA described above is that Digicel T&amp;T has failed to establish that it suffered loss and damage as a result of the conversation referred to in that Digicel T&amp;T has failed to show that it had a real or substantial chance of having been better off if that conversation had not taken place and in particular has failed to show that it had a real or substantial chance that interconnection would have been completed before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.

The Claimants said that Digicel T&amp;T was delayed in relation to its launch for the period of any delay in relation to interconnection. TSTT said that Digicel T&amp;T had many other matters to deal with, apart from interconnection, before it could be ready to launch and, on the detailed facts, Digicel T&amp;T was not ready to launch before it actually did so. Accordingly, any delay on the part of TSTT in relation to interconnection had not made any difference to the date when Digicel T&amp;T launched in T&amp;T. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have decided that I will not attempt to determine the very many issues which arose in this respect. My reasons for this decision are somewhat similar to the reasons which I have already set out for reaching a similar decision in relation to Barbados. In T&amp;T my reasons are as follows. First, I have determined that there was no delay to interconnection  even though TSTT was in breach of section 4 of PAUCA. Secondly, if I attempted to deal with the many points of detail as to a possible delay to the launch in T&amp;T, I would immediately face the difficulty of having to make an assumption of fact, which I have not held to be well founded, as to when interconnection should have been completed and then to ask whether interconnection on such an assumed date would have allowed Digicel T&amp;T to launch earlier than it actually did. Indeed, I may have to deal with a number of possible assumed dates depending on what Digicel T&amp;T says is the date on which interconnection should have been completed (contrary to my actual findings). The assumed dates of interconnection could have a bearing on the effect of the allegedly delayed interconnection on a planned launch. Thirdly, any attempt to make findings of fact on the question of a possible delayed launch in T&amp;T would involve a very considerable amount of time and result in delay in concluding my judgment. Fourthly, there were significant arguments as to whether I should permit the Claimants to advance a case that they were delayed from a specified date or alternative specified dates when those dates were not pleaded and the date of commencement of delay, which was pleaded in relation to T&amp;T, was not contended for by the Claimants in their closing submissions. If I were otherwise minded to make findings of fact as to a possible delay to the launch in T&amp;T, it would be necessary to set out in some detail the procedural history in relation to this question and to examine the legal basis for the Defendants’ proposition. Fifthly, the Claimants proposed a particularly burdensome course of action which, they suggested, required me to read a substantial quantity of further documents, which had not been referred to at any earlier stage of the trial, solely for the purpose of answering the question of whether Digicel T&amp;T would have been able to launch its network earlier in certain hypothetical circumstances. For all these reasons, I conclude that it would be disproportionate to go further into the facts as to any such delay to launch. Accordingly, I will not make findings on a hypothetical basis as to whether a delay in interconnection did cause delay to Digicel T&amp;T’s launch.</p>

By regulation 5 (3), it was provided that the duty to interconnect specified in regulation 5 (1) obliged CWWI to refrain from refusing, obstructing or in any way impeding the interconnection of another carrier or service provider, entitled to obtain such interconnection. Whereas the duty in regulation 5 (1) is expressed as a positive duty on CWWI, the obligation on CWWI imposed by regulation 5 (3) is expressed in what are clearly negative terms. In my judgment, it is neither necessary, nor appropriate, to read regulation 5 (3) as imposing a positive duty on CWWI to provide interconnection.

The duty owed by CWWI under regulation 9 plainly only applied to a request for interconnection from a licensed operator. Under regulation 9 (5), it was provided that the parties were to negotiate in good faith with the objective of concluding an interconnection agreement. Regulation 9 (6) stated that good faith negotiations required, at a minimum, adherence by the parties to a detailed timetable. This timetable identified a period for acknowledgment of a request for interconnection and a further period for the provision of a complete response to a request for interconnection.</p>

It will be remembered that section 23 of the Ordinance referred to the regulator issuing instructions in respect of interconnection. Accordingly, regulation 10 is such an instruction in relation to the contents of interconnection agreements. By regulation 10, an interconnection agreement was to address a large number of matters, including the technical characteristics of interconnection, capacity levels, service levels, forecasting, "ordering and provisioning", provision of information, fault detection and repair and provision for breaches of the agreement.</p>

It seems to have been contemplated that the parties would negotiate and agree the terms of an interconnection agreement and then implement that agreement in order to provide interconnection. There is no express obligation upon CWWI, whether pursuant to the Ordinance or the Regulations, to order and/or install and/or test the specialist equipment needed for its side of the interconnection, or to carry out civil works, before concluding an interconnection agreement. Conversely, there was no prohibition upon the parties, if both so wished it, making an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> agreement which dealt with ordering or installation or testing equipment, or the carrying out of civil works, before they concluded a comprehensive interconnection agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When considering the obligations on CWWI in SLU, I discussed what was involved in the course of ordinary commercial negotiations. I reached the following conclusion, as to the usual position of parties to negotiations where one party is under time pressure and wishes some step to be taken prior to the conclusion of those negotiations and the other party is not under time pressure and does not have any reason of his own to see that step taken prior to the conclusion of negotiations. In such negotiations, the second party has a bargaining advantage which it is ordinarily legitimate for that party to use to encourage the first party to agree terms more favourable to the second party, so that the agreed terms can then be implemented and the step which the first party wants to see taken can then be taken in accordance with the agreed terms. I also considered that it was not contrary to the legislation in SLU for the second party to use that advantage to negotiate more favourable terms by declining to order and/or to install and test interconnection equipment and/or to carry out civil works before the parties had entered into an interconnection agreement which provided for all those steps to be taken. Having considered the Ordinance and the regulations in TCI, I consider that the conclusions I reached in SLU are also appropriate in TCI. However, as will be seen in TCI, the question of ordering and installing and testing equipment and carrying out civil works did not rest on the terms of the Ordinance and the regulations but was made the subject to an express contract entered into by CWWI and Digicel TCI.</p>

By section 51(2) a licensee is obliged to comply with such a direction. If a licensee fails to comply with such a direction then under section 51(5), the regulator may censure the licensee publicly and impose a financial penalty and enforce a remedy available to the regulator under the licensee’s licence, including a suspension or revocation of that licence. By section 51(6), where the regulator imposes a penalty under section 51(5), the penalty is recoverable in the same manner as a fine imposed by the magistrates’ court. Section 52 deals with revocation and suspension. By section 52(1) the regulator may give to the licensee a notice requiring the licensee to take remedial action. Thereafter, the regulator may suspend or revoke the licence.</p>

The harm which may be suffered by a licensee requesting interconnection as a result of a breach of duty is economic loss.  The duties in question are imposed upon a private entity. The 2004 Ordinance imposes sanctions for a breach of a duty in the regulations. Section 51(1) of the Ordinance refers to non-compliance with a provision of the subordinate legislation and this extends to the regulations. Thus a breach of the regulations entitles the regulator to give a direction under section 51(1) requiring compliance with the regulations and under section 51(2) a licensee is obliged to comply with that direction. If the licensee does not comply with a direction which requires compliance with the regulations, then the regulator can act under section 51(5) and (6) of the Ordinance. Further, in a case where the regulator has acted under section 51(1) to require compliance with the regulations and the regulator’s directions have not been complied with then the regulator may require remedial action under section 52(1) and, in case of default, suspend or revoke the licence.</p>

CWWI accepted in its submissions to me that the MOU placed on it a contractual obligation of some kind in relation to ordering interconnection equipment.  It seemed to be accepted that CWWI was to commence the process of ordering the equipment but, it was submitted, the letter said nothing as to any timetable for the placing of the order for the equipment or for later stages of the process.  The Claimants submitted that CWWI was contractually obliged to order the interconnection equipment “immediately”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I am not able to accept CWWI’s submission that the memorandum of understanding does not lay down a timetable for the various matters which are the subject of the MOU.  Starting with the question of ordering interconnection equipment, the MOU makes clear that the task of ordering the interconnection equipment is included within “this work” and the phrase “this work” refers to “the physical and technical interconnection necessary to interconnect their respective networks”.  On that basis, the task of ordering the interconnection equipment is to be commenced and completed “immediately”.  The ordinary meaning of “immediately” can be expressed in different ways.  It can mean “without delay” or “at once”.  The word “immediately” has to be read in context.  Part of the context is that the parties to the MOU appreciated that for CWWI to order interconnection equipment, it would be necessary for certain preliminary stages to be gone through.  The Claimants do not appear to challenge the need for CWWI to communicate with an equipment supplier to obtain a proposal or a quotation from the supplier, for that quotation or proposal to be placed before CWWI for approval of the expenditure and, following that approval, for the order to be placed with the supplier.  The Claimants submitted that CWWI had to go through those stages as soon as possible but the Claimants were prepared to accept that the obligation might mean that CWWI should go through those stages “as soon as reasonably practicable”.  In my judgment, the obligation is to go through the various stages with a view to placing the order for the interconnection equipment as soon as reasonably practicable.  </p>

CWWI is also to commence commissioning and testing the interconnection equipment within one week of completion of installation.  It must have been envisaged that CWWI would be obliged to do more than simply commence the installation of the equipment; it must have been envisaged that it would complete that installation.  Indeed, in my judgment, the MOU expressly says so when it directs that CWWI is to complete the physical and technical interconnection, necessary to interconnect the respective networks, “immediately”.  Accordingly, CWWI must complete the installation of the interconnection equipment as soon as reasonably practicable after it has commenced the installation.  CWWI then has one further week from completion of installation to commence commissioning and testing the interconnection equipment and then must complete commissioning and testing as soon as reasonably practicable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The parties disagree as to what is meant by the phrase “the required interconnect equipment”.  There seem to be two points in play.  The first is whether this phrase refers to the MUX and associated cables (this is sometimes called the optical equipment or the transmission equipment) or whether the phrase extends to other work, by way of an upgrade of the switch and signalling equipment at the CWWI switch site.   The second point appears to be, once one has identified the interconnection equipment which is needed to interconnect the two networks, whether CWWI has to order all of that equipment or whether it must order only such of it as is immediately needed having regard to spare equipment which might be available to CWWI.  </p>

In my judgment, the phrase may go further than those items.  The interconnection equipment which is “required” is the interconnection equipment which is required to “complete the physical and technical interconnection necessary to interconnect their respective networks”.  Therefore, one asks: what is the equipment which needs to be installed so that, following installation, one could properly say that the two networks have been interconnected and the interconnection will work?  If that process requires the addition of equipment to the switch or signalling equipment then the equipment which needs to be added is part of the required interconnection equipment. Conversely, if CWWI had a wish to carry out an upgrade to its network and, in particular, the switch and signalling equipment and even if it made sense to carry out that upgrade at the same time as it installed the equipment needed to effect the interconnection, the equipment needed for the upgrade is not part of the required interconnection equipment.  </p>

It is clear that CWWI would be entitled to draw on its stock of spares if it wished to do so.  If the item taken from stock was part of the equipment needed to interconnect the networks then CWWI would be entitled to charge for the item which it supplied to itself from its stock.  The question is: if CWWI decides not to supply itself with an item from stock and if the ordering of that item afresh in some way delayed the ordering or delivery of other equipment, has CWWI broken the MOU because it has not ordered the “required” equipment as soon as reasonably practicable?  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I have decided that I will not attempt to determine the very many issues which arose in this respect. First of all, I have determined that there was no delay to interconnection by reason of any breach of any obligation placed on CWWI. Secondly, I have held on the facts that there was no conspiracy between CWWI and C&amp;W plc in relation to TCI. Thirdly, I have held that even if there had been a conspiracy to act in breach of the legislation in TCI, it would not have been actionable. Fourthly, if I attempted to deal with the many points of detail as to a possible delay to the launch in TCI, I would immediately face the difficulty of having to make an assumption of fact, which I have not held to be well founded, as to when interconnection should have been completed and then to ask whether interconnection on such an assumed date would have allowed Digicel TCI to launch earlier than it actually did. Indeed, I think that I would have to deal with a number of possible assumed dates depending on what conduct on the part of CWWI is to be assumed (contrary to my actual findings) to have been a breach of its obligations. The assumed dates of interconnection could have a bearing on the effect of the allegedly delayed interconnection on a planned launch. Fifthly, any attempt to make findings of fact on the question of a possible delayed launch in TCI would involve a very considerable amount of time and delay in concluding my judgment. Sixthly, there were significant arguments as to whether I should permit the Claimants to advance a case that they were delayed from a specified date or alternative specified dates when those dates were not pleaded and the date of commencement of delay, which was pleaded in relation to TCI, was not contended for by the Claimants in their closing submissions. If I were otherwise minded to make findings of fact as to a possible delay to the launch in TCI, it would be necessary to set out in some detail the procedural history in relation to this question and to examine the legal basis for the Defendants’ proposition. This is an additional reason why it is disproportionate to go further into the facts as to any such delay to launch. Finally, in relation to any assessment of when Digicel TCI would have been able to launch, the Claimants invited me to take the burdensome course of reading additional documents which they supplied as part of their closing submissions and which had not been examined at any earlier stage of the trial and had not been put to any witness.</p>

Further, it is not appropriate to discuss the law or the facts as to whether the present is a case of exemplary damages or what have been called restitutionary damages. </p>

CWWI was not prepared to negotiate with Digicel SLU in earnest on the terms of an interconnection agreement in SLU. Those representing CWWI took the view that there was no obligation on CWWI either under the Telecommunications Act or under the relevant regulations to negotiate the subject of interconnection with someone who was not yet a licensee. Digicel SLU also believed this was the position at that stage. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel SLU does allege, however, that a failure by CWWI to negotiate with Digicel SLU from June to September 2002, a period during which Digicel SLU had the status of a potential competitor, was a breach of the terms of CWWI’s licence which sought to outlaw various kinds of anti-competitive behaviour. I have already ruled that this attempt to rely on the terms of the licence is unfounded. It follows that CWWI’s stance in relation to negotiations prior to the grant of a licence to Digicel SLU on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 did not involve a breach of any duty owed by CWWI. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel SLU invites the Court to have regard to what happened, or did not happen, during this period for two other reasons. First, it suggests that CWWI’s stance shows that CWWI wished to delay Digicel SLU’s entry into the market. Secondly, Digicel SLU says that the fact that a formal request for interconnection was made on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002 is part of the background when one assesses CWWI’s response following 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 to a valid request for interconnection. As to the first of these points, I accept that the principal reason for CWWI being reluctant to attempt to make progress in negotiations prior to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 is that CWWI did not wish to co-operate with Digicel SLU, at that stage, in order to bring forward Digicel SLU’s entry into the market. Although CWWI and those representing it were reticent about admitting that fact in the course of the evidence and although it is possible to identify arguments based on other grounds to support CWWI’s stance, I accept that the primary reason for its behaviour is as I have described. As to the second point made by Digicel SLU, although the events, or non-events, in the period from 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2002 to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 are potentially relevant to what happened later, in the event, I have not found this background to be of any particular significance when assessing the arguments in relation to the allegations about breaches of duty on or after 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I now deal with the topic of the possible ordering of equipment by CWWI before the parties had agreed the terms of an interconnection agreement. As stated above, Digicel SLU obtained its licence in St Lucia on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. On the same day, Digicel SLU wrote to the carrier services team, acting for CWWI, to request interconnection. Representatives of the two sides met on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. Digicel SLU asked CWWI to order the equipment intended to be used on the CWWI side of physical interconnection at that stage rather than waiting until the interconnection agreement was finalised. There is a minor dispute of fact as to CWWI’s response to that request. I find that Mr Batstone of carrier services, on behalf of CWWI, stated that he would take this request for pre-ordering equipment back to Mr Thompson. Mr Batstone did not, as was alleged at the trial, agree at that meeting to pre-order equipment. </p>

This relates to the question whether it was Digicel SLU who was to provide a list of the equipment it needed to CWWI or CWWI was to provide to Digicel SLU a list of the equipment which Digicel SLU needed. I find as a fact that what was discussed was that Digicel SLU would provide to CWWI a list of the equipment which Digicel SLU believed it needed. </p>

Mr Batstone on behalf of CWWI told Digicel SLU that CWWI would not order equipment in advance of finalising the interconnection agreement. He gave three reasons for CWWI’s stance. He said, first, that ordering equipment for interconnection with Digicel SLU would be an unhelpful precedent in the case of other persons requesting interconnection, secondly, that it would expose CWWI to financial risk and, thirdly, there would be difficulties with obtaining internal approval at CWWI for the capital expenditure involved. He did not say that CWWI’s reasons were, or included, the consideration that postponing the ordering of equipment until the interconnection terms were agreed would assist CWWI in the negotiations as to those terms. </p>

Mr Thompson told Mr Miller that he had instructed the carrier services team conducting the negotiations on behalf of CWWI that CWWI would not purchase equipment nor agree to take over equipment purchased by Digicel SLU on CWWI’s  behalf until the interconnection agreement had been approved by the regulator. Mr Thompson stated his belief that the best chance to get a “reasonable agreement approved is to introduce time pressure into the process.” Mr Thompson stated that he expected that the ministers and/or the regulator might try to pressurise CWWI into early ordering of equipment. </p>

Digicel SLU explained its view that pre-ordering would not be an unfortunate precedent. It also explained that the question of financial exposure could be dealt with by provision of security by Digicel SLU and it questioned the reality of the suggested difficulty in relation to capital expenditure. </p>

Digicel SLU suggested that the parties should try to agree an interim agreement setting out all the matters they could agree, and leaving other maters to be determined by the regulator, but so that interconnection could proceed on the basis of the interim agreement. CWWI did not accept that suggestion. </p>

He suggested that someone from carrier services should have “a subtle chat” with the right person in Nortel essentially for the purpose of advising Nortel that it was not to use any information it had from C&amp;W as a client to assist when fulfilling the order to be placed by Digicel SLU. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In January 2003, there were a number of days of negotiations between Digicel SLU and CWWI. Those negotiations were attended by government representatives from SLU (and SVG). Mr Thompson of carrier services on behalf of CWWI obviously saw the question of CWWI ordering equipment, or using the equipment which Digicel had ordered and which was in SLU, as a difficult topic in the negotiations. On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, Mr Thompson sent an email to Mr Lerwill, who was the Deputy Chief Executive of C&amp;W Plc and the Chief Executive of C&amp;W Regional. Mr Thompson contacted Mr Lerwill because he needed Mr Lerwill’s approval to the capital expenditure involved in the proposal contained in the email. At that time there was a freeze on capital expenditure and Mr Lerwill was the only person in C&amp;W Regional allowed to authorise the relevant expenditure. Mr Thompson explained to Mr Lerwill that the carrier services team’s policy had been to purchase equipment only when the parties had finalised an interconnection agreement which had been approved by the regulator. Mr Thompson stated that Digicel SLU, having bought the equipment for CWWI, was applying pressure for CWWI to accept ownership of the equipment to speed up physical interconnection. Mr Thompson thought this would be an unhelpful precedent. He stated that the lead time for delivery of the main items of the equipment was typically 4 to 6 weeks. Mr Thompson believed that he could resist the pressure to accept the equipment which had been purchased by Digicel SLU for CWWI if he could tell the Government representatives and Digicel SLU that CWWI had actually placed an order for its own equipment. The value of ordering equipment at that stage was described by Mr Thompson as “tactical”. On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2003, Mr Lerwill approved the capital expenditure involved in Mr Thompson’s request. CWWI then ordered the equipment on or about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Further negotiations took place in SLU on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2003 and in Miami on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. Digicel SLU says that it finally agreed terms with CWWI because it wanted to get on with physical interconnection. The parties signed an interconnection agreement on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2003. That agreement was submitted to the regulator for his approval and the agreement was approved on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003. In the meantime, the equipment ordered by CWWI arrived in SLU on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003 and cleared customs on or about 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I can summarise the position as follows. On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, Digicel SLU requested CWWI to order, at that stage, the equipment needed by CWWI. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, CWWI stated that it would not order the equipment at that stage. CWWI at all times thereafter until 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 maintained the stance that it would not order equipment until the parties had finalised an interconnection agreement and/or that agreement was approved by the regulator. CWWI and the carrier services team did not believe that this stance amounted to a breach of the duty on CWWI under the 2000 Act or the regulations. CWWI and the carrier services team thought that the Act and the regulations permitted CWWI to take the stance that the parties should agree terms first, have those terms approved and then implement the agreement by, amongst other things, ordering equipment. In particular, Mr Batstone and Mr Thompson believed that this was the position. I do not find that anyone at CWWI or the carrier services team believed that there was a legal prohibition on CWWI pre-ordering equipment. Even if anyone had believed that, it was clear that the government representatives and the regulator positively wanted CWWI to pre-order equipment. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">It was an important part of the reasoning of the carrier services team, on behalf of CWWI, that a tactic of not pre-ordering equipment would give to CWWI a negotiating advantage and a better chance of getting the best available terms agreed with Digicel SLU and then approved by the regulator. CWWI did not ever state to Digicel SLU that this was an important part of its reasoning. It saw no reason so to state but, in particular, it probably felt that a disclosure of its negotiating tactic might diminish the effect of the tactic and lead the government representatives or the regulator to apply further pressure on CWWI. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the three reasons put forward by CWWI for its decision not to pre-order, the alleged precedent effect could easily have been dealt with. The third reason, the need for capital expenditure approval, could also have been dealt with. It was suggested that capital expenditure approval would not have been given to incur expenditure when CWWI did not have the benefit of an enforceable interconnection agreement with Digicel SLU. I do not believe that there would have been any real difficulty in that respect, if CWWI had security for reimbursement of the cost from Digicel SLU. As to the provision of security for reimbursement of the costs, Digicel SLU caused an unnecessary difficulty by contending that it was not liable to pay for the equipment ordered by CWWI. However, Digicel SLU did make various offers to provide security for any liability it had to reimburse the costs to CWWI. If this question of security had been the only issue standing in the way of pre-ordering equipment, then it is more likely than not that terms, which ought to have been satisfactory to CWWI, could have been agreed. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the overall time which would be taken to finalise an interconnection agreement and then to begin and complete physical interconnection thereafter, Digicel SLU wanted matters to proceed very quickly. Digicel SLU may have been unrealistic as to the length of time that would be needed. CWWI did not wish matters to proceed quickly. By adopting the tactic of finalising the interconnection agreement first and ordering equipment second, the result might be that the process would take longer overall. This was not inevitably so. The period of time from ordering equipment to delivery of equipment might be as short as four weeks (as it actually was in SLU) or might be predicted to be some eight weeks. The tactic of withholding ordering of equipment until interconnection terms were agreed might hasten the time when those terms were agreed. If the parties did agree terms quickly, probably terms which were more favourable to CWWI than might otherwise have been the case, then time would be saved thereby and ordering of equipment would follow. If, on the other hand, the negotiations became protracted, then one way of looking at the matter was that Digicel SLU’s refusal to accept CWWI’s terms would prolong the matter overall. That would be a concern to Digicel SLU but would not be a concern to CWWI. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In my main judgment, I have given my reasons for the conclusion that CWWI did not breach its duty under section 46(1) of the 2000 Act or regulation 5 by using the tactic of not ordering equipment before an interconnection agreement was signed to assist CWWI in its negotiations. In my judgment, on the facts in relation to SLU, because an important part of CWWI’s reasoning was that this tactic was available to it and could and should be used, the result is that CWWI did not, on the facts, commit a breach of its duties in this respect. </p>

CWWI’s motive was that it did not wish to take any action to bring forward Digicel SLU’s entry into the market unless it was obliged to do so and it felt it was not obliged to do so. It is not possible to identify any delay which was, in the event, caused by this un-cooperative attitude on its part. CWWI’s position in this respect appears to have been overtaken by the later event of CWWI ordering its equipment on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 which was before the parties finalised the interconnection agreement on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2003.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Initially, Digicel SLU’s only complaint about the pace of physical interconnection in SLU related to the fact that CWWI had not ordered the equipment it needed prior to 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. However, at the outset of the trial, Digicel SLU obtained permission to amend its Particulars of Claim to allege that CWWI had refused at the negotiation meetings in Miami on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003 to accept the equipment which Digicel SLU had previously ordered for CWWI’s side of the interconnection and which had arrived in SLU on or about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002. In its closing submissions, Digicel SLU said that the effect of CWWI’s refusal to accept the equipment which had been ordered by Digicel SLU introduced a further period of delay, of approximately 3 to 4 weeks, into the process of physical interconnection. I note that Digicel SLU does not say that CWWI was in breach by not accepting Digicel SLU’s offer to buy equipment on CWWI’s behalf much earlier in the process or that CWWI was in breach by not accepting this equipment when it was delivered to SLU on or about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002. This can be understood on the basis that whereas Digicel SLU argues that CWWI was under an obligation to obtain the necessary equipment before finalising the interconnection agreement, Digicel SLU does not argue that there was an obligation to install and test that equipment at any time before finalising the interconnection agreement. I note that in other jurisdictions, the Claimants contend that there was an obligation to install and test equipment before finalising the interconnection agreement.</p>

The first method was to use the equipment which had been ordered by Digicel SLU and the second method was for CWWI to continue with the order it had placed on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, to wait for that equipment to be delivered and then to proceed accordingly. It is clear from the notes of the meetings in late January 2003, that the parties expressly referred to both possibilities. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Black of Digicel referred to these meetings in his witness statement. At paragraph 43(b) he described matters in a way which was, at least, suggestive of the possibility that it was for CWWI to decide which route to follow. What CWWI conceded at that stage was that it would get on with physical interconnection and would not wait for the terms, agreed between the parties, to be approved by the regulator. When cross-examined, Mr Black suggested that his witness statement needed elaboration and what had been envisaged was that CWWI could only choose whichever of the two methods which was going to deliver physical interconnection earlier. I have considered Mr Black’s evidence in chief and in cross-examination together with such indications as there are in the contemporaneous documents. For the reasons which I will explain, I do not accept Mr Black’s evidence insofar as he suggests that there was an agreement obliging CWWI to accept the faster option. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">What does emerge from the documents is that on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, representatives of Digicel SLU were in the course of exploring with Nortel which of the two options would be faster. Nortel pointed out that the equipment delivered to Digicel SLU in November 2002 was not the same as the equipment ordered by CWWI on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003. In particular, there were differences in the software. Nortel’s position was that if the equipment which had been delivered to Digicel SLU was to be transferred to CWWI so that there would be, effectively, a contract of sale between Nortel and CWWI, containing the usual warranties, it would be necessary for the equipment in Digicel SLU’s possession to be returned to Nortel, for changes to be carried out and then for it to be re-delivered to CWWI. At the trial, Mr Doyle of Digicel suggested that the representative of Nortel dealing with the matter was reluctant to permit the equipment which had been delivered to Digicel SLU to be redirected to CWWI. It was suggested that he was concerned about his commission on the sale of the equipment to Digicel SLU; it was suggested that if the equipment was redirected to CWWI, a different salesman in Nortel would receive the commission. Therefore, the first salesman in Nortel was trying to make it difficult for the equipment to be redirected to CWWI. Whether there is substance in that explanation does not matter. It was Nortel who was causing a difficulty about the equipment being transferred to CWWI. Further, Digicel SLU knew that Nortel was causing a difficulty. </p>

He said that this question as to the choice between the Digicel SLU equipment and the equipment which had been newly ordered by CWWI was not a particularly contentious issue. Mr Thompson expressed a preference for CWWI staying with the equipment it had recently ordered. He thought that the Digicel SLU representatives were “comfortable enough” with that. Mr Thompson’s evidence was not challenged in cross-examination. Further, in a C&amp;W internal email of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, it was stated that Digicel SLU had agreed on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003 to await the arrival of the equipment newly ordered by CWWI, which was expected on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion is that Digicel SLU and CWWI, at the end of January 2003 and the beginning of February 2003, left it to CWWI to decide whether to take over the equipment which had been delivered to Digicel SLU, or to stay with the order which CWWI had placed on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.  CWWI had reasons of its own, explained by Mr Thompson, for preferring to take the equipment it had itself ordered. Digicel SLU was not on the whole concerned about that possibility because it understood that there were difficulties, created by Nortel, in carrying out the proposal to transfer the Digicel SLU equipment to CWWI. Even if, which I reject, CWWI were in breach of duty by staying with the order it had placed for its equipment, it is not possible to identify any delay caused by that decision. The equipment which had been delivered to Digicel SLU did differ from the equipment ordered, and needed, by CWWI. Some differences may have been easy to deal with. One example of that would be the cables, where different lengths of cables could be ordered, if needed, and they would probably not take an undue time to deliver. However, there was a more serious problem. As Digicel SLU was informed by Nortel, the software in the two sets of equipment was different. Mr Fisher, a witness on behalf of the Defendants, explained that C&amp;W had its own standards and requirements as regards software. If the Digicel SLU equipment had been transferred to CWWI, the software in that equipment would not fit those requirements. Something had to be done. The route suggested by Nortel to Digicel SLU and the route which Mr Fisher independently thought was appropriate was for the appropriate software to be installed in Nortel’s factory so that the equipment when delivered to the customer, CWWI, would have what the customer needed. It was suggested to Mr Fisher in cross-examination that it would have been satisfactory for CWWI to take delivery of the equipment with the inappropriate software and then install the right software, and indeed everything else that needed to be changed, on site. Mr Fisher explained why that was not appropriate. I conclude that Mr Fisher had adequate grounds for his point of view. </p>

It arrived in SLU by 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003. It is a matter of speculation whether the alternative of returning the Digicel SLU equipment to Nortel for the right software to be inserted, and other alterations made, followed by delivery to CWWI, would have been any quicker. In my judgment, it has certainly not been proven on the balance of probabilities that it would have been quicker. It is more likely that the alternative of using the Digicel SLU equipment following adaptation by Nortel would have taken longer than CWWI  staying with the order it had placed on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The remaining allegations made by the Claimants in relation to SLU concern alleged delays to the contractual negotiations as to the terms of the interconnection agreement. It will be remembered that the Claimants submitted as a matter of law that there was no obligation imposed on CWWI by section 46(1) of the 2000 Act (and possibly also no obligation under the regulations) as to contractual interconnection. However, consistently with that case, the Claimants contended that because CWWI took the stance that ordering of equipment would have to await finalisation of an interconnection agreement, the delays in the negotiations as to the terms of such an agreement did thereby cause delay to physical interconnection. In the event, I have held that section 46(1) imposes a duty in relation to both physical and contractual interconnection. The Claimants’ allegations as to delays to the contractual negotiations were fully explored at the trial and I will therefore proceed to address them on the basis that section 46(1) did impose on CWWI a duty in relation to the progress of contractual interconnection. </p>

I will set out the relevant timetable. Digicel SLU made a valid request for interconnection on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. The parties met on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. On 13th September 2002, CWWI provided a draft Joint Working Manual. This ran to 52 pages. Those 52 pages contain a considerable amount of technical data and information. However, Mr Doyle of Digicel stressed that to the technical persons involved on either side, much of this content could have been predicted so that the focus in negotiations would be upon a relatively small part only of those details. The parties met again on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. Later on that day, CWWI sent to Digicel SLU a draft of the Definitions Schedule and the Legal Framework. The Definitions Schedule ran to 10 pages. The Legal Framework ran to 25 pages. Obviously, the detail of these documents was important to the parties and, indeed, three terms in particular in the Legal Framework agreement became seriously contentious in later negotiations. On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, CWWI sent to Digicel SLU drafts of the Parameter Schedule, the Service Schedule and the Service Descriptions. The Parameter Schedule ran to 4 pages, the Service Schedule ran to 5 pages and the Service Descriptions comprised 25 pages. The facsimile letter dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002, which attached these three documents, stated that the only remaining document was the Tariff Schedule which CWWI hoped to provide “shortly”. The parties met again on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 and the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002. At the end of the day on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002, CWWI sent to Digicel SLU the draft Tariff Schedule, comprising 6 pages of detailed figures. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In their closing submissions, the Claimants submit that CWWI failed to deliver draft documentation “promptly”. They also submitted that CWWI intentionally delayed production of the Tariff Schedule for as long as possible. In support of the submission that the documents were not delivered “promptly”, the Claimants referred to some background evidence. At a meeting on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2002, CWWI had told Digicel SLU that a draft RIO was due at the end of July. This reference to a draft RIO is a reference to a draft interconnection agreement. Further, there was evidence that C&amp;W companies were assisted in preparing a draft RIO by Price Waterhouse Coopers and there was apparently a draft document of that kind in February 2002. In relation to the Tariff Schedule, the Claimants submit that it was reasonable to expect an incumbent to have prepared a tariff schedule at an early point in the lead up to liberalisation and ensuing interconnection. The Claimants point out that Mr McNaughton sent an internal email in May 2002 referring to the possibility that Digicel and another operator would begin negotiations shortly thereafter and C&amp;W should ensure that its tariffs were ready.</p>

In paragraphs 48 to 76 of his witness statement, he described the work which had gone into the preparation of the Tariff Schedule, the stage which that work had reached at various points in time and his own working on the Tariff Schedule until the last moment when it was provided to Digicel SLU. The Claimants submit that this evidence as to why CWWI took so long to provide a draft tariff schedule was “unconvincing”. </p>

I do not understand the Claimants to allege that the documents had been drafted and were available for a period before they were provided to Digicel SLU. There is no evidence to support a finding to that effect. That allegation was not put to the Defendants’ witnesses. The Claimants submit that the Defendants “intentionally” delayed production of the Tariff Schedule. It may be that in the course of making their general allegations as to deliberate delay by the Defendants, the Claimants also mean to submit that there was intentional or deliberate delay in producing the draft documents. I do not believe that any specific allegation of that kind was put to the Defendants’ witnesses including Mr Forrest. Nonetheless, the Claimants do say that these documents could have been prepared earlier and the reason why they were not prepared earlier is either because the Defendants took an unreasonably long time to get the work done or that they deliberately took a long time to do so. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue for the Court is whether CWWI broke the duty on it pursuant to section 46(1) of the 2000 Act or regulation 5 in the way in which it, and carrier services on its behalf, dealt with this matter. In answering that question, it seems to me that as a matter of law the duty in question arose for the first time on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. The duties in question are owed to another licensee. The duties are not owed to the public generally or to the Government of SLU. Accordingly, it must follow that no duty is owed prior to the time that there is an identified other licensee who requests interconnection. That must mean that CWWI cannot be said to be in breach of that duty by reason of anything it did, or failed to do, prior to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. If that is right, then I need to examine the period from 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 to 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 to see whether, during that period, CWWI did something or failed to do something which amounted to a breach of duty. Even if it were right to consider the period before 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 as well as the period after that date, the task would seem to involve findings as to the steps which were actually taken and an assessment as to whether those steps could have been taken earlier. I have evidence, in particular from Mr Forrest in relation to the Tariff Schedule, as to the steps which were taken to prepare these draft documents. </p>

The Claimants did not identify the length of the period which would have been reasonable for the preparation of these documents. In these circumstances, it does not seem to me to be possible to reach any conclusion that some other identified period was a reasonable period shorter than the actual period of time taken by the Defendants. Further, if I concentrate on the period 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 to 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002, which I consider is the right thing to do, then again I do not have any identified reasonable period shorter than the actual time taken by the Defendants to produce the draft documents. In these circumstances, I conclude that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Defendants should have produced these draft documents on dates earlier than the actual dates they were sent to Digicel SLU. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Although I have not relied on this point when reaching my conclusion, I also note the submission made by the Defendants based on section 46(3) of the 2000 Act. That subsection provides that a telecommunications provider, to whom a request for interconnection is made, must respond to the request within 4 weeks from the date of the request. In the present case, the request was dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 and the period of 4 weeks ran to 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002. In that period, CWWI provided a complete draft interconnection agreement, as described above. It may be that this submission provides a very short answer to the Claimants’ allegation, namely, that CWWI did what it had to do within the period allowed by statute. However, I have, in the event, examined what was done during the relevant period to see whether the Claimants have established that the Defendants failed to deliver documents within a reasonable time potentially shorter than 28 days and I have concluded that the Claimants have not established that allegation. </p>

It will be remembered that the terms of the agreement were only settled at the end of January 2003 and signed on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2003. I do not think that it would be possible for me to say that a week’s delay or two week’s delay in September 2002 had caused a delay in the finalisation of those negotiations by a period of one week or two weeks, or some other period. The truth is that the parties were very far apart with their proposals as to the terms of the agreement, in particular as to rates. The parties took the time which they took and, eventually, under pressure from the Government representatives and the regulator they reached a reluctant compromise at the end of January 2003. </p>

Paragraph 3.19 of schedule B1 to the Amended Particulars of Claim pleads that “the key members” of the CWWI negotiating team who were missing were Mr Batstone and Mr Fisher. In their closing submissions, the Claimants referred to the long list of absences on the CWWI side and in addition to Mr Batstone and Mr Fisher, they referred to Mr Thompson, Mr McNaughton and Mr Forrest. Because the pleaded case only referred to Mr Batstone and Mr Fisher, there is no evidence before the Court as to the whereabouts of the other individuals on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002 or as to whether it would have been possible or convenient for them to attend the meeting on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2002. As regards Mr Batstone, he was in Dominica that day. He is a lawyer and no regulatory person attended the meeting on behalf of Digicel SLU either. As to Mr Fisher, he had attended a specialist technical meeting with Digicel SLU the previous day. I reject the allegation that the absence of Mr Batstone and Mr Fisher from the meeting amounted to a breach by CWWI of the duties on it. Further, the Claimants have not established on the balance of probabilities that the absence of those two individuals from that meeting affected anything that happened later and, in particular, delayed the time when the interconnection agreement was finalised. </p>

The interview which led to the article of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 had been given prior to the meeting on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002, when the question of breaches of the agreement had been raised.

Clause 10 is in wide terms but those terms were agreed by the parties and were binding on them. It is not relevant to ask whether the information which was published was confidential or sensitive information. It is also not relevant to enquire whether Digicel SLU gave information to the newspaper before or after Mr Thompson’s warning on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002. CWWI and carrier services genuinely regarded clause 10 of the non-disclosure agreement as an important provision.

I agree that it is difficult for Digicel SLU to go behind the evidence given by witnesses on behalf of CWWI. In my judgment, it would not be right to hold that the representatives of CWWI were available earlier than they stated and that they deliberately postponed the resumption of negotiations to a date later than was necessary or appropriate.

By the end of October 2002, Digicel SLU could see that negotiations with CWWI had taken, and were likely to continue to take, a considerable time and that CWWI was insisting on certain matters which Digicel SLU felt most reluctant to agree. It was also apparent to Digicel SLU and, for that matter, to CWWI that Digicel SLU was in a hurry to make progress to conclude interconnection whereas CWWI was not concerned about the passage of time.

At the end of the meeting, the carrier services team acting for CWWI stated that Digicel SLU could not expect to hear back from CWWI on outstanding issues for three weeks. The delay was caused by the fact that there were proceedings in Jamaica brought by the Digicel subsidiary in Jamaica and the Cable and Wireless subsidiary in Jamaica was an interested party in those proceedings.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The day after the meeting of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, Digicel SLU wrote to the relevant minister in SLU, to the regulator in SLU and to the Chairman of C&amp;W plc. Digicel SLU’s letter to the Minister set out its case that CWWI was in breach of section 46 of the 2000 Act and in breach of clause 6 of its licence. Digicel SLU asked the Minister to use his statutory powers including the power to suspend or revoke CWWI’s licence. In its letter to the regulator, Digicel SLU made similar points about the conduct of the negotiations and CWWI’s position and asked the regulator to intervene. The letter to the Chairman of C&amp;W plc was written by Mr O’Brien, the chairman of Digicel (Caribbean) Limited. Mr O’Brien referred to a conversation he had with C&amp;W plc’s Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Lerwill. Mr O’Brien wrote that “Cable &amp; Wireless is blatantly attempting to delay interconnection with Digicel”. Mr O’Brien stated that Digicel intended to take whatever steps were necessary to protect its interests including submitting a formal complaint to the regulator and calling on the Minister to exercise his statutory functions and powers to commence the procedure for suspending or revoking CWWI’s licences. </p>

The note referred to CWWI seeking to negotiate interconnection terms simultaneously with approximately ten new entrants in the OECS. Mr Thompson was concerned about the question of precedent involved in agreeing terms with any one new entrant. He described the negotiations as being 80% advanced. He referred to the fact that new entrants were seeking to advance their positions by approaching the ministers in the relevant countries. He stated that CWWI would not purchase the interconnection equipment needed for its side of physical interconnection until there was an approved interconnection agreement. He noted that the benefit of this stance was that the regulator could not easily force CWWI to enter into an interim agreement and the regulator was required to deal with matters “in a more expeditious and timely manner” than otherwise. Mr Thompson also stressed a number of terms which were regarded as “important principles” for CWWI. He suggested that CWWI could not afford to compromise on these essential terms. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Although not strictly relevant to SLU, as it concerned SVG, I will briefly refer to the position in SVG at this stage. Digicel SVG had made a complaint to the regulator in SVG which was essentially the same as the complaint made by Digicel SLU to the regulator in SLU. On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, the regulator in SVG gave directions to Digicel SVG and CWWI as to the negotiations between them on the terms of an interconnection agreement. In particular, the regulator in SVG directed that negotiations on interconnection were to be completed by 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002. However, the regulator in SVG had acted prematurely. He had not given, as required by the regulations in SVG, the requisite period of time for CWWI to respond to the complaint made by Digicel SVG. CWWI sought judicial review of the regulator’s direction of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court granted CWWI leave to apply for judicial review and ordered the decision of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 to be stayed. On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, the regulator in SVG wrote to CWWI rescinding the decision in the letter of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.  The regulator stated that if CWWI had, instead of seeking judicial review, pointed out that it had not been given the requisite period of time for a response, the regulator would have varied the decision of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002. </p>

Digicel SLU wanted CWWI to identify what was agreed (to be placed in schedule A) and what was not agreed (to be placed in schedule B). Digicel SLU essentially wanted there to be an interim agreement to implement the schedule A matters, leaving the schedule B matters to be determined by the regulator, if not later agreed. CWWI, in accordance with the internal document to which I have referred, wanted to insist on certain matters which it regarded as essential. The parties did not reach any agreement at the meeting on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants point to the events of November 2002 and the lack of progress in negotiations during that month.  The Claimants say that CWWI was guilty of delay in relation to these negotiations and thereby was in breach of Section 46(1) of the 2000 Act and of regulation 5.  In my judgment, the events of November 2002 did not involve a breach by CWWI.  The 2000 Act and the regulations contemplate that the parties will negotiate with a view to reaching agreement.  If the parties cannot reach agreement then it is open to one party to refer the matter to the regulator for its determination.  CWWI put forward the terms that it wanted to achieve.  CWWI genuinely was reluctant to make concessions in respect of some terms which it regarded as essential.  It was not a breach of any duty on it for it to take that stance and to negotiate hard to achieve its position.  The events of November 2002 revealed very clearly that Digicel SLU was deeply frustrated by the lack of progress but CWWI was more concerned with getting the right set of terms, however long it took, rather than making rapid progress.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient at this point to complete the narrative of the events involving Digicel SLU’s reference to the regulator.  On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, CWWI had been notified by the regulator of this reference.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, CWWI wrote to the regulator stating that it expected it would require the full 30 day period allowed by the regulations for a response. CWWI’s response came on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2002, within the 30 day period.  The response consisted of a 2 page covering letter and a 51 page document.  Mr Batstone gave evidence that the carrier services team operating in SLU did not have all the manpower it needed to provide this response and that it sought assistance from the regulatory group at C&amp;W plc in London.  The covering letter to the response stressed the commercial confidentiality of the figures in the document.  In addition to providing a document containing all the relevant figures, CWWI provided an abridged version, for public consumption if need be, which omitted the relevant figures.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The 51 page submission made by CWWI was extremely detailed.  It is worth referring briefly to some of the matters dealt with in this submission in order to illustrate the nature of the points that divided the parties at that time.  One such point was the question of ADCs.  CWWI addressed the issue of ADCs over some 13 pages of detailed reasoning.  ADC stands for access deficit contribution.  CWWI’s position was that it should be able to pass on an access deficit contribution in the charges which it made to Digicel SLU for interconnection.  Digicel SLU was opposed to paying any such contribution.  A second matter of substance was the debate as to fixed origination rates as against mobile termination rates.  CWWI did not wish there to be a fixed origination rate but preferred a mobile termination rate.  Digicel SLU took the opposite position.  The issues of ADCs and fixed origination versus mobile termination were complex and of great financial significance to both parties.  The submission of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2002 also dealt with two clauses in the Legal Framework document.  Clause 35.1 sought to impose restrictions on both sides, as parties to the expected interconnection agreement, from making certain public announcements connected with the matters covered by the interconnection agreement.  Clause 37.1 was designed to deal with the situation where the parties had agreed an interconnection agreement which had been submitted to the regulator for approval, but where the regulator had withheld its approval to those agreed terms.  CWWI wanted both these clauses to be in the agreement and Digicel SLU was strongly opposed to both clauses.  The submission of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2002 also discussed the powers of the Minister to revoke CWWI’s licence and the various powers of the regulator.  In particular, CWWI submitted that the regulator did not have the power to impose an interim agreement, not dealing with all the matters that needed ultimately to be agreed for the purposes of an interconnection agreement.  CWWI’s stated position was that the parties should reach agreement on all issues prior to commencing interconnection.  </p>

Digicel SLU urged the regulator to act straightaway to ensure the immediate interconnection of the networks.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">It is next relevant to refer to certain matters which occurred in November 2002 as regards the provision of information on rates by CWWI to Digicel SLU.  It will be remembered that CWWI provided its tariff schedule (but not including a transit rate) at the end of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002.  There was to have been a conference call with Mr Forrest of carrier services on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 for the purpose of Mr Forrest giving further information about the rates.  That call was cancelled as earlier described.  Digicel SLU made written comments on the rates on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002.  Rates were discussed at the meeting on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 but little progress was made and Digicel SLU sought further information.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, Mr Forrest sent to Mr Thompson and Mr Batstone a draft of a presentation designed to give more information as to the cost modelling which had been used by CWWI for the purpose of producing the rates in the tariff schedule.  The presentation comprised some 8 pages or slides.  Mr Forrest wrote to Mr Thompson and Mr Batstone on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 stating that the request for further information was not unreasonable.  His 8 page presentation had been cut down to the bare minimum so that Digicel SLU would not have an undue advantage should there be legal discussions at a later stage.  Mr Forrest stated he wanted to be “seen” to be helping the discussion process.  Mr Batstone was prepared to agree with Mr Forrest’s approach.  Mr Thompson was not convinced that the explanation should be put in writing; he preferred it to be delivered orally.  On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, Mr Forrest explained his point of view.  He thought that Digicel SLU ought to be given the information.  A refusal to give that kind of information would only lead to the matter being taken to the regulator whereas Mr Forrest preferred to continue the debate.  He did not want to give any information that would cause any harm to CWWI.  Mr Thompson remained unconvinced and on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, Mr Forrest suggested there be a discussion as to the desirability of giving this information to Digicel SLU.  He wanted to be “seen” to be moving things forward particularly if CWWI ended up “limiting/spreading out the number of meetings and calls”.  Mr Forrest was cross-examined about this phrase and his evidence was that the carrier services team were limited as to the amount of time they could spend on any one carrier as they had other carriers to deal with.  Digicel SLU wanted CWWI’s carrier services team to spend much more time on the matter than the carrier services team could afford.  The slide presentation was provided to Digicel SLU at the meeting on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.  </p>

CWWI and Digicel SLU were going to be in competition as telecommunications operators.  CWWI was reluctant to give its costs information to a potential competitor.  CWWI was prepared to give the information to the regulator to convince the regulator, if need be, that its rates were an appropriate reflection of underlying costs.   Digicel SLU did object strongly to CWWI’s proposed rates.  Digicel SLU’s reluctance to agree those rates was not in any way lessened by the limited information only being provided by CWWI. </p>

The first of these complaints relates to CWWI’s statement of its position in relation to Digicel SLU’s suggestion that the terms should be divided between schedule A (terms which had been agreed) and schedule B (terms which had not been agreed).   It will be remembered that the day before the meeting of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002, the regulator in SVG had given a direction pursuant to Digicel SVG’s reference of the matter to the regulator, but without having waited for any response to the reference from CWWI. The regulator’s direction was that the parties should complete negotiations by the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  If all matters were not agreed by that date, the regulator directed that there would be an interim interconnection agreement in place on or about 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  The meeting on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 between the parties was for the purpose of discussing not only SLU, but also SVG.  A considerable time was spent at the meeting on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 discussing Digicel SLU’s suggestion of a process involving schedule A and schedule B.  CWWI would not commit to that process at the meeting.  Digicel SLU pressed CWWI to confirm its position as quickly as possible.  CWWI stated that it ought to be in a position to confirm its position by Friday of that week.  It was stated that while CWWI could make a commitment on when it would respond to Digicel SLU it did not commit that it would “respond on proposal”.  I understand the quoted words to mean that CWWI was not committing that it would accept the process suggested by Digicel SLU.  CWWI stated that it needed to explore further the direction from the regulator in SVG.  </p>

One action point was a response to the schedule A and schedule B proposal.  He circulated his list of action points by email on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.  It seems to be accepted that he wrongly stated the date when this action point was to be dealt with.  The intention was that it would be dealt with on or by 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.  Mr Batstone’s list of action points suggests that Mr Batstone and the other members of the carrier services team genuinely intended to comply with the requirements on the list.  Further, Mr McNaughton of the carrier services team responded to Mr Batstone’s list by encouraging everyone in the team to ensure that the requirements in the action points were complied with.  Mr McNaughton’s response again indicates that the carrier services team genuinely intended to comply with those requirements.  The Claimants suggest that CWWI never did intend to comply with the requirements.

Mr Batstone wrote that “as was stated at the meeting”, it was necessary to engage staff and fully consider the issues raised by Digicel SLU’s request.  Mr Batstone stated that CWWI was not yet in a position to respond.  He referred to a forthcoming conference call scheduled for 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2002 and he expressed the hope that progress could be made at that time.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The conference call duly took place on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2002.  Digicel SLU’s proposal as to the process to be adopted was raised as a topic.  CWWI stated that it was not refusing to accept the procedure but nor was it accepting it.  The background to these communications is explained by Mr Batstone’s evidence at the trial.  CWWI was in the process of taking legal advice on its response to the direction by the SVG regulator given on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002.  CWWI saw the regulator’s direction and the schedule A and schedule B procedure as driving to the same end, namely, that of an interim agreement with physical interconnection taking place before all of the terms as to interconnection were agreed.  Mr Batstone accepted when cross-examined that CWWI’s desire to take legal advice on the direction from the SVG regulator meant that it wished to keep matters open when it responded to Digicel SLU on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 and when it recorded its position at the meeting on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2002.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the communications around this time in relation to the schedule A and schedule B proposal did not involve a breach by CWWI of a duty upon it.  CWWI was not obliged to go down the route of an interim agreement. Similarly, it was not obliged to negotiate on the basis of schedule A and schedule B which it considered, rightly, was an attempt by Digicel SLU to back CWWI into an interim agreement.  In law, CWWI was entitled to negotiate on the basis that it required all the terms to be agreed before it permitted interconnection to take place.  Digicel SLU (and Digicel SVG for that matter) had whatever rights they had under the legislation and the regulations to refer any stalemate or deadlock to the regulator.  In fact, at this stage, the Digicel companies had referred the matter to the regulators.  If the Digicel companies thought that an agreed process of schedule A and schedule B would help them with the reference to the regulator, then, as stated above, CWWI was not obliged to agree that process.  If the Digicel companies thought that a refusal by CWWI to agree that process could be used by the Digicel companies as evidence of a lack of co-operation or a lack of progress on CWWI’s part, then the Digicel companies already had the fact, to which they could refer in their favour, that they had proposed a schedule A and schedule B process and there had not been a positive acceptance of it by CWWI.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel SLU also complained about the time that CWWI took to provide Digicel SLU with the tariff for the joining service in SLU.  Mr Batstone’s list of action points on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 records that this tariff was to be provided to Digicel SLU by 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  In fact, it was only provided on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  Mr Forrest explained in his witness statement (at paragraphs 97 and 105-108) the steps he took to ascertain the appropriate rate to be communicated to Digicel SLU. The Claimants put to Mr Forrest in cross-examination that there was “orchestrated inefficiency” in this respect.  Mr Forrest did not accept that suggestion.  He said that work was being undertaken and there was a person or persons on leave whose input was needed.  He had explained that matter in his witness statement.  The Claimants asked me to reject Mr Forrest’s evidence and, I assume, determine that the rate was available earlier but there was a deliberate decision not to communicate the rate to Digicel SLU, or that the rate could have been made available earlier if CWWI had taken appropriate action to ascertain it.  There is no evidence that the rate had been ascertained before the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002 and that CWWI deliberately withheld it from Digicel SLU.  As regards a reasonable time for the purpose of ascertaining such a rate, I see the strength of the Claimants’ submission that the time taken appears very lengthy for what might have been involved.  As against that, the evidence did not reveal precisely what was involved nor what would have been a reasonable period for that purpose.  In any event, I do not see how any difficulty in this regard was causative of any delay in relation to the date when the negotiations were ultimately concluded.  As earlier explained, the parties were very far apart on matters which they could reasonably regard as fundamental.  When the joining service rate was communicated to Digicel SLU, there does not appear to have been any negotiation about it and the rate which was stated on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002 was the same rate as was ultimately agreed<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span></p>

Mr Batchelor stated that all relevant CWWI personal were available on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  He enquired as to Digicel SLU’s availability for that date.  Mr Hogan replied on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002.  He referred to the procedure which Digicel SLU wished to adopt in relation to schedule A and schedule B terms.  He also referred to the direction given by the regulator in SVG.  Although the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002 ordered a stay of the direction of the regulator in SVG, it is quite possible that Mr Hogan was not aware of it when he sent his letter.  Mr Hogan stated that CWWI appeared to be trying to ensure that “negotiations” continued <span style="font-style:italic">ad infinitum</span> whereas Mr Hogan thought that meaningful negotiations could only take place in the context of an agreed process, by which he meant the process which had been proposed by Digicel SLU.  In my judgment, a fair reading of Mr Hogan’s letter was that unless CWWI agreed to the schedule A and schedule B procedure then Digicel SLU did not wish to attend a meeting on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, or any other date around that time.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In their closing submissions, the Defendants are sharply critical of the way in which Digicel SLU conducted itself during these meetings. Of course, the Defendants do not make any counterclaim or any allegation of breach by Digicel SLU in these respects. It seems to me that it is not necessary to set out the tortuous course of six days of negotiations in any detail. I will however refer to the essential matters that became agreed at those meetings. Throughout all the negotiations up to this date, Digicel SLU had set its face against paying an ADC, that is, an access deficit contribution. However, in the course of the January meetings, Digicel SLU gave way on this and agreed to pay an ADC. In order to avoid creating an unfortunate precedent for other jurisdictions, Digicel wanted the ADC, or access deficit contribution, to be re-titled an “accelerated deployment contribution”. This linked the payment, not to access deficit charges, but to the fact that CWWI was prepared to agree to order equipment before the terms of the interconnection agreement were approved by the regulator. In fact, CWWI had ordered the relevant equipment on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2003, as described earlier in this judgment. Digicel SLU also dropped its insistence on a fixed origination service and accepted CWWI’s proposal of a mobile termination service. During the January meetings, Digicel SLU, for the first time, put forward a counter-proposal as to the rates payable under an interconnection agreement. There was a lengthy dispute about whether the rates should be reciprocal that is, whether the same rate should be charged by CWWI to Digicel SLU and by Digicel SLU to CWWI. CWWI wanted a reciprocal rate. Initially, Digicel SLU did not but later compromised on a reciprocal rate. Digicel SLU was concerned to agree rates which would generate the best return for its business. There is nothing remotely surprising in that, save that the legislation and the regulations in SLU required rates to be cost based. I find that the management of Digicel SLU, as distinct from the regulatory advisors to Digicel SLU, were not concerned about whether the rates were cost based, provided that they could secure the approval of the regulator to those rates. </p>

In the preceding paragraphs, I have examined the detail of the allegations which the Claimants have made about delay on the part of CWWI. When I have examined the detail, and considered what findings of fact are permissible on the evidence I have been given, I have usually found it very difficult to say that there is specific evidence supporting a finding, on the balance of probabilities, that CWWI deliberately delayed in the relevant respect. However, having examined the detail, I think that I should stand back to try to form a reliable assessment of the overall picture. </p>

These differences between the parties were real differences on matters which both parties regarded as essential from their different standpoints. The parties remained far apart on essential matters until the very last stage, that is, until the meetings in January 2003. Both sides thought, and acted, tactically to achieve the desired outcome from their different points of view. The period of the negotiations was approaching 5 months. For nearly all of that period, both parties adopted very tough negotiating stances, the parties were far apart and neither was in any mood to compromise.</p>

A compromise only came about when Digicel SLU began to move its position and that only happened at the meetings in January 2003. </p>

Digicel SLU felt very frustrated at its inability to make progress. It resented the fact that CWWI would not talk to Digicel SLU in any detail before Digicel SLU obtained its licence. It resented the fact that CWWI would not order the equipment it needed for interconnection until the parties had agreed all the terms. It correctly saw that this stance gave CWWI a negotiating advantage. Digicel SLU tried a number of tacks to get around this difficulty. It proposed an interim agreement, but CWWI would not agree to that. It proposed the procedure using Schedule A and Schedule B to help it with its reference to the regulator. CWWI would not agree to that either. It referred the matter to the regulator but suffered a setback, first, when the court ordered a stay of the regulator’s direction in SVG and, secondly, when the regulator in SLU directed the parties to continue negotiations, with the possibility of a mediator being appointed if they failed to agree. Digicel SLU came to realise that a reference to the regulator and/or a dispute resolution process would take longer than compromising with CWWI. At that point, a compromise became more attractive even though the terms of the compromise might be worse than those that could be secured from the regulator or pursuant to a dispute resolution procedure.</p>

It was under an obligation under section 46(1) of the 2000 Act and under regulation 5 not to delay the process of interconnection and to allow interconnection to come about as soon as reasonably practicable. CWWI preferred to arrive at agreed terms by negotiation, rather than have terms imposed by a regulator. It therefore wished to avoid, if possible, the intervention of the regulator. CWWI therefore wanted the regulator to see that it was trying to make progress with the negotiations. How matters appeared was therefore important to CWWI. If the underlying reality matched the outward show, then that would be beneficial. However, CWWI probably understood that, providing the outward show was convincing, the underlying reality could be different. There was no predetermined permitted length for the negotiations. It would be difficult for Digicel SLU or the regulator to prove that CWWI was going slow and causing delay which could have been avoided. </p>

I have usually found it difficult on the basis of that evidence to make findings on the balance of probability that CWWI was guilty of delay and thereby in breach of duty. Standing back from the detail, I need to bear in mind the overall probabilities of what was happening  and the specific evidence given by Mr Francis and Ms Turner to which I have earlier referred. Those probabilities and that evidence, if it is accurate, suggests that CWWI deliberately acted more slowly than it could have done and used various tactics to slow down the pace of the negotiations. In particular, there is reason to believe that CWWI attempted to limit the number of meetings with Digicel SLU and spread out the intervals between those meetings. Taking the matter overall, I think it is probable that CWWI deliberately, and unnecessarily, allowed time to go by when no progress was made. It is much harder to identify the specific occasions on which that occurred and harder still to say what period of time might have been allowed to slip by in that way. </p>

This is because I believe that I can make firm findings in relation to the consequences of any default of this kind on the part of CWWI. The evidence does not show that any delay in a particular respect caused delay to the overall outcome of the negotiations. The negotiations did not really move forward until Digicel SLU was prepared to change its position in January 2003. What caused it to change its position in January 2003 was that a period of more than 4 months had gone by, and it still had not settled the terms of the interconnection agreement, and it was facing the prospect of further delay while any matters not agreed were submitted to the regulator for its decision. Digicel SLU was only prepared to end the stand off in the negotiations when it felt the negotiations had gone on for too long and it was better to compromise rather than to continue to resist.  In my judgment, the detail of the meetings which preceded that stage, the number of those meetings, the persons who attended and the subjects discussed did not in the end affect the time at which Digicel SLU reached the point I have described, when it was prepared to move its position, leading to the ultimate agreement between the parties. Accordingly, if Digicel SLU had been able to show that CWWI had acted in breach of the duties on it, Digicel SLU has failed to show that any such breach delayed the time when contractual interconnection was completed.</p>

I think that on the evidence I have about delivery periods for the relevant equipment, it would have been possible for me to select a likely period for the delivery of the equipment. It would then become necessary to consider whether Digicel SLU has pleaded that CWWI was under an obligation to install and test that equipment and whether CWWI was under such an obligation. If I had held that CWWI was under an obligation to install and test the equipment, again on the evidence it would have been possible for me to select a likely period for this work. The position would probably be the same in relation to the civil works needed to connect the two networks. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, the completion of physical interconnection would not have allowed Digicel SLU to launch its network. Contractual interconnection had to be provided for. I have already held (against the background that CWWI was not obliged to, and did not, pre-order equipment) that it is not possible to hold that the parties would have agreed the terms for contractual interconnection earlier than was actually the case. Digicel SLU submits that if the equipment had been ordered by CWWI and delivered to SLU, then CWWI would have come under pressure from government ministers and/or the regulator to arrange for installation and testing of that equipment (even if CWWI was not obliged to install and test before an interconnection agreement was made) and would have come under further pressure from the same sources to permit Digicel SLU to launch on the basis of an interim agreement or even to agree terms with Digicel SLU more quickly than in fact happened. I can see that the existence of such pressure is a possibility but I regard the extent of such possible pressure, and the effect of it, as essentially speculative. There is a real possibility that the matter would have been referred to the regulator and a considerable time would have gone by before the regulator gave its decision on the questions of ADCs, fixed origination service and the appropriate rates.</p>

The launch actually took place on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003. The burden of proving that a launch would have taken place earlier is on Digicel SLU.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to attempt an answer to this question it would be necessary to examine in detail the steps which Digicel SLU took over many months to get itself ready to launch its network. It would be necessary to examine the decisions made by Digicel SLU to see if they were influenced by the rate of progress or lack of it in relation to interconnection. It would be necessary to identify which parts of that lack of progress amounted to a breach of duty by CWWI and to try to assess whether any such breaches caused Digicel SLU to alter its approach to its launch. It would be necessary to examine all of the many steps which had to be taken by Digicel SLU and by others to prepare for its launch. It is clear that not all of the matters which needed attention were under Digicel SLU’s direct control. In relation to the actions of third parties, it would be necessary to assess the prospects, or the chance, that the third party would have acted differently. </p>

For the reasons which I set out in my main judgment when I deal with the question of damages, I conclude that it would be disproportionate to spend time examining the question of a delay to Digicel SLU’s launch. I will add some brief comments at this point on my reasons for this conclusion.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The first comment is that before attempting this hypothetical exercise one needs to know what CWWI should have done differently. I have made my actual findings on that question and, on that basis, the question of delay to Digicel SLU’s launch date does not arise. I would therefore have to construct a hypothetical basis of some breach or breaches by CWWI causing some delay in the interconnection process. The difficulty is that there is more than one possible hypothesis that might be taken and the answer to the question as to delay to Digicel SLU’s launch date might vary with the hypothesis adopted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The second comment is that on my findings as to the law and as to the facts, there are multiple reasons rather than a single reason why an answer to the question as to Digicel SLU’s launch date is not relevant. An appellate court would have to reverse my decisions on the law and on the facts in many cumulative ways before an answer to the question would become relevant.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The third comment is that in order to consider the submissions which Digicel SLU made in closing  on this question, it would be necessary to consider a large number of documents which had not been examined at any earlier stage of the trial and which were not put to any witness by any party. Whilst I do not consider that this prevents Digicel SLU from putting forward its claim, nonetheless, this factor greatly increases the burden involved in carrying out the exercise and this consideration is relevant to the issue of the proportionality of examining this question.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Telecommunications Act 2001 was in force at all material times. The copy of the Act which was provided to me appeared somewhat irregular. The parties have checked with the authorities in SVG but have been told that the copy provided to me is in the form in which the Act is available and no better print of the Act exists. The first five pages set out a list of the sections of the Act but the following pages of the Act do not appear to be the provisions of the Act as enacted but appear to be the provisions of the Bill, pre-enactment. Thus clause 1 of the Bill states that the Act was to be cited as the Telecommunications Act 2000 whereas the Act as printed states that it is Act No. 1 of 2001. The Bill also appears to contain some typographical errors in that the section (or clause) which was intended to be section 45 is numbered section 47 and what was intended to be Part V of the Act has been numbered Part IV. The drafting of the SVG Bill was obviously based upon the SLU Act but the clauses were renumbered and rearranged and this has led to what look like mistakes. For example, section 44(1) states that it is subject to subsection (4) whereas I suspect that it was intended that it would be subject to subsection (2)(d). In setting out the provisions of the Act in this Annex, I have changed the number of the wrongly numbered section that it is section 45 and I have numbered Part V correctly. Otherwise, I have set out the provisions of the Act as printed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to the inclusion of clause 10.2 in the legal framework agreements was that the mobile termination rate payable by CWWI to the Digicel company was EC55 cents whereas the rate payable by a US based carrier for an international call delivered to CWWI was a lower figure. At the relevant time, the US Federal Communications Commission’s Benchmarks Order of 2001 provided that US based carriers should not pay a rate for international calls to SLU or SVG in excess of US19 cents (equivalent to EC51 cents). In fact, the average settlement rate which CWWI had earlier agreed with US carriers was lower than the benchmark at US14 cents (EC37.6 cents). Thus, for an international call carried by a US carrier delivered to CWWI in SLU or SVG and then transmitted on to the Digicel company, CWWI would receive EC37.6 cents and pay to the Digicel company EC55 cents. In this way, each of these calls transmitted by CWWI for the ultimate benefit of the Digicel company would involve CWWI in a significant loss. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">CWWI considered that there were two possible ways to deal with this situation in SLU and SVG. The first was for CWWI to attempt to persuade some international carriers to pay higher rates to CWWI so as to enable CWWI to make a profit, or at least break even. There was some basis for thinking that this could be achieved but for various reasons, which I need not describe, it turned out to be difficult and in the end was not achieved. The alternative was to adjust the level of mobile termination rate paid by CWWI to the Digicel company so that this rate was below the sum received by CWWI from the international carrier. Clause 10.2 was an attempt to provide for a possible revision of the mobile termination rate in this respect. </p>

The question later arose as to whether clause 10.2 was “an agreement to agree” and therefore of no contractual effect. It is not necessary for me to resolve that question of law. The Claimants submitted that clause 10.2 only contemplated re-negotiation in the event of a change in international settlement rates and they point out that there was no change in those rates between 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2003 and the matter receiving attention in and after March 2003. Again, it is not necessary for me to determine whether the Claimants are right in their submission. </p>

I think it is likely that in that period CWWI did begin to take steps to re-negotiate the rate which CWWI had to pay to certain international carriers. That possibility was discussed in an internal C&amp;W email from Mr McNaughton on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003.

Mr McNaughton also gave oral evidence to this effect and I accept that evidence.

In my judgment, these allegations and counter-allegations are in the end not material to the issues I have to decide. I do not detect anything sinister in the fact that CWWI did not pursue the question of re-negotiation in accordance with clause 10.2 of the interconnection agreement until a late stage when the Digicel company was on the brink of launching its service. I think it is the case that CWWI did commit a breach of the interconnection agreements, or ran a very serious risk of committing a breach of the interconnection agreements, by blocking incoming international calls. However, the rights and wrongs of that matter were subsequently settled and are not for determination in this present litigation. </p>

This was followed by communications between the parties on the subject of a possible compromise of the difficulty in relation to the rates for international incoming calls. CWWI’s perception was that the Digicel companies were not seriously engaging in a process of negotiation but were going through the motions on the basis that they were content to rely on the fact that the existing rates were favourable to the Digicel companies and CWWI was, pursuant to the court order of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2003, passing international traffic to Digicel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">At the trial, the parties made submissions as to whether a service of transmitting incoming international calls to Digicel Grenada was or was not an interconnection service, which C&amp;W Grenada was obliged to provide under section 45 of the Telecommunications Act 2000. In my judgment, it is not necessary to reach any conclusion on that matter. At the time of this request for interconnection, the Digicel companies and, in particular, Digicel Grenada were asserting that the service of transmitting incoming international calls was part of an interconnection service. Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG had positively asserted that fact when seeking interim injunctions in the proceedings they brought against CWWI in April 2003. As indicated above, when Digicel Grenada requested interconnection with C&amp;W Grenada on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003, the request for interconnection specifically included a request for a service of transmitting incoming international calls as part of an interconnection service. C&amp;W Grenada proceeded on the basis that Digicel Grenada was entitled to seek such a service as part of an interconnection service. It seems to me to be nothing to the point that certain individuals within the C&amp;W carrier services team either took the view that an incoming international call service was not part of an interconnection service or that there was some doubt about that question. C&amp;W Grenada were entitled to proceed on the basis that Digicel Grenada were right on the question of incoming international calls being part of an interconnection service. That meant that C&amp;W Grenada and Digicel Grenada had to negotiate and eventually agree a rate for incoming international calls. That subject, of course, was the identical subject outstanding in relation to SLU and SVG pursuant to clause 10.2 of the interconnection agreements in those countries and pursuant to the undertaking given by Digicel SLU in the SLU High Court proceedings. It seems inevitable that the three Digicel companies and CWWI and C&amp;W Grenada would wish to discuss that single subject at the same time for all three countries. I do not see how a discussion of that topic, applicable to all three countries, would be any different as regards content or duration as compared with a discussion of that topic in relation to Grenada alone. That is to say, for so long as Digicel Grenada was requesting an interconnection service in respect of incoming international calls in Grenada, a negotiation on the appropriate rate for that service would not be delayed or lengthened by reason of the fact that the same discussion was<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>taking place with Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG, through the same human agency, at the same time. </p>

These are put forward by the Claimants as examples of a lack of co-operation by C&amp;W Grenada. They are not pleaded as breaches by C&amp;W Grenada of any duty owed to Digicel Grenada. The matters to which I refer are the Claimants’ complaints about a lack of<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>co-operation in identifying the location of a footway box, part of the joining service between the two<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>networks<span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>a refusal to provide a quotation for running fibre to Digicel’s interconnection equipment, a lack of cooperation in relation to a site survey and the provision of a numbering plan for Grenada.

More precise findings on these matters are probably not necessary. Even in the absence of these matters of complaint being relied upon by the Claimants, I would in any event have made the finding that C&amp;W Grenada was not prepared to volunteer to help Digicel Grenada in relation to matters where it owed no obligation to take any action to assist Digicel Grenada. Further, I accept the Defendants’ submission that there was nothing unlawful, and indeed nothing very surprising, in C&amp;W Grenada taking the stance that it would not do things, which it was not legally obliged to do, for the purpose of improving its negotiating position in relation to matters which had to be negotiated between the parties as part of the process of interconnection. </p>

Section 45 continues by referring to other steps which are to be taken by means of requests “in writing”: see section 45(3) and (5). The Defendants say that a request for the purpose of section 45(2) must be in writing so that a purported oral request will be of no effect for the purpose of section 45(2). The Claimants appear to accept this basic submission. They did not submit that the reference to writing in section 45(2) was directory rather than mandatory, so that an oral request would suffice. What divided the parties was the question as to what formality, if any, was required for amendments or revisions to be made to a request for interconnection in circumstances where the original request for interconnection had been in writing, in compliance with section 45(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties debated various issues as to the operation of section 45(2). For example, the Defendants submitted that it was not possible for there to be two requests in operation at any one time. The Defendants also submitted that it was not possible to amend in any way the original request. It may be that the Defendants would accept that a telecommunications provider who had made a written request could formally withdraw that request and make a second written request which would then be the relevant operating request. However, the Defendants do insist that it is not possible for a telecommunications provider, having made a valid written request, to indicate in the course of negotiations that it no longer wishes to have a part of the service initially requested, resulting in the statute taking effect as if the original request had been reduced in scope. The Claimants submit, to the contrary, that it is perfectly open to a telecommunications provider to reduce the scope of its request. The Claimants make that submission so that if the scope of the request is reduced in that way, the party in receipt of the request is no longer bound to negotiate the part of the service that has been removed from the request and, equally, no longer entitled to take time in negotiating the terms of the service which has been removed from the request. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, if a telecommunications provider makes a written request which complies with section 45(2) of the Act, it is open to that provider, with the agreement of the other party, to reduce the scope of the services requested. If the provider who has made the request does not obtain the agreement of the other party, a statement of a wish to reduce the scope of the request will have some consequences. For example, if the requesting provider states that it no longer wishes to have a particular service, that provider could hardly complain of a breach of duty by the other party if that other party declines to negotiate or provide that matter. However, if the requesting provider has initially requested a particular service and the other party wishes to negotiate and agree terms as to the provision of that service, it is not open to the requesting provider unilaterally to prevent the other party so negotiating, unless the requesting provider withdraws the initial request and replaces it with a second request which complies with section 45(2). </p>

It follows in my judgment that C&amp;W Grenada were entitled at all times after 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003, and in particular after 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003, to proceed on the basis that it was entitled to negotiate with Digicel Grenada the rates for the provision of incoming international calls to Grenada and the time reasonably taken up by those negotiations was properly to be considered as time spent dealing with the request made on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003. </p>

There are difficulties in making clear findings on this point because the negotiations between the parties in relation to Grenada were taking place alongside, and in some respects indistinguishably from, negotiations which are admitted to have been without prejudice, where the court has not been given evidence as to the course of those without prejudice negotiations. It will be remembered that on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2003, the Digicel companies in SLU and SVG agreed to negotiate the rates for incoming international calls to SLU and SVG. There were complaints from CWWI in late April 2003 to the effect that the Digicel companies in SLU and SVG were not complying with that undertaking. Although this was not initially accepted by the Claimants, it was accepted in closing submissions that without prejudice negotiations on that matter began in April/May 2003. The parties to those negotiations included, at least, CWWI (dealing with SLU and SVG) and Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG. It seems to have been common ground in closing submissions that, at least for some of the time, there were further parties to those without prejudice negotiations, namely, C&amp;W Grenada and Digicel Grenada, both of whom were concerned with the amount of the rate for incoming international calls to Grenada. </p>

There was a dispute between the parties as to whether the relevant part of the email was without prejudice and therefore inadmissible. What one gets from the email is that the solicitors acting for Digicel had contended that clause 10.2 of the legal framework agreements in SLU and SVG was unenforceable as an “agreement to agree” but, without prejudice to that contention, the Digicel companies were prepared to discuss the rate for incoming international calls. It does not seem to me to matter whether this document is admissible in evidence. Other evidence which is agreed to be admissible establishes the same two points and the email of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003 does not add anything else material. </p>

The subject is dealt with in a witness statement of Mr Connor of Digicel. In paragraphs 57 to 60 of that witness statement, Mr Connor describes the fact that C&amp;W Grenada was not prepared to order the equipment it needed for its side of the interconnection until the parties had obtained the approval of the regulator to a settled interconnection agreement. As I interpret paragraph 60 of Mr Connor’s statement, he gave evidence that Digicel Grenada was prepared to sign an interconnection agreement with C&amp;W Grenada on terms that did not include an incoming international calls service to Grenada. Mr Connor on behalf of Digicel Grenada felt that the question of the rate for incoming international calls to Grenada could be negotiated with C&amp;W Grenada after the launch of Digicel’s network. He thought that this would take from C&amp;W Grenada the ability to delay negotiations on the interconnection agreement in Grenada by reason of the time needed to agree the rate for incoming international calls. </p>

He does not identify when and in what terms this suggestion was made. Paragraph 65 refers to the possibility of the parties agreeing an interconnection agreement without a rate for incoming international calls, leaving that issue to be negotiated separately. Mr Connor does not appear to be suggesting that Digicel Grenada had stated that it did not require an incoming international call service; rather, its suggestion was that it did require that service but that the negotiations on that service should be split from the negotiations on any other matter relating to the interconnection agreement. </p>

One paragraph in the email deals with the negotiations as to the rates for incoming international calls although much of the paragraph is redacted on the grounds that the discussion was without prejudice. Another paragraph in the email deals with the negotiations as to the interconnection agreement in Grenada and this paragraph is not redacted. The text dealing with the negotiations as to the interconnection agreement in Grenada refers to Digicel Grenada’s concern that C&amp;W Grenada was not prepared to order equipment in advance of there being an approved interconnection agreement. The principal, if not the only, thing delaying negotiations on the interconnection agreement was the rate for incoming international calls to Grenada. Mr Batchelor records that someone on behalf of Digicel Grenada had made the suggestion that the parties should sign an interconnection agreement without any provision in it dealing with incoming international calls so that the terms as to such calls could be negotiated after interconnection went live. As described in the email, this suggestion from Digicel Grenada was not a suggestion that Digicel Grenada did not wish there to be a service from C&amp;W Grenada in respect of incoming international calls but rather that the negotiations should be split in two. The first part of the negotiations, it was suggested, could lead to a concluded interconnection agreement not dealing with incoming international calls and the second part of the negotiations would then be confined to the rate for incoming international calls.</p>

That finding is consistent with the way matters were described in paragraph 65 of Mr Connor’s witness statement.

The letter proceeded on the basis that the request of 22nd May 2003 was the relevant operating request.  The letter also referred to the discussions in Miami between CWWI and Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG and proceeded on the basis that those discussions and any agreement which resulted were effective as between C&amp;W Grenada and Digicel Grenada.  The letter suggested that the agreement had been broken because C&amp;W Grenada had not been prepared to enter into an interconnection agreement in the same terms as those which had been agreed in SLU and SVG.  It will be remembered that the agreements in SLU and SVG provided for an incoming international calls service to be provided as part of the interconnection service.  The letter threatened court proceedings to enforce the obligations on C&amp;W Grenada.  I interpret the letter, read as a whole, as stating that the relevant request was the written request of 22nd May 2003 and that C&amp;W Grenada was obliged to provide an interconnection service which included an incoming international calls service.  </p>

The first paragraph refers to the possibility that unless matters changed on the ensuing day the result would be that the parties were unable to agree the rate for incoming international calls.  The consequence of that, it was stated, would be that Digicel Grenada would seek to proceed with the interconnection agreement for Grenada without an incoming international call service.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;text-indent:0.5in">The result of the above reasoning is as follows.  First, whilst it would have been open to Digicel Grenada to have withdrawn the request of 22nd May 2003 and replaced it with a written request for interconnection on terms which did not include an incoming international calls service, Digicel Grenada never did serve a revised request in writing and the request of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003 remained the relevant request which C&amp;W Grenada was obliged to, and entitled to, deal with.  Further, having considered the detailed communications between the parties, I do not accept the suggestion made by the Claimants that on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003, the Claimants orally said enough to amount to a withdrawal of the written request of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003 and the replacement of it with an oral request for interconnection not including the service of incoming international calls.  In my judgment, what was suggested orally on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003 was that the parties should negotiate in relation to the request of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003 by two stages, the first leading to an interconnection agreement not dealing with incoming international calls and the second part of the negotiation dealing with incoming internal calls.

Digicel Grenada requested interconnection on 22nd May 2003 and C&amp;W Grenada sent it a draft interconnection agreement on 30th June 2003.  Following Digicel Grenada’s request on 22nd May 2003, the CWWI carrier services team wrote on 26th May 2003 to Digicel Grenada stating that a draft agreement would be sent “shortly”.  The letter went on to describe the changes which needed to be made to the form of agreement used in SLU and SVG.  One change was needed to address the issue of incoming international calls.  The drafting of the agreement was done by Mr Batstone of CWWI. He went on annual leave from 25th May 2003 to 15th June 2003.  Before he left he did substantial work on preparing a first draft of the interconnection agreement.  When cross-examined he was uncertain what further work was outstanding but he thought it was probably the drafting of terms dealing with incoming international calls.  On 2nd June 2003, there is an internal CWWI email pressing for the draft agreement to be available at an early point as it was felt that the early delivery of the draft agreement would assist with the negotiations on rates for incoming international calls in SLU and SVG, something which CWWI wished to settle.  </p>

His witness statement identified the various commitments in question.  Against that background, he attempted to finalise a draft interconnection agreement for Grenada.  There was a major issue between the parties as to the incoming international calls service and the appropriate rate for the service.  Mr Batstone completed his draft on 30th June 2003 and it was sent on the same day to Digicel Grenada.  </p>

They point to a large number of matters before Digicel Grenada obtained its licence on 22nd May 2003 which, the Claimants contend, should have produced the result that C&amp;W Grenada were ready with a draft agreement in May 2003.  In my judgment, some of these points are unrealistic given the real uncertainty as to whether Digicel Grenada would obtain a licence.  I have earlier referred to the fact that it was far from being a foregone conclusion that Digicel Grenada would have obtained such a licence.  In any event, C&amp;W Grenada was not under a statutory duty to Digicel Grenada under section 45 of the 2000 Act, or otherwise, to take any action in this respect until 22nd May 2003.  </p>

As regards Mr Batstone personally, it would probably not be right to conclude that he had acted in an unreasonable way.  He was no doubt entitled to take a lengthy period of leave in May and June 2003 and he was busy on his return to work in mid-June 2003.  It might be said that the drafting of the agreement for Grenada could have been handled by someone other than Mr Batstone.  Although Mr Batstone wanted to see what progress had been made in negotiating a rate for incoming international calls and when he found that the rate was not agreed he wished to be careful as to his drafting on that topic, it could be said that it would have been possible for someone else at C&amp;W to produce a draft agreement for Grenada which simply identified a figure representing C&amp;W’s proposal as to the relevant rate, or to draft in a more general way.  </p>

However, I do not see that it was of prime importance for Digicel Grenada to receive a draft interconnection agreement at an early point.  The principal, if not the only, matter outstanding as regards the interconnection agreement in Grenada was the question of the rate for incoming international calls.  Until that matter was settled, the delivery of a draft agreement dealing with other matters which were to follow the form of agreement in SLU and SVG was of secondary importance.  When the rate for incoming international calls was eventually agreed, the other matters took no time to settle.  In these circumstances, I conclude, that C&amp;W Grenada were not at fault in failing to provide a draft agreement before the 30th June 2003 and, in any event, any such fault did not delay interconnection and, therefore, was not a breach of duty.</p>

The negotiations which related to the rate which would be applicable in SLU and SVG were without prejudice. At some point, the without prejudice negotiations included the rate which would be payable in Grenada also. Because the negotiations were without prejudice, I have no real evidence about when the without prejudice negotiations extended to the rate payable in Grenada. The Claimants say that this happened on and after 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2003. The Defendants would say that the without prejudice negotiations about the rate for incoming international calls extended to Grenada from an earlier point in time.

The primary matter outstanding at that point did not relate to Grenada but related to SLU and SVG. That outstanding point was of concern to the parties in SLU and SVG who were different from the relevant parties in Grenada.

What remained outstanding was a question as to when the new rate for incoming international calls would apply in SLU and SVG. CWWI wanted the new rate to apply with effect from the date of the launch by the Digicel company in SLU and SVG (24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003). Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG were not prepared to agree to back date the new rate. They were also not prepared, initially at any rate, to agree that the new rate in SLU and SVG should apply from the date of the new agreement. Instead, they wanted the new rate in SLU and SVG to apply from the date of completion of interconnection in Grenada. Thus, Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG were seeking to link the negotiations in SLU and SVG and the negotiations in Grenada so as to provide an incentive to C&amp;W Grenada to achieve physical interconnection sooner rather than later in Grenada. </p>

CWWI and Digicel SLU and Digicel SVG were necessary parties because this agreement of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 varied the interconnection agreements those parties had made in SLU and SVG respectively. C&amp;W Grenada and Digicel Grenada were necessary parties to this agreement because the agreement contained terms relevant to interconnection in Grenada. By clause 3 of this agreement, C&amp;W Grenada agreed to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Activation Date would occur on or before 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. Activation Date was the date by which all of the tests to be carried out on the interconnection in Grenada had been successfully completed and the interconnection in Grenada was capable of carrying live commercial traffic. There was a link between this obligation as to interconnection in Grenada and the rate payable for incoming international calls in SLU and SVG. Clause 3 of the agreement spelled out the effect on the rates payable in SLU and SVG if the Activation Date in Grenada was after 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 or, conversely, before 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. </p>

However, I can see that it is arguable that C&amp;W Grenada committed a breach of duty at the stage when the parties were capable of agreeing the rate for incoming international calls in Grenada and, indeed all the terms of an interconnection agreement in Grenada, and C&amp;W Grenada failed to enter into an interconnection agreement in Grenada; at that stage the parties were continuing to discuss a topic which only applied in SLU and SVG, namely, the date when the new rate for incoming international calls would apply in SLU and SVG. I am not positively finding that C&amp;W Grenada was in breach in this way as there is a counter argument to the effect that Digicel Grenada also wanted a linkage between interconnection in Grenada and the other matters at that stage. </p>

In my judgment, particularly in view of my finding that the only arguable case of breach of statutory duty, arising from a linkage of the negotiations, applies to a period from around 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2003 onwards, it is not necessary to examine these elaborate arguments in greater detail. </p>

The Claimants accepted that from the date on which the agreement, referred to in recital (E), was made, the linkage in the negotiations was not a breach of statutory duty. The parties did not agree on the date which I should find to be the relevant date for the purposes of recital (E). The Defendants contended that the date was the date of the negotiations concerning SLU and SVG which took place in Miami in January 2003. The Claimants contended that the date was 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2003 when (they said) there began without prejudice negotiations which involved a link between interconnection in Grenada and the rate for incoming international calls in SLU and SVG.

It is right that Digicel Grenada wanted C&amp;W Grenada to order this equipment before the parties had reached agreement on the terms of an interconnection agreement and before those terms were approved by the regulator. The stance taken by C&amp;W Grenada was in accordance with the stance taken by the C&amp;W companies generally, which was not to order equipment until the terms of an interconnection agreement were settled and approved by the regulator. In the event, the parties had reached substantial agreement on the terms of an interconnection agreement for Grenada by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2003 and on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2003, C&amp;W Grenada ordered the equipment it needed.

In my judgment, for the reasons which I have given in much greater detail in relation to SLU, C&amp;W Grenada was entitled to postpone the ordering of its equipment for the purpose of assisting it in its negotiations with Digicel Grenada as to the terms of the interconnection agreement and, accordingly, C&amp;W Grenada was not in breach of any duty it owed to Digicel Grenada in this respect.</p>

In their closing submissions, the Claimants did not make any complaints about the pace of physical interconnection, apart from the allegation concerning the ordering of equipment, with which I have already dealt. The Claimants had pleaded two other matters in relation to physical interconnection but those matters were not repeated in their closing submissions. The first was an alleged failure by C&amp;W Grenada to use a second hand MUX and the second related to the way in which a test of the installation was interrupted because of a defective cable. The Defendants’ submissions dealt with these two matters in detail and put forward several reasons why the allegations could not be sustained. In these circumstances, I will not deal with the detail of the allegations but I will record that I do not make a finding of breach by C&amp;W Grenada in these two respects.</p>

I have held that if the draft interconnection agreement had been provided earlier, this would not have changed the date when the interconnection agreement in Grenada was ultimately finalised.

I could, for example, discuss what would have happened if C&amp;W Grenada’s equipment had been ordered earlier; when would it have been delivered; when would it have been installed and tested and when would Digicel Grenada’s side of physical interconnection been ready. I could also consider whether any steps taken to advance physical interconnection would have had any impact upon the date when contractual interconnection was finalised. Finally, if interconnection had been completed prior to 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, there is the question whether Digicel Grenada would have been ready to launch its network before 17th October 2003 and, if so, when.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants say that the Government of Barbados was keen to see interconnection with C&amp;W Barbados and the entry into the market of new licensed operators to compete with the incumbent C&amp;W Barbados.  The Defendants make similar submissions as to the political background to the interconnection process in Barbados.  I find that the government was directly involved with the matter in Barbados from an early stage.  The government’s chief technical officer, Mr Chelston Bourne, was involved from an early stage, initially in drafting legislation and issuing licences, and then in convening meetings and writing to the parties.  The Deputy Prime Minister and Attorney General, Ms Mia Mottley QC, as well as other ministers on a governmental sub-committee for telecommunications, became personally involved.  Digicel Barbados saw the opportunity to turn this level of Government interest to its advantage.  Digicel Barbados sought to apply political pressure on C&amp;W Barbados.  Digicel Barbados would say that it was applying pressure to ensure that C&amp;W Barbados performed its legal obligations.  C&amp;W Barbados says that Digicel Barbados was applying political pressure to make C&amp;W Barbados go beyond its legal obligation.  In the event, C&amp;W Barbados says that it dealt with certain matters at a time when it was not obliged to deal with those matters.  An example of such a matter is the ordering of the equipment needed by C&amp;W Barbados before the parties had finalised the terms of an interconnection agreement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The organisation of certain matters in relation to CWWI and the C&amp;W Barbados business unit was not the same as in the OECS countries to which I have referred, namely, SLU, SVG and Grenada.  In the OECS, as has been seen, the interconnection process was conducted by the carrier services team, headed by Mr Thompson.  Mr Thompson reported directly to Mr Errald Miller, the Caribbean CEO and not to the general managers of the business units in SLU, SVG and Grenada.  However, matters were re-organised in the Caribbean in mid to late 2003.  This followed the appointment of Mr Loosemore as Chief Operating Officer of C&amp;W plc.  The head of the Barbados business unit at that time was Mr Austin and following re-organisation, Mr Austin reported directly to Mr Loosemore.  Mr Loosemore wanted Mr Austin to be accountable for matters relating to Barbados, including interconnection. Thus, it was Mr Austin who was to instruct Mr Thompson of the carrier services team as to the action to be taken in relation to interconnection.  Because of this and because the Barbados business unit was close to the political situation in Barbados, the carrier services team were at a somewhat greater remove.  On the other hand, the work of drafting documentation for interconnection and conducting negotiations with Digicel Barbados was still done first hand by the carrier services team. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Barbados had a distinct system of charging for retail calls.  At the relevant time in the OECS, the OECS countries operated a system known as CPP, that is, calling party pays.  Under this system, the person who makes the call pays for it.  The person who receives the call does not pay for it.  The system in Barbados at the relevant time was called RPP or receiving party pays.  As explained at the trial, this description is not wholly accurate and a more accurate description would be mobile party pays, or MPP.  Under this system, telecommunications operators had the right to charge mobile customers both for making and for receiving calls.  As fixed lines were not metered, customers using fixed lines did not pay to make domestic calls or to receive domestic calls.  This had significant implications for interconnection charges between telecommunications providers.  In the OECS, where there was a fixed to mobile call, the fixed line network obtained retail revenue from such calls.  In turn, the fixed network paid a substantial termination rate to the recipient mobile network for terminating the call.  This arrangement would not work in Barbados because there the fixed network did not charge fixed line customers for making the call.  There was therefore no income stream from which the fixed line network could pay a termination rate to the recipient mobile network.  The position was more complex still as regards mobile to mobile calls.  As early as 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, C&amp;W Barbados was permitted by the government to set the charge, for C&amp;W mobile customers to receive calls from other C&amp;W mobile customers, at zero.  So from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2003 onwards, C&amp;W Barbados did not charge its customers for receiving mobile to mobile calls from C&amp;W Barbados customers.  These were described as on-net mobile to mobile calls, that is, they were calls made within the same mobile network.  By August 2003, the position as regards C&amp;W’s retail charges was as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">By August 2003, it was far from clear whether the various operators providing mobile telecommunications services in a liberalised market would charge customers for receiving off-net calls, that is, calls from customers on a different mobile network.  C&amp;W Barbados considered that the right of mobile telecommunications operators to charge their own customers for receiving calls undermined the justification for the payment of a mobile termination rate from mobile to mobile calls.  Further, the fact that mobile operators could charge their customers for receiving calls from fixed line customers, whereas C&amp;W Barbados’ fixed network had no right to charge its fixed line customers who had made the call, could be said to make it appropriate for mobile operators to pay an origination fee to C&amp;W Barbados’ fixed network to cover the cost of originating that call.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There was considerable debate at the trial as to whether there was uncertainty in Barbados in the middle of 2003 as to the precise requirements of the regulations to be made by the government.  I find that the position is as follows.  It was not until 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 that C&amp;W Barbados obtained its new non-exclusive licence replacing its pre-existing monopoly licence.  It was not until 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 that potential new entrants into the market obtained licences.  The government published its interconnection policy (which was later referred to in the regulations made in Barbados) on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2003.  The Fair Trading Commission was in the process of consulting on its interconnection guidelines on accounting, costs and pricing principles and its interconnection dispute resolution procedures.  These were published on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003 and were challenged unsuccessfully by C&amp;W Barbados.  The Telecommunications (Interconnection) Regulations 2003 were published on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2003.  These regulations had been made available earlier in draft form and both Digicel Barbados and C&amp;W Barbados had requested amendments to the draft regulations.  At one time, it appeared that the amendment requested by C&amp;W Barbados, which would have made it explicit that a person requesting interconnection had to have a licence at the time of the request, was going to be accepted, but in the event the final form of regulation 7 of the regulations did not so provide. </p>

The letter of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003 stated that Digicel Barbados had been awarded a mobile telecommunications licence by the government of Barbados on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2003.

This email is revealing as to Mr Thompson’s thoughts on the question of ordering equipment before the entry into and/or approval of an interconnection agreement.  Indeed, Mr Thompson’s analysis was not applicable to Barbados only.  His analysis in this email is entirely consistent with what I have found was the approach adopted by the CWWI carrier services team in SLU and SVG.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Thompson’s analysis in his email is closely reasoned.  I will not set out the full text of the email but will attempt to summarise the main points.  He began by explaining his rationale for making equipment ordering conditional upon regulatory approval.  He thought it would be “difficult” for new entrants or regulators to force C&amp;W legally to purchase equipment in advance of an interconnection agreement.  Carrier services wished to maximise its negotiating leverage during the interconnection negotiations and equipment ordering was one of the few areas where carrier services could influence the negotiations, if new entrants failed to negotiate in a way that suited C&amp;W, on issues which were important to C&amp;W such as ADCs and mobile termination rates.  The use of “delay” in ordering equipment gave to the carrier services team an ability to secure more swift and favourable terms.  New entrants, including Digicel, understood the fact that not ordering equipment gave to the C&amp;W carrier services team a negotiating advantage and the response of new entrants was intense political lobbying.  Mr Thompson pointed out that new entrants wanted equipment ordered but they also wanted the equipment to be installed and tested.  If the equipment were ordered and delivered then C&amp;W would come under pressure to install and test the equipment and then allow the carriage of live traffic on the basis of an interim agreement.  Interim agreements were bad for C&amp;W as it would take a lengthy time for a final interconnection agreement to be arrived at.  A refusal to order equipment before finalising an interconnection agreement incentivised new entrants and also made a regulator work “harder and faster” in relation to the approval stage.  Mr Thompson thought that in the OECS, the C&amp;W companies had succeeded in making the regulators there work harder and faster.  Making the ordering of equipment conditional upon approval of an interconnection agreement also led to a water tight non-discriminatory process, that could not be challenged by a particular new entrant.  He thought that in the OECS, the C&amp;W companies had run a considerable risk of difficulties arising as a result of different new entrants not going live at the same time, mostly as a result of differential treatment as regards equipment ordering.  This point meant that equipment ordering should be postponed not only to the time when interconnection terms were finalised but to the later time when they were approved by the regulator. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Thompson’s email of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2003 goes on to discuss the “political situation” in Barbados.  He did not set out in detail what he thought the political situation was but it is, I think, clear that Mr Thompson was aware that the government in Barbados was putting considerable pressure on C&amp;W Barbados to order equipment at that stage.  It is to be inferred that Mr Thompson thought that a lack of co-operation from C&amp;W Barbados in that respect might have political disadvantages.  In his email, he sought to balance such disadvantages against the cost of conceding on equipment ordering.  He identified three costs.  The first was securing less favourable interconnection terms.  That comment was consistent with his detailed analysis about the use of equipment ordering as leverage in the negotiations.  The second cost he identified was that C&amp;W Barbados might be forced to go live on the basis of an interim agreement determined by the regulator.  That comment is also consistent with his earlier analysis.  The third cost was expressed as: “seeing xmas activity shared with new entrants and erosion of our ability to better establish our own GSM credentials as the sole provider.”  Mr Thompson then went on to propose a certain approach if it were felt that the balance of interests in Barbados was best served by facilitating equipment ordering.  I will refer to that matter below. </p>

The analysis as explained in detail by Mr Thompson does not include the objective of delaying Digicel Barbados for the sake of delay but, rather, confines the rationale in relation to equipment ordering to two principal matters, first, the leverage point and, secondly, the desire to have an unchallengeable non-discriminatory process.  </p>

The Claimants submitted that these references give the game away and show that the C&amp;W carrier services team had the objective of delaying Digicel Barbados for the purpose of keeping Digicel Barbados out of the market at Christmas 2003 and buying time for C&amp;W Barbados to improve its own position in the market in particular in relation to GSM.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, a fair reading of these references, in the context of the email as a whole, is as follows.  Mr Thompson was obviously aware, not least because of his experience in SLU and SVG, that if the C&amp;W company took the recommended stance in relation to equipment ordering and if the Digicel company declined to accept C&amp;W terms in relation to matters such as ADCs and mobile termination rates (and any other relevant matter) then the likely result would be that the negotiations would drag on and would not result in the early settlement of interconnection terms.  That passage of time would be harmful to Digicel and conversely would be beneficial to the C&amp;W company.  If the delay took Digicel’s launch to a date after the forthcoming Christmas period then that would be harmful to Digicel and beneficial to the C&amp;W company.  During the period of delay, the C&amp;W company could use the time profitably to improve its own position in the market.  All of those matters were foreseeable and were in fact foreseen by Mr Thompson and probably by other members of the carrier services team.  However, it would be wrong, in my judgment, to say that the primary objective of C&amp;W’s policy in relation to equipment ordering was to produce that result.  In my judgment, the primary object of C&amp;W’s policy on equipment ordering is explained in the first part of Mr Thompson’s email and that explanation does not include the objective of causing delay for delay’s sake.  If, as I have held, the C&amp;W company was entitled to adopt that approach to its negotiations with Digicel (in Barbados and elsewhere) then it was not disabled from adopting that approach by reason of the fact that it could foresee the consequences of that approach being adopted and the Digicel company declining to agree the terms proposed by C&amp;W. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Thompson concluded his email of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2003 by proposing a certain approach in the event that C&amp;W Barbados felt that it ought to order equipment before finalising the terms of an interconnection agreement.  His proposal identifies various specific stages to be followed through for that purpose.  The first stage related to identifying what equipment was needed by all the new entrants and not just Digicel Barbados. Thereafter, C&amp;W Barbados would wish to have credit guarantees from the new entrants in relation to the cost of the equipment.  He then proposed that the equipment in question should stay in bond in Barbados rather than being installed and tested and rather than allowing interconnection to go live.  This was to be the position until the interconnection agreement was finalised and approved by the regulator.  Mr Thompson also wanted to try to persuade the government in Barbados that it should not insist on C&amp;W Barbados entering into interim agreements with new entrants. </p>

This referred to the question of interconnection being completed before Christmas 2003.  Mr Thompson said he did not know whether the government had the expectation that that would occur.  For that purpose, Mr Thompson explained that C&amp;W Barbados would need to put in considerable and immediate effort in various respects.  </p>

He directed Mr Austin to instruct Mr Thompson as to what needed to be done to “honour our agreement with the PM”.  It is not clear what agreement Mr Loosemore was referring to.  It is probable that this was a reference to much earlier discussions between C&amp;W Barbados and the government on the subject of liberalisation, pursuant to which C&amp;W Barbados agreed to give up its exclusive licence and accept a non-exclusive licence.  </p>

He referred to the position of other new entrants apart from Digicel Barbados.  He stated that C&amp;W Barbados would require “a suitable bond or cash deposit” from Digicel Barbados.  He also stated that the equipment when delivered to Barbados would remain in bond until an interconnection agreement became legally effective and at that stage C&amp;W Barbados would proceed expeditiously to install and test the equipment so that interconnection could go live.  </p>

If C&amp;W Barbados had been under a duty to Digicel Barbados to order equipment following a request for interconnection then it would follow that some or all of the period between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 and 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2003 amounted to delay in C&amp;W Barbados’ compliance with its duty.

It follows from this that C&amp;W Barbados was not in breach of duty by reason of the fact that it communicated its decision to pre-order equipment only on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2003, rather than at some earlier time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Before considering the detailed facts in relation to that period, it is necessary to reflect my earlier conclusion that the legislation in Barbados did not place on C&amp;W Barbados an obligation to order the equipment prior to the parties entering into an interconnection agreement which would contain a contractual provision dealing with that matter.  Of course, the case put by Digicel Barbados is that there was a legal obligation to order equipment following the request for interconnection on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003.  If there were no such obligation, then it is difficult to see how Digicel Barbados can submit that certain stages in the process could have been, and should have been, handled more quickly.  On my finding as to the legal position, C&amp;W Barbados was not obliged to order equipment in this period.  C&amp;W Barbados had made its decision to order equipment because of the political pressure applied to it.  If anything was to control the pace at which C&amp;W Barbados proceeded to order the equipment, it would be the existence or absence of further political pressure and not the existence of a legal obligation to order equipment.  </p>

My conclusion is that the fact that C&amp;W Barbados, on a non-obligatory basis, took on the task of ordering equipment in advance of an interconnection agreement does not impose on C&amp;W Barbados an obligation that would not otherwise be upon it, which is to handle the ordering of equipment in a timely fashion.  </p>

I would not accept such a submission.  Section 28(3) requires the process of negotiating the terms and conditions of interconnection to be conducted in good faith.  It does not say anything about a process, voluntarily undertaken, to arrange for the ordering of equipment, in advance of finalising the terms of an interconnection agreement.</p>

The documents were described as “an indemnity of insurance bond”.  The documents were presented in a confusing way although if one had carefully studied the enclosed documents one would have detected that one of the two documents was a draft of a bond from Digicel Barbados to C&amp;W Barbados.  The draft envisaged that a bank would also commit itself to the bond.  The document which was headed “indemnity for issuance of bond”, misdescribed by Digicel Barbados as an “indemnity of insurance bond”, was a document to be entered into by Digicel Barbados and its bank and was not the bond being given to C&amp;W Barbados.  Digicel Barbados appeared to have dealt with this matter rather quickly and did not itself understand the format of the documents.  Later, Digicel Barbados did identify the correct document and re-supplied this to C&amp;W Barbados.  </p>

In any event, the letter of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2003 stated that C&amp;W Barbados required a cash deposit (rather than a bond) in relation to the cost of the equipment.

The only potentially relevant question would be whether C&amp;W Barbados put forward its figure of U$200,000 in good faith.  I find that it did put forward that figure in good faith.  In so far as it is material, I find that it was permissible for C&amp;W Barbados to ask for a full figure and to err on the side of caution in its favour.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants next complain that C&amp;W Barbados delayed unduly in ordering the equipment.  The equipment was either ordered on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 (as C&amp;W Barbados contends) or in the period 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 (as Digicel Barbados contends).  Digicel Barbados has two principal points as to the alleged delay in placing the order.  It says that by reason of matters which allegedly occurred in June 2003 and, in any event, did occur in August 2003 (the provision of Digicel Barbados’ forecast) the question of placing the order did not need to wait until 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, or thereabouts.  Of course, if C&amp;W Barbados had been under an obligation to order equipment following the request for interconnection on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003, the availability of a forecast from Digicel Barbados on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 would have been material.  If, however, one is asking a different question as to whether C&amp;W Barbados delayed unduly from 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2003 (when Digicel Barbados accepted the terms as to pre-ordering contained in the letter of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2003) to the date of ordering on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, the fact that Digicel Barbados’ forecast had been available from, at the latest, 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 is of less importance.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel Barbados’ second principal criticism of the way in which ordering was handled arises from the fact that C&amp;W Barbados ordered other equipment which it wanted, namely, switch expansion and upgrade equipment, at the same time as ordering the equipment directly involved in the interconnection with Digicel Barbados.  In the letter of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2003, Mr Thompson had stated to Digicel Barbados that the equipment needed for interconnection with Digicel Barbados would be ordered at the same time as equipment deemed necessary by C&amp;W Barbados to upgrade C&amp;W Barbados’ switch, in order to support the forecast demand upon interconnection.  The last paragraph of the letter stated that if Digicel Barbados was in agreement with these terms, the letter should be countersigned.  On the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2003, Digicel Barbados did countersign the letter.  Thus, Digicel Barbados agreed terms on which C&amp;W Barbados should pre-order equipment and those terms permitted C&amp;W Barbados to order the other equipment it wished at the same time.  In any event, the Claimants accepted on a number of occasions during the trial that they had not pleaded any allegation of any breach due to the fact that C&amp;W Barbados had placed an order for additional equipment as part of the order it placed on or about 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  There was technical evidence as to whether such a course was or was not appropriate but given the absence of a pleading and remembering that I have already decided that these matters of fact do not arise in view of my conclusion that C&amp;W Barbados was under no obligation to order equipment before the finalisation of an interconnection agreement, I do not think it necessary or proportionate to investigate these matters further. </p>

C&amp;W Barbados says that date was a predicted dispatch date rather than a delivery date and, in any event, it was expected that the equipment would remain in customs in Barbados until early January 2004.  In the event, the Claimants do not put forward any specific criticism of what C&amp;W Barbados did or failed to do in whatever time it took for delivery to be achieved.  In their written closing submissions the Claimants say: “… it is not known whether C&amp;W could have done more to procure an earlier delivery of the equipment, or at least the optical equipment itself such as to allow installation and testing to commence.”</p>

In their oral closing submissions, the Claimants provided schedules which showed the actual time taken for various stages of the interconnection process and compared those with a counterfactual for the same stages.  In these schedules, the actual time taken from the ordering of the equipment to the delivery of the equipment is given as 9 weeks.  In the counterfactual, that is, on the assumption that C&amp;W Barbados had done everything that it ought to have done, the same period from ordering to delivery of 9 weeks is taken.  In view of the way the matter is put in the Claimants’ written and oral closing submissions, it does not appear to be necessary for me to speculate, as the Claimants have done, as to the existence of a possibility that the period which the Claimants identify, 9 weeks, might have been shorter if something else had happened.  </p>

However, I have not been able to find any allegation that any step in the interconnection process or in the subsequent launch was thereby delayed.  It does not seem at all likely that completion of the C&amp;W Barbados’ side of the interconnection could have been delayed by the alleged failure to keep Digicel Barbados informed of Nortel’s progress towards delivery of the equipment.  As regards Digicel Barbados’ side of interconnection, the equipment which Digicel had ordered arrived in Barbados sometime earlier, on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ next complaint concerns the stance taken by C&amp;W Barbados in relation to carrying out civil works such as digging a trench and laying cable to join the Digicel Barbados switch station to the C&amp;W Barbados switch station.  In my judgment, there was no obligation on C&amp;W Barbados to carry out the civil works before the parties had agreed the terms of an interconnection agreement which would provide for the carrying out of such works.  In the event, C&amp;W Barbados agreed to carry out the civil works and commenced the carrying out of the civil works prior to finalising the terms of the interconnection agreement on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003.  Further, if there had been an obligation to carry out civil works prior to the entry into the interconnection agreement, there would only be a breach of that obligation if C&amp;W Barbados started the process at a time when it should have been foreseen that delay in completing the civil works would hold up interconnection.  Further, any such breach would only cause loss if the date on which the civil works were actually completed did in fact hold up interconnection.  </p>

That equipment was ordered by C&amp;W Barbados, duly arrived in Barbados and cleared customs in early January 2004.  The civil works were completed by 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 so that the potential impact of any delay in completing civil works is a limited one only, if I have correctly held that C&amp;W Barbados was not in breach of duty in relation to the circumstances whereby its equipment cleared customs in Barbados in early January 2004.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Notwithstanding these conclusions which dispose of the claim in relation to delay in respect of civil works, I will make my findings of fact on the subject.  On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003, Mr Austin, the President of C&amp;W Barbados, together with Mr Loosemore, who was a Director of C&amp;W Barbados, had a meeting with government ministers to discuss interconnection in Barbados.  During the course of that meeting, Mr Austin and Mr Loosemore agreed to carry out the necessary civil works to join up the C&amp;W Barbados network with the networks of the various new entrants in Barbados.  On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, there was a meeting at the Ministry of Industry and International Business of representatives of C&amp;W Barbados, of Digicel Barbados and of two other proposed new entrants.  The representatives of C&amp;W Barbados were Ms Medford, Mr Barnes and Mr Small.  In the list of action points contained in a note of that meeting, it was stated that the ministry needed a commitment from C&amp;W Barbados regarding civil works, before the Fair Trading Commission approved the RIO submitted by C&amp;W Barbados.  It seems likely that the government officials and the representatives of C&amp;W Barbados present at this meeting were not aware of the commitment given to the government on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003.  On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, C&amp;W Barbados wrote to the ministry, referring to the request made at the meeting on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  C&amp;W Barbados stated that it was willing to make a concession by commencing civil works to facilitate installation of underground optical fibre between the premises of other carriers and C&amp;W Barbados’ switch site, in advance of a signed and approved interconnection agreement.  C&amp;W Barbados stated that this was not normal practice but it was willing to do this after consideration of the requests from the government and the proposed new entrants.  It stated that this was without prejudice to the fact that it was under no obligation to do so.  It continued by saying that it would seek to secure a non-refundable cash deposit from each new entrant prior to commencement of the work and that C&amp;W Barbados was in the process of assessing the value of the cash deposit for each of the new entrants.  It would submit the appropriate requests for approval to the work to the Ministry of Energy and Public Utilities who would then assume responsibility for securing the approvals from the Ministry of Public Works.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a meeting between representatives of C&amp;W Barbados and Digicel Barbados on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  Digicel Barbados asked if, following the meeting on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, C&amp;W Barbados had taken the decision to commence civil works.  Mr Batchelor of C&amp;W Barbados stated he was unaware of what had been agreed between C&amp;W Barbados and the ministry and would revert to Digicel Barbados that afternoon when he was able to discuss the matter further.  It seems odd that the representatives of C&amp;W Barbados were not aware of the letter of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  It also seems odd that if that letter went to the ministry on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, Digicel Barbados had not become aware of that fact from the ministry.  There are clear signs in the documents that Digicel Barbados was putting considerable pressure on the government and the government was keeping Digicel Barbados generally informed.  It is possible that the letter in the bundle of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 was a draft and was not sent or that the date is wrongly stated.  At any rate, C&amp;W Barbados did not tell Digicel Barbados at the meeting on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 that it would agree to carry out the civil works before entering into an interconnection agreement.  </p>

C&amp;W Barbados then required from Digicel Barbados a non-refundable cash deposit from each of the proposed new entrants.  It stated that it was in the process of assessing the value of this cash deposit for each of these new entrants.  Upon receipt of the cash deposit from each of the new entrants, and the necessary approvals from the Ministry of Public Works or other government agencies, C&amp;W Barbados would commence the civil works.  </p>

The figure for Digicel Barbados was BDS$ 75,000.  Mr Barnes stated that letters needed to be drafted to be sent to the new entrants to seek their acceptance to pay these deposits.  I was shown an earlier email to Mr Barnes of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 when Mr Barnes was given an estimate in relation to Digicel Barbados which refers to the subject of the cost of fibre involved in the civil works.  The cost at that date was placed at approximately BDS$ 70,000.  It is not necessary to explore the difference between the two figures as Digicel Barbados paid the requested figure of BDS$ 75,000.  Further, it was not submitted to me in closing submissions that the figure of BDS$ 75,000 had actually been calculated by C&amp;W Barbados prior to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.  </p>

The letter also referred to the need to conduct an appropriate site visit and survey of the proposed route for the underground fibre link and the need to obtain government and other approvals. On the same day, Digicel Barbados countersigned this letter agreeing its terms and gave C&amp;W Barbados a cheque for BDS$ 75,000.  </p>

Although the time involved was only some 20 days and although the C&amp;W Barbados representatives were no doubt doing other things, as the process in relation to the draft RIO was ongoing at this time, there is force in the complaint that extra days were taken up unnecessarily.  If the matter arose for a decision, I would be inclined to hold that the period from 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 when C&amp;W Barbados were asked what its position was in relation to civil works until 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 when C&amp;W Barbados told Digicel Barbados the answer to that question could have been shortened by some days.  On balance, I would be inclined to say that the period from 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 to 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 when C&amp;W Barbados told Digicel Barbados the amount of the deposit, did not exceed a reasonable period, given that the letter of the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 had to be drafted and the draughtsman was involved in other ongoing matters.  However, if I shortened the period from 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 to 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 by some days, the extra time taken at that stage would only be a breach of a duty to act in a timely fashion if there was a real risk at that stage that the extra days would ultimately cause delay to the process of interconnection.  Conversely, if there was no risk at that stage of the civil works not being completed by the time that the interconnection was ready for testing then it would probably not be right to say that C&amp;W Barbados had failed to act in a timely fashion.  </p>

The steps taken by C&amp;W Barbados to obtain the necessary government approvals and to carry out the civil works are described in detail in paragraph 47 of the witness statement of Mr Barnes.  I accept that evidence.  Based on that evidence, I find that C&amp;W Barbados did progress the civil works at all times after 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 in a timely fashion.  </p>

There does not appear to be any dispute that when the interconnection agreement was entered into, it placed on C&amp;W Barbados certain obligations as to the installation and testing of the equipment.  The interconnection agreement was entered into on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003.  The stage at which installation and testing was to be carried out started on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and installation and testing started on that date and continued to 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004.  There was a pleaded allegation as to the position in relation to the testing on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004 but that allegation was not pursued by the Claimants in closing submissions and, in any event, I find that the allegation fails.  </p>

Similarly, the legal question whether C&amp;W Barbados was under a duty to carry out installation and testing before entering into an interconnection agreement does not arise. If that question had arisen, I would have held that there was no such obligation.  Further, on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003, that is before the parties entered into the interconnection agreement on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003, C&amp;W Barbados informed Minister Mottley that it was willing to install and test the equipment required for interconnection as soon as the equipment cleared customs, even if that was before the parties entered into an interconnection agreement.  They stated that following satisfactory testing of the interconnection, the interconnection would be disconnected and only re-connected and commissioned when the interconnection agreement was reached and approved by the regulator.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ complaint therefore seems to be confined to a complaint that C&amp;W Barbados did not adopt that stance until the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003 and, further, that C&amp;W Barbados put forward reasons for its stance prior to 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003 which were not good reasons.  In my judgment, the reason which C&amp;W Barbados had before 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003 for its refusal to agree to installation and testing before entering into an interconnection agreement is explained by the email from Mr Thompson to Mr Austin of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2003 to which I have earlier referred.  C&amp;W Barbados did not wish to take action which it was not obliged to take which might speed up the time at which Digicel Barbados could enter the market.  C&amp;W Barbados wished to use the fact that installation and testing would follow the making of an interconnection agreement to provide such leverage as it would provide in favour of C&amp;W Barbados when negotiating the terms of the interconnection agreement.  In so far as C&amp;W Barbados put forward other reasons why it was inappropriate for it to commit itself to installation and testing before an interconnection agreement, those reasons were not C&amp;W Barbados’ real reasons.  C&amp;W Barbados put forward those reasons not because it knew that its stance on installation and testing was unlawful but, instead, because it was coming under considerable political pressure from the government in Barbados and it judged that it was inappropriate for it to make it explicitly clear to the government in Barbados that its stance was for the purpose of improving its negotiating position.</p>

I have held that C&amp;W Barbados was not in breach in the way alleged.  I have also dealt with Digicel Barbados’ case that C&amp;W Barbados was in breach of its duties to Digicel Barbados in certain respects in relation to physical interconnection.  The principal respects referred to were failing to order equipment before 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, failing to agree to carry out civil works until that matter was agreed on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2003 and its stance in relation to installation and testing of the interconnection.  I have held that C&amp;W Barbados was not in breach in the respects alleged.

If I had held that C&amp;W Barbados was in breach in relation to its handling of physical interconnection (even though it was not in breach by not talking to Digicel Barbados before 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003), Digicel Barbados would wish to argue for a counterfactual time line whereby physical and contractual interconnection would have been achieved by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003.  </p>

Accordingly, if I had found for Digicel Barbados on its case as to negotiations before 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003 and/or found for Digicel Barbados on its case as to physical interconnection, then it would be necessary for me to consider whether C&amp;W Barbados should have acted differently in relation to contractual interconnection and, in particular, whether any differences in its behaviour, which there should have been, would have resulted in contractual interconnection by 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 alternatively by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003.  </p>

The relevant part of Mr Batstone’s witness statement is in paragraphs 326 to 427, at pages 93 to 121 of that witness statement.  Mr Batstone was cross-examined on these matters, in particular, on day 31 at pages 150 to 184 of the transcript and on day 32 at pages 1 to 32 of the transcript.  Mr Forrest dealt with these matters in paragraphs 132 to 226, pages 41 to 70, of his witness statement.  Mr Forrest was cross-examined, in particular, on these matters on day 54 at pages 1 to 62 of the transcript.  The Claimants drew my attention in particular to pages 50 to 62 of the transcript of day 54.  At pages 54 and 55 of the transcript for day 54, Mr Forrest gave evidence as to why, at a particular point in the sequence, C&amp;W Barbados did not wish to identify a mobile termination rate in advance of an acceptance by Digicel Barbados that any mobile termination rates would be reciprocal.  C&amp;W Barbados did not want to show its hand at that stage and preferred to remain neutral on the amount of any mobile termination rate.  With that addition to the written evidence of Mr Batstone and Mr Forrest, I accept the evidence given by those witnesses in their witness statements on the subject of the negotiations in Barbados.  </p>

It is said that C&amp;W Barbados adopted a series of delaying positions and underhand tactics to ensure that interconnection could not happen until the New Year 2004.  It is said that C&amp;W Barbados delayed putting forward any interconnection rates in Barbados until it filed its RIO on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2003, a copy of which was supplied to Digicel Barbados on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2003.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The next allegation made by Digicel Barbados as to C&amp;W Barbados’ stance in the negotiation on rates is that C&amp;W Barbados used a cynical ploy to slow down negotiations in Barbados.  The alleged ploy was to omit from the draft RIO any service description for mobile to mobile calls.  C&amp;W Barbados, it is said, later filled this gap in time for a meeting on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 but when it did so it proposed a nil rate for a mobile to mobile call adopting a “sender keeps all” model, which meant that it was not necessary to specify a mobile to mobile rate.  Digicel Barbados suggests that more than one explanation has been given for the omission of a termination service for a mobile to mobile call.  I am asked to conclude that these explanations are unlikely and indeed false.  Digicel Barbados explains that the negotiating position adopted by C&amp;W Barbados was always going to be unacceptable in commercial terms to Digicel Barbados.  Digicel Barbados says that C&amp;W Barbados’ real intention was to keep its powder dry on mobile termination rates for as long as possible.  As I understand it, the submission of Digicel Barbados is that this was the intention of C&amp;W Barbados from as early as August 2003 and not simply from the time when C&amp;W Barbados put forward the “sender keeps all” concept. These various matters alleged by Digicel Barbados are said to be contrary to an obligation to negotiate in good faith.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the interconnection rates in the RIO of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2003, Digicel Barbados alleges that these rates were not cost oriented and this was a breach of section 25(2)(e) of the Telecommunications Act 2001.  Digicel Barbados says that the “numbers speak for themselves” in this respect and, further, that C&amp;W Barbados could not have genuinely believed that it could justify its proposed rates as lawful cost oriented rates.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In order for Digicel Barbados to establish breach of duty by C&amp;W Barbados, Digicel Barbados must establish that C&amp;W Barbados did not negotiate the terms of interconnection in good faith (contrary to section 28(3) of the Telecommunications Act 2001) or did not allow interconnection to be made available “in a timely fashion” (contrary to section 25 of the Telecommunications Act 2001).  Indeed, as I understand its submissions, Digicel Barbados relies on essentially the same matters as being both a failure to negotiate in good faith and a failure to provide interconnection in a timely fashion.  The failure to provide interconnection in a timely fashion is said to be because C&amp;W Barbados deliberately and knowingly adopted a negotiating stance for the purpose of slowing down the negotiations and delaying the time when agreement might be reached.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Based on the evidence of Mr Batstone and Mr Forrest, which I have described above, I do not accept that the negotiating stance adopted by C&amp;W Barbados was otherwise than in good faith.  Similarly, I do not accept the submission that C&amp;W Barbados deliberately and knowingly adopted a negotiating stance for the purpose of delaying the negotiations and the point at which ultimate agreement would be reached.  C&amp;W Barbados was a tough negotiator in these negotiations.  Digicel Barbados was every bit as tough.  Both negotiating parties were endeavouring to get the best deal for themselves.  As regards the allegation that C&amp;W Barbados put forward rates which were not cost oriented, there was no adequate material put before the court which would enable me to determine what the permissible range for a cost oriented rate in Barbados would have been and whether the starting positions of C&amp;W Barbados were outside that range, or within it.  For the same reason, the absence of any relevant material, I have no basis in which I could find that the rates initially put forward by C&amp;W Barbados were put forward in bad faith. </p>

I have already held that I have no material on which to make a finding that the rates put forward by C&amp;W Barbados were put forward in bad faith.  I further comment that this allegation was not put to C&amp;W Barbados’ witnesses.  </p>

In any event, having regard to the way in which the negotiation progressed and, in particular, the way in which they were concluded under considerable pressure from Minister Mottley, I am not able to find that any ploy of this kind, if practised, had an impact on the date on which matters were ultimately agreed.  In so far as Digicel Barbados alleges that it was bad faith for C&amp;W Barbados to put forward a rate which reflected an ADC, I do not regard that approach to the negotiations as involving bad faith.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">When considering the allegations as to the approach adopted by C&amp;W Barbados to these negotiations, I have also considered the lengthy submissions made by C&amp;W Barbados which are critical of the approach adopted by Digicel Barbados to the negotiations.  It is submitted that Digicel Barbados adopted an impermissible approach to the negotiations, misunderstood the charging regime in Barbados and knowingly put forward rates which were not cost oriented.  It is not necessary to make any findings on these counter allegations.  It is sufficient for me to find, as I have done, that each party to the negotiations conducted its negotiation using a tough negotiating style with a view to achieving a good commercial result for itself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In coming to my conclusion that any ploy of keeping Mr Forrest away from meetings did not cause any delay in fact, I have had regard to the negotiations in December which finally produced an agreement on rates.  The parties negotiated rates over six days between 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003.  The precise positions taken by the parties during that period are described in detail in paragraphs 208 to 215 of Mr Forrest’s witness statement and I accept that evidence.  After the six days of negotiations, no agreement was reached.  This led to Minister Mottley convening a final round of negotiations on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003.  She exerted significant pressure on the parties to reach agreement and the parties bowed to that pressure, made compromises and finally reached agreement.  The interconnection agreement was signed on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003 and approved by the regulator on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The result of the above is that Digicel Barbados has not established that interconnection was delayed by reason of a breach of duty by C&amp;W Barbados.  Accordingly, the question whether Digicel Barbados would have been in a position to launch its network earlier than the date on which it actually launched its network, if interconnection had been completed earlier than it was actually completed, does not arise.  For essentially the same reasons as I gave when I considered the position in SLU, it is neither necessary nor proportionate for me to consider on a hypothetical basis all of the arguments between the parties as to whether Digicel Barbados could have launched its network any earlier than the actual date of its launch.</p>

It will be remembered that I have held that on the true construction of the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations (in force from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2003) there was no obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to order the equipment it needed for its side of the interconnection before the parties had concluded an interconnection agreement. Similarly, if such equipment had been ordered and delivered to Cayman before the parties had concluded an interconnection agreement, there was no obligation on C&amp;W Cayman under the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations to install that equipment and test the interconnection. Similarly, there was no obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to carry out the civil works necessary to join the switch sites of C&amp;W Cayman and Digicel Cayman before the parties had concluded an interconnection agreement. </p>

I have described the position under the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations as to the intended process whereby the parties would negotiate and agree an interconnection agreement. There was no obligation on either party under those provisions to make an agreement in stages so as to produce an interim agreement in relation to some of the matters that needed to be agreed leaving over other matters to be negotiated and agreed later. Further, there was no obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to negotiate an interim agreement which allowed the interconnection to go live before the parties had agreed on the rates which would be payable for traffic passing through the point of interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Against the background of these legal obligations, I will refer in summary to the basic steps that were in fact taken by the parties in Cayman. Digicel Cayman obtained its licence on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. Prior to that date, C&amp;W Cayman did not owe Digicel Cayman an obligation under the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations (which in fact only came into force on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2003 in any event). Following the grant of the licence, C&amp;W Cayman did decide that it would order the equipment needed for its side of the interconnection. It made that decision on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, C&amp;W Cayman notified Digicel Cayman of the amount of the deposit that it would require before it ordered this equipment. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003, C&amp;W Cayman ordered equipment for its side of the interconnection. This equipment arrived in due course. C&amp;W Cayman began to install the equipment on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and testing then followed. C&amp;W Cayman began the civil works to join the two switch sites. There is a dispute as to when C&amp;W Cayman completed its civil works; C&amp;W Cayman contend that it completed its civil works by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2004 and Digicel Cayman contend that the works were completed by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. The parties entered into an interim agreement on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. The interim agreement specified the rates which were to be payable save that the mobile termination rate was an interim figure pending determination of a permanent mobile termination rate by the regulator. Testing of the interconnection was completed on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004. </p>

Digicel Cayman complains of the time which C&amp;W Cayman took to notify Digicel Cayman of the amount of the deposit to be paid by Digicel Cayman. Digicel Cayman criticises C&amp;W Cayman for the time it took to order equipment on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. Although Digicel Cayman contends that the parties should have entered into an interim interconnection agreement by mid to late December 2003, it does not contend that C&amp;W Cayman should have entered into an interconnection agreement, of any kind, by the earlier dates in October and November or the date of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 referred to above. If as a matter of law C&amp;W Cayman was not under any obligation to order equipment before the making of an interconnection agreement, it must follow that C&amp;W Cayman’s conduct in ordering equipment by 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 went beyond its obligations and it cannot be said to be in a breach of an obligation to order equipment, which I have held it did not owe. Thus even if, on the facts, it would have been possible for C&amp;W Cayman to have made its decision about ordering equipment at an earlier date or it could have notified the amount of the deposit earlier or even placed the order earlier, these cannot be said to be a breach of any obligation owed to Digicel Cayman. Just because C&amp;W Cayman, acting under no obligation, is prepared to take these steps, it does not follow that the way in which it takes these steps becomes a matter of obligation on its part permitting Digicel Cayman to make criticisms, on the facts, of how it proceeded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The position is somewhat similar, albeit not identical, in the case of commencing the civil works and commencing installation of the equipment (followed by testing of the interconnection). If C&amp;W Cayman was not at fault by reason of the fact that the interim interconnection agreement was entered into on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004, rather than at some earlier date, then it follows that the civil works were begun before that date, as was the start of installation (to be followed by testing of the interconnection). If I have correctly held that C&amp;W Cayman was not under an obligation to commence civil works or to commence installation, before the parties had concluded an interconnection agreement, then it follows that it is not open to Digicel Cayman to allege a breach of obligation in relation to the date when C&amp;W Cayman commenced the civil works or commenced installation of its equipment. Conversely, if Digicel Cayman were to establish that C&amp;W Cayman was in breach of its obligations by delaying the time when the parties had entered into an interconnection agreement so that there was a period of delay between the notional date when such an interconnection agreement should have been reached and the later date of commencing civil works and installation of equipment, then it would be open to Digicel Cayman to put forward a case as to the rate of progress in commencing civil works and in commencing the installation of equipment in the period from the notional date of an interconnection agreement until the date when those things actually began. However, it must be remembered, that the notional date of an interconnection agreement will have to be the notional date for a full interconnection agreement, given that C&amp;W Cayman was under no obligation to enter into a partial or interim interconnection agreement, although in fact it did so on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. </p>

Digicel Cayman also alleges that it was misled in a certain respect in relation to the installation of the MUX needed for C&amp;W Cayman’s side of the interconnection. I will examine these allegations in detail in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">It is convenient at this stage to state that the case put forward by Digicel Cayman is that the provision of wrong information by C&amp;W Cayman amounted to a breach by C&amp;W Cayman of its duty not to obstruct or impede interconnection. As will be seen, the matters which are urged by Digicel Cayman involved allegations that C&amp;W Cayman made false representations, which it knew to be false and Digicel Cayman relied on those representations, causing it loss and damage. It might be thought that a case of the kind I have just described is a classic example of an allegation of the tort of deceit. Although the Claimants amended their pleaded case in Cayman to make these allegations of misleading conduct by C&amp;W Cayman, the Claimants did not allege that C&amp;W Cayman or anyone else had committed the tort of deceit. I raised this matter with the Claimants in the course of their closing submissions and I was told that Digicel Cayman was deliberately not alleging the tort of deceit. I find that the way in which Digicel Cayman has chosen to put its case on this subject somewhat curious. After all, the tort of deceit, if committed, is actionable whereas at the trial, C&amp;W Cayman were contending that a breach of the 2002 Law or a breach of the 2003 regulations was not actionable. As matters have turned out, I have held that C&amp;W Cayman’s submissions on that point are correct. Further, the tort of deceit would amount to unlawful means, for the purpose of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, whereas C&amp;W Cayman argued at the trial that the other breaches alleged by Digicel Cayman were not unlawful means. In the event, I have held that a breach of the 2002 Law does not amount to unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy and, in relation to the 2003 regulations, a breach of a regulation which is a crime under regulation 30 will be unlawful means but the regulations only came into effect on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2003. Having made these comments, in view of the Claimants’ deliberate decision not to allege the tort of deceit, when I consider the facts relied upon by the Claimants, I will not consider whether those facts do or do not amount to the tort of deceit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The first of the detailed allegations with which I will deal is the allegation that C&amp;W Cayman delayed unduly before making its decision, and informing Digicel Cayman of that decision, that it would order the equipment needed for its side of interconnection before entering into an interconnection agreement. I can begin the history with a letter dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2003 from Digicel Cayman to C&amp;W Cayman. This stated that Digicel Cayman had been successful in its bid for a mobile licence in Cayman. The letter requested a meeting with C&amp;W Cayman to discuss the physical and commercial aspects of interconnection. This letter was written before Digicel Cayman received its licence on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. In fact, there were two meetings between the parties before 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. These took place on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. It seems likely that the first of these meetings concerned tower sharing and the meeting on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 discussed interconnection at a fairly high level of generality. I was not shown a note of the meeting of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. The meeting is however referred to in an internal Digicel document prepared on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. That document also refers to a meeting which Digicel held with the regulator on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. C&amp;W Cayman were not present at the meeting on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. The internal Digicel document to which I have referred states that Digicel told the regulator that it would order the equipment needed for the C&amp;W Cayman side of the interconnection. There was an issue at the trial as to whether Digicel Cayman had also made the same point to C&amp;W Cayman on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. The evidence on that question was not satisfactory. Mr Merriman on behalf of Digicel Cayman says that he thinks that he made this suggestion to C&amp;W Cayman. It is possible that something of this kind was said at the meeting on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. It is equally possible that Mr Merriman thinks that he said it because having read the documents some time after the event he saw the reference to this point, albeit a reference to a meeting on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 when C&amp;W Cayman was not present. In the event, I do not think it is necessary to wrestle any further with the question whether this statement was made at the meeting on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. If the statement had been made on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, it is probable that C&amp;W Cayman would have rejected that suggestion. Further, Digicel Cayman did not press the suggestion at any time after 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 and the matter was quickly overtaken by the agreement from C&amp;W Cayman to order equipment pursuant to its letter of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003.</p>

The letter requested information on various matters including a request to be told the tariffs and terms and conditions under which C&amp;W Cayman would be willing to provide interconnection services to Digicel Cayman. On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, Digicel Cayman wrote to C&amp;W Cayman referring to the request for interconnection. Digicel Cayman stated that they would be most obliged if C&amp;W Cayman could confirm by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 whether C&amp;W Cayman would be willing to undertake certain matters prior to an interconnection agreement being signed and approved by the regulator. The three matters referred to were: (1) ordering the interconnection equipment necessary to link the networks; (2) undertaking the civil works and testing the underground optical fibre link necessary to install the joining service between the two switch sites; and (3) installing, commissioning and testing the interconnection equipment. Digicel Cayman stated that it would be willing to provide C&amp;W Cayman with a reasonable deposit towards the cost of the equipment and the civil works, to be credited against amounts owed by Digicel Cayman to C&amp;W Cayman under the interconnection agreement, once it was signed and approved by the regulator. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties met on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. I was not shown a note of what was discussed at that meeting. On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, C&amp;W Cayman replied to the letter from Digicel Cayman of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. The letter states that this reply had been promised at the meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. C&amp;W Cayman stated that as a demonstration of its commitment to facilitate competition in the newly liberalised market, C&amp;W Cayman was prepared to: (1) commence ordering of the interconnection equipment; and (2) to commence planning and pursuit of the necessary approvals for the civil works ahead of an approved interconnection agreement. It will be seen that the response from C&amp;W Cayman gave Digicel Cayman part only of what it had asked for in its letter of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. C&amp;W Cayman in its letter of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 then identified certain conditions to be complied with by Digicel Cayman. These were that Digicel Cayman provided the location of its switch site, confirmation of adherence to the main technical principles in the joint working manual, a forecast of network links for two years completed as in the joint working manual and a statement of the technical requirement needed for day one of the interconnection. C&amp;W Cayman also required Digicel Cayman to provide a cash deposit to cover approximately 60 to 70% of the estimated cost of the equipment and the civil works. The letter stated that the parties should develop and agree a project plan for the expeditious installation and testing of the joining service working towards a ready for service date. Additionally, C&amp;W Cayman requested that both parties commit to the pursuit of the signing of an interconnection agreement by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. C&amp;W Cayman stated that it committed itself in good faith to making available the necessary legal, commercial &amp; technical resources to achieve this date. C&amp;W Cayman also committed itself to commence the civil works immediately after the signing of an interconnection agreement (subject to having the necessary approvals) and to expedite the project plan towards the earliest ready for service date subject to constraints beyond the control of the parties. C&amp;W Cayman looked forward to a continued professional and cordial relationship which, it said, had evolved over the past weeks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel Cayman says that C&amp;W Cayman was in breach of duty by taking the time which it took to write the letter of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. If, which is not the legal position, the 2002 Law had stated that C&amp;W Cayman was under an immediate binding obligation to order the equipment it needed as soon as a request for interconnection was made then one might have had to examine the period from 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 to see whether the passage of thirteen days amounted to a breach of such an obligation. However, the 2002 Law says no such thing. Even if the 2002 Law had placed an obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to order equipment at some time before the entry into an interconnection agreement, I would not have held that C&amp;W Cayman had broken that obligation by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. The discussion, if there had been one, about equipment on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 was before Digicel Cayman had its licence and before C&amp;W Cayman had any obligation under the 2002 Law to Digicel Cayman. Following the request for interconnection on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, the parties had a meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, Digicel Cayman wrote its letter requesting the ordering of equipment, amongst other things. Digicel Cayman asked for a response by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. At the meeting of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, C&amp;W Cayman agreed to give its response by that date. By 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, C&amp;W Cayman gave a favourable response to the request for ordering equipment. In my judgment, there is nothing in that history which can form a proper basis for criticism of C&amp;W Cayman even if it was under some obligation to order equipment before entry into an interconnection agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The next complaint made by the Claimant is that there was delay on the part of C&amp;W Cayman in providing the figure which it required Digicel Cayman to pay by way of a deposit for the equipment which C&amp;W Cayman would order and for the civil works. More particularly, Digicel Cayman says that C&amp;W Cayman delayed in providing the figure for that part of the deposit which related to the equipment to be ordered. C&amp;W Cayman provided final figures for the deposit for the equipment and the civil works on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Digicel Cayman says there was unreasonable delay in that these figures, alternatively, the figure for the equipment alone, should have been provided on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. In their closing submissions, the Claimants make detailed submissions to the effect that the figures which were provided by C&amp;W Cayman were too high. There is no allegation in the pleaded case that an excessive figure was put forward by C&amp;W Cayman. Indeed, as will be seen, Digicel Cayman paid “thesum” requested by C&amp;W Cayman and there was no delay involved in any argument between the parties as to the amount of the figure. Nonetheless, the Claimants allege that the amount of the deposit appears to have been significantly inflated or exaggerated. I was asked to conclude that I should draw certain conclusions from the alleged deliberate exaggeration, in particular, the conclusion that C&amp;W Cayman had a propensity to mislead Digicel Cayman. </p>

I can express my conclusion on the allegation that this part of the history shows a propensity on the part of C&amp;W Cayman to misled Digicel Cayman. There is no sign in the C&amp;W Cayman internal documents of any intention of that kind. Instead, the documents fairly clearly indicate an intention on the part of C&amp;W Cayman to co-operate with the process and with a view to avoiding delay. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Returning to the question of whether C&amp;W Cayman delayed the production of the deposit figure in circumstances where the figure ought to have been communicated by the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Digicel Cayman put forward a somewhat brief submission that “there was no justification for that delay”. In these circumstances, it becomes necessary to consider the period from 30th October 2003 to 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to see what transpired during that period. I have already referred to the letter dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 from C&amp;W Cayman stating that it would order the equipment it needed for interconnection on certain conditions. Some of those conditions related to Digicel Cayman providing further information; another condition required a deposit to cover both the estimated costs of the equipment and the civil works. On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2003, Digicel Cayman replied to C&amp;W Cayman. Digicel Cayman thanked C&amp;W Cayman “for your timely response”. Digicel Cayman gave some of the information requested. It was unable to state definitively the location of its switch site. However, it stated that it had made an offer to purchase a switch site and as soon as that was finalised, C&amp;W Cayman would be informed. The letter from Digicel Cayman then stated that it was requesting a cost estimate for the equipment to be provided by November 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> 2003. This was so the parties could “discuss” the amount of the deposit. A careful reading of this letter shows that Digicel Cayman was distinguishing between the deposit for the equipment and the deposit for the civil works. Because Digicel’s switch site was not settled by that date and because the amount of the civil works, and therefore the cost of them, would depend on the precise location of the switch site, I can see the sense of Digicel Cayman endeavouring to separate the cost of the equipment from the cost of the civil work. However, Digicel Cayman did not emphasise this point and it can be seen from the later documents that C&amp;W Cayman did not think that there was any need to deviate from the proposal it had made in the letter of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003, to the effect that there should be a single deposit for the equipment and civil works. </p>

Mr Batstone advised that C&amp;W Cayman should be careful about creating expectations on the part of Digicel by responding too quickly. He recognised that the carrier services team had “got off on the wrong foot” with the Digicel company in SLU and that C&amp;W Cayman was trying not to repeat that in Cayman. Mr Batstone went on to say that Digicel was good at setting very high expectations which required C&amp;W to drop everything to meet those expectations. This was said to be unfair to C&amp;W and to the other carriers. In my judgment, on a fair reading of this email, this is not a case of Mr Batstone seeking to introduce delay in the process for the sake of delay but is a genuine comment that there would be real difficulties in practice with C&amp;W Cayman and the carrier services team if they allowed Digicel Cayman to insist that its requirements for a very speedy process had to be complied with. </p>

It had obtained a costing from Nortel for, I presume, its equipment, in the sum of U$141,000. 70% of that figure, by way of deposit, was U$98,000. It will be seen that the deposit for the equipment later requested by C&amp;W Cayman was less than these figures. Nonetheless, the Claimants submitted in their closing submissions that C&amp;W Cayman’s figures were significantly inflated. The note also records that Digicel Cayman’s costs estimate of the civil works was U$60,000. Again, the figure ultimately requested by C&amp;W Cayman was very much less than this figure. </p>

There were a number of internal C&amp;W emails on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 when different people within C&amp;W Cayman and the carrier services team were liaising in an attempt to identify the appropriate figure by way of deposit to be stated to Digicel Cayman.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Towards the end of the day on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr McNaughton of the carrier services team sent an email to Digicel Cayman stating that the deposit for the equipment, but not the civil works, appeared to be in the region of U$70,000 and Mr McNaughton stated that he should be able to send something formal and more definitive on the following day. The recipient at Digicel Cayman replied later on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 expressing very considerable appreciation for Mr McNaughton’s efforts in giving her this information. She even went so far as to say that C&amp;W Cayman were “eating out of [her] hand”. Mr McNaughton returned the compliment by stating that he was looking forward to making the relationship work and he thought that a lack of trust in other countries had only led to numerous and totally unnecessary discussions and negotiations which were a waste of everybody’s time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, there is an internal email in C&amp;W Cayman which identifies the costs of the civil works for Digicel Cayman at approximately CI $23,000, which I am told is approximately U$27,000. The email has a redacted section from which one can infer that C&amp;W Cayman was working on an assessment for the costs of the civil work for another potential new entrant at the same time. The email stated that there were certain approximations in the calculations and a detailed site analysis was required to provide an accurate cost and a 20% contingency should be added to cover unknowns; a more detailed study providing more accurate costs would take until 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Mr McNaughton did not wait for a more detailed study to be done and on the same day sent an email to Miss Lewis of Digicel Cayman quoting the figure of some CI $23,000 and he did not mention the question of a contingency. Later on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, C&amp;W Cayman was in contact with Nortel with a view to assessing an accurate price for a TN-1X MUX. </p>

Also on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 there are internal emails within C&amp;W Cayman as to what should be added to the figure of some CI $23,000 for the civil works. Mr McNaughton revealed that he had already communicated the figure of some CI $23,000 to Digicel Cayman but stated that there might not be a problem if Digicel Cayman regarded the figure as 60-70% of the estimated costs. </p>

Indeed, a review of this period and, in particular, the internal communications within C&amp;W Cayman do nothing to support the case put forward by the Claimants that C&amp;W Cayman was determined to cause delay for the sake of holding up Digicel Cayman. The internal communications at this stage show that C&amp;W Cayman was actively co-operating with a view to advancing interconnection at least within a reasonable time, if not more quickly than that.</p>

The steps which were taken by C&amp;W Cayman in the period from13th November 2003 to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 are revealed by the documents in the Cayman supplemental bundle. It is not necessary to narrate the many detailed steps taken during this period by reference to these documents, as the matter is described in the witness statement of Mr Anderson of C&amp;W Cayman. He describes the internal communications within C&amp;W Cayman on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, the same day as C&amp;W Cayman received the cheque from Digicel Cayman for the deposit for the equipment and the civil works. It will be remembered that the cheque had to be corrected and this was in due course done. Mr Anderson also describes the procedures within C&amp;W Cayman for obtaining capital expenditure approval. These procedures included, as a first step, obtaining a quotation from a supplier for the equipment. A second step was to prepare a business case, based on the quotation, although such a business case could be prepared in parallel with obtaining a quotation, if there had been a preliminary cost estimate. If the business case were approved, a purchase order would be prepared and submitted for approval within C&amp;W Cayman. If the purchase order were approved, the expenditure was thereby authorised and the purchase order could be sent to the supplier. </p>

Mr Callow revised the request for a quotation on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Nortel provided a quotation on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Mr Anderson explained in his witness statement why Nortel would have taken the time it took from 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to produce its quotation.

Mr Anderson commentated that this was “a fast turn around” and it was unusual to take this step before the business case was approved. On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Callow asked Nortel to make a minor amendment to its quotation and a revised quote was provided the same day.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Then there was a new development. A Mr Anderson White of C&amp;W Cayman became aware that C&amp;W Cayman had in stock two TN-1C MUXs that were surplus to its immediate requirements. These could not be directly used to form an interconnection between C&amp;W Cayman and Digicel Cayman because a larger MUX, a TN-1X, was needed for that purpose. However, C&amp;W Cayman had in its system TN-1Xs that were not fully utilised and which could be replaced by TN-1Cs. Thus, it was possible to use a surplus TN-1C to replace an existing TN-1X thereby making the TN-1X available for interconnection with Digicel. The discovery that there were two TN-1Cs in stock in Cayman and the realisation that a TN-1C could be substituted for a TN-1X appears to have occurred for the first time on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Digicel Cayman suggested in closing submissions that this discovery and realisation would have happened earlier if C&amp;W Cayman had proceeded more expeditiously with its placing of an order to Nortel. In my judgment, there is no connection between the time when the TN-1Cs were discovered and anything which C&amp;W Cayman did, or did not do, as regards the ordering process with Nortel. I proceed on the basis that the TN-1Cs were discovered on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and there is no reason to find that this event should have happened at an earlier date. The consequence was that although C&amp;W Cayman had ordered equipment (or was about to place an order for equipment) including MUXs from Nortel, there was now the possibility that these MUXs were not needed from Nortel. Mr Anderson White obviously told Mr Callow of the discovery and the first thing which Mr Callow did was to inform Nortel that C&amp;W Cayman wished to place a hold on its order. </p>

Mr Anderson stated that it was more likely than not that Mr Callow had placed a hold on the order without seeking prior authorisation from Mr Anderson. On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Callow told Nortel that C&amp;W Cayman did not now need to order the MUXs which had been in the earlier order. Nortel responded to this on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. The 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 was a Friday and the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span>December 2003 was a Tuesday so there was one complete working day between these two communications. A purchase order was approved within C&amp;W Cayman on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 and sent to Nortel on the same day. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Although Digicel Cayman is critical of the fact that the final form of the order which was placed with Nortel was not sent to Nortel until 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003, the criticism is essentially that Nortel should have been asked to provide a quotation before C&amp;W Cayman had received the deposit cheque from Digicel Cayman and, further, that C&amp;W Cayman should have obtained internal approval to the capital expenditure before the Digicel deposit cheque was received. I will deal with those criticisms but before I do so, I make the finding that so far as the individual steps taken by C&amp;W Cayman in the period 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 are concerned, C&amp;W Cayman was not guilty of delay. On the contrary, C&amp;W Cayman acted with considerable speed. I have also paid close attention to the internal communications within C&amp;W Cayman at this time to see if those communications reveal anything as to the attitude of C&amp;W Cayman as to the need for expedition or, conversely, any desire to slow matters down. In my judgment, the internal communications within C&amp;W Cayman reveal that C&amp;W Cayman and the carrier services team, acting on its behalf, were not motivated by a desire to cause delay but were motivated by a desire to use all proper speed in obtaining the necessary equipment. In particular, the decision to use a spare TN-1C in place of a TN-1X, which was in use, so as to release the TN-1X, so that it would be available for interconnection with Digicel Cayman was motivated principally because such a move would help speed things up. I do not think that the decision to use a spare TN-1C in this way was motivated by any real need or desire to improve C&amp;W Cayman’s cash flow at that particular time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I now return to the two criticisms made by Digicel Cayman that a request for a quotation should have been sent to Nortel before C&amp;W Cayman received Digicel Cayman’s deposit and, similarly, there should have been an earlier request for capital expenditure approval within C&amp;W Cayman. Whether there should have been an earlier request for a quotation from Nortel is debatable. From the documents I have seen, the reason why C&amp;W Cayman waited for the deposit cheque from Digicel Cayman was to have the certainty that interconnection was indeed proceeding with Digicel Cayman. I can see the force of the argument that C&amp;W Cayman should have been convinced of that in any event and that no harm would have been done by asking Nortel to provide a quotation at an earlier date. However, in the event, I do not see that the passage of what may have been only a few days between the time when a quotation could have been requested, and the time when a quotation was actually requested, affected anything subsequently. The order which C&amp;W Cayman ultimately placed on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 was for interconnection equipment excluding a MUX. The relevant request for a quotation was the request which was made following the discovery that C&amp;W Cayman had a spare TN-1C. That request for a quotation could only be made following that discovery on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. As regards the internal request for capital expenditure approval, C&amp;W Cayman was justified in seeking that approval when it was actually sought because, up until that time or around that time, the relevant costs were still being assessed. Further, as with the request for a quotation from Nortel, earlier matters were overtaken by the discovery on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 that there was a spare TN-1C which led to a different request for capital expenditure approval and a different order to Nortel. I have already held that the discovery of the spare TN-1C on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 was unaffected by what C&amp;W Cayman had done or not done in these respects prior to 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. It should be noted that I have so far proceeded on the basis that C&amp;W Cayman placed an order with Nortel on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. There is a separate question which I will discuss in due course as to whether there had been an earlier order on or about 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003.</p>

It is said that these false representations and this non-disclosure amounted to a breach of a duty owed by C&amp;W Cayman to Digicel Cayman under the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations. The allegations which I am considering are those put forward by Digicel Cayman in a Re-Re-Amended pleading in relation to Cayman. I will describe how matters are pleaded and also how matters were put in closing submissions for Digicel Cayman. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The duty which is alleged to be relevant at all times during the period November 2003 to January 2004 is the duty not to refuse, obstruct or in any way impede interconnection. Digicel Cayman relies on section 44(1) of the 2002 Law. Digicel Cayman’s legal submission as to the content of that duty is that section 44(1) obliged C&amp;W Cayman to take positive steps to bring about interconnection, without delay. I have held that section 44(1), properly construed, is a negative obligation not to do anything which would obstruct or impede C&amp;W Cayman in making interconnection between the two networks. However, I have also held that section 44(3) of the 2002 Law does place a positive obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to provide an interconnection service within a reasonable time. C&amp;W Cayman has not taken any pleading point to the effect that Digicel Cayman has relied only on section 44(1) rather than section 44(3). Indeed, C&amp;W Cayman did not itself submit that section 44(1) is restricted to a negative prohibition on obstructing or impeding the making of a interconnection. In these circumstances, I will not dwell on the difference between section 44(1) and section 44(3), nor will I confine Digicel Cayman to a case within section 44(1), that is, a case of C&amp;W Cayman taking positive steps in breach of a negative prohibition in section 44(1). Staying with the question of the duties which Digicel Cayman alleges were broken in relation to the representations or non-disclosure referred to above, Digicel Cayman also alleges that from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2003, when the 2003 regulations came into force C&amp;W Cayman’s conduct was a breach of an obligation not to obstruct or impede interconnection (relying on regulation 4(1)), an obligation to consider requests and provide interconnection and infrastructure sharing in good faith (relying on regulation 6), and an obligation to negotiate interconnection and infrastructure sharing in order to ensure the provision of service throughout the Cayman Islands (relying on regulation 8). Digicel Cayman’s pleading misdescribes the obligation in regulation 4(1) which refers to a licensee obstructing or impeding the making of an “interconnection… arrangement”.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I now consider the way in which Digicel Cayman has pleaded the breach of the obligations relied upon. The first allegation is in relation to a representation made at a meeting or meetings on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. It is said that C&amp;W Cayman represented to Digicel Cayman that C&amp;W Cayman had ordered a TN-1X MUX from Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and that the same was due to arrive in Cayman on or about 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. It is then said that C&amp;W Cayman had not ordered that piece of equipment on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 or at all and did not subsequently order such equipment. Instead it located and used a spare TN-1X already in Cayman. It is then alleged that C&amp;W Cayman concealed the true position in this respect knowing the importance of the matter to Digicel Cayman. It is said that Mr Barnes of C&amp;W Cayman, in particular, concealed the truth because of his concern as to the reaction of Digicel Cayman if it had been told the truth. It is next pleaded that Digicel Cayman was misled by the misinformation, as it relied upon the information as being true and it failed to take steps it would otherwise have taken to progress physical and technical interconnection and make preparations for its own network launch. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel Cayman makes a further set of allegations in relation to certain things that were said in January 2004. It is pleaded that on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004, C&amp;W Cayman informed Digicel Cayman that the equipment needed for C&amp;W Cayman’s side of the interconnection including a TN-1X MUX would not be installed or tested until the parties had signed an interconnection agreement. This was said to involve an implied statement that the TN-1X MUX needed for C&amp;W Cayman’s side of the interconnection had not been installed by 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. It is then alleged that on the true facts that C&amp;W Cayman’s MUX had been installed on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. It is said that this misinformation occurred on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and was repeated or perpetuated by concealment during the following two weeks. When arrangements were made for installation, commissioning and testing following the interim interconnection agreement on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 this was on the mistaken assumption on the part of Digicel Cayman that C&amp;W Cayman’s MUX had yet to be installed. It is then said that Digicel Cayman relied on this information by diverting resources in Cayman away from the completion of its own civil works for the purposes of interconnection and/or refraining from securing additional resources in Cayman to ensure that interconnection and network completion would continue at full pace and/or failing to ensure that a Nortel engineer came to Cayman to install, commission and test both sides equipment prior to 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. It is then pleaded that Digicel Cayman relied upon these matters in January 2004 as a breach by C&amp;W Cayman of its obligation not to obstruct or impede interconnection. By reason of an earlier statement in its pleading, this last averment is, I understand, to be read as a reference to the obligation in section 44(1) of the 2002 law and the obligations in regulation 4(1), regulation 6 and regulation 8 of the 2003 regulations.</p>

Digicel Cayman made clear in its written and its oral closing submissions that it did not seek to put forward the case that C&amp;W Cayman committed the tort of deceit. Digicel Cayman relies upon the 2002 Law and the 2003 regulations and in particular what it says is the obligation in section 44(1) of the 2002 Law that C&amp;W Cayman was not to obstruct or impede the making of an interconnection. Digicel Cayman says that a number of representations were made on behalf of C&amp;W Cayman on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, to the effect that C&amp;W Cayman had ordered a TN1-X MUX on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, which was due to be delivered on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004.

In particular, it is said that Mr Barnes and Mr McNaughton of the carrier services team knew the representations to be false, as did Mr Anderson of C&amp;W Cayman. It is said that Mr Adam, the Chief Executive of C&amp;W Cayman knew that a TN-1X had not been ordered by C&amp;W Cayman although I am not clear whether it is said that Mr Adam knew that Digicel Cayman had been misled. The allegation continues to the affect that C&amp;W Cayman and those acting on its behalf participated in deliberate and coordinated concealment of the relevant facts after 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. It is said that Digicel Cayman was misled by the false statements made to it. The case that Digicel Cayman would have acted differently if it had been given different information on or after 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 is said to be supported by the evidence of Mr Merriman of Digicel Cayman. Digicel Cayman deals separately with the misrepresentation said to have been made in January 2004 that C&amp;W Cayman’s MUX had been installed prior to 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. However, the Claimants make clear in their written closing submissions that any wrong doing by C&amp;W Cayman in mid January 2004 is unlikely to have any independent causative impact in its own right. However, it points to these events as corroboration of its case that there was deliberate misinformation in and after November 2003.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I will now set out my findings of fact in relation to this case of misrepresentation and non-disclosure. At 8:47am, local time, on Friday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Barnes of the carrier services team sent an email to Mr Merriman of Digicel Cayman, attaching a project plan for interconnection in Cayman. The start of the period in the plan was 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and the predicted end date was 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004, just after the date of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2004 referred to in the licence to Digicel Cayman. On a fair reading of the second line of the project plan, the plan contained the statement  that a purchase order had been placed for a TN-1X on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. The third line of the project plan stated that the period from placing the purchase order to the delivery of the TN1-X was eight weeks, although the start of the eight week period was 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and the eight week period ended on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. To reconcile lines two and three, one would have to say that the order was placed on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 i.e. a week late but nonetheless the plan still predicted that the MUX would be delivered in seven weeks, that is, by 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. The project plan then showed later stages in the period up to the completion of interconnection. A number of these stages were timed to occur after 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. This was revealed by a Gantt chart, attached to the project plan, which showed the delivery period for the MUX ending on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and thereafter a number of steps being available to be taken. </p>

I find that the meeting began at or around 9:30 on that day. I also find that either Mr Barnes said to Mr Merriman at this meeting that the C&amp;W Cayman MUX had been ordered on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 or, having given to Mr Merriman a project plan which stated that fact, Mr Barnes did not say anything to contradict what was said in the project plan. There was a later meeting between the parties on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. I do not have a note of the meeting referred to. However, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003, Mr McNaughton sent an email to Miss Agard copied to Mr Ebanks and Mr Barnes which referred to three meetings in the period 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Mr Merriman was not said to be at any of those meetings. Mr Barnes was not described as attending any of those meetings. The persons said to be representing C&amp;W Cayman at the meetings were Mr Ebanks and Mr McNaughton. The email of 2nd December 2003 briefly describes what happened at the three meetings and, in particular, it states that the draft project plan for the ordering and installation of the interconnection equipment service was presented with a ready for service date scheduled for mid-February 2004. It is said that Digicel Cayman expressed disappointment with this timeline and C&amp;W Cayman offered to do what it could to improve the delivery time from Nortel. C&amp;W Cayman reminded Digicel Cayman that pursuant to an earlier agreement for early ordering of equipment, installation would not commence ahead of a signed interconnection agreement. I interpret that as referring back to the arrangements described in C&amp;W Cayman’s letter of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 when C&amp;W Cayman stated that it would order equipment before the parties entered into an interconnection agreement. </p>

I have already held that on a fair reading of the project plan, it contained a statement that C&amp;W Cayman had ordered its TN-1X MUX on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 with an expected delivery date of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. I also find, based on the evidence of the witnesses, that it was probably Mr McNaughton on behalf of C&amp;W Cayman who offered to do what he could to improve the delivery time from Nortel. </p>

This email, as printed states a time of “14:39”. In its closing submissions, C&amp;W Cayman drew attention to some emails in the bundle having a time which was the local time at which the email was sent whilst others had a GMT time, five hours ahead of the local time. If this email stated the GMT time, it should be read as having been sent at the local time of 9:39am. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I did not have specific evidence about this point on the timing of the emails. However, it was put to me that where an email had the word “unknown” at the top, that indicated that it was printed in London and the time was GMT. Conversely, if the email had, instead of the word “unknown”, the name of the originator of the email then that showed the time stated to have been a local time. This explanation is consistent with the many emails in the supplemental bundle prepared for Cayman. For example, Mr Callow sent an email to Mr Seaman of Nortel on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. One copy of this email, where the heading is “Callow, Ian” shows the time 16:03. Another copy of this email, where the heading is “unknown”, has the time “21:03”. The two copies are of an otherwise identical email. The explanation put forward by C&amp;W Cayman is therefore borne out by this pair of copies and by other emails that I have considered. On the balance of probabilities, I hold that the email from Mr Anderson to Mr Merriman of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 was sent at 9:39am local time. </p>

Mr Anderson stated that C&amp;W Cayman had asked Nortel to improve on that and would continue to press for improvements. “The order” as referred to in the email is plainly a reference to an order for the TN-1X. The reference to C&amp;W Cayman pressing Nortel for an improvement on the delivery date is also consistent with what was said at the meeting attended by Mr Ebanks and Mr McNaughton, which I find to have happened later that day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Having identified the relevant statements made on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 by C&amp;W Cayman to Digicel Cayman, it is now necessary to determine whether those statements were factually correct when they were made. The position is disclosed by a number of internal C&amp;W emails in the period 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. By 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, C&amp;W Cayman had prepared a purchase order to be sent to Nortel and that step had been approved for expenditure purposes by C&amp;W Cayman. This purchase order was for equipment needed to effect C&amp;W Cayman’s side of interconnection with both Digicel and another intended entrant into the market. This equipment therefore included two TN-1Xs. At some time on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Barnes prepared his project plan and sent a copy of it to a number of addressees including Mr Anderson, Mr Callow, Mr McNaughton and Mr Ebanks. The time shown on the copy email is 16:14. There is in fact another copy of that email where the time is shown as 12:14pm. It seems to me that the time the email was sent was either 11:14am or 12:14pm. One arrives at 11:14am by subtracting five hours from 16:14, and treating the latter time as GMT. The fact that another copy of the email is timed at 12:14pm is possibly explained by the fact that the clock on the email had not been properly adjusted. In any case, Mr Barnes’ email, referring to his draft project plan, made an assumption that the TN-1X purchase order “goes off to Nortel today (November 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>)”. That indicated that Mr Barnes believed that the purchase order for the MUX was about to be sent to Nortel. Mr Barnes’ email went on to refer to the fact that he had heard that C&amp;W Cayman had an unused “TN-1X chassis available”. What Mr Barnes must have heard appears to be a version of something which became clearer later, which was that C&amp;W Cayman had two TN-1Cs available which could be swapped for two TN-1Xs in use in Cayman. Mr Barnes was not proceeding on the basis that what he called the TN-1X chassis would definitely be used. He was proceeding on the basis that C&amp;W Cayman would order a TN-1X (or in fact two of them) from Nortel and the question of pressing the chassis into service was something that could be looked at in due course. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Barnes followed up this email with a further email on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. The time shown is 23:03; if that was GMT, the email would have been sent at 18:03 local time. The email was sent to Mr Anderson, Mr Callow, Mr McNaughton, Mr Ebanks and others. Mr Barnes refered to having had discussions with three other people at C&amp;W Cayman that afternoon. Mr Barnes said that the purchase order for the TN-1X equipment had been faxed to Nortel “today”. Mr Barnes said he would talk to Mr Seaman (of Nortel) to put some pressure on him to deliver. This email is consistent with Mr Barnes believing that a purchase order for the MUX was sent to Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. Mr Barnes told Mr Anderson, Mr Callow, Mr McNaughton and Mr Ebanks that that was what had happened. </p>

The email was timed 18:58 but as the heading has the name “Callow, Ian”, this does indeed appear to have been sent at 18:58 local time. Mr Callow asked Mr Seaman of Nortel to “put a hold on the MUX order”. This email is consistent with there having been an order to Nortel for, amongst other things, a MUX to be used for interconnection with Digicel. Mr Callow explained to Mr Seaman that it seemed that C&amp;W Cayman was about to make some major changes to the order. This suggests that Mr Callow fully expected the order to be changed but it is also consistent with his email that a decision to that effect had not yet been taken. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In his evidence in chief, Mr Anderson of C&amp;W Cayman stated that he had probably not been consulted by Mr Callow before he sent this holding email to Nortel. On the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Anderson sent to Mr Merriman the email to which I have already referred. The time is given as 14:39 but I proceed on the basis that this was sent at 9:39am local time. As already described, Mr Anderson told Mr Merriman that the order for the MUX had been submitted. The sending of this email is consistent with Mr Anderson’s evidence to me that he had not been consulted by Mr Callow before Mr Callow sent his email to Nortel asking it to put a hold on the MUX order. If I accept Mr Anderson’s evidence, then his email on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 was a genuine attempt to describe the situation to Mr Merriman. If I reject Mr Anderson’s evidence about being consulted by Mr Callow, then it would follow that Mr Anderson had knowingly said something very misleading, if not downright wrong, to Mr Merriman. Having considered the internal communications within C&amp;W which included Mr Anderson and having considered the entirety of Mr Anderson’s evidence I accept that he was not consulted by Mr Callow before Mr Callow sent his email at 18:58 on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. </p>

Mr Barnes asked Mr Callow for further information about the possibility of taking TN-1X s out of service to use them for interconnection with Digicel and the other new entrant. It is plain that Mr Barnes needed to know more at that stage about the proposal. </p>

Mr Callow’s email was copied to Mr Anderson and others. The email refers to order number FO4017. That order number was not explained to me and the fact that the email quotes an order number suggests that an order had been placed with Nortel before the time of this email.</p>

Mr Callow told Mr Barnes that C&amp;W Cayman would be able to recover the MUXs from the existing network. The timescale for this would depend on when C&amp;W Cayman could arrange “outages” with the customers whose MUXs  were being replaced, together with the timescales Nortel had for delivering the mounting kits, needed for the MUXs to be used for interconnection. Mr Callow also referred to the remaining items to be ordered from Nortel as “bits and pieces”. I have another copy of this email from Mr Callow to Mr Barnes this time timed at 5:07pm. Again, a possible explanation is that the clock had not been properly set. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The question which now needs to be addressed is whether C&amp;W Cayman did place an order with Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 for interconnection equipment including two TN-1Xs. No copy of a purchase order has been disclosed by C&amp;W Cayman to Digicel Cayman. However, apart from the missing purchase order, the documents tend to support a finding that an order was placed with Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. It is clear that in the morning of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, it was intended that an order should be placed that day. By 6:03pm on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Barnes told a number of people at C&amp;W Cayman that the purchase order had been faxed to Nortel on that day. When Mr Callow asked Nortel to put a hold on the order, he referred to it as an “order” and not simply a request for a quotation or a proposed order. When Mr Anderson emailed Mr Merriman at 9:39am on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Anderson said that an order had been submitted; however, it is entirely possible he was simply relying on Mr Barnes’ email of 18:03 the previous day. Mr Callow’s email of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to Nortel quotes an order number which is different from the number later used on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. Further, Mr Callow’s email of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 to Nortel refers to C&amp;W Cayman changing “the order”. In addition, there are several later documents passing between C&amp;W Cayman and Nortel which refer to there being two orders in existence from C&amp;W Cayman to Nortel. The orders have the numbers FO4017 and FO4021. The first of these seems likely to have been an order placed on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2002 and the second the order placed on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. It is to be inferred from Mr Callow’s email of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 that the original form of the order FO4017 included an order for the supply of two MUXs.  On all this evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that an order was sent to Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and that order included two TN-1Xs.</p>

An order had been placed for the MUX on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and there is no suggestion that the expected delivery date was different from 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. When Mr Barnes met Mr Merriman at around 9:30am on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Barnes had had some wind of the possibility that it might not be necessary to wait until the TN-1X was delivered in January 2004 but he did not mention that possibility to Mr Merriman. In view of what appears to have been the uncertainty in Mr Barnes’ mind about that possibility, it does not seem to me to be fair to criticise him for not raising it with Mr Merriman. When Mr Anderson sent his email to Mr Merriman at 9:39am on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, Mr Anderson was passing on what he had been told by Mr Barnes the previous evening to the effect that the TN-1X had been ordered. I have already accepted Mr Anderson’s evidence that he had not been told by Mr Callow the previous evening that a hold had been placed on the order. At the meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 which involved Mr Ebanks and Mr McNaughton, the statements they made that the TN-1X had been ordered on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 were consistent with what they had been told by Mr Barnes at the end of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I will consider what the situation would be if I were wrong in my finding that an order had been sent to Nortel on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. In that event, it would follow that the statements made on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, to the effect that such an order had been placed, would also be wrong. For the sake of completeness, in view of the seriousness of the allegation made by Digicel Cayman as to deliberate misleading conduct by C&amp;W Cayman, I will go on to consider what the relevant persons at C&amp;W Cayman believed the position was on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. When Mr Barnes sent his project plan to Mr Merriman on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and met Mr Merriman at around 9:30 that day, I find that Mr Barnes genuinely believed what he told Mr Merriman about the order having been placed and the expected delivery date. When Mr Anderson sent his email at 9:39am on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, I find that Mr Anderson believed what he wrote. When Mr Ebanks and Mr McNaughton attended a meeting with Digicel Cayman on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, I find that they believed that an order had been placed on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The next matter I ought to consider is the allegation of non-disclosure from 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 onwards. It is clear that C&amp;W Cayman did not disclose to Digicel Cayman what happened in the period November 2003 onwards as regards the swapping over of a spare TN-1C MUX for an in-service TN-1X MUX. No-one on behalf of Digicel Cayman was aware of this happening until the matter was put in cross-examination to Mr Merriman on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day of this trial. It is clear that various persons acting on behalf of C&amp;W Cayman became aware at the end of November 2003 or the beginning of December 2003 that the way in which C&amp;W Cayman would obtain the necessary MUX was by means of taking an existing TN-1X out of service rather than by ordering a new MUX from Nortel. Mr Anderson and Mr Barnes accepted that they knew that matter at around that time. Mr McNaughton said that he was not aware of that fact at the time and I accept his evidence. If the case was being put on the basis of the tort of deceit, then it would be relevant to consider whether the failure to correct, on and after 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003, the statement made on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, that a MUX had been ordered and was awaited from Nortel, amounted to a continuing false representation. However, the case is not put on that basis. What is principally said is that the non-disclosure after 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 obstructed or impeded interconnection. As the case is put that way, the principal matter to be considered is whether the non-disclosure had any causative effect on what happened later. </p>

It was put to him that he believed that if he told Mr Merriman, Digicel Cayman would put pressure on C&amp;W Cayman to interconnect more quickly. The Claimants submitted to me in closing submissions that this was indeed the reason why Mr Barnes did not disclose what had happened in relation to the TN-1X. However, Mr Barnes did not agree with that suggestion. His evidence was that he probably did not tell Mr Merriman because he was concerned about his reaction when he realised that C&amp;W Cayman had not actually ordered the equipment but had used equipment already available. The cross-examination did not explore in any more detail precisely what Mr Barnes feared the reaction of Digicel Cayman would be, nor at what point in the history he was concerned in this way. Nor was Mr Barnes further pressed to agree that he feared that Digicel Cayman would be able to bring about interconnection more quickly if it had known that a TN-1X was available, without having to wait on a delivery from Nortel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, it might have been part of Mr Barnes’ thinking that if C&amp;W Cayman told Digicel Cayman that a MUX was available on a different timescale from that shown in the project plan, Digicel Cayman would require a different project plan and possibly a faster progress to interconnection. It is possible that Mr Barnes wanted to avoid assisting Digicel Cayman. But it is also possible that Mr Barnes did not have any particular wish to delay Digicel Cayman. At the beginning of December 2003, Mr Barnes may have wanted to wait and see how matters transpired with the re-use of an existing TN-1X. It is also the case that in December 2003 and January 2004, Mr Barnes seems to have had comparatively little contact with C&amp;W Cayman and he was busy in dealing with interconnection in Barbados. As the weeks went by and C&amp;W Cayman had continued to fail to tell Digicel Cayman of the source of the TN-1X, it might have seemed to Mr Barnes that it would be embarrassing to have to disclose that C&amp;W Cayman had not after all ordered the MUX but had one already available. I can see that it would have been embarrassing to reveal this some time after the event and in that sense Mr Barnes would have been concerned about the reaction of Digicel Cayman. This possibility is consistent with the evidence Mr Barnes gave although, as I have said, the matter was not really investigated. I found Mr Barnes to be a helpful and generally reliable witness. I can also add that I found that the internal C&amp;W documents in relation to Cayman did not support the suggestions made to me by the Claimants that C&amp;W Cayman was guilty of deliberately misleading Digicel Cayman with a view to delaying interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Anderson accepted that he knew what was happening about the TN-1X MUX, but he left it to carrier services to tell Digicel Cayman. I do not regard that as a satisfactory answer. Mr Anderson knew that Mr Merriman was particularly keen to have as much information as possible about the expected delivery times for C&amp;W Cayman’s equipment. It is difficult to be sure why Mr Anderson did not tell Digicel Cayman about the TN-1X. There may have been some adversarial spirit on Mr Anderson’s part so that he saw no reason to tell Digicel Cayman things which he did not have to reveal. It is possible that he withheld the information about the TN-1X not being ordered from Nortel for similar reasons to those given by Mr Barnes, as described above.</p>

When the order to Nortel for TN-1X MUXs was cancelled, it was envisaged that C&amp;W Cayman would remove two existing TN-1X MUXs from its existing network. It had been predicted on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 that the timescale for the removal of the existing MUXs would depend on when C&amp;W Cayman could arrange “outages” with the customers whose MUXs were being replaced. The outages had originally been planned for the weekend of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003 but had to be rescheduled and the removal of the existing TN-1X MUXs occurred on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003. </p>

This seems to be a reference to the TN-1X MUX having been “installed” for the purpose of the interconnection with Digicel. The evidence was not very precise as to how much work of installation had been done by the date of this email. There were references in the evidence to the TN-1X MUX having been placed on a rack and having been “bolted down” and having been plugged into a power source. C&amp;W Cayman submitted that more needed to be done before one could describe a MUX as having been “installed”. I was not given any evidence as to installation beyond that described above. I was also told that C&amp;W Cayman installed some further equipment, ordered from Ericsson, needed to upgrade its switch. This work was done in mid-January 2004. </p>

I have already held that C&amp;W Cayman was not under an obligation to install and test the equipment needed for its side of the interconnection until the parties had agreed an interconnection agreement. Accordingly, C&amp;W Cayman was not in breach of duty by insisting upon the parties entering into an interconnection agreement which provided for the testing to be done and then implementing that agreement by carrying out the testing.

There was some, albeit limited, evidence on that subject. It is necessary to explain how this allegation of non-disclosure by C&amp;W Cayman came into the case. At all times in 2003 and 2004 and indeed until C&amp;W Cayman served its Re-Amended Defence during the trial, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2009, Digicel Cayman (basing itself on the project plan prepared by Mr Barnes) believed that C&amp;W Cayman ordered the TN-1X MUX on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 and that it was delivered to Cayman on or about 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. Mr Merriman’s witness statement referred to these events as if they were matters of fact. When Mr Merriman was cross-examined on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day of the trial, 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2009, it was explained to Mr Merriman that his facts were wrong because C&amp;W Cayman had cancelled the order, or the intended order, to Nortel as it had found it had two TN-1X MUXs which it could recover from its existing network to be used to interconnect with Digicel and another entrant. As I have explained, the facts put to Mr Merriman in cross-examination were correct, but they came as a complete revelation to Mr Merriman. He appears only to have realised the true position at that point even though the matter had been pleaded by C&amp;W Cayman in its amended Defence a few days before he gave evidence. In the course of Mr Merriman’s cross-examination and re-examination, he referred in different ways to the significance to him of the new revelation. In considering his evidence, I must take into account the fact that Mr Merriman had not heard of the new revelation until it was put to him in cross-examination and he had no real opportunity to reflect on the position before he answered questions in cross-examination and, indeed, in re-examination on the same day. Further, it was plain that Mr Merriman was shocked by the discovery that C&amp;W Cayman did not tell him at the time in December 2003 and January 2004 of what had really happened. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Merriman’s first response in cross-examination, at page 95 of the transcript for day 20, was that it was irrelevant to him whether C&amp;W Cayman ordered a TN-1X, or did not order one, so long as they had one ready for service in line with Digicel Cayman’s requirements. It was put to him that his concern was that there was a MUX available and that it worked. He agreed with that suggestion. He stated that the difference between a MUX being ordered or a MUX lying in a warehouse somewhere in Cayman was irrelevant to him so long as C&amp;W Cayman had its MUX in line sometime around the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 to start the work. It was then put to him that the difference between ordering a MUX and re-using a MUX was irrelevant and he agreed but he then added that if he had known that C&amp;W Cayman had a MUX earlier “the whole thing could have moved along a lot faster”. Mr Merriman was re-examined about the project plans sent to him on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. He said that if he had been told that C&amp;W Cayman had discovered two MUXs lying in a warehouse somewhere he would have done everything possible to ensure that Digicel Cayman would have a MUX in place in the first week in January 2004. I note that Mr Merriman referred to a TN-1X MUX being available in a warehouse in Cayman. That was not exactly the situation. A TN-1X MUX would have to be taken out of service and replaced with a TN-1C MUX, at a convenient time to the customer whose service depended on that MUX.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The first reason put forward by Digicel Cayman is that if it had been notified of the amount of the equipment deposit on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 (rather than 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003) then it would have ordered its equipment on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 (rather than 13th November 2003). I have already held that C&amp;W Cayman were in not of breach of duty by notifying the amount of the deposit on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. It follows that I do not accept that Digicel Cayman would have ordered its equipment earlier than 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003. In any event, non-disclosure beginning on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 can not have affected the events earlier in November 2003. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason put forward by Digicel Cayman for changing the date when the Digicel equipment became available for interconnection is that Digicel Cayman submitted that if it had known that C&amp;W Cayman could recover a TN-1X MUX from its existing network then Digicel Cayman would have pressed Nortel to deliver a TN-1X MUX to Digicel for its side of the interconnection at an earlier date. I can see the possibility that Digicel Cayman might have pressed Nortel to deliver earlier. Whether Digicel Cayman would or would not have done that would depend on some extent on all the many other things which Digicel Cayman had to do to launch its network. Even if Digicel Cayman had pressed Nortel to bring forward the delivery date of the equipment ordered by Digicel, I have no evidence on which I could make a finding as to what would have happened. I have no material on which I can judge whether Nortel could have brought forward the delivery date and whether they would have done so. Given that the bringing forward of the delivery date was not under the control of Digicel Cayman or C&amp;W Cayman for that matter but was under the control of a third party, Nortel, Digicel Cayman’s case that Nortel might have brought forward the delivery date must be a case that Digicel Cayman lost a chance of the delivery date being brought forward. However, on the evidence, whether such a chance existed is a matter of pure speculation and I am not able to find that Digicel Cayman did lose any worthwhile chance of that kind. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel Cayman also has the difficulty that the other equipment which C&amp;W Cayman did order from Nortel did not arrive until around 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. Digicel Cayman’s counterfactual is based upon this equipment arriving not later than 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003. Digicel Cayman did not call any evidence which would allow me to find that the equipment could have arrived earlier. Mr Anderson of C&amp;W Cayman was cross-examined about different sources for some of the equipment. If C&amp;W Cayman had explored different sources, that would have involved it cancelling the order with Nortel at some point and trying to find an alternative supplier. Mr Anderson did not in fact accept any of these suggestions put to him in cross-examination. Further, the suggestions were general ones and not of a specific character which would enable me to identify a timescale different from that which actually occurred. Whilst I can see that difficulties arose with the delivery of the equipment from Nortel and those difficulties caused delay so that the overall time for delivery was longer than it should have been, I am not able to make a finding that C&amp;W Cayman was under an obligation to take some other course to secure the delivery of that equipment at an earlier date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel Cayman also says that the civil works should have been completed earlier than they were. C&amp;W Cayman completed its part of the civil works on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2004 and Digicel Cayman completed its part on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. So far as the part of the works carried out by C&amp;W Cayman is concerned, it should be remembered that C&amp;W Cayman was not under an obligation to carry out these works in advance of the parties entering into an interconnection agreement. On that basis, C&amp;W Cayman did the works voluntarily and not under an obligation. Further, there is no allegation that C&amp;W Cayman delayed the carrying out of the works. There was a particular difficulty, referred to in the evidence, about the provision of manhole covers which caused delay in the completion of the civil works. In its submissions, Digicel Cayman was dismissive of the significance of the missing manhole covers and suggested that the problem could and should have been solved by laying a metal sheet over the relevant hole in the ground. Digicel Cayman did not itself give evidence to enable me to make that finding and when the matter was put to Mr Anderson, he did not agree that that was an appropriate thing to do. In my judgment, I ought not to substitute a counterfactual for completion of the C&amp;W side of the civil works substituting a different date for the actual date of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2004. As regards the Digicel Cayman part of the civil works, Mr Merriman stated that he would have sent round a mechanical digger to complete the works in next to no time. I am prepared to accept if that item had been the only thing outstanding in the way of completing interconnection, Mr Merriman would have been able to get the outstanding work done in a short period, somewhat less than the seven days it actually took. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">My conclusion, based on the evidence with which I was provided, is that Digicel Cayman has not demonstrated that the non-disclosure of which it complains caused any delay to the completion of interconnection. I have borne in mind in considering the evidence that Digicel Cayman came to court at the beginning of the trial wholly unaware of the true facts as to where C&amp;W Cayman obtained the TN-1X. Those facts were only revealed in the Re-Amended Defence on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2009 and were only highlighted when Mr Merriman was cross-examined on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day of the trial (9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2009). It is therefore not surprising that Digicel Cayman had not thought through the evidence which it would need if it were to show that the non-disclosure of which it complained had caused delay to the completion of interconnection. As against that, C&amp;W Cayman amended its Defence in relation to Cayman to plead the real facts about the source of the TN-1X and Digicel Cayman amended its pleading to allege a false representation and non-disclosure. There were, altogether, some 77 days of court hearing. The trial was adjourned over the long vacation and concluded on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2009. Digicel Cayman did not apply at any stage to recall Mr Merriman or to call other witnesses on the question as to the effect of the non-disclosure. In these circumstances, I am obliged to make my findings of fact based on the evidence I have and that is what I have now done. </p>

Digicel Cayman say that this was a deliberately misleading statement given that installation had commenced by 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. However, Digicel Cayman accepts that statements in January 2004 about whether installation had or had not commenced had no consequence so far as the timetable for completing interconnection was concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I wish to add one further comment in relation to the case against C&amp;W Cayman that it did not disclose the true facts about the source of the TN-1X from 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003 onwards. The effect of regulation 6(a) of the 2003 regulations was C&amp;W Cayman had an obligation to negotiate an interconnection agreement in good faith. Those regulations came into effect on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2003 but the relevant non-disclosure continued during the period after the regulations took effect. It has occurred to me that it could be argued that the non-disclosure, which I have found in this case, was a breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith. Even if C&amp;W Cayman had thought that the source of the TN-1X would not matter to Digicel Cayman, it could be argued that C&amp;W Cayman should have told Digicel Cayman to allow Digicel Cayman to decide what to do in response. Indeed, Mr Barnes’ explanation for his non-disclosure was that, at some stage, he was concerned about the reaction from Digicel Cayman. Having made those remarks, I will not make any finding one way or the other as to whether there was breach of regulation 6(a) by reason of the non-disclosure. It is not wholly clear from Digicel Cayman’s pleading whether such an allegation was there put forward; the pleading does refer to regulation 6(a) but in a way which suggests it only relates to the non-disclosure in January 2004 and not the non-disclosure from 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2003. More importantly, the Claimants did not put forward any such case in their closing submissions. The parties agreed with the court that in their closing submissions, they would identify every finding which they invited the court to make. The Claimants have not invited the court to find that there was a breach of regulation 6(a) by reason of the non-disclosure. A breach of the regulations is a criminal offence: see regulation 30. C&amp;W Cayman has not put forward its submissions as to why I should hold that it did not break regulation 6(a). Finally, even if there were a breach of regulation 6(a) no loss has resulted. Even if a breach of regulation 6(a), being a criminal offence, would constitute unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy, no such tort was committed because no loss resulted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have now dealt with all of the complaints made by Digicel Cayman about the progress of physical interconnection in Cayman. Digicel Cayman makes two other complaints, both of which relate to the progress of contractual interconnection in Cayman. The first complaint about contractual interconnection is that C&amp;W Cayman delayed the provision of draft documents to be used to negotiate the interconnection agreement and, in particular, delayed the production of C&amp;W Cayman’s tariff schedule. The second allegation concerns the approach which C&amp;W Cayman adopted to the negotiation of the rates payable for interconnection in Cayman. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Before considering the detail of these allegations, I ought to consider whether it is possible that these allegations, if sustained, would lead to the conclusion that interconnection was delayed in Cayman. In their closing written submissions, the Claimants say that it is not necessary for them to establish any causative, let alone actionable, delay to the conclusion of the interconnection agreement. The principal reason given for this is that the parties entered into an interim interconnection agreement on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and the earliest date on which Digicel Cayman was entitled to launch its service was 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2004. However, the Claimants point out in their written submissions that if I should find that there was no obligation on C&amp;W Cayman to install (or complete the installation of) its equipment before entering into an interconnection agreement and no obligation to test interconnection before such an agreement, then the Claimants would wish to argue that the alleged breaches by C&amp;W Cayman in relation to contractual interconnection did hold up the time when an interconnection agreement was reached. The Claimants contend that an interconnection agreement ought to have been reached sometime in mid/late December 2003. Thus, it might be necessary to consider these allegations as to contractual interconnection if I held that the delay in reaching an interconnection agreement resulted in a delay in completing installation of C&amp;W Cayman’s equipment and delay in testing the interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already made findings as to the state of play in relation to a number of features of the interconnection in January 2004. I have made findings about the dates when the C&amp;W Cayman equipment was ready to be installed and/or was installed, when the Digicel Cayman equipment was ready to be installed and when the civil works were completed. Unless I substituted a different date for completion of the Digicel Cayman civil works on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 or accepted that it ought to have been possible to do some tests, but not all tests, on interconnection before the civil works were completed, it would not seem to matter that the interconnection agreement was entered into on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004, rather than an earlier date. Further, since I have held that I ought not to substitute a counterfactual date for the actual dates in relation to the availability of the Digicel Cayman interconnection equipment and the C&amp;W interconnection equipment, there is really no prospect of testing having begun before mid January 2004. As it happens, on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004, the parties had reached a provisional agreement on the rates payable, save for the rate to be later settled by the regulator. Accordingly, even if C&amp;W Cayman had been in breach of its obligation at an earlier point in time in relation to the way in which it conducted negotiations as to rates, any such breach was spent by 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004. Indeed, part of the explanation for the passage of time between 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 was that Digicel Cayman sought to renegotiate rates which had been provisionally agreed on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 and that attempt ultimately was unsuccessful. </p>

In particular, this is demonstrated by the fact that on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003, Mr Adam of C&amp;W Cayman wrote to Mr Buckley of Digicel Cayman explaining the reasons for C&amp;W Cayman’s stance in relation to rates and further stating that he encouraged the two teams of negotiators to continue to meet to resolve the outstanding questions. Mr Buckley did not reply to that letter until 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003 when he described the previous situation as one where the interconnection negotiations had stalled and that agreement could not be reached without outside intervention. On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003, Mr Buckley suggested that the agreement which had been reached in Barbados around that time meant that it was worth the parties trying again to negotiate the rates payable in Cayman and negotiations resumed in January 2004. My conclusion therefore is that even if Digicel Cayman could demonstrate a breach by C&amp;W Cayman in relation to the progress of contractual interconnection, any such breach would have no causative effect on the time at which interconnection ultimately occurred. In these circumstances, although I will consider the two matters alleged by Digicel Cayman, I will do so more briefly than might otherwise have been appropriate.</p>

On the same day, Digicel Cayman requested interconnection from C&amp;W Cayman. Under section 44(3) of the 2002 Law, C&amp;W Cayman was obliged to respond to this request within a period of one month from the date of the request and to provide an interconnection service in a reasonable time. In my judgment, C&amp;W Cayman would not be in breach of section 44(3) nor section 44(1) (containing a negative obligation not to obstruct or impede interconnection) if it took one month to respond to the request for interconnection. In fact, C&amp;W Cayman responded more quickly than the one month permitted by the statute. C&amp;W Cayman sent the legal framework agreement to Digicel Cayman on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. It sent all the other parts of the draft interconnection agreement (bar the tariff schedule) to Digicel Cayman on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003. It sent the tariff schedule on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2003. On the evidence, I am not persuaded that C&amp;W Cayman delayed the time at which it delivered these documents to Digicel Cayman and, as I have said, they were all served within the statutory time limit.

In my judgment, the fact that the rates in the different countries differed is not particularly surprising and certainly is no foundation for a finding that the rates quoted in Cayman were impermissible in Cayman. Similarly, the fact that parties started with a negotiating position and ended up with a different agreed position is not surprising and is no foundation for a finding that the original position was impermissible.

Finally, as stated above any criticism that could be made of C&amp;W Cayman in the period up to 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 was spent by that date and the equipment needed for interconnection was not ready for testing by that date so that any criticism applicable before 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 did not have an impact on the date on which interconnection was tested and became available for use. </p>

In these circumstances, for similar reasons to those given in SLU, I will not deal with the wholly separate question, hotly disputed between the parties, as to whether any delay in achieving interconnection caused a delay to the date when Digicel Cayman was ready to launch its service in Cayman. An investigation of those matters is in my judgment unnecessary and not a proportionate use of time.</p>

Thus, TSTT was not entitled to take the line which the C&amp;W companies had taken in other jurisdictions that it would not negotiate an interconnection agreement with a new entrant until the new entrant had obtained its concession.

The 2001 Act came into force piecemeal. Section 85 of the 2001 Act dealt with repeal of earlier legislation and transitional provisions; this section came into force on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2004. The precise point at which liberalisation would happen was not clear in 2004 and 2005. Eventually, on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2005, the relevant minister in T&amp;T wrote to TSTT clarifying the position. The letter stated that in accordance with section 85(9) of the 2001 Act, the period within which all the rights and obligations, afforded to TSTT under the Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Act, remained in force was extended to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005, “or until such time as a concession is granted to TSTT, whichever is earlier”. The letter went on to provide that in accordance with section 85(3) of the 2001 Act, the period for which licences issued under the Wireless Telegraphy Ordinance remained in force was extended to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005. The first part of this letter dealt with domestic telephone services in T&amp;T; the second part of the letter dealt with the provision of international telephone services. As regards domestic telephone services the letter did not guarantee that TSTT would enjoy exclusive rights until 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005. It was possible that in the period between 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2005 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005, the relevant minister might grant a concession to TSTT under the 2001 Act. The concession would be a non-exclusive right to provide telecommunication services and the earlier exclusive right would come to an end. In fact, the concession to TSTT was granted on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005.

However, it is relevant to know what rights and obligations, if any, in relation to interconnection, TSTT had under the 2001 Act and its concession of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005. </p>

The absence of obligations arising in other ways does not automatically mean that TSTT was free from any obligation under section 4 of PAUCA. However, there is considerable force in the point made by TSTT that when one considers what it did and failed to do, in particular in the period up to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005, and when one considers whether TSTT then acted contrary to honest practices, one has to assess that question against a background where TSTT was not under a legal obligation in relation to interconnection but was, as will be seen, reacting to considerable pressure placed upon it to take action to assist Digicel T&amp;T and where the taking of that action was something that TSTT would not otherwise have done on a voluntary basis. I also note in passing that when I consider whether TSTT acted contrary to honest practices in putting forward a project timetable in the period prior to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005, to the extent that section 4 of PAUCA restricted TSTT’s freedom of action, section 4 of PAUCA also applied to Digicel T&amp;T who also had put forward a timetable for interconnection and who regularly communicated with the government and the regulator putting forward its point of view as to what should be done. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Espinal, the CEO of TSTT, stated that he was appointed in October 2004 because of the imminent liberalisation of the telecommunications market in T&amp;T. His remit was to prepare TSTT for liberalisation. Before his arrival, TSTT was publicly perceived as a poorly run, out of date, government controlled and a government run organisation. TSTT was strongly under the control of the trade unions, who would frequently take action to disrupt the telecommunications service. Service levels were poor and prices were high. TSTT had a confused and over-manned organisational structure with a lack of clear reporting lines and accountability. Mr Espinal thought that the company was wholly unprepared for liberalisation. When he arrived as CEO, Mr Espinal thought that the employees of TSTT did not have the skills and experience necessary to deal with liberalisation. For this reason, he obtained the services of Miss Agard. Miss Agard agreed with Mr Espinal’s assessment. She referred to TSTT having the inefficiencies and problems usually associated with an historic state owned monopoly company with powerful unions. She said that TSTT needed time to prepare itself for competition. It was conducting a massive upgrade to its network and launched a new mobile brand, bMobile, in November 2005. Mr Barnes also commented that in 2005, TSTT was not well placed to face competition. TSTT needed to improve its position in a number of respects to enable it to compete effectively against a new entrant such as Digicel T&amp;T. It needed to overhaul its internal arrangements and procedures. It needed to deal with issues as to trade unions and numbers of employees. It needed to improve the public’s perception of it. More technically, it needed, or at least wished, to upgrade its fixed network, in particular by adding a next generation network (“NGN”). Further, it wished to improve significantly its mobile network. Its plans involved expanding the number of cell sites to increase coverage. It wished to add further mobile switches, using GSM technology. One of these switches was planned to be installed and operational in November 2005 and the other by the end of March 2006. This date became a significant date, as will appear. In terms of marketing its services, TSTT wished to increase the number of mobile subscribers before facing competition with a new entrant.</p>

The Claimants say that TSTT’s project timetable was deliberately exaggerated to show a period longer than was necessary. TSTT is criticised because, having allegedly exaggerated the timetable, it pretended that the timetable was reasonable. Further, TSTT is criticised because it said to the government and to the regulator that it would try to achieve physical interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T expeditiously, although it had no real intention of doing so, and the preparation of the project timetable was part of its attempt to slow things down, rather than speed them up. It is said that TSTT had no desire to co-operate in a speedy process towards interconnection, but it wanted to give the appearance of doing so. The Claimants say that the combination of these matters amounted to TSTT acting contrary to honest practices. The Claimants say that TSTT’s behaviour was dishonest or, at any rate, was sufficiently reprehensible to be a breach of section 4 of PAUCA. </p>

Digicel T&amp;T’s note of this meeting assesses whether the regulator would be likely to apply pressure on TSTT to take steps towards interconnection. At that meeting, the regulator did exert pressure on TSTT to fix another meeting with Digicel T&amp;T and Laqtel. TSTT met Digicel T&amp;T and Laqtel on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005. At this meeting, TSTT tried to avoid committing itself to starting the process of interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr McNaughton asked Mr Barnes to comment on the technical part of the timetable which had been provided by Digicel T&amp;T. On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005, Mr Barnes gave his comments. He suggested that the timescale for technical interconnection was “completely unrealistic”. He then referred to a number of technical matters. He referred to the need to have an upgrade to the trunking capacity on the TSTT NGN. He said he could guarantee that the switching/transmission equipment could not be in place on the TSTT network and commissioned before the end of October 2005, at the very earliest. He thought one was dealing with a completion date of the second week of November, at the earliest. He said that a quote from Nortel for the necessary equipment would take at least two weeks to complete and it was more likely that it would take four weeks to complete. The ready for service date could not be any earlier than early December. He regarded the fact that TSTT was installing and commissioning the NGN as further complicating the issue. He thought it would be difficult to manage a change of the scope involved in the Digicel interconnection “without major problems”. He said that the standard implementation schedule for other interconnection projects, about 20-24 weeks from the request for a quote to a ready for service date, would be appropriate. </p>

He made the comment that TSTT could well benefit from the time needed to sort out regulatory matters to get its house in order “on the interconnect front among others”. Mr McNaughton said TSTT needed time to sort out how it was to deal with interconnection. In their closing submissions, the Claimants contended that TSTT did not have a need to sort out its procedures in relation to interconnection. Based on a large number of internal TSTT documents, which I need not list, it is clear that TSTT did need time to resolve issues as to its approach to interconnection. For example, there was a difference of opinion between the CWWI and the TSTT personnel as to the form of any interconnection agreement. However, whilst time may have been needed in that respect, I accept the Claimants’ general point that TSTT wished to have time to make progress on a large number of other fronts, which I have already described, before it found itself in effective competition with Digicel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In early September 2005, Mr Barnes met various technical people in TSTT. In his witness statement he referred to meeting “the relevant people”, including Mr Legall. He said that they worked on producing an indicative timeline for interconnection. He described this timeline as their reasonable estimate as to how long it would take to complete physical interconnection. He referred to an email of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 to Miss Agard and Mr Espinal. He thought there was some scope for improvement in the timeline but he did not see that it could be reduced to much less than 40 weeks in total. One reason for this was that the task of conducting interconnection in T&amp;T was of a different order of magnitude to the interconnections that he had conducted in other jurisdictions. In particular, there was a need for significant expansion of the capacity of the network to accommodate the traffic of new entrants and this was complicated by the fact that TSTT was conducting its upgrade to the NGN. Mr Barnes was cross-examined in great detail about the meeting he had with the technical people in TSTT at this stage. I will refer in due course to the timeline which they produced. He gave the names of other technical people in TSTT whom he had met. He stated that he met a Mr Perai at a time which was later than his meeting with the heads of department. The revised timetable was worked out at the meeting with the heads of department. He met them for a period of 3 or 4 hours in one day. He conducted a question and answer session trying to build an idea of what logistical challenges there might have been in T&amp;T. He adjusted his timetable based on input from the heads of department. It did not necessarily reflect his own views. The resulting timetable identified a period to interconnection of 49.2 weeks. He was surprised at how long this period was. He thought that the personnel in TSTT did not work as efficiently as C&amp;W companies did. The period was based on historical benchmarks TSTT used to assess the length of a project. He challenged their assertions but they were firm in insisting that the timeframes were realistic. The new timetable included an item for an evaluation exercise of the existing network. Periods of 4 to 6 weeks or 6 weeks were stated. The heads of department felt strongly that they needed time to assess the impact on their network of Digicel T&amp;T’s and Laqtel’s traffic expectations. Although the heads of department thought this time was vital, Mr Barnes did not himself share that view. He also thought that if this work was needed it could be done in parallel with other activities rather than being a pre-condition to other steps being taken. He was asked about various other periods in the resulting timeline and agreed that they did not all accord with his own independent view. He was asked about the stages in the timeline dealing with the internal process in TSTT authorising capital expenditure. Mr Barnes said that the heads of department insisted that these steps were necessary as part of TSTT’s internal governance. </p>

This timetable showed  a period of 49.2 weeks. An accompanying explanatory note was based on the original timeline prepared by Mr Barnes which showed 25 weeks but had not had been significantly amended. The second item in the new timeline referred to an evaluation being carried out to the TSTT network to assess the demands being made of that network upon interconnection. This was estimated to take 4 to 6 weeks in the text and it was shown in an accompanying Gantt chart as taking 6 weeks. I will not itemise all of the changes from the original 25 weeks, to arrive at a total of 49.2 weeks, but I will refer to some of the more important ones. The timetable provided for a business case development, followed by business case approval and then for something called a “tender process”. This contemplated that, following approval of a business case, there would be an internal tender process in relation to all equipment, materials and services required from external vendors. This tender process was to take 6 weeks. The delivery time for equipment from Nortel was given as 16 weeks, including clearance of customs. </p>

He compared the timetable with the time taken, for example, in Barbados and Cayman. He suggested that one reason for the lengthy timetable in TSTT was the total time taken to approve capital expenditure. He suggested that if this part of the timetable could be reduced then the plan might become more palatable for the regulator. He also suggested other ways in which the time could be reduced but he did not think that it could be reduced to much less than 40 weeks even if the capital approval process was fast tracked. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005, Mr Espinal considered the draft timetable of 49.2 weeks. He emailed Miss Agard, Mr Morris and Mr Barnes amongst others, making two observations. The first was that he wished to link the schedule of events with the grant of concessions by the government of T&amp;T. He said this was because TSTT needed to enter into commitments in order to order some equipment. He then said: “the overall completion of interconnection should be completed sometime at the end of March 2006 or 3 months after signing the interconnection agreements (right after the issuance of Concessions), whichever occurs last…” . Mr Espinal’s second comment referred to the point of interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a detailed investigation at the trial of what had led Mr Espinal to refer to completion of interconnection “at the end of March 2006”. Mr Espinal explained that he arrived at the date of end of March 2006 by assuming that concessions were granted at the end of December 2005, that interconnection agreements were immediately entered into and it took 3 months to interconnect pursuant to those agreements. Three months is about 17 or 18 weeks. That would seem to involve equipment being ordered soon after the parties had entered into an interconnection agreement. Mr Espinal must therefore have been contemplating that the earlier stages of the project timetable would take place before the parties obtained concessions and had signed an interconnection agreement. It was pointed out to Mr Espinal that his email referred to completion of interconnection at the end of March 2006, or 3 months after an interconnection agreement, whichever was the later. It was also said that if a concession were granted long before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005 and an interconnection agreement entered into before that date, and if interconnection only took 3 months thereafter, a reference to interconnection being completed at the end of March 2006, which would therefore be the later date, showed a desire to hold up interconnection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I find that Mr Espinal did try to assess the date at which interconnection might take place in T&amp;T. It is clear from his own evidence and the background matters to which I have referred, that Mr Espinal did not want interconnection to take place as soon as possible. The idea of only ordering equipment following the signature of an interconnection agreement suggests that Mr Espinal wanted to put back the date for interconnection, rather than achieve the earliest possible date. I find that one reason why Mr Espinal mentioned the date of the end of March 2006 was that he assessed that concessions were unlikely until late 2005 and if concessions were followed by an interconnection agreement and then followed by the ordering  and installation of equipment, the end of March 2006 was a realistic date for completion of interconnection. The reason he referred to a possible later date was that if interconnection agreements were not entered into at the end of 2005, then completion of interconnection could be later than the end of March 2006. I also find that Mr Espinal regarded as unlikely the idea that there would be concessions before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005 coupled with interconnection agreements before the end of 2005 leading to interconnection much before end March 2006. It was put to Mr Espinal that the date of end March 2006 was exclusively connected with the date for completion of phase 2 of the NGN works. It was also put to Mr Espinal that he was determined to hold up completion of interconnection, come what may, until the end of March 2006. In my judgment, it is likely that Mr Espinal thought about the stage which TSTT would have reached in relation to the NGN, and probably other matters which were underway, so as to assess the impact on TSTT of interconnection at the end of March 2006. However, I do not find that the completion of phase 2 of the NGN work was the principal driver which led to Mr Espinal referring to the end of March 2006 in his email. </p>

The new timetable included a Gantt chart which showed a period of 32.6 weeks.  Many of the individual periods in the timetable of 49.2 weeks had been changed to produce the new period of 33 weeks, or so.  The requirement that there be a period for evaluation of the TSTT network, and that this work be done before the later stages in the timetable were progressed, was maintained in the new timetable, although the period of 4 to 6 weeks was changed to 3 weeks.  The 33 week timetable included stages for the development of a business case, the approval of that business case followed by a tender process.  The time for these three stages was 6 weeks and the tender process was to take 4 of those 6 weeks.  The time for delivery of the equipment ordered from Nortel, or other relevant vendors, was 16 weeks.  The timetable showed the interconnection being ready for service on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Barnes referred to this meeting with Mr Espinal and Miss Agard in his witness statement.  He said that a period of 33 weeks was “our” best realistic estimate at the time.  The period had been reduced as far as was thought to be possible.  Mr Barnes was cross-examined in detail about this evidence.  It was put to Mr Barnes that the persons at the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 went through the timetable to end up with a ready for service date later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Mr Barnes agreed that this “was [Mr Espinal’s] stated objective”.  He also agreed that the period in the timetable was to be one which could be defended in front of the regulator.  He agreed that completion in late April 2006 was in line with Mr Espinal’s expectations.  Mr Barnes agreed there were no other technical experts at the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005.  He said that the changes were principally at the suggestion of Mr Espinal.  Mr Barnes agreed that the evaluation of the existing network was in his view unnecessary.  Mr Barnes was not fully conversant with the procedures within TSTT as to tendering works.  It was put to Mr Barnes that a 33 week period was longer than he would have expected to see.  He replied that because of the added complexity of the work in relation to the NGN, it would be reasonable to expect a period longer that the standard 20 to 25 weeks.  He did not agree that 33 weeks was “ridiculous”.  He said that the persons at the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 did not choose a date and work backwards from that date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Espinal was cross-examined about his reaction to the timetable showing 49.2 weeks and about the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005.  Mr Espinal thought a timetable of 49.2 weeks was absurd.  He knew the government and the regulator would not agree such a timetable.  Mr Espinal gave detailed evidence that he discussed the timetable with Mr Perai before he had a meeting with Miss Agard and Mr Barnes on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005.  This evidence is neither corroborated nor contradicted by the documents.  The Claimants made a sustained attack on Mr Espinal and asked me to disbelieve this evidence.  It is not necessary for me to make a finding on this point and I do not do so.  Mr Espinal decided at the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 to direct reductions in the periods of time used in the project plan.  Whether the period of 49.2 weeks was supported by TSTT’s technical advisors, or not, it was clear to Mr Espinal that that period would be politically unacceptable and he made reductions.  It was suggested to him that these reductions were wholly arbitrary.  Mr Espinal replied that he had negotiated the reductions with Mr Perai.  In my judgment, whether or not Mr Espinal discussed the 49 week period with Mr Perai, Mr Espinal’s principal reason for reducing the 49 week period to a 33 week period was that he could see that a 49 week period would be politically unacceptable and counter-productive for TSTT and, somehow or other, he had to produce a reduced period.  To that extent, the process had an element of arbitrariness in it.  It might be said that the process was entirely pragmatic to deal with the pressure on TSTT from the government and the regulator.  </p>

Mr Barnes told Mr Espinal at the meeting on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 that he did not support that item in the plan.  It was said that Mr Barnes “complained about the item”.  Mr Espinal said he was not now clear what precisely Mr Barnes had said.  Mr Espinal said that he believed an evaluation was a proper requirement.  He gave evidence of difficulties with the TSTT network leading to him being very concerned about the addition of extra traffic on the network.  He said this view was shared by the technical team in TSTT.  He did not think the evaluation could be done in parallel with other stages in the process.  He said TSTT needed to complete the evaluation to know what equipment to order.  The decision to change the periods for the business case development and approval were made by Mr Espinal.  He explained why a tender process was necessary.  He referred to a requirement from the Minister of Finance that TSTT had to tender every purchase in excess of T&amp;T $160,000.  The government imposed this regulation for reasons of transparency and to avoid fraud or malpractice.  </p>

Digicel T&amp;T sent the forecast in order to assist with expediting the process of interconnection.  </p>

Nonetheless, it is useful at this point to summarise how matters developed later in respect of a number of the stages in the project timetable.  TSTT did carry out an evaluation of its network.  TSTT did request a quote for equipment to be provided by Nortel.  TSTT did approve expenditure on that equipment and the equipment was ordered.  TSTT waived the requirement for a tender process.  </p>

Digicel T&amp;T’s note of this meeting recorded that TSTT tried to link the ordering of interconnection equipment with the ordering of the equipment that it claimed that it needed for an upgrade and expansion of the network. The parties discussed the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 stated by the regulator the previous day. Digicel T&amp;T called this a “deadline”. TSTT called this “a recommendation”. Digicel T&amp;T noted that TSTT seemed unconcerned about complying with the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 for completion of interconnection. In particular, TSTT told Digicel T&amp;T that it had not received any instructions from its CEO to enable interconnection services to start by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005. </p>

The sending of this email led eventually to Mr Davy writing to Mr Espinal of TSTT on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005. This pair of communications is at the centre of the next allegation, put forward by the Claimants, that TSTT acted contrary to honest practices, in relation to the period from 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005. In particular, the Claimants say that TSTT in that period brought influence to bear on Nortel not only to write the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 but also, more generally, to cause deliberate delay in the provision of the equipment needed by TSTT for its side of the interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T. </p>

There was evidence from various witnesses about the nature of that relationship. In addition, considerable light has been thrown on that relationship by documents which were produced by Nortel in this litigation. These documents show that TSTT had had technical problems with Nortel in the period before September 2005. There were crashes or “outages” in relation to the Nortel system installed for TSTT. A Nortel email of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005 recorded that TSTT had made a request for US $5.65million as compensation. Nortel felt that this claim was exaggerated but the email recorded that the relationship between Nortel and TSTT was very important to Nortel so that Nortel should attempt to do “what is right”. The email came from a Mr Holden in Nortel and was sent to Ms Bejar, Mr Taylor and Mr Davy, all of Nortel. </p>

Mr Davy was a salesman for Nortel. His only customer was TSTT. He regarded himself as a go-between in relation to Nortel and TSTT. He saw himself as TSTT’s voice within Nortel. Mr Davy was paid commission by reference to the amount of the sales he made to TSTT. In the conversation on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005, Mr Espinal protested at what he saw was a conflict of interest on the part of Nortel, because a Mr Richard Nixon of Nortel was present at a meeting between TSTT and Laqtel. Laqtel was, along with Digicel T&amp;T, an intending new entrant into the T&amp;T telecommunications market. Mr Espinal was concerned that Mr Nixon’s involvement on behalf of Laqtel would lead to a conflict of interest within Nortel. </p>

Mr Nixon of Nortel recognised the need for Nortel to be consistent in the various messages which were given by Nortel to TSTT, or to the regulator, or to Laqtel. The position was further complicated because Digicel T&amp;T had earlier placed an order with Nortel for the MUX needed by Digicel T&amp;T.

The equipment was referred to as optical equipment and work to the NGN, required for an expansion of the network by TSTT, was also involved. It seems that these times were being computed for the purpose of being sent to the regulator. The emails referred to two schedules, one showing a period of 170 days, and the other showing a period of 185 days. These schedules were discussed within Nortel in an email on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2005. A Mr Bulengo, who was in the part of Nortel dealing with Digicel T&amp;T, expressed his views to a number of others in Nortel, dealing with different customers. Mr Bulengo pointed out that other customers had been given a lead time of 12 weeks from receipt of a purchase order, but he did not think that was significantly different from the standard lead times shown in the schedules. He did however ask that the Laqtel order and the Digicel order be checked to make sure that the time lines were more or less in line with the schedules. In addressing Mr Davy in particular, he expressed the view that even if Digicel T&amp;T or Laqtel got their MUXs earlier, TSTT would still have to do a great deal of work in connection with signalling and switch expansion. Mr Bulengo suggested that Nortel might accelerate the timetable for the good of customer relations. Mr Davy recorded his agreement with these views. </p>

Mr Bulengo says in terms that Mr Espinal telephoned Ms Bejar “about this”. This reference would seem to be to a statement or possibly various statements to be made by Nortel about delivery times for interconnection equipment and/or upgrades to the NGN. Mr Bulengo’s email also assumes that Mr Davy is aware that Ms Bejar was involved in the matter.

He gave his evidence in chief orally and was cross-examined by counsel instructed by TSTT and was then re-examined. In his evidence in chief on deposition he referred to a telephone call between Ms Bejar and Mr Espinal. He put the date of the telephone call at around the end of September. He assessed that was the date of the telephone call because the telephone call preceded a meeting between Nortel and Digicel T&amp;T in the first week of October, or 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005. He described his understanding that during the telephone call Mr Espinal asked Ms Bejar to ensure that Nortel delivered what was called “the final solution” no earlier or no later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. He described how he knew what had been said in the conversation. After the conversation between Ms Bejar and Mr Espinal, he said that Ms Bejar gave him, Mr Taylor, his “marching orders” that “the equipment” was to be delivered no earlier and no later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and that he needed to ensure that “the troops” understood these delivery dates and that all corresponding schedules matched that date. Mr Taylor also gave evidence on deposition that he spoke to Mr Davy shortly after the meeting with Ms Bejar. Mr Taylor told Mr Davy what Ms Bejar had said to him. Mr Davy asked Mr Taylor to support Mr Davy’s efforts in that TSTT was an extremely important customer and it was important that Nortel helped TSTT to ensure that TSTT could complete all the necessary upgrades to their network and therefore deliver “the final solution” on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. Mr Taylor explained there were two reasons for this date. The first was that TSTT wanted a robust network to face the new competition. The second reason was that “ironically” March 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> 2006 would have ensured that the Christmas season and the carnival season would have passed. The carnival season in T&amp;T was in early February. Mr Taylor said he was unhappy with Mr Davy’s approach, as Mr Taylor thought that the better course for Nortel was to set out to secure business from Digicel. Mr Taylor also said that he felt it was wrong to take the course requested by Mr Espinal. </p>

He explained his understanding that Nortel had been asked by its customer to deliver on the date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and that Nortel took steps to do so and later took steps to improve on that date. He said that the reason that the March 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> 2006 date was set, and then met, was because that was the date TSTT told Nortel in September 2005 that it was to meet.

He said that it was impossible to speculate whether Nortel could have done better because that was the date that Nortel was asked to hit, and so it did hit that date. He referred to possible opportunities to improve on the date. I will refer to that topic later in this judgment. Mr Taylor was asked why he did not refer the matter of Mr Espinal’s telephone conversation in September 2005 to the Nortel ethics officer. He failed to see how there was an ethical problem if Nortel delivered a project in accordance with the request of its own customer. That was notwithstanding the fact that he had said earlier, at page 64 of the transcript of the deposition, that he felt that Nortel was doing something wrong. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement, Mr Taylor gave further detail as to the conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar. He placed the conversation as being during the week of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005. He explained the circumstances which led to him being present, to hearing some of the conversation, which was in Spanish, and to Ms Bejar explaining to him in English, after the conversation, what had been said. Mr Taylor stated that Ms Bejar told him, in no uncertain terms, that Mr Espinal had instructed her that Nortel should control the interconnection equipment supply process for the Digicel/TSTT interconnection such that the final interconnection solution was completed, no earlier and no later than March 31, 2006. Ms Bejar gave him his “marching orders” (he said those were his words) that the equipment was to be delivered “no earlier and no later” (he said those were her words). Mr Taylor expressed to Ms Bejar his concern that this approach would cause a problem with Digicel T&amp;T who were already concerned about Nortel’s loyalties to TSTT, in relation to interconnection in T&amp;T. This expressed concern did not cause Ms Bejar to change her mind. After the conversation with Ms Bejar, Mr Taylor spoke to Mr Davy. Mr Davy was aware of the call between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar. Mr Taylor told Mr Davy exactly what had happened. Mr Davy asked Mr Taylor to support Mr Davy’s efforts to help TSTT in relation to TSTT’s request to Nortel. Mr Davy said it was important that Nortel helped TSTT through the liberalisation process, to ensure that TSTT could complete all necessary upgrades to its network, before interconnection with Digicel took place and competition arrived in T&amp;T. The fact that TSTT’s instruction would allow it to capitalise on the lucrative Christmas and carnival season was also discussed. </p>

Mr Espinal described that the reason he sent his email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 was that the regulator had insisted on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 on interconnection being complete by the end of November 2005. He explained that he wanted Nortel to put down in writing their views of how long it would take to have interconnection specific equipment ready to enable full interconnection to take place. He wanted Nortel to provide a realistic deadline. He had concerns about the reliability of Nortel by reason of the major project failures in T&amp;T. He was aware that Nortel were undergoing a huge restructuring and he wanted to be sure of Nortel’s resources and commitment to TSTT’s interconnection project. He explained that he wanted Nortel’s independent view as to the delivery timetable because he knew that the minister in T&amp;T had “direct access to the CEO” (i.e of Nortel). Mr Espinal was aware that the interconnection process would be subject to extensive public scrutiny and he wanted a genuinely realistic timetable that Nortel could work to. He gave evidence that he did not exert any influence over Nortel as to the terms of its response and he did not give instructions to anyone to slow down Nortel in any way by means of any phone call or other communication. This witness statement was signed on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2009, which was before Mr Taylor gave his evidence in Florida. </p>

He accepted that he had spoken to Ms Bejar on a few occasions but most of these occasions were for the purpose of asking for her support to secure the right resources to address the multiple issues that TSTT had with the design and support of its network.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">At this point I will make my findings as to the alleged conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar and the alleged conversation between Mr Taylor and Mr Davy. I essentially accept Mr Taylor’s evidence in relation to both conversations. As regards the alleged conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar, it is clear from the Nortel emails that Mr Espinal had telephoned Ms Bejar at around this time. The discrepancy in the date between the dates suggested by the email and the dates suggested by Mr Taylor does not seem to me to be significant. I hold that the conversation took place after Mr Espinal had sent his email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005. Although Mr Espinal was more ready to accept that the conversation concerned the problems with the network rather than the question of interconnection, the email suggests that the conversation did turn to the question of interconnection, as Mr Taylor has said. Although Mr Espinal initially denied any such conversation, he came very close to admitting that such a conversation did indeed take place when he was cross-examined. I think it is inherently probable that such a conversation did take place, in accordance with Mr Taylor’s evidence. Mr Espinal had been given a deadline by the regulator on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005. Mr Espinal did not wish to comply with that deadline. He almost immediately emailed Mr Davy to get Nortel’s support for his position. In the interval between making his request to Mr Davy and Nortel delivering a response, there was ample opportunity for Mr Espinal to contact Ms Bejar. The matter was sufficiently important to Mr Espinal to make it appropriate for him to approach Ms Bejar to get her, and therefore Nortel, on his side. Mr Espinal would have known that he would be able to exercise influence over Nortel in this respect because of the commercial relationship between the company and the fact that Nortel had let TSTT down in relation to the serious problems with TSTT’s network. </p>

Mr Davy did however take sides on the question of whether such a conversation had taken place by offering explanations as to how improbable such a conversation would have been. I am not persuaded by Mr Davy’s arguments. Indeed, the fact that he made those arguments adds to my dissatisfaction with him as a reliable witness of fact. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In coming to my conclusion as to the content of the conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar, it is relatively easy to be persuaded that Mr Espinal said to Ms Bejar that the upgrade to the network and interconnection should be “not before” 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. That was Mr Espinal’s settled intention in the period running up to his conversation with Ms Bejar. His settled intention in that respect is revealed by his email of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 and his email to Mr Davy of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have taken longer to be persuaded that Mr Espinal told Ms Bejar that the network upgrade and interconnection should be “not later than” 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. However, such an instruction is not as implausible as it initially appeared to me. First of all, Mr Espinal was identifying a single date for both the network upgrade and for interconnection. Mr Espinal had no reason to believe that Nortel would be able to deliver the network upgrade before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and he sincerely wished the network upgrade to be complete by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, and not later. Accordingly, in relation to that part of the work being handled by Nortel, Mr Espinal did wish the work to be completed not later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. I think there must have been other considerations in Mr Espinal’s mind as well. Mr Espinal knew that there would be pressure from the regulator and the minister in T&amp;T to complete interconnection sooner rather than later. Mr Espinal would have been concerned to identify a date for completion of interconnection that he believed he had some prospect of defending and bringing about. If Mr Espinal had endeavoured to delay interconnection to a date significantly later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, he must have realised that his prospects of success would be considerably reduced the greater the predicted delay. In any event, Mr Taylor was very clear that the message Mr Espinal gave to Ms Bejar and the message Ms Bejar gave to Mr Taylor was that the work should be completed no earlier and no later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. The reference to “no later” would have been a somewhat strange detail to fabricate or to mis-remember and, in the end, I am persuaded that that was a part of the instruction given by Mr Espinal to Ms Bejar in late September 2005.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the conflict of evidence between Mr Taylor and Mr Davy, I prefer the evidence of Mr Taylor. It was suggested to me that Mr Taylor was an unreliable witness because of the commercial connection between his present company and Digicel. Conversely, it was suggested to me that Mr Davy was an unreliable witness because of his longstanding association with TSTT and the indications in the history that he was, and still is, ready to help TSTT. As between these two arguments, I form the view that the connection between Mr Davy and TSTT was more significant than the connection between Mr Taylor and Digicel. I can understand that Mr Taylor’s connection with Digicel has led to him volunteering to Digicel some useful information as to the conversations in question. However, I do not think that the relationship between Mr Taylor and Digicel is of a character so as to make it likely that Mr Taylor would concoct an untrue story to try to help Digicel. Conversely, I am persuaded that the connection between Mr Davy and TSTT does explain why Mr Davy would have been prepared to give untruthful evidence in an attempt to help TSTT. Accordingly, on the question whether a conversation took place between Mr Taylor and Mr Davy as Mr Taylor has described, I make the finding that that conversation did indeed take place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The internal Nortel documents in late September and in the first few days of October 2005 show that various persons at Nortel were considering how to answer requests for information as to lead times for delivery of interconnection equipment. The different persons within Nortel were aware of requests for this information from TSTT, and from the regulator. These people were also aware that Digicel T&amp;T and Laqtel had previously ordered MUXs from Nortel and these purchasers had been given estimated periods for delivery of the equipment ordered. There was a considerable concern within Nortel that the information given to Nortel’s various clients and to the regulator should be consistent. The internal Nortel documents also show that Nortel was not in possession of all the technical information it would need to design the appropriate interconnection equipment to be supplied to TSTT. Mr Davy was kept aware of these various internal discussions and was shown a draft of the Nortel letter to the regulator before it was dispatched on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005. This letter stated that the general manufacturing interval for optical equipment was approximately 13 weeks, from receipt of a purchase order to the shipment from the Nortel factory. The letter also stated that because of the high demand for optical equipment at that time there was no difference in the manufacturing interval between a normal delivery as against a rush order. Air shipment from Miami to Trinidad took                approximately two days and delivery by ocean transport took approximately one week. These intervals did not include customs clearance. </p>

He proposed that the matter be discussed at the next meeting of senior management. A Mr Thrush of TSTT prepared a presentation to be given at that meeting. Mr Thrush had previously been an employee of a Digicel company. His presentation was headed: “The Games Begin”. It referred briefly to some of the history of the matter in T&amp;T and to the fact that TSTT had laid down a timeline of April 2006. This appears to be a reference to TSTT’s project plan. Mr Thrush discussed the question of delay. He referred to the possibility of Digicel T&amp;T missing out on trade over Christmas and the carnival season. He said that TSTT was aggressively improving its network and that if Digicel T&amp;T were delayed too long this would impact on their success. He later pointed out that delay was costing Digicel T&amp;T, in view of the size of its investment in T&amp;T, and he doubted if Digicel T&amp;T could afford a period of delay of as long as six months. He also reviewed the process of interconnection between Digicel companies and C&amp;W companies in other parts of the Caribbean. As regards TSTT, he pointed out that TSTT needed as long as possible to prepare for competition. In that context he referred to the fact that T&amp;T had not issued licences (concessions) to TSTT or to the new entrants. When discussing the next steps to be taken, Mr Thrust stated that if TSTT delayed, the dispute with Digicel T&amp;T would escalate aggressively; TSTT would be portrayed as blocking competition and negativity of that kind would be very serious for TSTT. Mr Thrush recommended that TSTT should “go on the offensive” and in particular should attack the regulator for failing to implement the process properly and should aggressively defend TSTT’s position. TSTT should use legal routes that might be available to it to “buy time”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Attached to this letter were two timetables, one showing a period of 170 days and the other showing a period of 185 days. These were the same timetables as were circulating within Nortel on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2005. 185 days is a little over six months so that a timetable of six months beginning at the date of the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 would take one to early April 2006. The evidence showed that this letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 was understood by Mr Espinal and Mr Davy to be a letter written in response to Mr Espinal’s request, by email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005, for a report from Nortel. The heading to the email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 was “update on NGN” but the heading to the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 had been varied to read “Interconnect Requirement to TSTT Network”. The email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 was an email from Mr Espinal whereas the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 stated that Nortel was in receipt of a request from TSTT’s “Technology Organisation”. There is no evidence that the Technology Organisation did originate such a request nor is there any evidence that the technical personnel at TSTT were in discussion with Mr Davy, in the period running up to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005, as to what Nortel should put in a report on the subject of interconnection. As against that, it is possible that Mr Davy was in contact with the technical personnel at TSTT for other more general reasons around this time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 correctly stated that Nortel was in the process of implementing phase 2 of the NGN infrastructure rollout and that that phase was due to be completed by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. The letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 identified a date for completion of interconnection by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006. This was on the basis that the interconnection project would be implemented concurrently with phase 2 of the NGN project. When the letter said that the interconnection project could be completed “by April 30, 2006”, the letter was not stating that interconnection could be achieved at some unidentified point much earlier than that date; the letter was stating that the realistic target date for achieving completion of interconnection project was 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 and, indeed, that date could only be achieved if Nortel worked extended hours and at weekends. The 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 was therefore “a best-case scenario”. </p>

It emerged however that there was an earlier draft of this letter which Mr Davy sent by email to various persons on Sunday 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005. The email was addressed to Mr Espinal and was copied to three others at TSTT, namely, Ms Agard, Mr Mitchell and Mr Perai, who was head of technology at TSTT . The email was also copied to five persons at Nortel including Ms Bejar and others who have been involved in email communications between 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, which communications discussed the answers that should be given to TSTT and the regulator so as to be consistent with timelines earlier quoted to Digicel T&amp;T and Laqtel. </p>

The words “and all other stakeholders” in the final version did not appear in the draft. Mr Davy said that those words were suggested by Jamie Gibson of Nortel. I am hesitant about accepting Mr Davy’s evidence in this case because I have already held that he deliberately misled the court as to a conversation he had with Mr Taylor, following Mr Taylor’s conversation with Ms Bejar. However, it is possible that the reference to other stakeholders was added by Mr Gibson so that it would be a non-explicit reference to the regulator and possibly the government in T&amp;T. If that was the meaning of “other stakeholders”, then it is also possible that persons other than Mr Gibson may have suggested that amendment. The part of the fourth paragraph of the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005, which describes what was involved in the project as regards major expansion to the network, also did not appear in the draft of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005.

Further, a final “s” has been added to the word “situation” in the final version. More importantly, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, Mr Davy expressed the view in the letter that interconnection could be complete by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, whereas the next day he expressed a different view, namely, that interconnection could be complete by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, but only by working extended hours and weekends. </p>

Mr Davy said that the reference to working extended hours and weekends came from Mr Naccarato of Nortel. Mr Davy said that the reference to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was a mistake. He said that he had been given the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 by the operations team at Nortel.

With that instruction in his mind, given that Mr Davy wished to say to TSTT what TSTT wanted to hear, Mr Davy drafted the letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 to say that phase 2 of the NGN upgrade was due to complete on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and that it was Mr Davy’s view that interconnection would also be complete by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.

One possibility is that someone pointed out that if the letter attached the two timetables, one of which was 185 days and the other was 170 days, those timetables would take one past 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. If that had been pointed out, it might have been thought desirable to amend the letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, so that it had a date for completion of interconnection which was not inconsistent with the timetables. Another possibility is that the technical people at Nortel were unhappy about Nortel making a commitment to achieve interconnection by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and they wished to have further time up to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006. There are, indeed, later internal Nortel documents which show that Nortel was working to a timetable for interconnection which gave them up to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 to achieve interconnection. However, it is possible that those later documents used the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 because that was the date in the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005. If the technical people at Nortel had asked Mr Davy on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 to change his date for interconnection from 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, then it seems likely that Mr Davy would have had to mention that to Mr Espinal to get Mr Espinal’s clearance to putting in a date for interconnection which was later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, which Mr Espinal had specified to Ms Bejar. Yet Mr Davy and Mr Espinal gave evidence that there was no communication between them as to the change in the date. In particular, they did not give evidence of any attempt by Mr Davy to contact Mr Espinal on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 to tell him to ignore the letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 and that it would be replaced with another letter with a different completion date.</p>

Mr Espinal would have been keen to ensure that phase 2 of the NGN upgrade was completed by March 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> 2006 and the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 is consistent with that. If Mr Espinal did not wish to achieve interconnection before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and he saw that the attached timetables took the date for interconnection past 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, it is possible that Mr Espinal took advantage of that fact and requested an amendment to Mr Davy’s letter in relation to the date. Further, TSTT’s project timetable showed a date for completion of interconnection which was later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. In those circumstances, Mr Espinal may well have thought that having a date later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 might be useful to TSTT and if the worst came to the worst TSTT could always make a virtue of accelerating completion of interconnection so that it was earlier than 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, provided always it was not earlier than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. </p>

In summary, they are: (1) the original choice of the date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was not a mistake; (2) the choice of the date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was the result of Mr Davy’s wish to give effect to Mr Espinal’s instruction to Ms Bejar, which had been passed on to Mr Davy; (3) Mr Davy told lies at the trial as to the change in the letters and the purpose of his lies was, more likely than not, to cover up the fact that Mr Espinal had been involved in the redrafting of the letter; (4) if Mr Espinal had not been involved in the redrafting, then there would have had to be some explanation given to Mr Espinal as to why his instruction, referring to “not later than” 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, was being disregarded in the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 and neither Mr Davy nor Mr Espinal gave any such evidence; (5) Mr Davy and Mr Espinal had the opportunity on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 to discuss the redrafting of the letter, as both were in T&amp;T and Mr Davy had said to Mr Espinal that he would go to Mr Espinal’s office that day; (6) it is inherently credible that Mr Espinal would have liked to have seen the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 in the final form of the letter. </p>

Mr O’Brien had obtained a copy of the letter which Mr Davy had written to Mr Espinal on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  Mr O’Brien referred to the timetable attached to the letter.  The note refers to a period of 180 days, although the timetable attached to the letter referred to 185 days, alternatively 170 days.  The note records that Nortel tried to explain to Mr O’Brien that this timetable was a conservative timetable which covered the period from requesting a proposal from Nortel to the interconnection being ready for service.  Mr O’Brien suggested that someone in Nortel was seeking to undermine Digicel T&amp;T’s opportunity to launch before Christmas 2005.  Ms Bejar promised to look into the matter.  The Nortel note records that, overall, the meeting went well for Nortel.</p>

Mr Davy referred to two questions put to him at the meeting on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005 and provided written answers to those questions. His answers stated that the handover to the NGN would be completed by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. He referred to the capacity constraint on TSTT’s network at that time. When asked whether there was traffic information or studies that supported an alleged inability to interconnect forthwith or other information supporting the constraints on capacity of the current network, Mr Davy said that Nortel did not have access to TSTT traffic information. Mr Davy said that there was no alternative to the existing network or the NGN to facilitate early interconnection. As regards the current status of interconnection, Mr Davy said that Nortel had received “the interconnect requirements” from TSTT, had asked for clarification and answers were to be provided on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005. </p>

The subject was “Laqtel”. Mr Barnes stated that TSTT needed to put pressure on Nortel to complete the engineering for the NGN network expansion as soon as possible so that TSTT kept pace with its earlier project plan. Mr Barnes then went on to refer to a quotation from Nortel which would be shown to the potential new entrant to have their commitment as to payment for the equipment. This seems to be a reference to equipment needed for interconnection. On the same day, Miss Agard replied to Mr Barnes and stated “we are pushing Nortel”. </p>

Mr Espinal said that certain advertisements placed by Digicel T&amp;T in the T&amp;T press were hostile to TSTT, were not in good faith and he would suspend communications between TSTT and Digicel T&amp;T.

Digicel T&amp;T demanded an immediate reinstatement of the meeting and said that if the meeting did not take place then TSTT was to be considered as making a formal declaration of its intent to obstruct competition in T&amp;T. Miss Agard of TSTT replied stating that Digicel T&amp;T was not in a position to demand anything of TSTT as TSTT was voluntarily engaged in a process on a without prejudice basis. Miss Agard was correct as a matter of law in that there was no obligation on TSTT in relation to interconnection with T&amp;T at that time or, indeed, until the government of T&amp;T granted a concession to TSTT imposing obligations upon it. </p>

Mr Espinal of TSTT replied on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005 stating that he was unable to attend a meeting as requested.  Mr Espinal referred to an opinion from senior counsel, Mr Daly, which had been provided to TSTT and sent to the regulator.  In the opinion, Mr Daly advised that the directive given by the regulator requiring interconnection by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 was unlawful.  Mr Espinal remarked that TSTT had committed to engage in, without prejudice, voluntary discussions with proposed concession holders and that TSTT had diligently proceeded with those discussions on a good faith basis.  He then complained about Digicel T&amp;T’s advertising campaign which was hostile to TSTT.  He said that the government, as distinct from the regulator, had not directed TSTT to achieve interconnection by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005.  The date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 for interconnection was impracticable.  He stated that Digicel T&amp;T’s advertising campaign was in breach of a non-disclosure agreement which was in operation between TSTT and Digicel T&amp;T.  Nonetheless, TSTT would continue to honour any commitments it had made which predated Digicel T&amp;T’s breaches.  </p>

The email referred to a formal request for a proposal which was being finalised and which would request a proposal for interconnection equipment and also equipment to augment TSTT’s network to meet with the traffic forecast.  Mr Perai asked Nortel to quote for the interconnection equipment first, by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2005, and quote a little later for the second part of the equipment.  </p>

I have been provided with two notes of this meeting, both prepared by Digicel T&amp;T.  Digicel T&amp;T recorded its observations that TSTT was not paying any attention to the regulator’s deadline of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 and TSTT obviously felt under no significant political pressure to expedite interconnection.  TSTT said that it had not ordered the interconnection equipment and would not commit to dates for the civil works.  There was a major row as to whether TSTT had previously stated that Digicel T&amp;T could connect to the legacy network rather than the NGN network.  It is not necessary to determine who was right and who was wrong about that matter but the reaction of the regulator to TSTT’s statement on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2005, that it would not permit interconnection to the legacy network, is of interest.  Dr Prince of the regulator said that “one party is hell bent on stalling”; he was obviously referring to TSTT.  He also said that the situation had moved from one of “disingenuousness to dishonesty”.  Dr Prince indicated that he intended to make his views public. </p>

In connection with the optical equipment to be purchased from Nortel, the report misstated the amount of expenditure involved.  The report referred to a sum in Trinidadian dollars which was approximately US $400,000.  Miss Agard of TSTT gave evidence that these figures were “guessed”.  The report supported a waiver of the tender procedures and the tenders committee approved the application on certain grounds.  It will be remembered that the project plans of September 2005 provided for a period of time to follow through the tender procedures of TSTT.  In the event, this waiver meant that period of time was not needed.  Although the figures considered on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2005 were inaccurate, there was no further request for a waiver of tender in relation to the correct, larger, figures.</p>

The regulator referred to a lack of co-operation on the part of TSTT.  The regulator stated that in the absence of immediate intervention from the minister, the regulator would need to await the grant of concessions to TSTT and the new entrants and the promulgation of interconnection regulations to enable the regulator properly to mandate interconnection between the operators.  The regulator therefore suggested that the minister exercise such powers and influence as he thought fit to assist in achieving interconnection.</p>

On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005, TSTT wrote to the regulator setting out the terms and conditions upon which TSTT would agree to facilitate interconnection.  In respect of the optical equipment, TSTT stated that the timeframe for the manufacture, shipping, installation and testing of this equipment would be 17 weeks from the date of placing the purchase order with Nortel.  That period was not guaranteed but was dependant upon Nortel.  TSTT would use its best endeavours to ensure that Nortel delivered in accordance with this timescale.  As regards interconnection equipment, Digicel was required to pay for the equipment.  TSTT would continue with the core upgrade to its NGN which was scheduled to be completed at the end of April 2006.  TSTT referred to a schedule submitted by Nortel.  This may have been Mr Davy’s letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005, although that letter referred to the upgrade to the network being completed by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and interconnection being completed by the end of April 2006.  TSTT pointed out in its letter of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 that there might need to be a high level of call blocking and non- completion of calls, because TSTT’s network might not be fully provisioned when interconnection was achieved.  TSTT stated that degradation to the quality of service would be experienced until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, when the upgrade to the NGN was expected to be completed.  TSTT’s letter enclosed a signature page which was available to be signed on behalf of Digicel T&amp;T.  Digicel T&amp;T never did sign a copy of this letter.  </p>

He also referred to the difference of opinion as to how physical interconnection would be achieved.  He said that interconnection arrangements must be concluded as far as practicable in the form of commercial agreements negotiated at arms length.  As regards the power of the government of T&amp;T to control TSTT, he pointed out the constraints of company law, fiduciary responsibilities and the position of minority shareholders.

Ms Bejar asked others in Nortel for this information.  Mr Guerra told Ms Bejar in reply that “the initial agreement” was to have everything in place by the end of April 2006.

TSTT had not yet placed the necessary purchase order with Nortel for the work which was to be done.  Nortel pressed TSTT to place the order but TSTT was plainly having second thoughts about whether the work should be done by Nortel, or by another supplier.  In the event, TSTT did not place the order with Nortel.  That led to Nortel and TSTT devising an interim arrangement which would permit interconnection in accordance with the planned ready for service dates.  </p>

She said that based on a review carried out by the deployment team within Nortel, “the reasonable but aggressive schedule” would have installation beginning week 4, that is, the week of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2006, and ready for service by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.

Whilst Mr Guerra’s email is not clear, one reading is that he was accepting Mr Davy’s distinction between the Laqtel equipment and the Digicel equipment but was still stating that in relation to the Digicel equipment, the ready for service date of the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 was possible.

Mr Davy sent a further email within Nortel warning that Nortel was: “heading down the road of pissing off Carlos and Bernard [of TSTT] by trying to advance Digicel interconnect project to February 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and not advancing the core project from April 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>”. Mr Davy pointed out that if Nortel did advance the Digicel interconnect project in this way, the instruction from TSTT for the core network upgrade might not be given.  Mr Davy initially gave evidence that he had spoken to Mr Espinal about the matter on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 but he later withdrew that evidence. </p>

Mr Davy replied on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 stating that Nortel would participate in the tender process.  He added that the core network was a critical part of the interconnect proposals and interconnection would not function without it.  He also stated that there was a need to re-evaluate the in-service date for the interconnection proposals; he stated that 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 might no longer be feasible.  He recommended that Nortel should begin to look at alternatives, should the core network not be in place by April 2006.  An internal Nortel email from Mr Naccarato also stated that Nortel could not make a commitment to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 in view of TSTT’s decision.  It is far from clear, from these emails, what Nortel did believe at this point was achievable in relation to interconnection with Laqtel and Digicel T&amp;T. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">On Monday 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, Nortel prepared a detailed timetable for the three TSTT projects.  The first project related to the core network upgrade.  The timetable recorded that TSTT had not placed a purchase order for this work.  Nonetheless, the timetable showed the work taking a period of 20 weeks to the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2006.  The timetable then showed three scenarios, A, B and C, for interconnection.  Scenario C involved interconnection using the new core capacity to be provided on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2006.  On this scenario interconnection would take place on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2006.  The two more relevant scenarios are A and B.  Scenario A was described as “interconnect customer 1 and 2” and scenario B was described as “interconnect customer 1 or 2”.  For scenario B, interconnection was to be completed by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  With scenario A, interconnection was to be completed by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  I interpret scenarios A and B as showing that Nortel could provide interconnection for one new entrant by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  It is not clear whether this could only be achieved by, in some way, delaying the other new entrant past 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  Scenario A involved providing interconnection to both new entrants with interconnection to be completed by 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  The timetable of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 contains a note in relation to scenario B.  The note states that scenario B was high risk and was on a best efforts basis, with aggressive timelines.  Scenario B assumed customs clearance was very aggressive in one week or less.  It also assumed that TSTT would provide the necessary site access 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and TSTT would need to provide the necessary trunking.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">When cross-examined on deposition, it was put to Mr Taylor that Nortel was working hard during December 2005, and later, to make sure that the interconnection equipment was delivered without delay.  Mr Taylor stated that there did come a time when Nortel had the opportunity to shorten delivery times and Nortel was waiting guidance from Ms Bejar, following her intended discussions with TSTT. He said that the reason that Nortel met the target date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was because that was the date Nortel was told to meet in September 2005.  He said that it was impossible to speculate whether Nortel could have done better because the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was the date it was asked to hit and that was the date it did hit.  He was asked to identify the opportunity that was turned down.  He said that by the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 there was an opportunity to accelerate the project but it was speculative.  There could have been, possibly, a saving of two weeks in relation to shipping.  He was later asked to identify the opportunity said to have been available in December to bring forward the delivery date.  He answered that the opportunity was to get the equipment manufactured earlier or to take and use equipment that was being manufactured for other customers and to advance the schedule by a couple of weeks.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In his witness statement served in these proceedings, Mr Taylor described his personal involvement in relation to interconnection between TSTT and Digicel T&amp;T.  He said that he was very much involved, in that Mr Gibson and Mr Reddy reported directly to him.  In paragraph 49 of his witness statement, he gave detailed evidence on the question whether it would be speculative to conclude that interconnection could have been completed prior to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  He said there was nothing magical or significant about that target date; it was simply the date fixed in advance by TSTT and ultimately met.  He also said that it was evident from the emails and his own recollection that interconnection could have been accelerated if there had been a desire to do so on the part of TSTT.  He then said: “Admittedly, answering how far in advance of the March 31, 2006, pre-fixed date interconnection could have been completed does, to some extent, remain speculative because there was never any interest or attempt to achieve an earlier completion date.”  He then said that the documents revealed that interconnection could have been advanced but TSTT did not allow Nortel to act in that way.  He then gave his interpretation of some of the documents starting with the email from Ms Ramos of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005.  He referred to the project plan of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, which included scenario B, which identified the possibility of one interconnection customer being ready for service on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  He said that the one interconnection customer must have been Digicel T&amp;T because it was the body exerting maximum pressure on Nortel.  He said that Laqtel did not in the event launch a mobile service in T&amp;T.  He also referred to a later attempt at a meeting on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 to discuss bringing forward the interconnection schedule. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">When cross-examined, Mr Taylor stated on a number of occasions that in the period January to February 2006, Nortel was doing everything it could to ensure that it met the target date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  He was asked to identify the opportunity to bring forward that date, which opportunity was said to have been missed.  He said there was an opportunity, in one specific case, to ship equipment earlier.  He thought it was in December 2005, in or around the last couple of weeks in December 2005, to achieve an in-service date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  It may be that Mr Taylor meant to refer to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, alternatively, he may have been deducting two weeks from 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  He said that, apart from that opportunity, there was no other opportunity to bring forward the delivery of interconnection for Digicel T&amp;T prior to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  He was asked about the evidence he gave on deposition about the difficulty of speculating how much time, if any, might have been saved.  He said that the only opportunity to advance interconnection was to do with the discussion about equipment in the middle of December 2005 that could have brought forward interconnection to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  This evidence is consistent with him saying that the opportunity to interconnect one customer on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 was the only opportunity which presented itself, and is inconsistent with him saying or intending to say that Nortel could have saved two weeks in terms of delivery of equipment, moving the interconnection date from 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  Nonetheless, in other parts of his evidence, he suggested that one could speculate that interconnection could have been expedited by some two weeks.  He was cross-examined in detail about whether Ms Ramos’ reference to interconnection by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 referred to the Laqtel equipment or the equipment for Digicel T&amp;T.  My impression was that Mr Taylor was interpreting the documents rather than offering any detailed facts from within his own knowledge.  He confirmed that although Laqtel did not launch a mobile network in T&amp;T, that fact was unknown at any time up to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  He suggested that the reference to Nortel being able to ship equipment in week 52 referred to equipment for Digicel T&amp;T.  He accepted that there were only two possible interpretations of that statement.  One interpretation was that it was a reference to the interconnection equipment for Laqtel.  The other interpretation was that it was the Digicel T&amp;T equipment which had been ordered in the Nortel factory on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 and which would have been ready for shipping in the week beginning 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, but only on the basis that the necessary equipment was already in the factory pre-manufactured and so only required some packaging to make it ready for shipping.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Davy gave evidence as to the discussions within Nortel in December 2005 in relation to the timetable for delivery of interconnection equipment to TSTT.  He considered whether there had been opportunities available for Nortel to bring forward delivery dates for this equipment.  At paragraph 18 of his witness statement he stated that Nortel looked for opportunities to speed up the timetable and moved the initial deadline of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  His reference to the initial deadline was a reference to the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, given in his letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  At paragraph 21 of his witness statement, he referred to communications within Nortel in December 2005 referring to a possible delivery date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  He stressed that this related to interconnection for one customer only and that the equipment for interconnection with Laqtel had been ordered before the equipment for interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T.  </p>

It was suggested to Mr Davy in cross-examination that no such conversation took place and he then withdrew that evidence.  When cross-examined, he explained in greater detail than in his witness statement why it was the case that the possible date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 related to interconnection with one new entrant only and did not provide for interconnection with both Laqtel and Digicel by that date.  </p>

He said that if such a suggestion had been made, he thought he would have asked if it meant that the time for the network upgrade that needed to be performed to accommodate the increased traffic was going to be improved as well.  If the answer to that question had been “no”, then such an approach would have been unacceptable to him, as he wished to provide a reasonable quality of service following interconnection, otherwise TSTT was going to be perceived by the public as damaging the quality of service.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I can now express my conclusions on some of the disputed matters of fact.  I have already held that in the period between 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 (the date of Mr Espinal’s email to Mr Davy) and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 (the date of Mr Davy’s email to Mr Espinal), Mr Espinal telephoned Ms Bejar and told her that TSTT did not wish to see interconnection completed before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  In particular, Mr Espinal said he wanted to see interconnection no earlier and no later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Ms Bejar passed this message onto Mr Taylor and Mr Taylor discussed it with Mr Davy.  Mr Davy understood TSTT’s requirements in this respect and wished to give effect to those requirements.  The letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, referring to a date for completion of interconnection of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, was distributed within Nortel, so that some of the personnel in Nortel, concerned with the later purchase orders from TSTT for interconnection equipment, were aware of this target date.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Nortel was in a very difficult position in relation to TSTT’s orders for interconnection equipment.  Nortel wished to keep TSTT happy as regards its requirements and timescales.  Nortel also wished to keep Digicel T&amp;T and the Digicel group of companies happy, because the Digicel group of companies was a potential source of lucrative business for Nortel.  Nortel was also put on the spot by specific and searching requests for information from the regulator in T&amp;T.   The way in which, for the greater part of the time, Nortel tried to combine the apparently incompatible pressures was to use the date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 as the target date for completion of interconnection and to make efforts to ensure that it did not go past that date.  Thus, Nortel could tell TSTT and Digicel T&amp;T and the regulator of a target date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Mr Davy of Nortel could even go so far as to claim credit because that date was a month earlier than 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, the date he had put in his letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  </p>

Some time may have been taken up due to the fact that Nortel wanted to see one purchase order for the aggregate of the Laqtel and Digicel T&amp;T interconnection equipment, but TSTT did not wish to combine the two orders into one.  In the event, the Claimants do not make any specific complaint about the way in which the purchase orders were handled by TSTT and it seems that Nortel made, and acted on, its own assumptions as to what the orders would require of it when the orders were eventually made.  </p>

In my judgment, the opportunity to deliver interconnection equipment by this date was interconnection equipment for one new entrant only.  The internal Nortel documents in December 2005 are not wholly clear on this subject.  In attempting to resolve the difficulty, there is one document which is more precise than some of the general statements, which being general are open to interpretation.  That document is the timetable dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, apparently prepared for, or as a result of, a meeting on that day to clear up the matter.  That document, if correct, shows clearly that the date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 only related to interconnection for one new entrant and that date was not a possible date for interconnection for both new entrants.

In his witness statement, he appeared to identify the date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 as the date for the Digicel T&amp;T interconnection equipment, not because two new entrants could be interconnected on that date but because, out of the two new entrants, Digicel was the one applying the greater pressure.  Apart from that consideration, it seemed to me, on this question of a possible opportunity for delivery by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, that Mr Taylor was attempting to interpret the documents rather than state his own recollection of events from within his own knowledge.  </p>

I have already indicated that I am hesitant about accepting Mr Davy’s evidence and, indeed, I have rejected it outright as regards the conversation he had with Mr Taylor in September 2005 and the way in which the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 came to be composed.  However, there is a contemporaneous internal Nortel document in which Mr Davy made the same point as he made in his oral evidence, to the effect that the equipment which was ready for 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 was the equipment intended for Laqtel.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">There are also more general references in the internal Nortel documents in December 2005 which refer to the possibility of shortening the time for delivery of interconnection equipment.  In particular, there is a reference to interconnection equipment being available for shipping in week 52 of 2005.  Mr Taylor explained to me that there were two possible explanations of that statement.  The first was that the statement referred to the Laqtel equipment.  The second was that it referred to the Digicel equipment, on the basis that the Digicel equipment had been ordered from the Nortel factory on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, whereupon it was found that the equipment had been pre-manufactured and needed packaging only.  Of these two possibilities, in my judgment, the explanation that the equipment in question was the Laqtel equipment is much more probable and I so find.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">On the question whether TSTT applied any pressure to Nortel to speed up manufacture and delivery of the interconnection equipment or whether, conversely, TSTT tried to retard that process, I have already made the finding that Mr Espinal told Ms Bejar in late September 2005 that interconnection was to be ready not earlier and not later than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  There are various communications from TSTT to Nortel up to the end of December 2005 when TSTT appeared to be following up and pressing for a commitment from Nortel in relation to manufacture and delivery of the equipment.  It would be wrong to say that TSTT allowed the matter to drift.  Conversely, there is no suggestion that TSTT at any time up to the end of December 2005 pressed for an improvement on a target date of the end of March 2006 for the interconnection equipment needed for Digicel T&amp;T.  </p>

In their pleadings, the Claimants made a large number of detailed allegations about the conduct of TSTT during this period, but did not repeat the majority of those allegations in their closing submissions, nor did they seek findings in relation to the majority of them.  The Claimants did make submissions in closing as to an email sent by Ms Bejar to Mr Espinal on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 and Mr Espinal’s response to it.  However, there is no independent allegation in the Re-Re-Amended pleading in relation to T&amp;T that Mr Espinal acted contrary to honest practices in the way he responded to this email. Further, as I have stated, I accept the Claimants’ own evidence from Mr Taylor that in January and February 2006, Nortel worked hard to achieve interconnection by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. </p>

That draft email referred to Nortel securing better delivery dates for some of, if not all of, the interconnection equipment.  On the evidence before me, I have held that this email was not received by Mr Espinal around that time.  However, on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, Ms Bejar re-sent the email to Mr Espinal and he received her email of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006.

Mr Espinal told Mr Davy that he had seen the email of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, for the first time on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006.  Mr Espinal said that he did not intend to respond to the email in writing but gave a verbal response to Mr Davy.  Mr Espinal stated that Nortel needed to address the schedules for all TSTT mobile projects, including the Laqtel interconnection, the Digicel T&amp;T interconnection and the core network expansion, to accommodate interconnection and the integration of a third mobile switch.  Mr Espinal added that an improvement in the schedules for Laqtel and Digicel T&amp;T, whilst leaving the core network expansion and the integration of the third switch in accordance with the original timetables, was unacceptable to TSTT.  </p>

TSTT declined to join in such a letter stating that such a letter was not necessary or appropriate.

Also on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, Digicel T&amp;T wrote to the minister in T&amp;T complaining that TSTT had not been prepared to join in sending a letter of this kind to Nortel.  </p>

It seems likely that those representatives included Mr Martin, who had been appointed Chairman of TSTT with effect from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005.  An internal Nortel email of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 referred to Ms Bejar attempting to persuade TSTT to change its stance “towards supporting accelerating these interconnect projects”.  The email reports that Ms Bejar gave information to TSTT on how she could execute and complete the projects sooner than the currently public date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  The author of the email did not know what TSTT’s response was.  Some information about this meeting was provided by Mr Martin of TSTT.  Mr Martin gave evidence that he told Ms Bejar and Mr Davy that he expected Nortel to do everything that it could to meet the timetable to provide interconnection by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 in accordance with a commitment that Mr Martin had given to the government in T&amp;T.  The internal Nortel email of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 also stated that shipments of equipment for TSTT were scheduled for 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2006 “with a possibility that they may ship one week earlier”.  The email explained that this was the best that the Nortel factory could do as there were some critical shortages that would not be available until at least week 4 of 2006. </p>

Mr Martin referred to his earlier meeting with Ms Bejar and Mr Davy and repeated that he had given an undertaking to the minister in T&amp;T that he would do everything possible to ensure that TSTT delivered on its expressed intent to try to make interconnection happen no later than end March 2006.

Instead, an arbitration panel gave its decision on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 which enabled Digicel T&amp;T to launch its network, on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, without there being an interconnection agreement in place. The panel’s decision came about as a result of certain steps which were taken between January 2006 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, Digicel T&amp;T served a notice of dispute under the dispute resolution procedures in T&amp;T.  On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, the regulator confirmed the existence of a dispute.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, Digicel T&amp;T served on TSTT a document setting out the subject matter of its complaint and attaching the form of the draft interconnection agreement then being negotiated.  There were further procedural steps leading to a hearing on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  There was then a procedural hearing on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 at which an arbitration panel made two relevant decisions.  The panel decided that it had jurisdiction to establish interim rates for interconnection.  The panel also established a sender-keep-all arrangement, effective from 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, so that interconnection could be established.  Although the matters referred to arbitration continued after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and indeed escalated into more disputes which were in turn referred to arbitration, the effect of the decision on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 was that Digicel T&amp;T was able to interconnect with TSTT and on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, Digicel T&amp;T launched its network in T&amp;T. </p>

The final form of the Particulars of Claim therefore involves three sets of amendments.  The Claimants applied on more than one occasion during the trial for permission to make these amendments. Those applications led to extensive argument as to whether permission should be given. TSTT objected to the grant of permission on various grounds. In relation to some draft amendments, it was said that the amendments did not disclose a proper basis for a claim or that the amendments were not adequately particularised. In relation to other draft amendments, it was said that it was too late to allow the Claimants to make the suggested amendments and it would be unfair to TSTT to permit the amendments to be made.  I considered the justice of the case and I gave the Claimants permission to make certain amendments, but not others. As it turned out, some of the matters which were then pleaded by way of amendment were later abandoned after they had been investigated in detail at the trial.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The essential allegation made by the Claimants is an allegation that TSTT acted contrary to honest practices. I have already explained what I understand is involved in such conduct. I regard an allegation of that kind as a serious allegation which must be properly particularised in any pleading. The Claimants should not be allowed to advance such an allegation unless it is properly pleaded. This is particularly so in this case where the Claimants have sought permission to make amendments and where I have sometimes refused that permission on various grounds which included the need to be fair to TSTT. In these circumstances, I will pay particular attention to the way in which the Claimants plead their case as to conduct contrary to honest practices and will give a fair reading to the pleaded case.  However, I will not permit the Claimants to rely upon wider or different allegations, which are not within a fair reading of their pleaded case.  As will be seen, in their closing submissions, the Claimants did put forward versions of their case which I do not recognise as being within the pleaded case.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The first pleaded allegation that TSTT acted contrary to honest practices, relates to TSTT’s timetable showing 33 weeks for completion of interconnection, which timetable was discussed at a meeting on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005.  The Claimants aver that a period of 33 weeks in the timetable was an unreasonable period, was part of a strategy to delay and obstruct interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T and was contrary to honest practices.  The Claimants focus in particular on the part of the timetable, at the beginning of the period, which referred to three weeks for an evaluation of TSTT’s network.  The Claimants plead that it was unnecessary and unreasonable for TSTT to include this period and in particular to include it at the commencement of the period covered by the timetable.  The Claimants then plead the evidence on which they rely to show that the period was unnecessary, at any rate coming at the beginning of the timetable period.  They refer to Mr Barnes’ views on the matter.  They say Mr Barnes must have known that the period was unnecessary, at any rate at the beginning of the timetable period, or he was at least reckless as to whether a statement that this period was necessary was a true or a false statement.  The Claimants also say that TSTT prepared a 33 week project timetable which was inconsistent with an impression it was seeking to portray to the regulator that TSTT was embracing the principle of liberalisation and was trying to expedite interconnection.  The Claimants rely in their pleading on the letter from TSTT to the regulator of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005, which came after the regulator had rejected the project timetable on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005.  The Claimants say that the deployment of the project timetable delayed interconnection by at least three weeks.  This three week delay was caused by TSTT’s carrying out an evaluation of the impact of interconnection on its network. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The third pleaded allegation which is still relied upon by the Claimants can best be explained by referring to paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2(q) of the relevant pleading. Paragraph 4.1 makes the general plea that C&amp;W and TSTT deliberately delayed interconnection from certain dates until 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, when interconnection was completed. This conduct is said to be contrary to honest practices. Paragraph 4.2 of the pleading then alleges that “C&amp;W’s” strategy of delay included certain acts or omissions. I note the reference to “C&amp;W” rather than TSTT. This reference was never amended to refer to TSTT. I will assume in the Claimants’ favour that they intended to refer to C&amp;W and TSTT. The case in relation to T&amp;T against C&amp;W has of course now been dropped and the case continues against TSTT alone. Paragraph 4.2(q) refers to TSTT’s exertion of influence over Nortel including as described in a number of earlier paragraphs, whose numbers are listed.

I have already referred to the background matters which were largely admitted by TSTT, and possibly even prayed in aid by TSTT, to the effect that TSTT was not ready for competition.

Digicel T&amp;T wanted interconnection to be completed in a matter of weeks or, in any event, as quickly as conceivably possible, starting the process in June 2005 or at the earliest date thereafter.  TSTT did not wish to do what Digicel T&amp;T wanted.  It was in Digicel T&amp;T’s commercial interest to proceed as quickly as possible.  It was not in TSTT’s commercial interest to proceed so quickly.  TSTT wanted to make many changes to its network, and other changes internally within TSTT, to put it in a better position to compete.  TSTT also thought, rightly, that it was not under a legal obligation to advance interconnection until, at the earliest, a concession was granted to TSTT, which placed obligations upon it in that respect.    </p>

Instead, it found itself having meetings with Digicel T&amp;T and Laqtel and the regulator and engaging in detailed correspondence on the subject of interconnection.  The reason why it behaved this way was that the government and the regulator put considerable pressure on TSTT to do so.  TSTT found itself having to submit to that pressure and did things which it would not otherwise have wanted to do.  The pressure from the government and the regulator was as intense as it was by reason of the complaints made by Digicel T&amp;T about TSTT’s behaviour.  Digicel T&amp;T continually made very serious criticisms of TSTT to encourage the government and the regulator to put pressure on TSTT.  </p>

I will discuss later in this judgment whether there was a causal link between the periods stated in the timetable and what subsequently happened.  The Claimants do say that the period in the timetable for evaluation of the network did cause delay to the completion of interconnection.  The Claimants then consider in detail the period in the timetable for the evaluation of the network.  The Claimants say that that period was unnecessary and it was known to be unnecessary.

The Claimants go so far as to say that even if technical people within TSTT genuinely believed that the evaluation had to be carried out and had to be carried out prior to sending a request for a quotation to Nortel, and even if the court held that view was a reasonable view, it was misleading of TSTT to keep secret the fact that Mr Barnes held a different view.  </p>

During that period, TSTT, acting in what it believed was its commercial interests, did not wish to advance interconnection.  TSTT was not wholly able to give effect to its wishes in this respect.  Digicel T&amp;T waged a successful campaign to persuade the government and the regulator to put increasing pressure on TSTT to act contrary to what TSTT regarded was in its best commercial interests.

When Mr Barnes did so, he was persuaded that interconnection in T&amp;T was a more complicated affair and would take more than 25 weeks.

The technical people in TSTT did carry out that evaluation before requesting a quote from Nortel.  An experienced technical man like Mr Barnes thought that it was not essential to have that evaluation before even requesting a quote for equipment.  The technical people in TSTT did not see it the same way.  It is difficult to judge whether the technical people in TSTT had regard exclusively to technical considerations or whether they were influenced by a desire to delay the completion of interconnection.  The desire within TSTT to interconnect at a time when it suited TSTT, rather than the earliest conceivable time which suited Digicel T&amp;T, makes it possible that the technical people in TSTT were influenced by that desire when forming their view as to the need for an early evaluation of the network.  The timetable of 49 weeks was not a genuine attempt to arrive at the fastest possible timetable for interconnection.  It was a timetable conceived in TSTT’s own self interests and to protect its own network.  </p>

He had to make a pragmatic decision to settle on a timetable, that was not uncomfortably short, but which could at least be defended.  He cut and pruned the various stages.  If Mr Espinal had applied his mind in order to arrive at the fastest possible timetable for interconnection, he could have produced a timetable of less than 33 weeks.  If Mr Barnes had been instructed to produce the shortest timetable from a technical point of view, he too would have been able to produce a shorter period than 33 weeks.  Whilst I cannot say for certain what that period might have been, I think that such a period would have been somewhere between 25 and 33 weeks.  </p>

The letter is a two page letter and contains a large number of statements about TSTT’s position and its intended behaviour.  TSTT stated that before the parties had obtained concessions, discussions would only be preliminary and exploratory;  the ability of the parties to make commitments must be without prejudice;  anything more required the grant of concessions and certainty as to the regulatory framework;  until concessions were granted, the role of the regulator would be persuasive, albeit highly persuasive; TSTT was seeking to protect its interests as far as it was able;  TSTT did not think that publicity would be beneficial;  Digicel T&amp;T’s timeframe for interconnection did not match TSTT’s timeframe.  The letter then referred to TSTT embracing the liberalisation process.  It added that carrying the process forward would not be done at the expense of operating irrationally and without detailed consideration of the impact on TSTT’s operations and that TSTT was committed to continuing preliminary negotiations in good faith but would be mindful of its right to benefit from its commercial activity in the same way as Digicel T&amp;T wished to benefit from its commercial activities.  </p>

However, the pleaded case against TSTT is not that TSTT took time in doing work, which it did not need to do, or that it did the work in advance of taking other steps.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already made my finding as to the character of the email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005. I have also made findings about the conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar and the conversation between Mr Taylor and Mr Davy.  I have found that Mr Davy knew before the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 that Mr Espinal was directing Nortel not to deliver interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T before the end of March 2006.  The evidence on these conversations did not go so far as to say that Mr Espinal instructed Ms Bejar, or indirectly Mr Davy, to produce a report which supported the date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, irrespective of whether Mr Davy believed the contents of his report or not.  There was no evidence that Mr Espinal raised with Ms Bejar the specific matter of his outstanding request of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005.  As I interpret Mr Taylor’s evidence, Mr Davy appeared to know something about a conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar, even before Mr Taylor told Mr Davy about it.  There was no investigation in the evidence of what precisely Mr Davy knew before his conversation with Mr Taylor.  However, it is to be inferred that Mr Espinal telephoned Ms Bejar for a purpose and that purpose was to influence Nortel’s behaviour as regards the delivery date for interconnection in T&amp;T.  The matter which was outstanding between TSTT and Nortel at the time of the conversation was the request of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 or, at the lowest, the matters outstanding included that request.  When Mr Davy produced his letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 the letter fitted closely with Mr Espinal’s instruction to Ms Bejar.  In his letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, Mr Davy stated that Nortel could complete the interconnection project by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 but this was a best case scenario and there was no room for any unforeseen matters.  </p>

Nonetheless, with such evidence as I have on those matters, I will next examine Mr Davy’s behaviour when he wrote the letters of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 and Mr Espinal’s involvement in the composition of the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  </p>

To advance that case, the Claimants rely upon what was later said by Ms Ramos on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 about interconnection being possible by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  The Claimants are prepared to assume in their pleading that this date could be achieved in a case where TSTT placed an order for the Digicel T&amp;T interconnection equipment by 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2005 (the date on which the actual purchase order was placed).  Accordingly, the Claimants did not submit the timetables attached to the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 to examination nor did they ask me to make findings of fact as to possibly shorter reasonable periods to be substituted for the periods in the timetables.  The Claimants also appear to accept that the period between 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 and a purchase order on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2005 is not to be held against TSTT.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ case hinges on the fact that, as they say, TSTT placed a purchase order for the Digicel T&amp;T interconnection equipment on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2005 and Ms Ramos wrote the email which she did on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005.  In my judgment, I am wholly unable to reach the conclusion contended for by the Claimants based upon the matters they have pleaded.  On my findings of fact, Ms Ramos’ email of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 was not referring to interconnection equipment for Digicel T&amp;T.  It was referring to interconnection equipment for Laqtel.  The Laqtel equipment was not identical to the Digicel T&amp;T equipment and the Laqtel order had been placed on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005.  In the case of an order placed for Digicel T&amp;T equipment on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2005, Ms Ramos’ email gives no guidance as to when that equipment would be ready for delivery, installation and testing </p>

I have made my findings on those matters and I have not accepted the points being made by Mr Taylor.  Mr Taylor gave evidence that there were no other opportunities to bring forward the target date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Mr Taylor said that in January and February 2006, Nortel was trying hard to achieve that target date and not overrun.  </p>

It is only at the later stage that more reliable predictions as to delivery dates can be made.  Accordingly, I do not accept the Claimants’ reasoning that the evidence as to what later happened, or allegedly happened, in relation to the order for the Digicel T&amp;T interconnection equipment, allows me to conclude that the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 as stated in the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 was known to be a false date. </p>

The Claimants give particulars of the alleged knowledge or recklessness.  They refer to the differences between the letters of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  The letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005 gave an end date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and did not refer to working extended hours or weekends.  The Claimants say that Mr Espinal’s email of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2005 did not contain the information which Mr Davy would need to make an assessment of when interconnection could be completed.  It is also said that Nortel had not carried out an examination of the capacities of TSTT’s networks as at 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005.  That being so it is said that it was impossible for Mr Davy to provide a definitive date as the earliest date for completion of interconnection.  It is then said that on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005, Nortel provided a target ready for service date of end of March 2006 without any explanation as to why the prediction had changed from 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 to 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005.  </p>

Finally, the Claimants say that the timetable stated by Mr Davy in his letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 was no more than guess work on his part and was designed to give Mr Espinal what he had asked for.  </p>

In particular, in relation to the letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005, I find that Mr Davy drafted that letter to refer to a completion date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 because he felt he was giving Mr Espinal what would suit Mr Espinal, namely, a letter from Nortel, which TSTT could show to the regulator, to support the position which TSTT wanted to achieve, namely, interconnection not earlier than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Mr Davy was not genuinely trying to assess how long interconnection would take. Instead, he was simply saying what he believed TSTT wanted him to say. </p>

I have found that the date was changed by Mr Espinal. The date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, was compatible with the project plan which TSTT was using to argue its position with the regulator.  Whilst it is conceivable that Mr Davy was shown the project plan and felt able to judge that it was a reliable project plan and so was behaving properly when he put his name to the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005, Mr Davy did not give evidence to that effect. I have not accepted the evidence which Mr Davy did give to the effect that the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 was provided to him by the technical people at Nortel. I find that Mr Davy signed the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 referring to the date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 for the same reason that he signed the letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005.

Mr Espinal had decided that TSTT’s position in relation to the regulator would be that interconnection could not happen before the end of April 2006, approximately in accordance with the TSTT project timetable.  Mr Espinal knew that he was procuring Mr Davy of Nortel to make a statement which was apparently technically well founded but was instead simply drafted to adopt TSTT’s pre-existing and continuing position.

TSTT plainly found it difficult to adopt the stance which some C&amp;W companies adopted in other countries, namely, a stance of outright refusal to make progress on interconnection, on the grounds that the incumbent had no legal obligation to co-operate in relation to interconnection until the new entrant obtained a licence or a concession.  TSTT therefore sought to deflect criticism by putting forward its arguments as to the requisite timetable involved in interconnection.  It sought to use its timetable and the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 for this purpose.

When the Claimants made their closing submissions, they submitted that TSTT acted contrary to honest practices by turning down the opportunity offered by Nortel to expedite completion of interconnection to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, alternatively, caused delay by reason of the instruction given by Mr Espinal to Ms Bejar in late September 2005. The suggestion was that if that instruction had not been given, then Nortel would have proceeded more quickly and, in particular, would not have taken time waiting for a reply to the email which Ms Bejar thought that she had sent on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">My initial reaction to the pleading is that it did not contain a clear statement setting out the allegation which was put forward in the Claimants’ closing submissions. The conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar was pleaded only for the purpose of alleging that Mr Davy knew that TSTT wished to delay interconnection until the end of March 2006. Further, the reference to completion of interconnection by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 was only for the purpose of alleging that as at the date of Mr Davy’s letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005, it was the case that interconnection could have been completed before the end of March 2006. If the pleadings had stopped there, I may have held that it was not open to the Claimants to allege that TSTT had delayed interconnection by reason of the conversation with Ms Bejar in late September 2005 or by reason of what happened in relation to the alleged opportunity to bring forward interconnection to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">However, paragraph 4.2(q) of the pleading also refers to paragraph 3.86 which alleges that TSTT applied pressure upon Nortel to slow down delivery of the interconnection equipment and that such pressure was successful in delaying interconnection. Paragraph 3.86 was in the original unamended pleading. TSTT requested further information in relation to another part of paragraph 3.86 but not in relation to the part which asserted that TSTT had applied pressure on Nortel. Based on the way in which the Claimants answered other requests for information, it is fairly clear to me that if further information had been sought of the relevant part of paragraph 3.86, the information would not have been provided. However, the fact remains that further information of the relevant allegation was not sought. The allegation is general and not particularised. Nonetheless, in view of the fact that the conversation with Ms Bejar and Ms Ramos’ email referring to the date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 are mentioned in the pleading, I have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to prevent the Claimants putting the case they want to put as to the significance of those matters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have made my findings of fact as to the conversation between Mr Espinal and Ms Bejar at the end of September 2005. I now need to consider whether that conversation comprised conduct by TSTT which was contrary to honest practices. If the conversation had merely been to state TSTT’s preferences as to when it wished to have completion of the various projects for which TSTT was considering placing orders with Nortel, then the passing of information of that kind to Nortel might not have been contrary to honest practices. If on the other hand, the conversation was for the purpose of persuading Nortel not to permit interconnection to occur before the end of March 2006, then in view of the statements being made by TSTT to Digicel T&amp;T, the regulator and the minister, then I think that behaviour would cross the line and I would hold it was contrary to honest practices to behave in that way. My conclusion is that the conversation was for the second purpose referred to above and that TSTT in this respect acted contrary to honest practices.</p>

The Claimants submitted in their written closing submissions that the position as regards the assessment of the counterfactual was “relatively straightforward”. The Claimants explained their version of the counterfactual in a mere 3 pages, out of a total of 211 pages of closing submissions dealing with T&amp;T. That counterfactual was on the basis that there was an opportunity in December 2005 to bring forward the date for interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.

I do not agree. On the evidence the equipment in question was the equipment which had been ordered for Laqtel. The specification of the equipment for Laqtel was different from the specification for the equipment for Digicel T&amp;T. There was no specific evidence as to what would have been involved in modifying or supplementing the Laqtel equipment to make it suitable for Digicel T&amp;T. However, I think it is likely that the Laqtel equipment could have been modified or supplemented for this purpose.</p>

Even if Mr Espinal had had no relevant conversation with Ms Bejar in late September 2005, Nortel would still have needed to approach TSTT to seek its consent as to what should be done in this respect. When Nortel did try to approach TSTT on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, there was a delay because Ms Bejar’s email was not successfully transmitted to Mr Espinal. It is possible that Ms Bejar and Mr Espinal spoke later in December, alternatively, it is possible that Mr Espinal was not sounded out on the possible switch of equipment until 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006. TSTT was not under any legal obligation, at least without obtaining the consent of Laqtel, to direct Nortel to use the equipment ordered for Laqtel for the purpose of interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T.</p>

I can only speculate on that topic. I do not see why Laqtel would have been prepared to agree to any such proposal. On the evidence before me, I find that there was no real or substantial chance that Laqtel would have consented to the same. Accordingly, there was no real or substantial chance that any arrangements between Nortel and TSTT in late December 2005 or early January 2006, which TSTT was in any event not obliged to entertain, would have resulted in the date for interconnection with Digicel T&amp;T being brought forward to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.</p>

If TSTT had pressed Nortel for an early delivery date, then TSTT would be joining with Digicel T&amp;T and the regulator and the minister in asking Nortel to assist in that way. Again speaking generally, that suggests there might have been a possibility of Nortel achieving an earlier delivery date than it actually achieved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The other Nortel witness was Mr Taylor. The Claimants specifically called Mr Taylor to give evidence about the possibility of bringing forward the interconnection date.  He gave evidence about a possible interconnection date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, on which I have already made specific findings.  He also gave evidence about the possibility of delivery of equipment in week 52 of 2005, about which I have again made specific findings.  More generally, Mr Taylor’s evidence was to the effect that one could only speculate as to what might have happened if TSTT had tried to apply pressure to bring forward Nortel’s target delivery dates. In one sense, Mr Taylor is absolutely right. A question of the present kind as to what might have happened necessarily involves an assessment, or speculation, as to what might have happened in circumstances that did not actually exist. However, Mr Taylor’s evidence is, on the whole, unhelpful to the Claimants. When Mr Taylor did try to speculate on these questions, his comments as to interconnection by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 and as to delivery in week 52 of 2005 were, I find, wide of the mark. As regards other possible speculations, I interpret Mr Taylor to be saying that, in other respects to those that he mentioned, he simply could not tell what could have happened, and therefore what might have happened, in circumstances such as those which are now being considered.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">This assessment of what might have happened in other circumstances involves an assessment of how a third party, Nortel, might have behaved. The law is clear that where one has to assess the possible conduct of a third party, i.e. neither a Claimant nor a Defendant, the law is concerned to assess the chance of the third party acting in a particular way, which would have been more beneficial to the Claimants than the actual situation in which they were placed. The assessment does not involve the court finding whether particular conduct by the third party was more likely than not, and then either deciding that the third party’s conduct would definitely have happened or would definitely not have happened. Instead, the court has to assess the chance of the third party acting in the way contended for. If there was a “real” or “substantial” chance of a better result coming about, the court assesses what that chance was. If there was only a “speculative” chance of a better result, then that speculative chance is ignored. The legal principles are stated in the well known case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons </span> [1995] 1 WLR 1602. Although this is, to my mind, clearly the position, the Claimants have not put their case that way. In the course of his opening, I asked Mr Rubin QC acting for the Claimants, on more than one occasion, whether he was contending for damages to be assessed on the basis that the Claimants had lost the chance of a better result, compared with the one which actually came about. He answered that the Claimants were not contending for damages to be assessed on the basis of a lost chance. In closing submissions, Mr Rubin repeated that that was the Claimants’ position but he added that the Claimants would wish to put forward, in the alternative to their principal claim, a claim to damages based on the loss of a chance of a third party acting in a way more beneficial to the Claimants than their actual position. The written closing submissions for the Claimants in relation to T&amp;T do not identify any case based on an alleged loss of a chance but seek to claim as damages 100% of the improvement in their position if Nortel had acted in a way which was more favourable to the Claimants.</p>

Nonetheless, the stance adopted by the Claimants in this respect does not encourage me to be too adventurous in speculating as to the possibility that the Claimants might have lost a chance of being better off, if Mr Espinal had not had his conversation with Ms Bejar in late September 2005. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Before coming to a view on the question of what might have happened in relation to Nortel’s conduct in certain circumstances, it is also necessary to consider what TSTT ought to have done. Speaking generally, I should proceed on the basis that TSTT would have performed any legal obligations upon it at the relevant time. TSTT was only placed under a legal obligation in relation to the progress of interconnection when it was granted its concession on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005. Up to that point it was not obliged to put pressure on Nortel to improve on delivery dates for interconnection equipment. As regards TSTT’s obligations under section 4 of PAUCA, it was not contrary to honest practices for TSTT to decline to put that pressure on Nortel. It was perfectly entitled to say to Digicel T&amp;T and to the regulator and to the minister that it would not put pressure on Nortel in this way. TSTT was even entitled to say to Nortel that it did not wish to see interconnection completed until 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, provided that TSTT did not say inconsistent things to Digicel T&amp;T, the regulator and the minister. As described above, TSTT did say inconsistent things to those persons but its protestations were simply not believed. It is possible, albeit rather difficult to tell, whether TSTT would have been prepared to be candid with Digicel T&amp;T, the regulator and the minister, and have explained that unless and until it was placed under a legal obligation to act otherwise, it was not prepared to take steps which might result in interconnection being completed before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. It is much too speculative to attempt to assess whether, if TSTT had said that, the government in T&amp;T would have granted a concession to TSTT before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2005 and thereby brought forward the date when TSTT came under a legal obligation in relation to interconnection.</p>

Physical interconnection is usually not enough to allow a new entrant to launch its network. The new entrant normally needs both physical and contractual interconnection. The events in relation to contractual interconnection in T&amp;T were somewhat unusual. When setting out my findings of fact in relation to T&amp;T, I described the sequence of events which led to the decision of the arbitration panel on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.</p>

Similarly, the Claimants put forward no submission to the effect that contractual interconnection would have been concluded before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, but for the matters alleged against TSTT. This was a remarkable state of affairs. It meant that even if I held that TSTT had acted unlawfully in delaying physical interconnection, the Claimants put forward no reasoned case that contractual interconnection (or an alternative way forward imposed by an arbitration panel) would have come about before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. TSTT drew attention to this point and the absence of any submission on it from the Claimants when, in turn, TSTT made its written closing submissions. This prompted the Claimants in their oral closing submissions to submit, for the first time, that if physical interconnection had been completed before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 then the dispute resolution procedures would have led to a conclusion earlier than 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, but to the same effect as the actual decision of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  </p>

Conversely, if physical interconnection were only completed a few weeks before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, it becomes much less likely that those procedures would have been expedited to any marked extent. In the end, the debate on what, to my mind, is a critical element in the assessment of the case on loss of a chance came down to the Claimants asserting that it was obvious that they were right on the point, without seeing any need to examine the individual steps in the period January 2006 to March 2006 in order to see how, and if so when, the actual timetable towards the decision on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 might have been shortened.

I can see that there was a possibility that this might have occurred a few weeks before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. In the light of all the evidence, and in particular the evidence of Mr Taylor, I do not think that I could find that the chance of that happening was greater than 50%. Overall, I do not think it would be right to assess the chance as being above a 1/3 chance. I consider that this 1/3 chance should be downgraded further to allow for the possibility that it was open to TSTT to invite Nortel to act as it actually did act, without TSTT doing anything unlawful. Finally, if physical interconnection might have been brought forward, but only by a few weeks at the most, then I do not think that I could reach the conclusion on the material (or more properly the lack of material) before me that there was a real or substantial chance that the arbitration procedures would have been appreciably speeded up so as to produce a decision from the arbitration panel, favourable to Digicel T&amp;T, on any date earlier than the date of the actual decision, 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. In these circumstances, the chance of Digicel T&amp;T being better off if Mr Espinal had not had his conversation with Ms Bejar in late September 2005 was not “real” or “substantial” but was “speculative” only. In law, the loss of such a chance is not loss and damage for which damages are awarded.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">For the sake of completeness, I will now address the further paragraphs of the Claimants’ pleading in T&amp;T, which are referred to in paragraph 4.2(q) of that pleading, in support of the general allegation that TSTT exerted influence over Nortel.  I will deal only with the alleged exercise of influence up to the end of December 2005. I limit my examination to that period in view of the evidence of the Claimants’ own witness, Mr Taylor, to the effect that in January and February 2006 Nortel worked hard to achieve the interconnection date of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  </p>

In my judgment, this allegation, if true, would not amount to conduct contrary to honest practices on the part of TSTT.  </p>

This is alleged to be the result of pressure by TSTT on Nortel.  In my judgment, even if the allegation were true as a matter of fact, I do not see how it caused any loss to Digicel T&amp;T.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The overall result of the above findings of fact and other conclusions is that Digicel T&amp;T has succeeded in establishing that TSTT acted contrary to honest practices in relation to the composition of and the use of Mr Davy’s letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 and in relation to the conversation which Mr Espinal had with Ms Bejar in late September 2005. However, I have concluded that TSTT’s conduct in relation to the composition of and the use of Mr Davy’s letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2005 has not been shown to have caused delay in achieving interconnection between the parties in T&amp;T. Further, Digicel T&amp;T has failed to establish that it suffered loss and damage as a result of the conversation referred to above in that Digicel T&amp;T has failed to show that it lost a real or substantial chance of having been better off if that conversation had not taken place.</p>

The parties agree that at this meeting, Digicel TCI offered to provide to CWWI at no charge a MUX which was described as being a spare TN-1C MUX.  CWWI’s response was to decline the offer “for now”.  CWWI stated that if it became a critical item for the purposes of arranging interconnection, CWWI would reconsider the offer.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The 2004 Ordinance and the 2005 regulations contained detailed provisions as to interconnection between telecommunications operators.  Digicel TCI accepts that those provisions did not apply in January 2006 because at that time Digicel TCI did not have a licence in TCI.  It acquired its licence on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. However, Digicel TCI points to section 13(5) of the Ordinance which provides that a licensee must comply with the terms and conditions of its licence.  Digicel TCI refers to the licence granted to CWWI, coincidentally, on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006.  Clauses 13.4 and 13.5 of that licence contain certain provisions prohibiting certain anti-competitive behaviour.  Digicel TCI argues that CWWI’s stance at the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 was anti-competitive behaviour in breach of the licence and therefore in breach of section 13(5) of the Ordinance.  I have already held that the provisions prohibiting certain forms of anti-competitive behaviour contained in clauses 13.4 and 13.5 of the licence did not place on CWWI obligations in relation to interconnection when the specific legislation dealing with the question of interconnection, namely, the 2004 Ordinance and the 2005 regulations did not place any interconnection obligations on CWWI.  In other words, in circumstances where the Ordinance and the regulations did not require CWWI to make progress towards interconnection in January 2006, I do not interpret the prohibitions on anti-competitive behaviour contained in the licence as imposing interconnection obligations on CWWI.  For these reasons, whatever was the reason for CWWI’s stance at the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, that stance was not a breach of any duty owed to Digicel TCI.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Notwithstanding the above conclusion, I will deal relatively briefly with certain matters of fact which were disputed in relation to the TN-1C MUX, which was the subject of the offer in January 2006.  At the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, there was no discussion as to whether the MUX was new or second-hand.  Digicel TCI did not say one way or the other and CWWI did not ask.  Digicel TCI in its closing submissions asked me to find that the MUX in question was brand new.  In fact, the documents show clearly that the MUX was not brand new. The position is described in some emails of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 and in particular an email of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 from a Mr Dabreo to Mr Wilson. These are internal Digicel emails.  The position appeared to be that the MUX in question was powered and wired up as a back up MUX in SVG.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">At the trial, CWWI called various witnesses to express their reasons for not being ready to accept the MUX when offered in January 2006.  One of those reasons concerned the availability of a direct warranty from Nortel, the original supplier of the MUX, to CWWI.  Again, the documents show some information relevant to this question.  An email of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006 from Mr Henry of Nortel to Maeve Collins of Digicel TCI describes the position about Nortel warranties in relation to this MUX.  This email shows that the MUX was out of warranty some time before 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006 and there were other difficulties in relation to the provision of a warranty to CWWI.  Ms Collins summed up the position in an internal Digicel TCI email of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006 to the effect that the warranty issue was “resolvable but bit of a nightmare”.  Whilst this was the factual position as to the warranty, these matters were not known to CWWI in January 2006.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I can deal straightaway with the allegations that any delay by CWWI in ordering optical equipment was a breach of the 2004 Ordinance and of the 2005 regulations. Digicel TCI did not obtain a licence in TCI until 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  Until that date CWWI did not owe any duty to Digicel TCI under the Ordinance or the regulations.  Further, I have held that the Ordinance and the regulations did not oblige CWWI to order equipment before the parties had entered into an interconnection agreement.  On the facts, CWWI ordered the optical equipment on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.  There was no interconnection agreement by that date.  The actual interconnection agreement was made on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006 (and executed on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2006).  Although the Claimants say that there was delay in the parties entering into an interconnection agreement, they do not assert that the interconnection agreement ought to have been made before 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.  For these reasons, there is no case for saying that CWWI committed a breach of duty under the Ordinance and/or the regulations by reason of the alleged delay in ordering the optical equipment.  Accordingly, the discussion which follows as to whether CWWI was in breach of a duty owed to Digicel TCI, as a result of the time taken for it to order the optical equipment, is exclusively dealing with the case that CWWI was in breach of the MOU in those respects.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">As explained, the MOU was recorded in a letter from CWWI dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2006.  This letter was counter-signed by Digicel TCI on or about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 and the signed copy was emailed to CWWI on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  The deposit cheque was provided to CWWI on Monday 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  The last paragraph of the MOU refers to Digicel TCI counter-signing the letter and paying the deposit in order for the parties to proceed with physical and technical interconnection.  In these circumstances, either the MOU did not become contractually binding until Digicel TCI paid the deposit on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 or, if the MOU became contractually binding on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, CWWI was not obliged to take action under it until 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Before I embark on a recital of the detailed facts as to the ordering of equipment in TCI, I will make my finding as to what was “the required interconnect equipment” which CWWI was obliged by the terms of the MOU to order. In the main judgment, I have expressed my conclusion as to the meaning of the phrase “the required interconnect equipment” in the MOU. Applying that meaning to the evidence in this case, I find as follows: (1) the required equipment included a MUX and associated cabling; (2) the required equipment also included switching and signalling equipment to satisfy the forecast provided by Digicel TCI to CWWI; (3) this forecast required there to be 8 E1 (switching) ports and 2 LIU7 (signalling) ports; (4) this was the position when CWWI placed its order on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, referred to below, and at any earlier date when CWWI ought to have placed an order, for “the required interconnect equipment”.  I also find that later, in the second half of April 2006 and at the beginning of May 2006, Digicel TCI indicated that instead of waiting for all of this equipment to arrive, it would be prepared to launch with less switching and signalling equipment, using only 4 E1s and 1 LIU7. After that point, if it had been relevant to ask as to the extent of the “required interconnection equipment”, it would have been appropriate to reflect the reduced requirement on the part of Digicel TCI. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in"> I now consider the question of spare equipment available to CWWI in TCI and the effect, if any, of the availability of such equipment on the obligations of CWWI under the MOU. There was no reliable evidence that CWWI had at any relevant time spares which would have met the requirements of Digicel TCI’s original forecast for 8 E1s and 2 LIU7s. However, as the events showed,  CWWI had available to it sufficient switching and signalling equipment so that it was able to provide 4 E1s and 1 LIU7 in accordance with the revised forecast put forward by Digicel TCI in the second half of April and early May 2006. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also held in the my main judgment that on the true construction of the phrase “required interconnection equipment”, CWWI was entitled to take the time which it reasonably needed to acquire from Nortel not only the MUX and associated cabling but also other components relating to switching and signalling needed to effect interconnection without drawing on components in stock.  Thus if, in due course, I hold that CWWI was in breach of the MOU in that it failed to order “the required interconnect equipment” at the proper time, then I will need to compare the actual time when physical interconnection was concluded (using spare E1s and a spare LIU7)  with the time when physical interconnceciton would have been concluded if CWWI had performed the MOU in all respects by ordering a MUX and associated cabling and 8 E1s and 2 LIU7s, waiting for the arrival of that equipment and then installing and testing it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I will now deal with the detailed events in relation to the ordering of equipment in TCI. In developing their case that there was a breach by CWWI of the MOU, the Claimants have asked me to consider certain matters that took place before the end of February 2006.  On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, Mr Barnes of carrier services, who had some involvement with the proposed interconnection in TCI, prepared a business case for the purpose of seeking capital expenditure approval.  He sent this business case to a number of other persons who, as I understand it, were also at carrier services.  In the covering email, Mr Barnes referred to the business case as being “the first draft”.  He asked a Mr Jonothan Edwards to help with certain financial information and he asked Mr Chantrelle to confirm with the CWWI personnel in TCI the estimates which Mr Barnes had made for certain interconnection costs.  I will not set out the entirety of his email which was technical and detailed.  However, I comment on the fact that Mr Barnes identified a number of matters which needed to be checked, in particular checked with CWWI in TCI.  Mr Barnes explained that he had not obtained quotations from suppliers for the purposes of his figures as to costs but he had based his estimates on quotations received in other jurisdictions in the preceding six months.  Mr Barnes stated that his costs were based on the assumption that there was no need for a significant expansion of the network fabric in TCI and he did not expect his estimates to change substantially if this assumption was correct.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In view of submissions made to me, I need to refer in a little more detail to the contents of this business case.  The business case obviously follows a standard format.  The document prepared in January 2006 is some 12 pages long.  The document consists of a number of boxes, which are to be completed by the author.  Box 1, to the extent that it is completed, referred to the need to expand the CWWI network in TCI as regards switching, signalling and transmission equipment to facilitate interconnection with Digicel.  There were a number of figures left blank in box 1.  In case it may be material, I draw attention to the answers in box 9.  Those answers set out a specimen timetable.  On the basis that the business case was approved on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2006, the timetable involved a purchase order for the equipment being issued on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006.  Insofar as the business case describes the equipment which was to be purchased, it refers to an optic terminal at US $25,000, to an expansion to the switch at US $60,000, to signalling units at US $10,000 together with freight and labour charges.  Boxes 26, 26a and 27 contain a large number of detailed figures designed to set out the financial consequences of the proposal.  So far as I can tell from the documents placed before me and other evidence, this first draft of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 did not receive any detailed attention until after the MOU was entered into at the end of February 2006. </p>

The note of the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006 does not indicate what additional equipment was envisaged.  It seems likely that the equipment being referred to was more than simply a TN-1C MUX together with associated cabling, as the MUX is dealt with separately in the meeting note.  When the parties entered into the MOU at the end of February 2006, the MOU contained a term that when CWWI had ordered the interconnection equipment, it would inform Digicel TCI of the type of such equipment.  That is consistent with the parties not being fully aware at the end of February 2006 of precisely what equipment needed to be ordered.  </p>

Mr Mangan asked Mr Seymour to proceed immediately with ordering the equipment so that the expenditure would fall in the year to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  It was plainly considered important by the financial officers of CWWI that the equipment was ordered promptly and indeed delivered promptly for this purpose.  </p>

Their discussion in relation to equipment ordering referred to a period of 6 to 8 weeks and referred to two possibilities.  One was to order a TN-1C MUX and the other was to use the unit offered by Digicel TCI, in particular, at the meeting on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006.  The discussion on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 also referred to the civil works being completed by the end of March 2006, if they were started on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.

The internal Nortel documents indicate that CWWI had requested a quote for more than simply a MUX and associated cabling.  The documents referred to a PDTC “fully configured”. There was considerable discussion at the trial as to what a fully configured PDTC was.  A distinction was made between a cabinet, a frame (comprising two shelves) and one shelf.  I will not describe all of that evidence as it was accepted by Mr Gibbs on behalf of CWWI that he was not clear about the detail of those matters and that he had requested a quotation from Nortel for more equipment than was needed to effect an interconnection with Digicel.  The Nortel documents of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 indicated that Nortel was working to a timetable pursuant to which it would get a quotation back to CWWI by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  </p>

The meeting note does not refer to any specific discussion about the date for ordering the TN-1C but there was discussion about the time for Nortel to deliver the equipment.  The discussion appears to have been on the basis that CWWI was intending to order the TN-1C the following day.</p>

The emails referred to three different works numbers suggesting three different requests for quotations.  Much of the text in the emails no doubt made sense to Nortel but it is difficult for an outsider to interpret.  Doing the best I can, it seems that two of the requests for quotations dealt with a GSM network expansion or a GSM capacity expansion.  It is known from other documents that CWWI did wish to do works to a GSM network in TCI around this time.  The other request for a quotation appears to involve a MUX (although it refers to a TN-1X and not a TN-1C) and a PDTC.  One of the Nortel emails, referring to this request for a quotation suggests that Nortel was waiting for a reply from CWWI.  Whilst not fully clear, these documents suggest that Nortel was being held up in dealing with the request for the quotation for the MUX and other equipment as it was waiting for information from CWWI.  </p>

Her email refered to an order relating to a switch and a TN-1C.  That indicates that Digicel TCI understood that the equipment being ordered was the MUX and some switching equipment.  Ms Collins asked Mr Chantrelle whether the equipment had been ordered “last Friday”, which would have been 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  Mr Chantrelle replied on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 stating that the MUX order had been placed “since that is an off the shelf item”.  He added that the switching equipment engineering details had not yet been concluded with Nortel.  Mr Chantrelle did not give evidence at the trial.  The Claimants emphasised Mr Chantrelle’s reference to the MUX being an off the shelf item but other witnesses for CWWI suggested that this description was over simplified.  At any rate, Mr Chantrelle was describing a situation where the MUX order was placed separately from the switching equipment because there was a need for ongoing discussion about the engineering of the switching equipment.  In fact, by 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006, CWWI had not placed any order with Nortel.  </p>

Also on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, Nortel sent to Mr Gibbs its proposal for what it described as the trunking expansion for interconnection.  The proposal referred to a TN-1C with 32 E1s capacity to fulfil the transmission requirements.  In addition, further equipment was identified to fulfil signalling requirements and trunking requirements.  The copy of the proposal which I have seen does not include prices.  However, on the same day, CWWI prepared a draft purchase order for certain equipment where the total cost was approximately US $315,000.  In view of what happened later, I need to refer to some of the make up of this figure.  The cost for “optical equipment” is given as US $8,939.66 and the cost for “optical equipment – spares” is given as US $6,875.00.  The greatest part of the cost of US$315,000 was for TDM-equipment, at a figure in excess of US $256,000.  </p>

Mr Gibbs said that he asked Nortel to amend the proposal and he sought advice from a Nortel contractor, a Mr Ashdown, on how to reduce the cost of the proposal.

Expenditure of some US $315,000 had not been authorised within CWWI.  The capital expenditure approved on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 was US $150,000.  Mr Seymour the Chief Executive of CWWI in TCI did not have authority to approve expenditure of US $315,000.  The authority of Mr Macfee was needed for expenditure of that amount.  There is no sign that Mr Macfee, or anyone else, was ever asked to authorise expenditure of US $315,000.  Indeed, documents from early April 2006 make it clear that expenditure of that amount would not have been authorised.  Mr Gibbs says that he placed the order on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 fully intending to follow it up with a Job Change Order (“JCO”) to amend the order when he had negotiated a revised proposal from Nortel.  He thought that would save time rather than obtaining a new proposal and only then placing an order.  I am not able to accept Mr Gibbs’ evidence on this point.  The contemporaneous documents are inconsistent with an order having been placed on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  A copy of the order which has been produced appears to be a draft of an order as no one has signed in the appropriate place to authorise the order.  I think it is inherently improbable that Mr Gibbs would have placed the order without any authority.  I am also not impressed by Mr Gibbs’ suggestion that he placed the order in order to save time.  I treat this, and other parts, of Mr Gibbs’ evidence with considerable reserve.  It seems to me that Mr Gibbs did not co-operate with Digicel TCI and did not even co-operate with CWWI’s carrier services for the purpose of facilitating interconnection with Digicel.  As regards Digicel TCI, it was put to Mr Gibbs, on the basis of certain emails, that he was hostile to Digicel TCI.  The emails did powerfully suggest that that was so and I was unimpressed by Mr Gibbs’ denial.  As regards his lack of co-operation with CWWI’s carrier services, his own witness statement complained about the way in which, as he saw it, carrier services were making unreasonable demands on him and others at CWWI in TCI.  </p>

Thus, when Mr Gibbs requested a quotation from Nortel for a MUX and associated equipment, on or about 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, he obtained a quotation on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 and a purchase order was placed on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.  No doubt, those steps were able to be taken within a very short time scale because they had been preceded by the other events in March 2006.  However, the evidence supports the conclusion that it was a simpler and faster thing to seek a quotation for, and then place an order for, some US $16,000 worth of optical equipment and spares rather than seeking a quotation for, and then placing an order for, the more elaborate equipment the subject of Nortel’s quotation of 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  </p>

The updated plan continued to show that CWWI had ordered TN-1C equipment on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  Mr Chantrelle stated that CWWI was having difficulty obtaining a delivery schedule from Nortel and there were “issues” with Nortel’s equipment pricing.  On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, Ms Collins of Digicel TCI replied to Mr Chantrelle stating that she had learnt that the switch equipment had not been ordered and asked how that affected the project plan.  I have not been shown a response to her question.  </p>

The evidence was not clear as to what precisely was included in this order. However, the equipment which was ordered did include switching and signalling equipment and, in particular, some E1s and some LIU7s. There was no precise evidence as to when the equipment ordered on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 arrived but it clearly had not arrived when CWWI installed the MUX which had been ordered on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 and installed 4 E1s and 1 LIU7 taken from CWWI’s spare equipment.</p>

Although Digicel had stated in its original forecast that it required 8 E1s and 2 LIU7s on day one of launching its service, it in fact launched with the use of only 4 E1s and 1 LIU7 and this equipment was provided by CWWI from spare components which it held.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Having set out the detailed history of CWWI placing an order for interconnection equipment, I can now turn to the criticisms made by the Claimants.  The Claimants say that CWWI delayed in seeking approval for capital expenditure.  It will be remembered that CWWI obtained capital expenditure approval on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  It does not appear that they started the process of seeking that approval immediately following 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, the date on which the obligations in the MOU became effective.  The Claimants also say that CWWI delayed in seeking a proposal from Nortel.  The first point made is that CWWI could have sought a proposal from Nortel immediately following 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 as CWWI did not need to wait for approval to the capital expenditure being obtained on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006.  The Claimants say that the quotation which should have been sought from Nortel was a quotation for a TN-1C MUX and associated equipment, but not for the equipment desired to expand switching and signalling capacity.  Further, the Claimants say that even if some switching and signalling expansion in TCI was needed in order to accommodate interconnection with Digicel, CWWI could have installed the MUX and carried out interconnection testing using just one interface card and could then have installed extra switching and signalling later.  The Claimants also complain that the equipment for which a quotation was sought from Nortel in March 2006 was excessive as regards switching and signalling compared with Digicel’s original forecast.  The Claimants point to the fact that Digicel TCI was prepared to launch in TCI with only 4 E1 switching ports rather than 8 E1 ports and CWWI had sufficient capacity to accommodate interconnection at that level without the need to expand switching and signalling further at the point of interconnection.  The Claimants also say that CWWI delayed providing sufficient information for Nortel to prepare the proposal it sent on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006.  The Claimants build on these allegations by submitting that the delays were not accidental or due to incompetence or misunderstanding but were part of a preconceived deliberate strategy.  The Claimants also complain about the lack of information and, indeed, the misinformation which CWWI gave Digicel TCI during this process.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I can now state my conclusions.  I will begin with the provision of information from CWWI to Digicel TCI in the period from 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.  The MOU required CWWI to keep Digicel TCI informed of the current location of the interconnection equipment and its intended date of delivery to TCI.  In my judgment, CWWI broke that obligation time and time again.  First of all, it did not provide regular updates.  Its defence was that there was nothing to report.  I hold that CWWI was in any event required to describe the state of affairs at regular intervals.  Secondly, CWWI wrongly stated the facts on more than one occasion.  It follows that CWWI was in breach of contract in this respect.  Digicel TCI does not point to any loss which flowed from these breaches and I hold that Digicel TCI has failed to prove that it suffered damage as a result of these breaches of contract.  Accordingly, Digicel TCI is entitled to only nominal damages for these breaches of contract.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I next deal with the allegation that the way in which CWWI handled the ordering of equipment from 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 was part of a preconceived deliberate strategy to cause delay.  I do not make that finding.  So far as the members of the carrier services team at CWWI who were dealing with interconnection in TCI’s concern, the internal documents of CWWI indicate that they were trying to make timely progress in relation to ordering equipment.  I think the carrier services team were frustrated by the apparent inability of Mr Gibbs to make that progress.  As regards Mr Gibbs he did fail to co-operate with the carrier services team.  He appears to have thought that he was being asked to do too much by the carrier services team and he was not well disposed to Digicel TCI.  He also appears to have lacked the technical expertise himself and he did not have sufficient technical expertise within CWWI in TCI to call upon to enable him to handle the matter competently.  In fact he dealt with the matter most incompetently.  </p>

I hold that CWWI did delay, in breach of the MOU, in not seeking a quotation from Nortel prior to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006, say, on or about 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, which was a Wednesday.  It was not necessary to wait for capital expenditure approval before seeking a quotation. CWWI was also in breach of the MOU by incompetently losing time during March 2006 in liaising with Nortel.  Further time was unnecessarily taken in obtaining a quotation from Nortel by asking Nortel for a quotation for more extensive and more complicated equipment.  </p>

I do not think that CWWI would have been at fault if it had asked Nortel to provide a quote for a MUX, and associated cabling, by Wednesday, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. It may not have been possible for CWWI to have prepared a request for a quote by that date for the additional switching and signalling equipment required for interconnection with Digicel TCI. It may therefore have been necessary for CWWI to have made two requests for quotes. CWWI was entitled pursuant to the terms of the MOU to request a quote for equipment which complied with Digicel TCI’s forecast which required 8 E1s and 2 LIU7s. If CWWI had requested a quote for a MUX on or about 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and had requested a quote for switching and signalling equipment on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 or, possibly, a little later, then the best estimate I can make as to when Nortel might have provided such quotes would have been, say, within 3 weeks of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, that is, by 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2006.  </p>

If that had been the only matter, I might have hesitantly come to the view that capital expenditure approval could have been obtained one or two days earlier. In any case, capital expenditure approval, based on estimated figures, could have been obtained long before 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2006 (the date which I have selected, as explained in the last paragraph above).  No one has suggested to me that if capital expenditure approval based on estimated figures had been obtained before 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2006, there would have been any need to go back for further capital expenditure approval following a quotation on or about 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2006.  </p>

The difference between that date of 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006, when CWWI ordered a MUX and associated cabling, but not the necessary switching and signalling equipment, is some 13 days, i.e. just under 2 weeks.  </p>

If CWWI had performed the MOU, it would have ordered the MUX and the switching and signalling equipment on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. It would then have been entitled to wait until that equipment arrived and then to install it and complete physical interconnection. Although CWWI did not wait until the switching and signalling equipment (which it ordered on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006) arrived, as it used its spare equipment, it was not contractually obliged to resort to its spare equipment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The best evidence as to the expected delivery time of the switching and signalling equipment, as compared with the delivery time for the MUX and associated cabling, is shown by two project plans which were prepared by CWWI at the relevant time. The first of these project plans was sent under cover of an email from Mr Chantrelle of CWWI to Digicel TCI on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006. The second was sent under cover of an email from Mr Nelson of CWWI to Digicel TCI on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006. In the first project plan, the delivery time for a MUX was stated to be 28 days and the delivery time for switching and signalling equipment was stated to be 46 days, a difference of 18 days. In the second project plan, the comparable figures were 46 days and 30 days, a difference of 16 days. In a supplemental note prepared by the parties following the conclusion of oral argument, the parties agreed that the lead time for the relevant switching/signalling equipment was longer than the lead time for a MUX and they specifically referred to these two project plans.</p>

This would mean the equipment notionally ordered on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 would have arrived some 3 to 5 days later than a MUX ordered on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 would have arrived. In the event, CWWI did not wait for the delivery of additional switching and signalling equipment (which had actually been ordered on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006) as it drew on its spare equipment. But its contractual obligations under the MOU did not require it to do this. It was entitled to wait until the notionally ordered switching and signalling equipment arrived. </p>

I was asked to consider evidence given by Mr Gibbs and by Mr Fisher when cross-examined. Having considered that evidence, I conclude that I have not been given the necessary material to enable me to make an assessment of what time would have been taken in total by proceeding to test the interconnection before the arrival of the switching and signalling equipment which was on order and then completing all other stages necessary to allow physical interconnection with 4 E1s and 1 LIU7. Further, although I asked the parties, following the conclusion of the hearing, to provide information as to when the actual testing was carried out, the parties agreed that the evidence did not provide a clear answer to that question.

The Claimants have not identified in their closing submissions the date which they say is the date when the civil works were complete. The Claimants do not say that the time for completion of the civil works held up interconnection. Amongst the various references in the documents to which I was taken, the reference which identifies the latest date for completion of the civil works is a statement in an email of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006 from Mr Chantrelle to Miss Collins. The email suggests to me that it was predicted that the civil works would be completed on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006. As that date was only a few days after the date of the email, there is reason to think that the prediction in the email was accurate at the time and shows what probably did then happen. There is no other evidence from CWWI that the civil works were completed before the predicted date referred to by Mr Chantrelle. The Claimants have not called any evidence to show that the civil works were completed later than 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006.

That means that the Claimant’s claim in relation to the civil works is, at best, a claim for nominal damages. It does not seem to me to be appropriate to devote much time to considering the evidence as to whether there was or was not a breach in relation to civil works when, first, the claim would be limited to a claim for nominal damages only and, secondly, the evidence called by the Claimants is so exiguous on the subject. </p>

However, contrary to the submission of Digicel TCI, I have held that the prohibitions on anti-competitive behaviour in clause 13 of the licence did not add to the specific obligations owed by CWWI in relation to interconnection which, as I have said, were owed only to another licensee and therefore were only owed to Digicel TCI with effect from 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Digicel TCI relied on regulation 8(2) which exceptionally imposed an obligation on CWWI in relation to the period before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006. Regulation 8(2) provided that a dominant carrier must prepare and publish its reference interconnection offer (RIO) within 30 days of its grant of licence. Regulation 8(3) required a RIO to contain certain information and, in particular, regulation 8(3)(d) refered to the question of rates or pricing formulae. As CWWI obtained its licence on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006, the 30 day period referred to in regulation 8(2) expired on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. CWWI provided a draft RIO to Digicel TCI on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. That document followed the format used by the C&amp;W companies in other jurisdictions and I have previously described that format. In TCI, the document extended to some 136 pages. The document included a tariff schedule but no figures for the proposed tariffs were inserted in the document provided on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. Those figures were later provided to Digicel TCI on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. Because 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 was outside the 30 day period permitted by regulation 8(2) it follows that CWWI did not comply with regulation 8(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to assess whether non-compliance with regulation 8(2) caused loss to Digicel TCI, it is necessary to put this matter into its context. Although Digicel TCI did not obtain its licence until 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, it had requested, on various earlier occasions, interconnection with CWWI. It requested interconnection in 2005 but, more relevantly, it requested interconnection on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006. The parties met on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006. They discussed a draft interconnection agreement, which they called a RIO. CWWI stated that it would provide Digicel TCI with a draft RIO by 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. CWWI stated that the rates would not be included in the draft RIO. As I have indicated, CWWI did provide the draft RIO without rates or tariffs on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. </p>

That meeting was described by Mr de Goeij in an internal Digicel TCI document on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. He said that the meeting had been “an extensive meeting” and a great number of issues on the draft RIO had been resolved and that CWWI had agreed to present Digicel TCI with its tariffs. He described the meeting as “fair” and that there was “real progress”. A note of the meeting recorded that Mr Nelson of CWWI agreed to send the tariffs to Digicel TCI by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006, Mr Nelson emailed Mr de Goeij apologising for the fact that he was unable to send the tariffs to Digicel TCI that day. Internal CWWI documents from that time show that CWWI was working on finalising the tariffs and was encountering certain complications which continued until 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. The parties agreed that the tariffs were sent to Digicel TCI on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. </p>

Thus, although CWWI did not perform its obligation under regulation 8(2), I do not see how that breach caused any loss to Digicel TCI. That finding is supported by another specific matter to which I now refer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">When Digicel TCI obtained CWWI’s rates on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006, it considered them and considered them completely unacceptable. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2006, Mr de Goeij prepared a memo for the Chief Executive of Digicel TCI. The memorandum contained Mr de Goeij’s recommendation as to the way forward. The recommendation was that Digicel TCI should push for completion of technical interconnection and “keep the issue of pricing until the last moment”. Mr de Goeij gave similar advice internally in Digicel TCI on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006. He recommended that Digicel TCI should not respond to CWWI’s tariffs for reasons of strategy. On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2006, Mr de Goeij gave a presentation within Digicel TCI. He recommended that Digicel TCI should push for technical interconnection first and prepare for dispute resolution proceedings on the question of rates. As this was Digicel TCI’s strategic response following 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, when CWWI had an obligation under the regulations to negotiate with Digicel TCI, I cannot see that Digicel TCI would have been any better off, or further advanced, if the rates which were put forward on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 had been put forward earlier in a draft RIO on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. </p>

A meeting between the parties had been arranged for 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 and was then cancelled. Mr Nelson of CWWI gave evidence that this meeting clashed with another meeting. There was no satisfactory evidence either way to corroborate that statement. I suspect that CWWI did not give meetings with Digicel TCI any priority at this stage, which was before Digicel TCI had obtained the licence and therefore before CWWI owed any obligations to it. Because CWWI did not owe any obligation to Digicel TCI at this stage, there cannot have been a breach of duty by cancelling the meeting, whatever the reason for the cancellation might have been. Further, emails from the time show that Digicel TCI was relatively unconcerned about the cancellation of the meeting on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. </p>

Of course, until 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, CWWI did not have an obligation to negotiate with Digicel TCI. Notwithstanding that there was no face to face meeting in this period, there were many communications by email as to the terms of the draft interconnection agreement. In particular, I refer to emails on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006.

At that time there were some 91 issues that were being discussed. The first 84 of these issues did not concern tariffs. The last 7 issues related to the subject of tariffs but Digicel did not put forward any counter proposal as to rates. </p>

The parties agreed certain of these issues and left others for further deliberation. Digicel TCI also requested a mobile to mobile interconnection service, which was different from the interconnection service they had earlier requested and which was the subject of the discussions. A mobile to mobile interconnection service would have avoided the transit of Digicel TCI’s calls across CWWI’s fixed network and would have eliminated the need to agree a transit rate. In the event, when the parties settled the terms of an interconnection agreement, it was not for mobile to mobile interconnection. At this meeting, Digicel TCI did not make a counter proposal to the rates put forward by CWWI. Instead, Digicel TCI asked CWWI to make a revised proposal. In my judgment, it is not necessary to explore whether the parties should have had a meeting after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006 and before the actual meeting on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 because I am not able to find that a meeting in that period would have produced a result different from the position the parties were in at the end of the meeting on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006. </p>

As all of this period was before Digicel obtained its licence on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, it is not necessary to examine this matter in detail. If CWWI had been under an obligation to progress the matter, then it is entirely possible that the matter could have proceeded with more urgency. However, given the absence of an obligation on CWWI, it is not meaningful to judge whether the rate of progress did or did not conform to the non-existent obligation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context, Digicel TCI stresses the importance of an email sent by Mr Vandendries of CWWI carrier services to Mr McNaughton on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. The background to this email was that on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, Mr Vandendries had sent a marked up version of the draft MOU to Mr de Goeij. Mr de Goeij’s email server sent an automatic message that he was currently out of the office and would return on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. The message stated that if the matter was urgent, contact could be made with Mr Gorton of Digicel. On receipt of that automatic message, Mr Vandendries emailed Mr McNaughton pointing out that the email would not be read by Mr De Goeij and stating that “the helpful thing” to do would be to forward the email to Mr Gorton. Conversely, “the delaying tactic” would be to do nothing. In fact, Mr Vandendries forwarded the email to Mr Gorton on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006. This little episode shows that as at 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006, certain members of the carrier services team were, at least, considering the desirability of time passing without progress being made, in other words, delaying the progress of negotiations. In the event, the carrier services team did not take advantage of the opportunity to introduce an element of delay. This was at a time when CWWI was not under an obligation to progress negotiations. The episode indicates that CWWI, or at least some members of the carrier services team, did not have interests of their own to bring forward the conclusion of negotiations. As against that indication, it is clear that CWWI did take steps which it was not obliged to take, such as entering into the MOU and ordering equipment in advance of an interconnection agreement. Further, even if the conclusion I drew from the email of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 was that CWWI was disinclined to do things which it was not obliged to do, that attitude on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2006 does not necessarily describe the attitude which CWWI took, following 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2006, when CWWI was under certain obligations under the Ordinance and the regulations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The remaining allegations made by the Claimants about the progress of the negotiations for contractual interconnection in TCI all concern the negotiating positions adopted by the parties in relation to rates. There were three rates in dispute between the parties. The first was the mobile termination rate (MTR). The second was the fixed termination rate (FTR). The third was the transit rate. Before describing the course of the negotiations on rates in TCI, I need to refer to the provisions of the 2004 Ordinance and the 2005 regulations which are potentially relevant. Section 22 of the 2004 Ordinance obliged CWWI to provide interconnection timeously to Digicel TCI. As regards the regulations, the subject of rates is dealt with in regulations 14, 15 and 19. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In summary, regulation 14 specifies what can be agreed as the basis of the charge for interconnection. Regulation 14 deals with a party “providing” interconnection or charging for interconnection. Accordingly, regulation 14 is concentrating upon the rate which is ultimately agreed between the parties. Regulation 14 does not therefore directly deal with the negotiating positions of the parties. If in the course of negotiations, a negotiating party put forward a rate which could not pass the test of regulation 14 then whether that stance was contrary to the regulations would depend on what the regulations elsewhere provided. For example, if the regulations said that a party must negotiate in good faith then a party who knowingly put forward a rate which did not conform to regulation 14 might be said to be acting otherwise than in good faith. Conversely, if a party put forward a rate which did not conform to regulation 14 in circumstances where that party genuinely believed the rate did conform to regulation 14, then in my judgment, that party would not be acting otherwise than in good faith. </p>

That does not necessarily mean that the position in negotiations must always involve transparency. Regulation 14(3) provides that a dominant carrier must provide interconnection at rates that are “cost-oriented”. Regulation 14(4) defines “cost-oriented”. The definition refers to the stand-alone costs of providing the service and also to the long-run average incremental costs of providing the service. Regulation 14(6) provides, in the ordinary case, that a dominant carrier may use a cost accounting method of its choosing for ensuring that its charges for interconnection are cost-oriented. </p>

Regulation 15 describes what the regulator may do if it is required to determine whether a particular rate, which has been agreed between the parties, is or is not cost-oriented. Regulation 15 does not deal with the methodology to be adopted by a carrier in fixing the rate for the provision of interconnection and, much less, for determining the negotiating stance that can be adopted in relation to rates. A carrier may take the view that if there is to be a challenge to a rate and if that challenge went to the regulator for determination and if that regulator were to adopt the principles set out in regulation 15, it might be sensible for the carrier in the first instance to adopt the same methodology. However, regulation 15 does not impose that methodology as such on the carrier. </p>

As will be seen, Digicel TCI wrote to the regulator on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2006 making its case that it was not dominant within regulation 19(1), but the regulator did not formally deal with that request. Regulation 19(2) provides that a carrier described in regulation 19(1) may not charge an interconnecting carrier or service provider an MTR that exceeded 15 cents per minute. This applied to the rate which CWWI could charge Digicel TCI. It also applied to the rate which Digicel TCI could charge CWWI unless the regulator were to accept that the presumption of dominance did not apply to Digicel TCI (see regulation 19(1)) or unless the regulator modified the operation of regulation 19(2). </p>

Regulation 9(5) requires a carrier to negotiate in good faith with the objective of concluding an interconnection agreement.

I accept that submission. The Claimants assume that the reference to “terms and conditions” in regulation 6(3) includes rates. I am not wholly persuaded that that is so. In one sense, a term as to a rate is part of the terms and conditions as to interconnection. However, regulations 14 and 15 deal specifically with rates and it may be that the right reading of regulation 6(3) is that it is dealing with terms and conditions other than rates. Regulation 6(3) refers to the terms and conditions being “reasonable”. If regulation 6(3) is dealing with rates, amongst other things, and if rates therefore have to be reasonable, it seems to me that if a party in the course of negotiations puts forward a rate which does not infringe regulation 14 then that position would not be open to challenge on the basis that the rate was in some other way not reasonable. Regulation 6(3) directs one to have regard “to economic feasibility” when considering whether terms and conditions are reasonable. If regulation 6(3) is dealing with rates, amongst other things, then I do not think that one can use the reference in regulation 6(3) to economic feasibility to override the direction as to cost-oriented rates in regulation 14. For example, it would not be open to a provider of an interconnection service to say that a cost-oriented rate is not economically feasible for it so that it wanted to charge more. Similarly, if an interconnection provider puts forward a rate which is cost-oriented and which conforms to regulation 14, it would not be open to the party requesting interconnection to assert that that rate was not reasonable because it was not an economically feasible rate from the point of view of the party requesting interconnection. </p>

The relevant rates were a reciprocal MTR of 15 cents and a FTR of 6.4 cents and a transit rate of 6.2 cents. The FTR of 6.4 cents was sub-divided into a call setup charge of 2.7 cents and a call duration charge per 60 seconds of 3.7 cents. The transit charge of 6.2 cents was sub-divided into a call setup charge of 2.7 cents and a call duration charge per 60 seconds of 3.5 cents. The first question to address is the derivation of these rates. There is no dispute about the fact that CWWI had a costs model which it had available to use to determine the rates appropriate in TCI. Mr Forrest of CWWI gave evidence that the rates put forward on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2006 were the product of introducing certain inputs into the cost model.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants compared the rates in TCI with rates in other Caribbean countries. However, in my judgment, that takes one nowhere. There is every reason to believe that the costs in different countries will, or might, be different so that cost-oriented rates in different countries will, or might, be different. The Claimants retort that the rates in TCI were much higher than elsewhere but if, as I hold, I cannot use a rate from another country as a comparator for a rate in TCI, then I am not able to form any view by reference to whether the rate in TCI is a little different or a lot different from another rate in another country. </p>

It is right that CWWI later agreed to accept a lower FTR and a lower transit rate and agreed a higher MTR. It is clear, however, that the figures ultimately agreed were the result of very tough bargaining under pressure from the government and the regulator, both of whom were trying to drive the parties to make a financial settlement. The government and the regulator seem to me to have been more intent on getting an agreement between the parties that would not operate against the public interest rather than paying close attention to what a costs model did, or might, justifiably show as a cost-oriented rate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants also rely on evidence from Mr Barrins who was himself involved in the negotiations on the rates in TCI. Mr Barrins is an economist but he was not called as an expert witness. He was involved in negotiations where passions ran very high and I do not think I can regard Mr Barrins as a wholly objective commentator on this point. Mr Barrins has never seen the CWWI costs model so his views as to what such a costs model could, or could not, properly show are of very little help to me. Further, Mr Barrins concentrated on the words “economically feasible” and discussed the impact of CWWI’s rate on the position of Digicel TCI. As I have explained, I would not regard the words “economically feasible” as entitling Digicel TCI to insist on a rate which worked economically for it and to allow it to reject a rate which otherwise conformed to regulation 14. Further, in any event, the Defendants relied with some force on internal Digicel TCI documents which showed levels of return for Digicel TCI which called into question some of Mr Barrins’ evidence as to what was economically feasible. In these circumstances, in the absence of any explanation of how the costs model worked and in the absence of any expert evidence on the subject and in the light of the other considerations to which I have referred, I regard it as virtually impossible for me to hold that the rates put forward by CWWI in TCI were not cost-oriented rates. </p>

CWWI would only be guilty of bad faith in relation to the negotiations, in a case like the present, if it knew that the rates could not be justified and the rates were being put forward to delay the progress of the negotiations. Similarly, CWWI would not be guilty of a breach of an obligation to act in a timely manner unless it could be shown that the rates were put forward with a view to dragging out the negotiations. On the evidence before me, I am not able to find that the Claimants have established any of those matters in relation to CWWI’s stance in the negotiations. </p>

I have a note of these meetings. The parties discussed the rates. Digicel TCI asked to be told the location of CWWI’s mobile switch. That is because Mr Barrins understood from a discussion on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2006 that the mobile switch was not in TCI, but was in Barbados. Mr Barrins thought that the location of the switch might be material to the transit rate. It is agreed that CWWI did not give an answer to Mr Barrins on or after 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006. At these meetings, Mr Barrins proposed a non-reciprocal MTR, that is, a situation where the rate which CWWI would pay to Digicel TCI and the rate which Digicel TCI would pay to CWWI would be different rates. Mr Barrins proposed that CWWI would pay Digicel TCI the rate of 25 cents while Digicel TCI would pay CWWI a rate of below 15 cents. There is a dispute as to whether Mr Barrins specified what the rate below 15 cents would be. Mr Barrins says that he offered 10 cents; that is disputed by CWWI. There is also a dispute whether any such offer was open or without prejudice. In the end, it does not seem to me to matter. </p>

Mr Vandendries of CWWI carrier services made a presentation on the legal issues and Mr Forrest of CWWI carrier services made a presentation relating specifically to rates. There is an issue as to whether the regulator said anything, and if so what, at the meeting 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2006 about regulation 19. I have already described the operation of regulation 19. Regulation 19(1) refers to a presumption of dominance on the part of an operator. Digicel TCI had written to the regulator on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2006 making its case that it was not dominant within regulation 19(1) but the regulator did not formally deal with that request. Regulation 19(2) provided that a carrier described in regulation 19(1) could not charge an interconnecting carrier or service provider an MTR that exceeded 15 cents per minute. This applied to the rate which CWWI could charge Digicel TCI. It also applied to the rate which Digicel TCI could charge CWWI unless the regulator accepted that the presumption of dominance did not apply to Digicel TCI (see regulation 19(1)) or unless the regulator modified the operation of regulation 19(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">On the evidence before me, I think that the most accurate statement as to what the regulator said at the meeting on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2006 is reflected in the evidence of Mr Vandendries, to the effect that the regulator indicated to the parties that they should approach the negotiations on the basis that the 15 cent cap might be lifted, without confirming that it would be lifted. In other words, the regulator who was keen to see the parties arrive at a commercial deal, wanted the parties to explore the possibility of a commercial deal at a rate above 15 cents. Of course, even if there was no statutory prohibition on a charge above 15 cents, it does not necessarily follow that a party who continues to put forward a rate of 15 cents in negotiations is somehow breaking the regulations as to permissible negotiating stances. </p>

Digicel TCI did not wish to refer a dispute to the regulator because it was concerned that the time limits in the regulations for dispute resolution were too lengthy. Instead, Digicel TCI wished the regulator to declare a dispute of its own motion and then to take steps to resolve it. The regulator did not respond to that invitation. There is an internal CWWI email of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2006 in which Mr Nelson refered to the regulator having stated that it was inclined to do nothing until after June 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. That date was approximately 90 days after the grant of the licence to Digicel TCI and the date of a valid request from Digicel TCI for interconnection. Regulation 6(3) refers to interconnection being provided on a timely basis “not to exceed 90 days”. It is not clear whether the commission had this period in its mind when referring to a possible deadline of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006. That note of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2006 is potentially of some significance when considering what stance the regulator might have taken in certain hypothetical circumstances, to which I will later refer. </p>

CWWI made substantial concessions in relation to the FTR and the transit rate, offering to accept substantially reduced rates. I accept Mr Nelson’s evidence about the meeting as regards the role of the regulator. The regulator wished to see the parties come to a commercial deal. He regarded the negotiations as being “all about money” rather than about points of principle on the interpretation of the regulations. Indeed, the regulator probably misunderstood what was involved in interconnection as he suggested a transit rate to be paid by CWWI to Digicel TCI whereas Digicel TCI had no fixed network on which such a transit would take place. </p>

The parties agreed a FTR of 3 cents and a transit rate of 1.5 cents. They agreed an MTR of 19 cents for an initial 18 month period and an MTR of 15 cents after the initial 18 months. The rate of 19 cents was to drop to 15 cents unless an expert consultant appointed by the regulator, and mutually acceptable to the parties, determined that another reciprocal charge, based on costs, should apply instead. The terms of reference of such a consultant and the rate study exercise format which he was to adopt were to be mutually agreed by the parties within a specified time. In the event, the 19 cent MTR applied for the initial 18 months and the MTR then did drop to 15 cents, as neither party operated the provisions as to an independent expert consultant fixing an alternative rate. </p>

Even if regulation 6(3) applied to the subject of a rate, rather than other terms and conditions, if the rate put forward was cost-oriented and compatible with regulation 14, it is not in my judgment open to attack on grounds of reasonableness or economic feasibility. Similarly, if the rate is not contrary to any requirement of the regulations, it cannot be attacked as being anti-competitive, within the general provisions about anti-competitive behaviour in CWWI’s licence. </p>

In summary, Digicel TCI says that if the pace of physical interconnection had been much more rapid, as they say it should have been, then the regulator would have seen that the matter which was really holding up interconnection in TCI was the pace of contractual negotiations and the regulator would have put much more pressure on CWWI to capitulate in those negotiations.

However, Digicel TCI had to retract that evidence when it was clear that the regulator had somewhat sat on the fence in those respects.

Contractual interconnection was completed on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006. CWWI was not in breach of duty in relation to the progress of contractual interconnection. Physical interconnection was completed on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2006. Although CWWI was in breach of the MOU, that breach did not delay completion of physical interconnection as compared with what would have happened if CWWI had performed its obligations under the MOU. This was essentially because although CWWI was in breach of its contract, it also did something which it was not contractually obliged to do, namely it made available its spare switching and signalling equipment and that speeded up the completion of physical interconnection. Digicel TCI is entitled to nominal damages by reason of CWWI’s breaches of the MOU by failing to order the required interconnection equipment as soon as reasonably practicable and by failing to keep Digicel TCI informed as it promised that it would. </p>

That case concerned the duty imposed on the occupier of a licensed dog-racing track by section 11(2)(b) of the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934. By section 11(2)(b) the occupier of a licensed track was placed under a duty to take such steps as were necessary to secure that, so long as a totalisator was being lawfully operated on the track, there was available for bookmakers space on the track where they could conveniently carry on bookmaking in connection with dog-races run on the track on that day. A contravention of this duty was a criminal offence. Section 30 of the Act set out the penalty which could be imposed on conviction. Section 29 provided that where a person convicted of such an offence was a body corporate, every person who at the date of the commission of the offence was a director or officer of the body corporate should also be deemed to be guilty of that offence, unless he proved that the offence was committed without his knowledge. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler</span>, the House of Lords held that a breach of the duty imposed by section 11(2)(b) did not give to a bookmaker, who suffered loss as a result of the breach of duty, a right to claim damages against the occupier of the track. At page 407, Lord Simonds stated that “the only rule” which applied for the purposes of asking whether a breach of duty was actionable was that the answer depended on a consideration of the whole Act and the circumstances, including the pre-existing law when the Act was enacted. There were “indications” which pointed with more or less force to one answer or the other. If a statutory duty was prescribed but no remedy by way of penalty, or otherwise, for its breach was imposed, it was to be assumed that a right of civil action accrued to the person damnified by the breach; otherwise the statute would be but “a pious aspiration”. But where an Act created an obligation and enforced the performance in a specified manner, the presumption was that performance could not be enforced in any other manner. The general rule was subject to exceptions so that even where a specific remedy was provided by the Act, a person injured by the breach could have a personal right of action in addition. Lord Simonds cited from the speech of Lord Kinnear in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Black v Fife Coal Company Limited</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">[</span>1912] AC 149 at 165. That case concerned a miner who suffered personal injury by reason of his employer’s failure to perform a statutory duty, aimed at safeguarding the safety of miners. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler</span> at page 408, Lord Simonds stated that the imposition of a criminal penalty emphasised that the statutory obligation was imposed for the public benefit and that a breach of duty was a public and not a private wrong. At page 409, Lord Simonds referred to “the primary intention of the Act”. If the consequence of the statutory duty being observed was that some bookmakers would be <span style="font-style:italic">benefitted</span>, that did not mean that the Act was passed for the benefit of bookmakers, in the sense in which the Factories Acts were considered to have been passed in favour of workmen in factories. At page 409, Lord Simonds considered the argument that the penalty provided by the Act was inadequate. He rejected that argument commenting that the penalties were severe. He added that conviction for an offence could lead to the disastrous result of a licence, held by the occupier of the track, being revoked. </p>

At page 412, Lord Normand emphasised the point that the duty in question could not have been intended to give every bookmaker a right of action and it was difficult to spell out a narrower class of bookmaker on whom a right of action might have been intended to be conferred. At page 413, when referring to the purpose of the statute, he referred to “the predominant purpose”. At page 414 he referred to “the overriding purpose”. Also at page 414, he referred to the provisions of section 29 under which a director or officer of a body corporate might be convicted of an offence, and also the power to withhold or revoke a licence required for the operation of a racing track, as being important sanctions being imposed by the statute. At page 416, when seeking to identify for whose benefit the provision was intended, Lord Reid referred to the “primary intention”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum Co Limited (No. 2)</span> [1982] AC 173, the House of Lords was concerned with the provisions of the Southern Rhodesia (Petroleum) Order 1965 which made it a criminal offence to supply oil to Southern Rhodesia. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had broken this prohibition and this had caused loss in various ways to the plaintiff. The House of Lords held that the breach of duty was not actionable by the plaintiff. At page 183G, Lord Diplock stated that it was well settled that the question as to the actionability of a breach of statutory duty was a question of construction of the legislation. At pages 185B to 186C, Lord Diplock summarised the general principles applicable. He referred to the presumption of actionability where the Act did not provide for any sanction for breach or other means of enforcement. Conversely, he referred to the presumption against actionability where the only means expressly provided in the statute for sanctioning a breach was prosecution for a criminal offence. This presumption was subject to two classes of exceptions. The first was where it was apparent on the true construction of the statute that the obligation or prohibition was imposed for the benefit or protection of a particular class of individuals; Lord Diplock referred to the Factories Acts and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Butler (or Black) v Fife Coal Company Limited</span> [1912] AC 149. Lord Diplock’s second exception was where the statute created a public right and a particular member of the public suffered “particular, direct, and substantial” damage “other and different from that which was common to all the rest of the public”. The Claimants relied heavily on this authority. In particular, they submitted that the duties on which they relied were passed for the benefit of operators, such as themselves, who requested interconnection to an existing fixed network and, further, they suffered particular and direct damage, different from any damage suffered by the public generally. I will examine those matters when I complete my review of the authorities but I will note at this point that the exceptions referred to by Lord Diplock are exceptions to the operation of a certain presumption and, as Lord Diplock points out, and as is a consistent theme of all the authorities, the answer to the questions requires an examination of the legislation as a whole in order to determine the intention of the legislator on the matter. </p>

In that case, the Court of Appeal held that a performer had a statutory right of action for breach of section 2 of the Dramatic and Musical Performers’ Protection Act 1958. The principal judgment was given by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C. At pages 51-52, he referred to a number of factors which pointed strongly against the Act creating anything other than a criminal offence. However, at page 52 he pointed out that the Act had been passed to comply with the Rome Convention for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations and he deduced the intention of Parliament to confer on a performer a civil right to obtain an injunction and, in consequence, a right to damages. </p>

The argument of counsel for Mr Hague is summarised in the speech of Lord Jauncey at page 168C-E. Counsel stressed that the absence of a statutory remedy or penalty for breach of the duty pointed to actionability. Lord Jauncey reviewed the authorities and stated at pages 170H-171A that it was always a matter for consideration whether the legislature intended that private law rights of action should be conferred upon individuals in respect of breaches of the relevant statutory provision. The fact that a particular provision was intended to protect certain individuals was not of itself sufficient to confer private law rights of action upon them and something more was required to show that the legislature intended such a conferment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.52in;text-indent:-0.50in">“The principles applicable in determining whether such statutory cause of action exists are now well established, although the application of those principles in any particular case remains difficult. The basic proposition is that in the ordinary case a breach of statutory duty does not, by itself, give rise to any private law cause of action. However a private law cause of action will arise if it can be shown, as a matter of construction of the statute, that the statutory duty was imposed for the protection of a limited class of the public and that Parliament intended to confer on members of that class a private right of action for breach of the duty. There is no general rule by reference to which it can be decided whether a statute does create such a right of action but there are a number of indicators. If the statute provides no other remedy for its breach and the Parliamentary intention to protect a limited class is shown, that indicates that there may be a private right of action since otherwise there is no method of securing the protection the statute was intended to confer. If the statute does provide some other means of enforcing the duty that will normally indicate that the statutory right was intended to be enforceable by those means and not by private right of action: <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Limited</span> [1949] AC 398; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum Co Limited (No. 2) </span>[1982] AC 173. However, the mere existence of some other statutory remedy is not necessarily decisive. It is still possible to show that on the true construction of the statute the protected class was intended by Parliament to have a private remedy. Thus the specific duties imposed on employers in relation to factory premises are enforceable by an action for damages notwithstanding the imposition by the statutes of criminal penalties for any breach: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Groves v Wimborne (Lord )</span> [1898] 2 QB 402.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The authorities were reviewed by Knox J in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mid Kent Holdings Plc v General Utilities Plc</span> [1997] 1 WLR 14 which concerned the actionability, or enforceability by the plaintiff, of an undertaking given by the defendant to the Secretary of State. The relevant legislation was the Fair Trading Act 1973, as amended by the Companies Act 1989. The judge commented on sections 93 and 93A of the 1973 Act. Section 93(1) provided that no criminal proceedings could be brought for contravention of an order made by the Secretary of State. By section 93(2), it was stated that section 93(1) did not limit the right of any person to bring civil proceedings in respect of such contravention. It was held that this did not confer a right to bring civil proceedings but left unaffected any right to bring such proceedings which might exist in some other way. Section 93(2) also provided for a contravention to be enforceable by civil proceedings by the Crown and, by inference, not by others. Section 93A which referred to “any person” bringing civil proceedings in respect of a breach of an undertaking was construed so that “any person” did not refer to anyone other than the Crown. This construction was arrived at to promote consistency between section 93 and Section 93A. The judge then considered the general law governing the availability of a civil remedy for a breach of a statutory provision. He summarised the law at page 36B - E. He stated that where a procedural remedy for a breach was provided by the statute, whether by way of a criminal sanction or other particular procedure (such as a civil action, only to be brought by a minister or other public officer) that was an indication that it was that procedural remedy alone that was intended by Parliament to be available as a sanction. This indication was, of course, subject to exceptions. The judge held that a breach of an order or a breach of an undertaking was not actionable at the suit of the plaintiff. At page 37D, he relied on the fact that if a breach of the order or of an undertaking was enforced by the Secretary of State, as it could be, matters of discretion and policy would enter into the action taken by the Secretary of State and those matters were not suitable for determination by a court, if a breach of the order or undertaking had been actionable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Todd v Adams and Chope, “The Maragetha Maria”</span> [2002] 2 Lloyds L R 293, the Court of Appeal considered the Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules, 1975. In that case, it was alleged that a fishing vessel did not comply with these safety rules. The vessel capsized and sank with the loss of all its crew. The question was whether a breach of the regulations was actionable. Neuberger J (sitting in the Court of Appeal) referred to a passage in the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition of Clark &amp; Lindsell on Torts at para. 11 – 02 which lamented the fact that legislation often failed to give express guidance as to the actionability of a breach of duty. It was said that determining Parliament’s intention was a haphazard process and although the courts relied on a number of presumptions, there were so many conflicting presumptions with variable weightings, making the result of a particular case unpredictable. At [16], Neuberger J restated that the question depended upon the construction of the particular statutory provision bearing in mind the language and purpose of the provision and all other relevant circumstances. He suggested that it was difficult, even dangerous, to attempt to lay down any rules of general application. He referred to the well known authorities in this area of the law. For reasons which were highly specific to the regulations in question in that case, the Court of Appeal held that a breach of the duty was not actionable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Claimants also relied on the decision of the ECJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Courage Limited v Crehan</span> [2002] QB 507. That case concerned breaches of article 81 of the EC Treaty, which prohibited contracts which were liable to restrict or distort competition. It was held that Mr Crehan had a right to sue Courage Ltd for damages when Courage Ltd and Mr Crehan had entered into a contract which infringed article 81. The reasoning of the ECJ did not involve the kind of reasoning which is appropriate when considering the actionability of a breach of a statutory duty. Instead, the ECJ concentrated on whether the ability to claim damages for a breach of article 81 would add to the effectiveness of the competition rules in article 81 and, if so, then such a remedy ought to be available. The ECJ commented upon the relevance of a claim to damages for breach of article 81 in paragraphs 26 and 27 of its judgment. It stated that the full effectiveness of article 81, and the practical effect of the prohibition laid down in article 81, would be put at risk if it were not open to any individual to claim damages for loss caused to him by conduct liable to restrict or distort competition. The existence of a right to claim damages strengthened the working of the competition rules and discouraged agreements or practices, which were frequently covert, which were liable to restrict or distort competition. In this way, actions for damages before the national courts could make a significant contribution to the maintenance of effective competition in the community. </p>

I will examine three of these ingredients in the following order: unlawful means, combination and intention to injure.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In Barbados, the Claimants’ case is based, first, on breaches of sections 25 and 28 of the Telecommunications Act 2001. Section 73 of that Act provides that a person who suffered financial loss as a result of another person's contravention of any of the obligations or prohibitions imposed by the Act is entitled to ask the court to award a reasonable amount in compensation. The Defendants accept that this makes a breach of section 25 or section 28 of the Act actionable and therefore an unlawful act for the purpose of the common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. However, it is not necessary for the Claimants to establish the common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means (i.e a breach of sections 25 or 28 of the Act) because section 73 (e) provides that a person who suffers financial loss as a result of another person's conspiring with any other person to contravene any provision of the Act, is also entitled to claim a reasonable amount from the person involved in the conspiracy referred to in section 73 (e). The Claimants have a second case in Barbados which is based on sections 16, 34 and 44 of the Fair Competition Act 2002. Section 44 of the 2002 Act makes actionable a breach of sections 16 or 34 of the 2002 Act. The Defendants accept that an actionable breach of sections 16 or 34 of the 2002 Act is an unlawful act for the common law tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Section 44(1) also expressly provides that a conspiracy to contravene sections 16 or 34 is actionable, but section 44(2) imposes a limitation period of 3 years. The interrelationship between the statutory torts of conspiracy and any alleged common law tort of conspiracy has given rise to various issues in relation to Barbados and I have referred to those issues when considering the claim in Barbados.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Claimants’ detailed submissions are as follows. They submit that "unlawful acts” for the purposes of the unlawful means conspiracy need not be privately actionable against one or more of the alleged conspirators. It is open to the court to adopt this approach, following the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Total Network</span> in which it was held that the common law crime of cheating the revenue amounted to "an unlawful act", despite not being privately actionable at the suit of the revenue. The House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Total Network</span> overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Powell v Boladz</span>. The result is that there is now no binding authority which requires the court to conclude that breaches of statutory duty, which are neither criminal nor tortious, are incapable of constituting "unlawful acts" for the purposes of the unlawful means conspiracy. Similarly, there is no binding authority which requires the court to conclude that breaches of contract are incapable of constituting "unlawful acts." The Defendant's stance of confining unlawful acts to actionable torts, and some crimes, should be rejected on the basis of both authority and principle. It would be arbitrary to treat criminality as a necessary precondition of non-actionable unlawful acts. With some criminal offences, at the lower end of the scale of seriousness, the distinction between criminal and non-criminal breaches of statutory duty is not necessarily of great significance, particularly as regards the potential impact of any breach on private individuals. The Claimants contend that if it is felt that a control mechanism is called for to keep the scope of liability in check, the control mechanism is not to be found in the definition of "unlawful acts" but is instead to be found in the requirement of "instrumentality ", i.e. the requirement that the unlawful acts are the means of inflicting harm and in the required mental element for an unlawful means conspiracy. As regards the mental element, the court should select a test for intention, which is a more strict test for intention than was adopted by the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG Ltd v Allen</span> [2008] AC 1 dealing with the tort of wrongful interference with contractual relations. </p>

The requirement of a predominant intention to injure, where the means used are lawful, is relaxed and replaced with a lesser mental element, where the means used are unlawful. It would be illogical to hold that a breach of statutory duty or a breach of contract were "lawful" acts requiring a claimant to satisfy the stricter test of intention, i.e. a predominant intention to injure.

The facts as described by Lord Halsbury LC [1892] AC 25 at 35 were as follows: an associated body of traders tried to get the whole of a limited trade into their own hands, and out of the hands of their competitors, by offering exceptional and very favourable terms to customers who would deal exclusively with the body of traders. The terms were so favourable that they would not have been offered save for the purpose of keeping the trade to themselves and away from the competition. If that action had been taken by one trader acting alone, then it could not be said that such a trader had done anything which would give a competitor the right to bring an action. However, it was argued that the combination of the traders meant that their conduct was an unlawful conspiracy. The argument provoked a division in the Court of Appeal with powerful judgments being given by the majority (Bowen and Fry LJJ) and Lord Esher MR dissenting. An appeal to the House of Lords was heard by a panel of seven Law Lords.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords, the judges pointed out that there was nothing (apart from the allegation of a conspiracy) which amounted to an unlawful act. The judges put the matters in different ways. For example, Bowen LJ in the Court of Appeal stated that the defendants had not done anything which was “unjustifiable in law”: (1889) 23 QBD 598 at 611. He later referred to things which a trader could not lawfully do (see at 614); his discussion was not for the purpose of defining what were unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy but to indicate what was unlawful for a trader acting alone. He held that the fact of a combination to do things, which were otherwise lawful, did not make them actionable where the intention was to enhance the traders’ business albeit at the expense of the competition. At 616 – 617, Bowen LJ considered whether there was a conspiracy to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means. Having already held that the acts complained of were not unlawful if done by an individual trader, he held that the combination to commit those acts was not a conspiracy to do an unlawful act or to use unlawful means.</p>

At page 37, Lord Halsbury stated that intimidation, violence, molestation or the procuring of people to break their contracts were unlawful acts so that a combination to procure people to do such acts would be a conspiracy and unlawful. At page 39, Lord Halsbury considered the argument that the combination was in restraint of trade and therefore “unlawful”. It was held that a contract in restraint of trade was void but was not “unlawful”. In this context, it was stated that “unlawful” meant “contrary to law”. Lord Bramwell at page 44 stated that the plaintiffs in that case did not complain of any trespass, violence, force, fraud, or breach of contract, nor of any direct tort or violation of any right of the plaintiffs, like the case of firing to frighten birds for a decoy; nor of any act, the ultimate object of which was to injure the plaintiffs, having its origin in malice or ill-will to them. Again, this list of matters of which the plaintiffs could have complained was not for the purpose of defining what were “unlawful acts” for the tort of conspiracy but to explain that the plaintiffs had no cause of action unless it could be said that a combination to carry out such acts was unlawful and actionable.</p>

(2) If the real purpose of the combination is, not to injure another, but to forward or defend the trade of those who enter into it, then no wrong is committed and no action will lie, although damage to another ensues.

This led Lord Cave to quote (at page 715) the French saying: “cet animal est très méchant; quand on l’attaque, il se défend”. Further, at page 716, Lord Dunedin referred to the plea from the Court of Appeal in that case, echoing the prayer of Ajax: “reverse our judgment an it please you, but at least say something clear to help in the future”.

That case concerned an application for an interim injunction and whether the plaintiff had shown that its claim involved a serious issue to be tried. The case did not involve an allegation that there was a conspiracy to injure by unlawful means; the tort which was discussed was described as the tort of interfering with the trade of business of the plaintiff with the intention to injure him by the use of unlawful means. The discussion in the Court of Appeal concerned whether a breach of statutory duty, which was not independently actionable, could be unlawful means for that purpose. Neill and Butler-Sloss LJJ thought that it was arguable that a non-actionable breach of statutory duty could be unlawful means for that purpose. Stuart-Smith LJ was more positive in favour of the proposition that the breach of statutory duty did not have to be actionable by the plaintiff; he also stated that a breach of contract which was not enforceable by the plaintiff could also be unlawful means for this purpose. That case went to the House of Lords, who reversed the Court of Appeal on the ground that there was no issue to be tried as to the alleged breach of statutory duty. I derive no assistance from this case. What constitutes unlawful means for the tort being considered in that case has now been authoritatively considered by the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG Ltd v Allen </span>and the test for unlawful means for that tort is not the same as the test for unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy. </p>

Ltd (No. 3)</span> [2006] QB 125 in connection with the test which should be applied as to the necessary intention to injure for the purpose of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. OK! had relied on the tort of unlawful interference with its business as well as the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. The latter tort was held to add nothing to a claim based on the underlying unlawful means which were themselves tortious. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concentrated on the tort of unlawful interference although it then went on to consider the question of intention by reference to authorities which included authorities as to the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means: see [152] and [178] – [193]. The argument before the Court of Appeal had identified five possible tests as to the requisite intention (see at [159]) and the court gave its conclusions at [223] – [224]. In my judgment, the most significant thing about the decision of the Court of Appeal on the issue of intention is that the House of Lords did not agree with that decision and, as will be seen, adopted a different approach. </p>

In the event, he held that he was bound by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Powell v Boladz</span> to hold that it was not. The case went to the Court of Appeal. The parties appear to have fully argued the issue about the meaning of unlawful means. However, when the court came to give its decision, it held that the claim by the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea based on an alleged conspiracy was not justiciable and the claims by Mr Mbasogo, the President of the Republic of the Equatorial Guinea failed for other reasons. In those circumstances, the court declined to consider the issues as to unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy: see at [102] – [104]. </p>

Nonetheless, I was asked to consider certain passages in the judgment of Davis J. The relevant passages are at [72] of the judgment. Davis J found it unattractive, and almost arbitrary, that an unlawful means conspiracy depended on the “virtual happenstance” of whether or not the unlawful means were actionable at the suit of the claimant and that the question whether the crime or the breach of a statute was independently actionable should determine whether the acts were unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy. He added that it appeared to be widely accepted that where the unlawful means involved a breach of contract, it did not need to be a contract enforceable by the claimant.</p>

The House considered the secondary liability involved in the tort of inducing a breach of contract. It considered the primary liability involved in the tort of causing loss by unlawful means. The speeches in the House of Lords provide a detailed analysis of the legal principles which apply to those torts. In several respects, the decision is a new departure for these torts and earlier distinctions and analyses were put aside. However, the House did not have to consider the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Nonetheless, it is relevant to see what was said about unlawful means for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means. Later in this judgment, I will refer to what was said about the test for the requisite intention in relation to that tort and the different test for intention or knowledge in relation to the tort of inducing a breach of contract.</p>

The qualification is that they will also be unlawful means if the only reason why they are not actionable is because the third party has suffered no loss. In the case of intimidation, for example, the threat will usually give rise to no cause of action by the third party because he will have suffered no loss. If he submits to the threat, then, as the defendant intended, the claimant will have suffered loss instead. It is nevertheless unlawful means. But the threat must be to do something which would have been actionable if the third party had suffered loss. Likewise, in </span>

In this respect, procuring the actions of a third party by fraud (dolus) is obviously very similar to procuring them by intimidation (metus).</span>

If a defendant intentionally harms a claimant directly by committing an actionable wrong against him, the usual remedies are available to the claimant. The unlawful interference tort affords a claimant a like remedy if the defendant intentionally damages him by committing an actionable wrong against a third party.

Lord Nicholls identified the two points of view in [150] and [151]. The wider view, in [150] is said to cover a wide range of matters. Lord Nicholls refered to torts and “statutory torts”; he did not include breaches of statute that are not torts. The wide view included breaches of contract. With one exception, all of the matters in the list were matters where a person could go to a civil court to seek a remedy. The exception is the case of a crime. The narrower class, in [151], is all civil wrongs. That again would exclude non-actionable breaches of statute and would also exclude crimes. Lord Nicholls refers at [156] to a case where the civil rights which are infringed are “statute-based”. That reference is explained in [157] – [160]. He had in mind, for example, statutes dealing with intellectual property rights where it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme for the courts to grant a remedy to someone other than the person entitled to a remedy under the scheme. He also mentioned a breach of a criminal statute dealing with road traffic: see at [160]. A crime under such a statute would not be unlawful means under his wider test because the crime was not committed “against” the claimant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">With the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, the defendant is liable to be sued by a third party for breach of a duty owed to that third party. Where the other requirements of the tort are satisfied, the claimant is also permitted to sue the defendant. In that way, the tort exposes the same defendant to a claim by an additional party. The tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means operates in a different way. One way in which it clearly operates is as follows: the claimant is entitled to sue a defendant (D1) for breach by D1 of a duty owed to the claimant. Where D1 has combined with another (D2) to commit that breach of duty, then subject to the other requirements of the tort being satisfied, the claimant can also sue D2. Thus, the tort allows a claimant to sue an additional party. It is also clear that the claimant can sue D1 and D2 even without an actionable breach of duty, if D1 and D2 had a predominant intention to injure the claimant. What is controversial is whether (without a predominant intention to injure the claimant) there are circumstances in which the claimant would not have been entitled to sue D1 if D1 had acted alone but because D1 and D2 have combined to injure the claimant by their actions, C is then entitled to sue both D1 and D2. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no escape from a detailed consideration of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Total Network</span>.  I start with the facts. The case concerned an unfortunately common form of fraud known as a carousel fraud, or missing trader intra-community fraud in relation to VAT. A number of persons combined together to produce a result that the Revenue paid to one of them a substantial sum by way of reimbursement of input tax allegedly paid by that person and recoverable under the VAT legislation and in circumstances where the Revenue’s right to recover VAT from another participant in the scheme was worthless, either because that other had disappeared or was insolvent. It was accepted that the person claiming and receiving reimbursement of input tax had committed the common law offence of cheat of the Revenue. The case was argued on the basis that even if the Revenue did not have an independent cause of action against any one of the conspirators, and even if the conspirators did not have the predominant intention of injuring the Revenue (as distinct from the predominant intention of benefiting themselves) the commission of the offence of cheat constitued “unlawful means” for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means and the conspirators could be sued by the Revenue to recover the sums it had paid out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is relevant to refer to some of the arguments of counsel. Mr Martin QC appeared for the Revenue. His primary submission was that unlawful means included crimes, where the crime was used against the claimant with an intent to injure and the crime was not merely incidental: see 1205 E-G. He made a secondary submission at 1206 A-D. This involved looking at the specific crime and inquiring as to the purpose of the creation of the offence and whether the claimant had suffered damage peculiar to itself. These matters are an echo of the matters which are relevant when asking whether a breach of a statutory duty is actionable.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">“44 The situation that is contemplated is that of loss caused by an unlawful act directed at the claimants themselves. The conspirators cannot, on the commissioners' primary contention, be sued as joint tortfeasors because there was no independent tort actionable by the commissioners. This is a gap which needs to be filled. For reasons that I have already explained, I do not accept that the commissioners suffered economic harm in this case. But assuming that they did, they suffered that harm as a result of a conspiracy which was entered into with an intention of injuring them by the means that were deliberately selected by the conspirators. If, as Lord Wright said in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana"> [1942] AC 435, 462, it is in the fact of the conspiracy that the unlawfulness resides, why should that principle not apply here? As a subspecies of the tort of unlawful means conspiracy, the case is virtually indistinguishable from the tort of conspiracy to injure. The fact that the unlawful means were not in themselves actionable does not seem, in this context at least, to be significant. As Professor Joe Thomson put it in “An island legacy-The delict of conspiracy”, Comparative and Historical Essays in Scots Law, ed Carey Miller and Meyers (1992), p 148, the rationale of the tort is conspiracy to injure. These factors indicate that a conspiracy is tortious if an intention of the conspirators was to harm the claimant by using unlawful means to persuade him to act to his own detriment, even if those means were not in themselves tortious.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">“My Lords, in agreement with my noble and learned friends and for the reasons they have given I too would hold that criminal conduct can constitute unlawful means for the purposes of a tortious conspiracy to injure by unlawful means: see para 95 of Lord Walker's opinion. It must, in my opinion, be kept in mind that the whole of this branch of the law of tort is the result of a step-by-step development by judges of the action on the case. We were taught at law school that the action on the case was the means whereby our judicial forbears allowed tortious remedies in damages where harm had been caused in circumstances where the conduct of the authors of the harm had been sufficiently reprehensible to require the conclusion that they ought to be held responsible for the harm. The law whereby harm caused by negligence can be remedied by an action in tort for damages results from a development of the action on the case. The law enabling an action for tortious damages to be brought where two or more persons have joined together with the predominant intention of injuring another person and have successfully carried out their intention is another, and for present purposes highly relevant, example of a judicial development of the action on the case. This is the so-called “lawful means” conspiracy which is tortious notwithstanding that the means employed to cause the harm are themselves neither criminal nor tortious. The essential ingredient of this type of action is the combination of people all intent on causing harm to the victim, not on the type of means employed for doing so. As it was put by Viscount Simon LC in Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1942] AC 435 , 445:  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">Where, however, unlawful means are employed by the conspirators to achieve their object and their object involves causing harm to the victim, the intent to cause that harm does not have to be the predominant purpose of the conspiracy. This difference between the torts of lawful means conspiracy and unlawful means conspiracy is sometimes described as anomalous. In my opinion it is not. The difference reflects and demonstrates the essential flexibility of the action on the case. It is not all conduct foreseeably likely to cause, and that does cause, economic harm to another that is tortious. Nor should it be. The circumstances must be such as to make the conduct sufficiently reprehensible to justify imposing on those who have brought about the harm liability in damages for having done so. Bearing that in mind, the proposition that a combination of two or more people to carry out a scheme that is criminal in its nature and is intended to cause economic harm to some person does not, when carried out with that result, constitute a tort actionable by that person is, in my opinion, unacceptable. Such a proposition is not only inconsistent with the jurisprudence of tortious conspiracy, as Lord Walker has demonstrated and explained, but is inconsistent also with the historic role of the action on the case.”</span>

A good deal of legal reasoning in the speeches and judgments (as to the ingredients of one or other of these torts) has been based on the assumption that the meaning must be the same in both.

He might or might not know that each of these was also a civil wrong (or tort) but it is unlikely that civil liability would be in the forefront of his mind. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana"> [2008] 1 AC 1 , Lord Hoffmann (expressing the majority view in this House) said that the fact that the means involve a crime, without also involving a civilly actionable wrong, was insufficient to establish a claim for loss caused by unlawful means. Given the obvious desirability of consistency and coherence as between the economic torts, it can fairly be said that the same rule should apply to a claim in unlawful means conspiracy. Further, the point made by Lord Hoffmann that “it is not for the courts to create a cause of action out of a … criminal statute which Parliament did not intend to be actionable in private law” can fairly be said to be as applicable to unlawful means conspiracy as to causing loss by unlawful means.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">221 On the other hand, it appears that the law of tort takes a particularly censorious view where conspiracy is involved. Thus, a claim based on conspiracy to injure can be established even where no unlawful means, let alone any other actionable tort, is involved. That tort is therefore frequently described as anomalous; yet its existence is very well established. Its centrally important feature is that the conspiracy must have as its primary purpose injury to the claimant. [In] my judgment, given the existence of that tort, it would be anomalous if an unlawful means conspiracy could not found a cause of action where, as here, the means “merely” involved a crime, where the loss to the claimant was the obvious and inevitable, indeed in many ways the intended, result of the sole purpose of the conspiracy, and where the crime involved, cheating the revenue, has as its purpose the protection of the victim of the conspiracy. The difference between intending to make a profit at the claimant's expense and intending to cause injury to the claimant is pretty fine and, in economic terms, artificial: that point emerges most clearly from the discussion in Lord Hoffmann's opinion in </span>

First, there is the narrow point that the crime (or at least the crime primarily relied on in the commissioners' argument) in the present case is a common law one, and therefore there is no question of disregarding the legislature's intention, which only arises where the [crime] is statutory. Secondly, there is the more general and telling point that the tort in this case involves the element of conspiracy, which is, of course, lacking in the tort considered in </span>

The importance of the ingredient of conspiracy has been examined and explained by Lord Walker and Lord Mance in their speeches, and is, as already mentioned, underlined in the field of economic torts by the anomalous tort of conspiracy to injure (or lawful means conspiracy).

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">, Lord Hoffmann made it clear that his “ discussion of unlawful means”  was limited to cases involving “ interference with the actions of a third party in relation to the plaintiff” , and did not necessarily apply to “a case of ‘two party intimidation’”, which, he said, “raises altogether different issues” . In this case, as Lord Hope and Lord Mance have explained, the tort is of a “two party” nature, in that the conspiracy could be said to have been directed against the commissioners. After all, it was directly intended (albeit for the purpose of enriching the conspirators) to deprive the commissioners of money to which they were entitled, and, if successful, it was inevitably and foreseeably going to do so, and no tort, harm or crime as against any party other than the commissioners was involved. As Lord Hoffmann implicitly recognised, it may therefore not be inappropriate to hold that the commissioners have a cause of action in such circumstances, even though they might not have had a claim if they had suffered loss (particularly if it was as an incidental result) as a result of a crime directed at a third party.  </span>

I would in any event, at least in a case such as this, where injury to the claimant is the direct, inevitable and foreseeable result of the conspiracy succeeding, and where the crime can be said to exist for the protection of the victim, I would find it far less offensive to hold that unlawfulness can extend to a “ mere”  crime in unlawful means conspiracy, when it cannot do so in causing loss by unlawful means, than to hold that a “ mere”  crime cannot in any circumstances constitute unlawfulness in unlawful means conspiracy, when there is a tort of conspiracy to injure by means which are neither tortious nor criminal.”  </span>

First of all, it is necessary for the criminal acts to be the “means” by which the injury is inflicted. That point is made clear by Lord Walker at [95] – [96] and by Lord Mance at [116] and [119]. I will return to that topic later in this judgment. This means that the first question can be re-formulated: are all criminal acts “unlawful acts” for the purposes of this tort? The answer to this question is not altogether clear. I do not detect in the decision any intention to distinguish between serious and non-serious crimes nor between more or less reprehensible crimes. Lord Scott referred at [56] to the conduct being “sufficiently reprehensible” but there is no indication elsewhere in the judgments as to this being the test nor indeed how one would go about applying that test in a way which would bring certainty and predictability to the law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The House of Lords does nonetheless appear to suggest the possibility that not all crimes will be unlawful acts. The point is put in different ways. At [95] – [96], Lord Walker referred to the intention of Parliament. There would only be a Parliamentary intention where one is dealing with a statutory crime (which was not the case on the facts of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Total Network</span>). Lord Walker suggested that the intention of Parliament might be relevant when asking whether the crime created by the statute amounts to “unlawful means”. He then made a point about means and instrumentality. He might have been saying that the considerations set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd</span> [1949] AC 398 were relevant when considering whether the criminal act was the means of inflicting injury or whether the criminal act was collateral to the injury. Alternatively, he might have been saying that a question such as whether the statute was for the benefit of individuals or whether an individual had suffered special damage, not suffered by the public generally, could be relevant when deciding whether the criminal act amounted to an unlawful act for the purposes of this tort. He clearly stated that he did not wish to lay down any general rule. I cannot, however, read his judgment as saying that with a statutory crime, it was only an unlawful act for present purposes where it was also actionable on the basis of the principles in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd</span>; that would be to re-introduce the rule that the House of Lords had just rejected, to the effect that the acts had to be actionable to be unlawful acts.</p>

However, on my findings of fact in relation to Cayman, there was not a breach of the regulations and therefore no criminal offence was committed.

There is force in the Claimants’ argument that it is entirely natural to put breaches of statute into the category of unlawful acts and that is less easy to put them into the category of lawful acts. However, I find this approach to the issue to be more elegant than helpful. If that elegant approach were right, then the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Total Network </span>ought to have been very straightforward; nobody could say that a crime is a lawful act. Although Lord Walker did refer to the attitude of the man in the street at [90], the overall thrust of the House of Lords was whether authority allowed the House to declare that that torts and crimes were unlawful acts, or whether the class of unlawful acts consisted of torts alone. As it was clear that the class included torts, the House consciously was asking itself whether it was proper to take the incremental step of declaring that the class comprised crimes as well as torts.</p>

Although I am considering the law of various Caribbean jurisdictions and although I do not profess to know much about the degree of statutory regulation in those jurisdictions, the submissions have been made to me on the basis that I am to apply the common law which applies throughout the common law world. In the common law world, modern life is the subject of a vast amount of regulation by primary and secondary legislation.

First, they pointed out correctly that the requirement of instrumentality limits the range of unlawful means. So it does, but not enough to allay my concern about the extension of what constitutes unlawful acts. Then they suggested that I should not adopt the test of intention which found favour with the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG</span> but should instead adopt the test of intention which was rejected by the House of Lords in that case but which had been favoured by the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Douglas v Hello!

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is one other feature of the tort of conspiracy which tends to widen the scope of the tort and which deserves to be mentioned. Conspiracy requires a combination of two or more persons. I will discuss the detail of this later in this judgment. The Claimants correctly submit that in certain cases, the combination may consist of a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary company, or two associated companies, or a company and a director of that company or a company and a shareholder of that company. Take this very case. I have held that in several of the jurisdictions the alleged breaches are not actionable because the legislatures did not intend that they should be actionable. The Claimants seek to escape this conclusion by saying that the relevant actor was not only the operating company which was under the statutory duty but the operating company was assisted by its parent company, or another group company, or the parent or group company acquiesced in the acts of the operating company. Thus, if the Claimants are right they have produced a result that non-actionable acts have become actionable by reason of (allegedly) quite limited  participation by a parent or group company. If the Claimants are right about non-actionable breaches of statute being unlawful acts, it would not be difficult to turn non-actionable breaches of a statute into an actionable conspiracy in many cases where one has the involvement of more than one company in a group of companies. I note in passing that for the purpose of considering whether there is a concerted practice or agreement to restrict competition,  for the purposes of article 101 of TFEU (formerly article 81 of the EC Treaty), the courts adopt a very different approach. The courts group together distinct legal persons into one “undertaking” if their relationship justifies them being regarded as a single economic unit: see Faull &amp; Nikpay, The EC Law of Competition, 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed. at 3.87.</p>

In the present case, in my judgment, the only contract that arises for consideration is the Memorandum of Understanding in TCI. That contract was made between Digicel TCI and CWWI. Accordingly, one of the  Claimants (Digicel TCI) has a right of action to sue a Defendant (CWWI) for any breach of that contract. No other Claimant alleges that it was injured by any such breach. So this case does not involve the question whether a breach of a contract is an unlawful act, where it is not actionable by a claimant injured by the breach, but is only actionable by a third party. In these circumstances, the economic tort which naturally comes to mind is the tort of inducing, or procuring a breach of contract. Where a third party, not a party to the contract, induces a party to the contract to break the contract then the party to the contract is primarily liable for the breach and the party who induced the breach is secondarily liable for the breach. The principles which apply to determine whether there is a secondary liability for a breach of contract are different from the principles which apply to an alleged tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. </p>

Accordingly, even if there had been a combination between CWWI and C&amp;W plc to commit a breach of contract, there would be no actionable conspiracy in the absence of damage to Digicel TCI. Further, there is no real basis on which it can be argued that CWWI and C&amp;W plc combined to commit a breach of contract. In these circumstances, the question whether a breach of contract constitutes unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means does not arise.</p>

The first tort would be the established tort of inducing a breach of contract. The second possible tort would be the tort of conspiracy to commit a breach of contract. It is clear that the ingredients of these torts differ. In particular, the intention required for each tort is different. It might be said that it is undesirable to recognise the existence of the tort of conspiracy to commit a breach of contract alongside the tort of inducing a breach of contract, where the two torts proceed on different lines. The matter is further complicated by the fact that because inducing a breach of contract is a tort, it ought in principle to be possible to have the tort of conspiracy to induce a breach of contract; this seems to have been the way the case was put in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz v ACP Ltd</span> [2008] Ch  244.</p>

In those circumstances, it is not strictly necessary to discuss the nature of a telecommunications licence, what remedies are available to the grantor of the licence for any breach of it by the licensee, whether such a breach is to be analysed as a breach of contract and whether such a breach is to be regarded as an unlawful act for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. However, as I have held that I am not prepared to extend the scope of unlawful means to a non-actionable, and non-criminal breach of  a statute or regulation, it seems to me to follow that the scope of unlawful means would similarly not extend to a breach of a telecommunications licence.</p>

A further feature of the tort of conspiracy, which is also found in criminal conspiracies, is that, as the judge pointed out (at p 124), it is not necessary to show that there is anything in the nature of an express agreement, whether formal or informal. It is sufficient if two or more persons combine with a common intention, or, in other words, that they deliberately combine, albeit tacitly, to achieve a common end. Although civil and criminal conspiracies have important differences, we agree with the judge that the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division delivered by O'Connor LJ in </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">'Secondly, the origins of all conspiracies are concealed and it is usually quite impossible to establish when or where the initial agreement was made, or when or where other conspirators were recruited. The very existence of the agreement can only be inferred from overt acts. Participation in a conspiracy is infinitely variable: it can be active or passive. If the majority shareholder and director of a company consents to the company being used for drug smuggling carried out in the company's name by a fellow director and minority shareholder, he is guilty of conspiracy. Consent, that is agreement or adherence to the agreement, can be inferred if it is proved that he knew what was going on and the intention to participate in the furtherance of the criminal purpose is also established by his failure to stop the unlawful activity.'</span>

In a criminal case juries are often asked to decide whether the alleged conspirators were 'in it together'. That may be a helpful question to ask, but we agree with Mr Brodie that it should not be used as a method of avoiding detailed consideration of the acts which are said to have been done in pursuance of the conspiracy.</span>

In most cases it will be necessary to scrutinise the acts relied upon in order to see what inferences can be drawn as to the existence or otherwise of the alleged conspiracy or combination. It will be the rare case in which there will be evidence of the agreement itself. Curiously this is such a case, although it appears to us that in crucial respects it is also necessary to draw inferences as to the extent of the agreement from what happened after it. Thus the essential nature of the agreement can be seen in part from the evidence of Mr Al Bader and Captain Stafford, although, especially in the case of Captain Stafford, the extent of the agreement will depend upon inferences to be drawn both from the surrounding circumstances and subsequent events.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In a group of companies, all of the individual companies have separate legal personality. If an enterprise organises itself so as to operate its business through a group of companies, taking the benefits of limited liability and perhaps the tax advantages involved, it cannot complain if a court holds it to an analysis based on the separate legal personality of the individual companies. Thus, in principle, a parent company can combine with a subsidiary and two subsidiaries can combine with each other. Further a director can combine with the company he directs and a shareholder (whether a corporate body or a natural person) can combine with the company in which the shares are held. Whether such a combination has taken place will depend upon the detailed facts. If an unlawful act is carried out by a subsidiary, it will be a question of fact whether that act was done pursuant to a combination between the subsidiary and its parent and, as stated above, it would normally not be sufficient proof of such a combination merely to show that the parent knew or suspected that an unlawful act was being committed and did nothing to stop it. Similarly, if it is suggested that one subsidiary did an unlawful act pursuant to a combination with another subsidiary (which did not have the ability to direct or prohibit the actions of the first subsidiary) it will not be enough to show that the second  subsidiary knew or suspected that an unlawful act was being committed and did nothing to stop it.</p>

That case concerned the circumstances in which a director of a company could be held to be a joint tortfeasor with the company. The case did not involve the tort of conspiracy as such. However, the law on joint torts was explained so that a person was liable as a joint tortfeasor if he participated in a common design to commit the tort or otherwise procured or induced the tort. There are obvious similarities between the test as to a common design for a joint tort and as to a combination for the tort of conspiracy.  Chadwick LJ said this:</p>

That, I think, is what policy requires if a proper recognition is to be given to the identity of the company as a separate legal person. Nor, as it seems to me, will it be right to hold a controlling shareholder liable as a joint tortfeasor if he does no more than exercise his power of control through the constitutional organs of the company - for example by voting at general meetings and by exercising the powers to appoint directors.

For my part, I would hesitate to use the word 'never' in this field; but I would accept that, if all that a director is doing is carrying out the duties entrusted to him as such by the company under its constitution, the circumstances in which it would be right to hold him liable as a joint tortfeasor with the company would be rare indeed. That is not to say, of course, that he might not be liable for his own separate tort, as Aldous LJ recognised at paras [16] and [17] of his judgment in the </span>

In other words, if, in relation to the wrongful acts which are the subject of complaint, the liability of the individual as a joint tortfeasor with the company arises from his participation or involvement in ways which go beyond the exercise of constitutional control, then there is no reason why the individual should escape liability because he could have procured those same acts through the exercise of constitutional control.

A high degree of blameworthiness is called for, because intention serves as the factor which justifies imposing liability on the defendant for loss caused by a wrong otherwise not actionable by the claimant against the defendant. The defendant's conduct in relation to the loss must be deliberate. In particular, a defendant's foresight that his unlawful conduct may or will probably damage the claimant cannot be equated with intention for this purpose.

Take a case where a defendant seeks to advance his own business by pursuing a course of conduct which he knows will, in the very nature of things, necessarily be injurious to the claimant. In other words, a case where loss to the claimant is the obverse side of the coin from gain to the defendant. The defendant's gain and the claimant's loss are, to the defendant's knowledge, inseparably linked. The defendant cannot obtain the one without bringing about the other. If the defendant goes ahead in such a case in order to obtain the gain he seeks, his state of mind will satisfy the mental ingredient of the unlawful interference tort.

I decline to follow the Claimants’ approach to the law in this area which seems to involve the court, like a tailor carrying out alterations to an ill-fitting garment, letting it out here (e.g as to unlawful means) and taking it in there (e.g as to the test for intention) just to suit the alleged facts of this particular case.

The Defendants say that if all the other ingredients of the tort of conspiracy are established against them, there is a further matter on which they rely which (if they establish the relevant facts) has the result that the Defendants are not liable for the tort of conspiracy. The Defendants say that if the acts or omissions which are proven against them are held by the court to have been unlawful, the Defendants are nonetheless not liable in the tort of conspiracy because when they committed those acts or were guilty of those omissions, they genuinely believed that they were not unlawful. Accordingly, the following issues arise. Is it relevant for the court to inquire into what the Defendants believed in this respect at the time of the relevant acts or omissions? If so, who bears what burden of proof in this respect? Is the absence of a genuine belief on the part of the Defendants something which the Claimants must assert and prove or is the existence of the genuine belief on the part of the Defendants something for the Defendants to assert and prove by way of defence? This question of the burden of proof was raised at an early stage in the trial in connection with the related question as to whether the Claimants had to plead the absence of a genuine belief or whether the Defendants had to plead a defence of the existence of a genuine belief. The issue was not resolved at that stage and the pragmatic decision was taken by both parties that each party would set out its case in relation to this topic.</p>

This means that if the Defendants are right that there is a requirement of no honest belief for the tort of conspiracy, there will be a difference between the rules which apply to joint torts and the rules which apply to the tort of conspiracy. It would then be easier for a claimant to put forward a case based on a combination to commit a tort, resulting in liability as joint tortfeasors, than asserting a conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, namely, the underlying tort.</p>

In that case, the plaintiff relied on the tort of inducing a breach of contract and the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. What precisely were the unlawful means was not made clear: was it the alleged breach of contract or was it the tort of inducing a breach of contract? It was held on the facts that the defendant did not know that his involvement would bring about a breach of contract. That meant that the defendant was not liable for the tort of inducing breach of contract. As stated above, that ruling was upheld by the House of Lords and followed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mainstream v Young </span>. The Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">British Industrial Plastics v Ferguson </span> also considered the tort of conspiracy. If the alleged unlawful act was the tort of procuring a breach of contract, then it would follow that there had been no actionable inducement of a breach of contract and no unlawful act. If the unlawful act had been the breach of contract itself, what then? Slesser LJ at 512-513 held there was no actionable conspiracy because the defendant was not “wilful”. He seems to have held that the defendant’s lack of awareness of any unlawful act meant he was not liable. Mackinnon LJ at 512-513 said the same considerations applied to both torts which had been alleged. Finlay LJ was the most explicit of the three judges on the point. He said that the two causes of action stood or fell together. He held at 514 that a person was not liable in a civil or a criminal court if he had no knowledge that his act was unlawful. He repeated that with specific reference to the tort of conspiracy at 515-516. When that case reached the House of Lords, the speeches focussed on the tort of inducing breach of contract and there is no separate consideration of the tort of conspiracy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Although not directly in point, it is worth noticing the reasoning in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz</span> in relation to the tort of inducing breach of contract. The circumstances of the various competing rights and obligations in that case were highly unusual.  Arden LJ held that, in relation to the alleged breach of contract by ACP, what had happened was that ACP’s obligation to grant a lease had by agreement been converted into a liability to pay damages for not granting that lease: see at [123] and [143]. Further, Arden LJ held that the other defendants in that case had not procured or induced a breach of contract although their actions had prevented ACP performing its obligation to grant the lease; there was a critical difference between inducing a breach of contract and preventing performance of a contact: see at [129] – [140]. Arden LJ would also, if it had been necessary to do so, have held that the defendants could plead justification as a defence to the tort of inducing breach of contract: see at [142]. As to the defendants’ state of mind, Arden LJ said at [124] and [127] that because the defendants believed that they were entitled to act as they did, the tort of inducing breach of contract was not made out. If that statement means that the defendants believed that they were not doing anything unlawful then the proposition is not controversial after <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG Ltd v Allan,</span> in relation to the tort of inducting breach of contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Arden LJ then considered the alleged tort of conspiracy. She dealt with this comparatively briefly. She appears to have approached the case on the basis that the alleged unlawful means were the alleged breach of contract rather than the tort of inducing a breach of contract: see at [145]. The trial judge had held in terms that a breach of contact amounted to unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy: see at [39]. At [147], Arden LJ held that there were no unlawful means; she held that the defendants had acted lawfully in exercising a power of sale which was available. At [146], Arden LJ stated that the test for intention to cause loss which was described in <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG</span> in relation to the tort of causing loss by unlawful means should also apply to the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. She held that there had to be an intention to cause loss. She held that, on the facts, there was no intention to cause harm. There appear to be two reasons for that conclusion. The first was that a belief that the right to the lease would be overridden was inconsistent with an intention to cause harm to Britel. The second (introduced by “nor”) was that the Claimant’s rights were to damages and there was no intention to prevent performance of the obligation to pay damages. Arden LJ did not, at any rate not in terms, hold that an honest belief that the means were lawful meant that there was no intention to cause harm.</p>

Arden LJ stated that she had rejected the relevance of the approach in that case in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mainstream Ltd v Young</span> [2005] IRLR 964 at [84]. However, in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mainstream </span> case she was dealing with the tort of inducing breach of contract. It is quite right that in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mainstream</span> case, Arden LJ proceeded on the basis that after the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Douglas v Hello !

He first dealt with the alleged tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. He held at [167] – [170] that the means used were not unlawful. He then considered the question to intention to injure and said this at [174]:</p>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana">“Although my conclusion on the issue of unlawful means makes it unnecessary to decide the point, I would support Arden LJ's view, at para 127, that it is a defence to an action for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means if the defendant not only acted to protect his own interests but did so in the belief that he had a lawful right to act as he did. Just as the tort of conspiracy to induce breach of contract is not committed if the defendant believes that the outcome sought by him will not involve a breach of contract (the </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-family:Verdana">Mainstream</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana"> case [2005] IRLR 964), so a defendant should not be liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means if he believes that he has a lawful right to do what he is doing. This is consistent with Lord Hoffmann's comment in the </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-family:Verdana">OBG</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana"> case [2008] 1 AC 1 , para 56, when considering the tort of causing injury by unlawful means, that the common law in this area is designed only to enforce basic standards of civilised behaviour. Moreover, Lord Nicholls was not addressing such a situation in the passage set out at para 125 above. (I would note two supplementary points. First, for avoidance of doubt, I do not consider that this conclusion is inconsistent with the decision of the House of Lords in </span>
	      <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-family:Verdana">R v Churchill (No 2)</span>
	      <span style="font-family:Verdana"> [1967] 2 AC 224 , which concerned a very different issue, namely, the mens rea element of the crime of conspiracy in the context of an agreement which led to the commission of a strict liability offence. Secondly, we are not in this case concerned with the alternative form of conspiracy to injure, where the intent to injure is the defendant's dominant intention and questions of the lawfulness of the means do not arise.) I would also concur with Arden LJ's conclusions about intent on the evidence before the judge.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Toulson LJ then dealt with the tort of inducing breach of contract although he described the case as one of conspiracy to induce a breach of contract. That seems to have been because the appellants in that case put their case on the two economic torts in similar ways: see at [175]. Toulson LJ held that the defendants had not induced the alleged breach of contract. He next held that the defendants could plead justification. Thirdly, he went on to hold at [180] that the defendants were not liable for inducing breach of contract when they believed they were entitled to act as they did.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is clear from the above analysis of the judgments of Arden and Toulson LJJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz</span>, that they approached the case on the basis that a defendant was not liable for the tort of inducing breach of contract nor the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means where the defendant did not know that he was acting unlawfully. It is of course readily understandable that they would adopt that approach in a case which was argued both by reference to the tort of inducing breach of contract and to the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, where the underlying facts were identical for both alleged torts and even more so where it was not clear whether the unlawful means for the tort of conspiracy was a breach of contract or a tort of inducing a breach of contract.

However, in view of what was said by the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">British Industrial Plastics Ltd v Ferguson</span> together with the dicta in the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz</span>, my conclusion is that a judge at first instance ought to follow what is clearly stated by Toulson LJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz </span>at [174].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The next question is: on whom does the legal burden of proof rest in this regard? Do the Claimants have to prove that the Defendants did not honestly believe they were acting lawfully or do the Defendants have to prove that they honestly believed they were acting lawfully? Putting the question that way suggests that the legal burden should be on the Defendants as they are asserting a positive matter and they should therefore be expected to prove it, instead of requiring the Claimants to prove a negative. I note that Toulson LJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Meretz</span> at [174] referred to a defendant having “a defence” of honest belief; that suggests that the Defendants would be expected to raise and then to prove the defence. However, the cases on this subject, in particular, <span style="text-decoration:underline">British Industrial Plastics Ltd v Ferguson</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">OBG</span> discuss this point as part of the intention which the Claimants must show that the Defendants had when they acted as they did. That would suggest that the legal burden is on the Claimants to show all relevant aspects of the Defendants’ state of mind. As it does not arise on the facts, I will leave that matter unresolved. Even if the legal burden is on the Claimants, as with any issue as to the fact of combination and the existence of the relevant intention, these matters can be the subject of inference and the circumstances of a particular case may place an evidential burden on a defendant to raise and prove the allegation that he genuinely believed he was acting lawfully.</p>
