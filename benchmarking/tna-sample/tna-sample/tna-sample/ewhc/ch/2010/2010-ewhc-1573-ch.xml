The latest figures (as at 31 March 2009) show a deficit on the buy-out basis (<span style="font-style:italic">ie</span> on the basis that the Scheme’s liabilities are discharged by purchase of annuities) of just over £285m.  By the Part 8 claim form, the Trustee seeks the guidance of the Court on the questions set out in paragraphs 1 to 10 of the claim form.  The Claim Form has recently been amended to add a new question 4A as an 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> question.  Each question has been, in turn, subdivided into issues.  There are a total of 39 issues on which a decision is requested.</p>

As at 28 May 2009, there were only 197 active members but the deficit is the large figure which I have just mentioned.</p>

Prior to the 1987 Act, pilots were licensed by different bodies, known as pilotage authorities.  Such authorities were given power to employ (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>under a contract of service) their pilots under section 11 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1979.  However, the vast majority did not do so; indeed, none of the authorities participating in the Scheme did so. Accordingly, prior to 1 October 1988 (when the majority of the provisions of the 1987 Act came into force), all active Members were self-employed.  The result of this, and of the fact that self-employed service benefits going back many years prior to 1971 were transferred into the PNPF on its creation, is that the bulk of the current deficit in the Scheme relates to self-employed service.  </p>

They were authorised or licensed by a pilotage authority – in most cases a Trinity House authority.  The self-employed pilots’ working arrangements had certain features that would not ordinarily be associated with self-employment.  I do not need to rehearse any of these arrangements since their status as self-employed persons is not open to challenge.  </p>

This Report proposed nationally agreed rates of earnings of pilots in each area (or port), the intention being that pilotage rates, agreed between representatives of the pilots and of the ship-owners (not the pilotage authorities) should be fixed at levels designed to produce a pre-determined level of income, with those rates being adjusted if they produced an income more than 10% above or below the agreed figure.  </p>

As a matter of fact, I do not understand there to have been a deficit on any transfer in, although it is noted on behalf of Tyne that such a deficit could have been dealt with by reducing benefits below the entitlement under the transferring scheme.  But in the cases of both surplus and deficit, benefits attributable to pre-transfer service would be established at the time of the transfer-in.

In addition, the nationally negotiated arrangements for pilots' earnings (namely, the Letch Agreement, followed by the 1980 National Agreement) were increasingly recognised as having failed to take account of the true number of surplus pilots because local authorities were left to determine themselves how the calculation of the “proper number” of pilots (which formed a component in the calculation of a pilot’s earnings) should be carried out.  </p>

In March 1983, they produced a draft report; it is not known whether they in fact produced a final report and certainly none is available.  Their proposals involved (among other things) the Scheme providing enhanced early retirement benefits for pilots who agreed to retire. This proposal also envisaged the Commission reimbursing some or all of the additional costs to the PNPF on the basis that it could then recoup these costs <span style="font-style:italic">via</span> increases in pilotage charges paid by ship owners under section 2 of the 1979 Act.</p>

Pilotage was to be seen as an ancillary part of a much broader service provided for vessels using a port, to be managed by the CHAs, being the bodies with a direct interest in ensuring that their ports operated efficiently.  CHAs were to be given broader powers than pilotage authorities enjoyed, in order to allow them to fulfil this role properly. Tied to this point, management of the pilotage authorities was to be decentralised, with a reduced role for the Secretary of State and the abolition of the Commission. Subject to certain statutory duties, CHAs were given the power to manage their pilotage services as they saw fit.</p>

As a result of these measures, in 1988 and 1989, employed active members of the PNPF marginally outnumbered self-employed active members but subsequently the active membership has become overwhelmingly self-employed.  Indeed, a significant number of members have mixed periods of employed and self-employed service, having (a) been self-employed prior to 1 October 1988; (b) employed immediately after 1 October 1988 for a period; and then (c) reverted back to being self-employed some time thereafter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As already mentioned, one of the main drivers for the reforms under the 1987 Act was the policy of reducing the number of pilots.  Over-manning was perceived as being an obstacle to efficiency and competitiveness of UK Ports.   It was generally perceived that a reduction in this over-manning could be effected only if an early retirement scheme were introduced to compensate those pilots that had become surplus to requirements. This was catered for by section 28 of the 1987 Act which required a scheme to be put in place for doing so. The details of the scheme that emerged and its impact on the Scheme are set out in greater detail below.</p>

The Trustee Directors would be expected to comply with and to implement decisions taken in this negotiating forum.

The questions for me are essentially questions of interpretation or construction.

Thus, in the present case the apparently wide words of Rule 9(1)(a) might be “read down” in one of three ways: first because, as a matter of construction, the words “alter cancel or add to” do not permit a change to the Rules which imposes additional obligations of the sorts identified in Question 1 in respect of each of the four categories of CHA; secondly because a term prohibiting such changes should be implied; or thirdly (which may be no more than a sub-category of the first two ways) in accordance with the line of authorities restricting the exercise of apparently wider powers.

First, members of a scheme are not volunteers: the benefits which they receive under the scheme are part of the remuneration for their services and this is so whether the scheme is contributory or non-contributory. This means that they are in a different position in some respects from beneficiaries of a private trust. Moreover, the relationship of members to the employer must be seen as running in parallel with their employment relationship. This factor, too, can in appropriate circumstances have an effect on the interpretation of the scheme.</p>

The implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. It only spells out what the instrument means. And, as he points out, the proposition that the implication of a term is an exercise in the construction of the instrument as a whole is not only a matter of logic (since a court has no power to alter what the instrument means) but also well supported by authority.   In every case in which it is said that some provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the question for the court is whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the instrument, read against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean.</p>

But it is hardly a traditional trust created by the bounty of a settlor. It is a means of creating a form of security in favour of policyholders. It provides a guarantee that a Name will be able to meet his liabilities and it provides a mechanism for the payment of such liabilities. This is the context in which the amendments brought litigation recoveries within the scope of the trust. Secondly, it is true that there is a well established line of authority which holds that a power of amendment reserved in a trust must be exercised for the purpose for which it was granted: see <span style="font-style:italic">Hole v Garnsey</span> [1930] AC 472... This principle is closely linked with the general proposition that the power must not be exercised beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties on which Nourse LJ founded his judgment. All this is hornbook law.

Moreover, the amendments were required by an unprecedented crisis affecting Lloyd’s. From the 1980s the Lloyd’s market was beset by serious structural problems. There was a spiral of losses. Lloyd’s names apparently suffered losses of £8bn. in respect of the 1988 to 1992 underwriting years of account. By March 1995 when the amendments were introduced the unwillingness and inability of names to settle their underwriting liabilities confronted Lloyd’s with a crisis which imperilled its standing as an insurance market.

In the exceptional situation which had arisen and the exceptional way in which the Names were having to enforce and obtain from their agents the financial consequences to which they were entitled arising out of their becoming names and participating in the market, it is both consistent and proper that the Council of Lloyd’s should have sought to amend clause 2 of the deed so as to bring the relevant litigation receipts within its scope and require the Name to pay such sums into the trust fund in so far as it is necessary to do so to enable his liabilities to be paid out of that fund. The situation which has arisen is exceptional.

But the Court should not start with any bias towards that conclusion.  All depends on the terms of the instruments imposing the putative obligation – Mr Ham would say the Deeds of Accession but it may be that the Rules are themselves a source of obligation.  It should not be overlooked that the pensions environment was very different in 1988 from today.  As Mr Ham points out in his skeleton argument:</p>

There was nothing, at that stage, which indicated what the contribution obligations of the CHAs should be.  There was nothing which treated a CHA as if it were a pilotage authority and, even if there had been, no contribution obligation would have been imposed on any CHA under the byelaws and rules.  However, the Scheme continued in existence and continued to operate under paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the 1987 Act.

Moreover, in a different scenario, that of surplus in the Scheme, these payments could exceed the sums necessary to provide benefits of the relevant Members.

In my judgment, the covenant is capable of extending to Members who are no longer employed by the relevant CHA but only insofar as the relevant provisions “relate to” such Members.  Suppose, for instance, that there were a modest deficit in the Scheme and that the actuary was able to attribute on a strongly defensible actuarial basis a certain amount of that deficit to under-funding in respect of the ex-employees of a relevant ECHA.  Assuming that the Trustee has power under Rule 9(1)(a) to introduce a Rule which required the ECHA to pay that proportion of the deficit being clearly identified as a deficit attributable to the ex-employees, it would be strongly arguable that such a provision would “relate to” those ex-employees.  If it does so relate, I consider that the covenant would bite: the contribution obligation arises in respect of the period of Membership when the Member was actually employed.

But it is obvious that the Trustee might not have made a decision by that date and might wish (and need) to require the CHA to obtain medical reports after that date.

But once payment has been made pursuant to the covenant, the covenant is exhausted unless and until a new deficit arises, for instance because of a fall in the market value of the assets.  I do not think that that argument is a good one.  The covenant is to comply with the provision of the Scheme insofar as they relate to the relevant Members: if the Scheme provides for contributions made by any CHA to go into a general pool and not to be earmarked, the effect of complying with the covenant is not to reduce by the amount of the contribution the deficit attributable to those Members.

The words “insofar as <span style="font-style:italic">etc</span>” add nothing of substance but serve only to remind that a CHA’s obligations do not extend to those of another CHA.</p>

But clearly a CHA’s covenant cannot, on any view, extend beyond the obligations which the Rules impose on it.  Thus although Rule 14(1) obliges an employed pilot to pay contributions, the Rules do not also oblige an ECHA to pay (save as a collecting body) those contributions and the covenant in the Deed of Accession is of no relevance to them: obviously the covenant to “comply with all the provisions…” means only those provisions which cast an obligation on the CHAs.  I am not aware of any provision of the 1988 Rules in their original form, or even as amended, which casts an obligation on a CHA in relation to Members other than those which are or have been employed or authorised by it.  Accordingly, I do not think that Mr Newman’s point takes matters further.  </p>

If the scope of the power of amendment is so restricted, or is restricted in some other way, then the power cannot be exercised in breach of that restriction.  If it is, then the exercise is invalid.  The CHA is not then bound by its covenant in relation to a provision introduced in breach of that restriction: but this is not because of some implied term but because there is no valid provision in the first place to which the covenant could relate.  But if the power is exercised within its permitted scope, it is not, in my judgment, possible to justify a conclusion that the Trustee had bound itself by contract not to exercise the power in certain ways within its permitted scope.</p>

If they are right in that, then there is no need for the suggested restriction on the covenant – the subject matter of the covenant would never include a contribution obligation.  But if the Scheme can be amended to introduce such an obligation, I do not see any reason for restricting, by way of construction, implication or otherwise, the scope of the covenant to purely administrative obligations.

Likewise, if the rules of a pension scheme, as amended from time to time, require payment of certain contributions by participating employers, it would require clear explanation how and why a participating employer could participate and yet pay some lesser contribution.  The Deeds of Accession should, as Mr Nugee submits, be construed against that background.  I should, he submits, give to the Deeds of Accession a practical and purposive, or reasonable and realistic, construction so that the express obligation undertaken in the Deed of Accession tracks the obligation which would ordinarily be expected to arise as the result of participation in the Scheme.</p>

To do anything else would be to suppose that although the position absent the express covenant would be that the CHAs were bound to comply with the rules as duly made, the Deed of Accession imposed a more limited obligation on them, namely only to comply with some of the rules which would otherwise apply.

A principled limitation would, however, restrict the obligations of the relevant CHA to liabilities under the Scheme in respect of a Member’s period of employment or authorisation by that CHA.  Thus, suppose a Member had been employed by CHA X for 10 years but is now employed by CHA Y and has been so employed for only a few months, it would not be right, in my view, for CHA Y to pick up the additional cost of providing for the Member’s benefits in respect of the whole of his period of service.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The one point on which I want to say something more is this.  Mr Nugee submits that, in relation to the possibility of a further amendment pursuant to Article 5, the Deeds of Accession are irrelevant. As he puts it: “Since the Trustee is not relying on the covenant in the Deeds of Accession but on its statutory power, the construction of the covenant is neither here nor there”.  Things are not, in my view, that straightforward.  The power of amendment under Article 5 is a power to amend the Scheme: it is not a freestanding power to impose obligations on a CHA.  It is only through their obligations pursuant to the Scheme that CHAs are liable at all.  Now it may be that those obligations are to be found in the Scheme rules or it may be that they have to be found in the Deeds of Accession.  But the answer to where they are found does not depend on whether the Trustee is relying on their existing power (which I have held to be unrestricted) or pursuant to a new exercise of the Article 5 power.  In either case, the only obligation on the CHA outside the Deeds of Accession is to be found in the 1988 Rules as amended from time to time.</p>

This process did not involve any action on the part of any pilotage authority although it was, of course, envisaged that pilotage authorities would become Participating Authorities by themselves making byelaws.

It is unlikely that the Rule-making power vested in the BoM would have allowed it to make a contribution provision inconsistent with the byelaws. It is clear, in my view, that there would have been nothing to prevent Trinity House and the other Participating Bodies together adopting new byelaws with an entirely different benefit and contribution structure if they had wished.  Section 17(i)(j) was unrestricted and there was no scope for an implied term or application of the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Hole v Garnsey</span> which would have prevented the imposition of a balance of cost obligation on Participating Bodies (although whether any particular pilotage authority would in fact have become a Participating Body if those had been the terms and thus undertaken such an obligation is a different matter).  </p>

Although section 17(1)(j) of the 1913 Act was effectively repeated by section 15(1)(i) of the 1983 Act, the national scheme was in fact constituted by an exercise of the former power.  This is of no importance because, in September 1983, Trinity House promulgated new byelaws (together with Rules) under section 15 of the 1983 Act.  It was provided that each Pilotage Authority which had become a Participating Body under the previous byelaws should be a Participating Body from the date of its original participation.  The power under which these 1983 byelaws and rules were made was thus a statutory power and not a power of amendment contained in the original provisions governing the national scheme.  As with section 17 of the 1913 Act, section 15 of the 1983 Act was a wide power and would, similarly, have permitted Trinity House to create a pension scheme containing a balance of cost obligation on Participating Bodies.</p>

In relation to the original byelaws made by Trinity House in 1971, those were expressly adopted as byelaws made by each authority pursuant to section 17.  Although each authority thereby became subject to the byelaws governing the Scheme (because it had, by its own byelaws, adopted them) there were, so far as I am aware, no subsequent byelaws made by any pilotage authority adopting the byelaws made by Trinity House in 1983 albeit that the 1983 Rules provided for them to continue as Participating Bodies: see Byelaw 3(2) of the 1983 Rules.  There was nothing, either in the legislation or in any byelaws, which expressly provided that an authority adopting the original byelaws was thereby adopting any replacement or amended byelaws which might thereafter be made.  It may be, but I think it unlikely and do not need to decide, that a participating pilotage authority would have been able successfully to argue that new or amended byelaws made under section 17, had they introduced new and more onerous contribution obligations, would not have been binding on it because it had not become a Participating Body under the new (or amended) byelaws.  But I do not consider that it could successfully argue that the power of Trinity House to make new byelaws governing the Scheme had somehow become restricted in its scope.</p>

Further, Questionnaires were sent to CHAs before 1 October 1988 which stated that, from 1 October 1988, a body could only be a Participating Body if it was a CHA or an employer of pilots.  Clearly it must have been in mind that changes would have to be made to the byelaws to reflect this.  Nobody has ever taken a point – and none was taken in the lengthy hearing before me – that the CHAs which intended to become Participating Bodies and which executed Deeds of Accession had not in fact validly become such Bodies.  I proceed, therefore, on the basis that the terms of participation of CHAs are to be derived from the combined effects of the 1988 Rules, the relevant Deeds of Accession and the actual operation of the Scheme since 1988.</p>

That the Secretary of State’s power should be a wide one is not entirely surprising.  In the past, changes to the byelaws would have been made under section 15 of the 1983 Act by a pilotage authority with confirmation by the Secretary of State.  In the new, privatised, world, the Secretary of State was to have a diminished role (or perhaps even no role at all – depending on whether he retained a residual power under paragraph 4 even after the making of the 1987 Order).  Instead, amendments were to be in the power of the managers. Just as the power to make byelaws under the old provisions was wide, one might not be surprised to discover that a wide power to make amendments could be given to the managers.</p>

But in the context of this power, that purpose and those objects are to be viewed at a high level of generality.  The purpose of the Secretary of State’s power was to enable him to confer powers of amendment on the Trustee in order that it would be able to ensure the continued effective operation of the Scheme as circumstances changed; and the objects of the Scheme were to be seen as the provision of benefits and not, at this high level, particular detail about contributions such as the ratio of employer and employee contributions.  </p>

Indeed, that is what in fact happened with the introduction, in the 1988 Rules for the first time, of an employer contribution under Rule 14.

It may be that, in certain respects, there are unusual features about the nature of the self-employment of a pilot as compared with ordinary self-employment in other professions and trades.  I think that these special features are relied on in support of an argument which starts with the proposition that contribution obligations can be imposed on CHAs which are employers (in the ordinary sense) of employed pilots; and that because the terms of a pilot’s self-employment are unusual and have many features of ordinary employment (or so it is said) that therefore the SCHAs can be made liable to make contributions.  I reject that argument.  The fact is that the S Members’ status is one of genuine self-employment (see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Bibby v Associated British Ports Ltd </span>25 March 2003) and they are not to be treated for pension purposes as though they were employed (whatever special treatment might have been afforded to them by the tax authorities).  I do not, perhaps, do justice to the lengthy submissions which have been made on this topic, in particular by Miss Asplin.  My clear conclusion, however, is that these special features have no material impact on the scope of the powers of the Secretary of State under paragraph 4, the powers of the Trustee under Article 5 or the powers of the Trustee under Rule 9(1)(a).</p>

She suggests that a contribution under this Rule is not treated as part of the Scheme funds as a whole.  She refers to Rule 3 which states that the Fund shall comprise a number of different identified assets with no mention being made of Rule 25.  However, Rule 25(6) itself refers to the Fund three times and it is clear that the contribution goes into the Fund just as the benefit is paid from the Fund.  The special contribution is not hypothecated to provision of the early retirement benefit which is simply a benefit under the Scheme.  I do not consider that there is anything in Miss Asplin’s point.</p>

Mr Newman has not argued that the scope of this power was restricted so as to prevent the introduction of any contribution on an ECHA.  Indeed, if it were so restricted, the 1988 Rules themselves would have been invalid in introducing the obligation for ECHAs to contribute 1.5 times their employed pilots’ contributions.  Mr Newman’s point is a different one which relates to the power of amendment under Rule 9(1)(a), a power which is contained in a set of Rules which provides for this ratio and which he says is an entrenched ratio.  </p>

In other language, to do so would, on this argument, be to change the substratum or basic purpose of the Scheme.  It cannot, of course, be argued that this power, in contrast with Rule 9(1)(a), fixes for ever and a day the ratio between employee and employer contributions for the simple reason that that ratio had not been agreed even in principle by the date of the 1987 Order, 10 December 1987.</p>

That is not to say that the position of the CHAs was irrelevant.  It was, without doubt, intended – by the Secretary of State, the Trustee and the CHAs themselves – that at least some if not all of the CHAs would become Participating Bodies; that is an important factor in ascertaining what, objectively, can reasonably be considered to have been in the contemplation of the relevant persons, that is to say the Secretary of State and the Trustee.</p>

The 1987 Order was made in December 1987 before final decisions had been made about benefits and contributions and before any drafts of the Deed of Accession had been sent to any CHA (or perhaps even been considered).

Even if Parliament has seen fit to give the Secretary of State a wide power, it can be said that he is to be trusted to exercise that power fairly and proportionately.  But once he has put it out of his own power to determine how the Scheme can be amended, it may be said that it cannot reasonably be considered to have been in the contemplation of the Secretary of State and the Trustee that the sort of alterations to which some of the CHAs object could be made; or to use  alternative language, the Secretary of State ought not to give the Trustee a power which would enable it to undermine the substratum or change the basic purpose of the Scheme as it is alleged such alterations would do.  There is, on this approach, a world of difference between the old provisions under which the byelaws could be amended only at the instigation of Trinity House (and even then possibly only with the consent of other Pilotage Authorities) on the one hand, and a unilateral power vested in the Trustee on the other hand.</p>

I accept, of course, that there is a very real difference between the old provisions and the unilateral power vested in the Trustee under Article 5.  However, the natural meaning of the words used is wide; I do not consider that there is anything which would justify cutting down the apparent width of the power (whether by reference to the reasonable contemplation of the Secretary of State or the Trustee, or by reference to the language of substratum and basic purpose).  The Secretary of State could, in my view, therefore have given an express, and valid, power to the Trustee to amend the Scheme so as to impose a contribution obligation on any CHA, whether an Active or Formerly ECHA or an Active or Formerly Active SCHA.  </p>

Of course there was no legal obligation: the level of contributions was for CHAs and pilots to decide.  But it is fair to observe that a commitment not to decrease benefits is somewhat empty if the funding to provide the benefits is not available.  It is a factor against the conclusion that it was not in the reasonable contemplation of the CHAs that they might have to make contributions in addition to those already provided in the Rules and in accordance with a different contribution structure.</p>

Otherwise, by parity of reasoning, it could be argued that it was appreciated and contemplated that the level of benefits would continue as under the previous byelaws and rules: that, however, would not mean that benefits were immutable and could not be increased pursuant to the amendment power under Rule 9(1)(a).  And if it is said that that is not a surprising result because it cannot have been contemplated that the Trustee would have a unilateral power to increase benefits, the answer is that it did not have such a power since Article 72 did not allow it to do so, at least from the time of its introduction on 1 February 1988.  Again, it must be remembered that a CHA did not have to become a Participating Body; a CHA which did become a Participating Body did so of its own choice in the knowledge (in the sense that they were publicly available documents) of the 1987 Order and the Memorandum and Association of the Trustee.

A contribution level of 21% for employed pilots was to apply for one year from 1 October 1988 with an employee/employer split of 1:1.5.  It was recorded that in order to ensure that undue strain was not put upon the Fund through, in effect, early retirement it had been agreed that the Trustee be asked to draft a rule giving them the right to apply an additional levy on the CHAs concerned.  Here, I note in passing, one sees another example of something which could probably not be done if the power under Article 5 was constrained by reference to the existing structure of the Scheme.  </p>

There is no suggestion that SCHAs themselves would contribute.  That is not surprising because there was, in fact, no intention at that time that they would do so nor had the pilots’ representatives asked them to do so.  All benefits were, at that time, thought to be fully funded and no change from the approach under the old byelaws and rules was to be made.   But it was recognised that contributions must be sufficient to fund current benefits.  The fact that nothing was said about possible future deficits and the need for further contributions from some source does not of itself mean that it was not in the reasonable contemplation of SCHAs that they might need to make contributions.  </p>

Mr Newman relies on this, as part of his case on “reasonable contemplation” to show that the amendment power would not be applied in relation to the shared cost ratio.  I disagree and think, if anything, that it points to a rather different conclusion.  The guidance says nothing, in my view, at all about the power of amendment.  What it does say is that it is not anticipated that the Negotiating Forum would revisit the split.  But, as with any situation where matters are open to negotiation, it would not be possible to rule out a change of circumstances under which the ratio might be reviewed.   </p>

By 1 February 1988, this had become formalised in the structure of the Scheme; on that date, the Memorandum and Articles of the Trustee were adopted.  There was thus equal representation of each side on the Board.  This was something which had been understood would be the case for months.

One might wonder why there was to be any SCHA representation if the SCHAs were in such a radically different position from ECHAs as Miss Asplin submits they were (and are).  It is curious that there should be such representation if, as she suggests, it would never be possible to cast any contribution obligation on them.  It is true that the contribution to be made by S Members would have an impact on the contractual payments which the S Members would wish, from time to time, to negotiate with their authorising SCHAs.  But given the proposition put forward by Miss Asplin that the total SCHA contribution would equal the total ECHA/E Member contributions, it is not easy to see why the interests of the SCHAs would not be fully represented by the ECHAs.  It is a small point, but one which suggests that SCHAs had more interest in the Scheme than Miss Asplin’s submissions would seem to accept.</p>

Her conclusion takes no account of Article 72(1) which relates more generally to alterations of provisions “relating to benefits or contributions under the Fund”.  This provision is directed at alterations to the provisions of the Scheme.  It would cover the introduction of a contribution obligation of any sort on an SCHA or the introduction of a new obligation on an ECHA.  Article 72(2), in contrast, is focusing on the rate of contribution payable under an existing rule.  The rate of contribution might be capable of increase under the Rules without any amendment to the byelaws or rules being required.  Indeed, Rule 14(1) is just such a Rule.  The Trustee was restricted in the exercise of its power under that Rule to alter contributions by Article 72(1).  It should be remembered that, by the time the latest drafts of the Articles were prepared, it was understood by everybody, and had been agreed by the Negotiating Forum, that the benefit structure would remain unchanged and that SCHA’s would not be contributing.  The express restriction in Article 72(2) reflects the Rules which were about to be introduced.</p>

Equally, there can be no doubt that, such policy having been determined, those bodies at least intended that the Trustee should be able to implement them.</p>

Given that the Trustee, the BPA/ABP and the UKPA were intended to have control over policy including benefits and contributions, I consider that, objectively judged, it was in the reasonable contemplation of all of them that the power of amendment which the Trustee had conferred on itself by the 1988 Rules pursuant to Article 5 should, like the power under Article 5 itself, be given the widest possible scope.  </p>

For my part, I do not see the issue as one of protection; rather, the issue is how Article 72 informs what it is that the CHAs are to be seen as having reasonably contemplated.  They reasonably contemplated policy being governed by the Negotiating Forum and they reasonably contemplated amendments being made to give effect to policy decisions.  They did not, therefore, reasonably contemplate any restriction on the scope of the power.  The requirements of Article 72 are to be seen not as a restriction on that scope, but rather as constraints on the exercise of the power, as to which see below.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the same applies in relation to SCHAs.  The Article 5 power was wide and could have been used by the Trustee to include, in the 1988 Rules, a power which expressly permitted it to impose a contribution obligation on an SCHA.  I acknowledge, of course, that negotiations with the Negotiating Forum proceeded on the footing, which was agreed, that S Members would fund their own benefits; but then nobody had in mind the possibility of the large deficits which are now to be found in the Scheme.  That is why everything which one sees in the documentation before the Court is consistent with the view that the SCHAs would <span style="text-decoration:underline">never</span> have to contribute.  But equally, it is consistent with the documentation and the evidence that all of the provisions which it was anticipated would initially be included in the rules were subject to amendment.  Article 72, as with ECHAs, supports the latter view and that the power of amendment could be used to introduce further contribution obligations on the SCHAs.  I say “further obligations” because Rule 25(6) in fact introduced such an obligation, albeit in relation to special circumstances.</p>

It is true that the introduction of contributions by SCHAs (and the possibility of surplus being paid, in part, to them in some circumstances such as a winding up of the Scheme) could give rise to issues which would need to be resolved with the Inland Revenue.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the case of Tyne itself. It wrote to its pilots on 16 June 1988 setting out the final terms on which it was prepared to engage pilots.  Tyne would pay for the period 1 October 1988 to 31 December 1989 “at the rate of 85% of the 1988 tariff (pilots to be responsible for their own pension fund arrangements)”.   Miss Asplin gives examples of other SCHAs which have had no involvement in the pilots’ arrangements with the Scheme, with pilots making contributions direct and the SCHA having no knowledge of or control over them.  She says that the Trustee itself sometimes positively acted on the basis that the SCHAs were only administratively involved in the Scheme.  In particular, there were direct negotiations between the Scheme and the Gloucester pilots about what would be included within Pensionable Earnings with no involvement or input from the SCHA concerned.  But the examples she gives post-date by some considerable time the adoption of the 1988 Rules.  There is, it seems to me, no inconsistency between what happened in practice and the possibility that contributions for SCHAs might be introduced in the future.  Suppose, for instance, that the Rules had expressly provided that amendments could be made to introduce new or different contribution obligations for both ECHAs and SCHAs.  The existence of that power would not have made any difference to how the Scheme was operated unless and until the power was exercised.  In my judgment, these factors are insufficient to show that, objectively, it was not within the reasonable contemplation of SCHAs that they could never be obliged to contribute to the Scheme.</p>

Suppose that in their negotiations with their pilots, a significant number of the SCHAs agreed that they should contribute towards the future cost of pilots authorised by them.  The construction of Rule 9(1)(a) for which Miss Asplin contends would prevent the Trustee from implementing such a change.  The construction I consider to be correct allows that to be done.  </p>

Nor does it make any difference that the BPA and ABP had no authority to act as agent for, and therefore to bind, CHAs in general.  These matters do not detract from the fact that the Negotiating Forum was perceived by the Trustee when it came to make the 1988 Rules as the policy-making body.  It cannot sensibly be suggested, I think, that the Negotiating Forum itself could not put matters to the Trustee for implementation which differed significantly from the existing structure.  Indeed, the very introduction of an employer contribution rule was itself a very significant change from the pre-existing byelaws but was not met with objection by any CHA which became a Participating Body.

The purpose of the implication of a term or the application of the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Hole v Garnsey</span> is to give the words used the meaning which the parties intended or understood them to have.  The scope of Rule 9(1)(a) is to be objectively ascertained.  Either it does allow the ratio of employee/employer contributions to be altered or it does not.   If its scope is wide enough to allow for such an alteration, it is not open, in my judgment, for a dissenting CHA to say that the alteration does not bind it.  In contrast, if the dissentient is able to say that the alteration does not bind it, that is because the amendment goes beyond the scope of the power.  The position in the case of a power vested in a third party as in the present case (where it is vested in the Trustee) is different from that in <span style="font-style:italic">Hole v Garnsey</span>.  The power in question in that case was exercisable by the members of the association; the litigation was about whether a dissentient member could be bound.  It was not necessary to decide whether the majority which assented to the amendment would be bound.  But even if they could, it must surely be on the footing that they were <span style="text-decoration:underline">agreeing</span> amongst themselves to an additional obligation being imposed on them rather than because the power of amendment could be used to impose it.  Consider, for instance, a member voting with the majority.  He would reasonably expect that either the resolution would be carried or it would not and that, if it were carried, all members would be bound.  He could reasonably say, I would have thought, that he never voted in favour of only some of the members being bound and that he, too, should be able to dissent.  The position in the present case, where a unilateral power is vested in the Trustee, is entirely different.  In my view, the issue is not the power of the Trustee to bind a dissentient CHA; rather it is about the scope of the Trustee’s power <span style="font-style:italic">simpliciter</span>.</p>

I do not consider that it must have been outside the reasonable contemplation of the CHAs in 1988/89 that the ratio might change.  I see no reason for thinking that the ratio was seen as set in stone.  If that is right, then there is no reason to pick any point beyond which one should not go.  The conclusion must be that the answer to Issue 1 remains the same.

If it had been sought to introduce such a contribution obligation in 1989 when the Scheme was in a healthy financial state, and if the Negotiating Forum had agreed that that should be done, I do not consider that a dissentient ECHA would have been entitled to block an appropriate amendment.  It is only the fact that the deficit is now so large that has led the CHAs to question whether it can possibly be the case that an amendment imposing this large new obligation can have been in the reasonable contemplation of anyone.  Focusing on the question in that way points, of course, to the answer which the ECHAs urge on me.  But it is not the right question.  The question is whether, when the 1988 Rules were made, it was in the reasonable contemplation of the relevant persons (let me assume for the sake of the argument that this includes the CHAs) that amendments could be made to the contribution rule which ensured that the Scheme would remain adequately funded.  I appreciate, of course, that the environment today is very different from what it was in 1988/9 when there was no statutory regime which could be used to extract further contributions from employers; schemes could be left under-funded with the pain being suffered by the members.  But even so, many schemes were conventional balance of cost schemes and the idea that employers might have to pay further contributions into under-funded schemes was not something new.  </p>

The Scheme is, after all, a single scheme and there is no ear-marking of its assets to particular Members.  Accordingly, a contribution by a particular CHA could accrue principally for the benefit of Members who had been employed by another CHA or indeed only by pilotage authorities and never by an SCHA at all.  Rejecting, as I do, the possibility of implied earmarking of contributions for particular Members, the curious result would be reached under which the liability of a CHA would be limited by reference to “its” employees without the payment made by it to meet its obligations being earmarked for their benefit.  </p>

Accordingly, even if the contribution of a particular CHA was restricted to that part of the deficit which related to its Members, it would be open, in my judgment, to the Trustee to introduce a rule which allocated the total deficit among the Participating Bodies <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>to the liabilities of the Members currently or formerly employed or authorised by them and in respect of their periods of employment or authorisation by that employer.  Contributions having been made pursuant to such a rule, the exercise could be carried out again.  But this would be no different from the imposition of a deficit contribution in the first place.</p>

I do not consider that such an amendment could possibly have precluded a further exercise of the power under Article 5 for instance to bring in new benefits or new contribution provisions with the consent of the Negotiating Forum.

The national scheme did not make such provision; but if that is what the pilotage authorities had wished to see, it could have been done.</p>

It would, in my judgment, have been possible for the Secretary of State to have provided expressly in the 1987 Order that the Trustee, in exercise of its power of amendment, could impose contribution obligations on an Active or a Formerly Active SCHA in the same way as for an Active or Formerly Active ECHA.  Had that been done, it would then have been open to the Trustee in fact to impose such an obligation in the exercise of the power given to it.  </p>

He says that the circumstances which have given rise to the deficit are highly material in relation to what can, and cannot, be a proper exercise of the power.  Thus, he contends, in similar vein to Miss Asplin and Mr Furness, that the Scheme was designed to operate without a conventional balance of cost covenant and that it is impermissible to use the power of amendment for the purpose of inserting what would in effect be such a covenant; but not only does he contend for that, he also contends that had the Scheme been operated properly according to its terms, no such covenant would have been needed.  Let me put the crux of his argument by quoting from his skeleton argument:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“……The source of Teesport’s obligations in relation to the Fund is the Deed of Accession it signed.  That Deed obliges it to comply with all the provisions of the bye-laws and Rules of the Fund from time to time in force insofar as they relate to members of the Fund who are authorised by it to act as pilots in any part of the area in relation to which it is the competent harbour authority.  Although the Deed does not in terms say so, it is obvious that the underlying basis of Teesport’s acceptance of obligations under the bye-laws and Rules was that the Trustee – the counterparty to the Deed - was itself to comply with the provisions of the bye-laws and Rules.  As trustee, the Trustee could not properly do otherwise.  It follows that both parties to the Deed had a reasonable expectation that each would comply with the material provisions of the Rules.  One such provision is <span style="font-weight:bold">rule 13(2)</span>.  The effect of that rule is to require the payment by self-employed members of such additional contributions as the Trustee, after consultation with the actuary, determines to be “necessary to secure” the benefits to be provided.  The presence of this provision explains the absence of any contribution obligation on the SCHAs: none can be necessary.  It is demonstrable on the evidence filed by the Trustee that the Trustee and the previous scheme Actuary have failed to comply with <span style="font-weight:bold">rule 13(2)</span>.  That failure is the cause of the deficit relating to self-employed members.  Because it was outside the contemplation of the parties to the Deed of Accession that the Trustee would fail to comply with <span style="font-weight:bold">rule 13(2)</span> and that a deficit would result, it was equally outside the contemplation of the parties that the amending power (whatever its apparent scope) could be used to make good a deficit resulting from the Trustee’s failure to comply with that or any other provision of the Rules.  The amending power is accordingly subject to an implied limitation preventing it from being used in that way.”</p>

I am bound to say that the mere presence of this substantial deficit does not necessarily indicate that there has been any breach of duty at all.  I am not sure whether Mr Martin is alleging that the Trustee has been in breach of duty (over the last 20 years) for failing to set and collect contributions at rates which, it can now be seen with the benefit of hindsight, were sufficient to ensure that benefits are fully secured or whether he is alleging that they have failed to set and collect contributions at rates which complied with good actuarial practice.  If he is saying the latter, I clearly cannot determine that in these proceedings.  But if he accepts that the Trustee has acted in accordance with proper actuarial advice but is saying that, even so, the Trustee is in breach of duty, I totally reject the allegation.</p>

The word “secure” is to be given a strong meaning.  In support of that, he relies on Rule 44(3) which gives the Trustee power to buy out the benefits of a Member entitled to a Deferred Pension by the purchase of “an annuity policy securing ….. the benefits which would otherwise be payable”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, that is not a tenable construction of Rule 13(2).  The contribution which is required from time to time has nothing to do with the eventual guarantee (possibly in very different market conditions) of benefits.  Rather the contributions under Rule 13(2) are those which the Trustee “after consultation with the Actuary, shall determine to be necessary to secure…”.  In my judgment, it is clear that if the Trustee obtains advice from the Actuary about the appropriate contribution rate and if it follows that advice without having any reason to question it then the Trustee has done all that the Rule requires of it.  There is no breach of duty at all.  The Trustee does not have to ensure buy-out funding; it does not have to adopt a gilts-matching policy (and even that would not provide the sort of guarantee which Mr Martin submits the Rules require) and I am in any event wholly unpersuaded by the ingenuity shown by him (and by Mr Stephens, his most experienced junior) in his skeleton argument describing an appropriate investment policy which “can easily be managed”.  Its obligations under this provision were different (compare <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Alitalia v Rotunno </span><span style="color:#000000">[2008] PLR 175) although no doubt discontinuance funding of some sort might have been a possible route.  The fact that in 2010 such a funding objective is more common and is perceived as wise and cautious, is not a reason for saying that it is an objective which the Trustee should have ensured was met in years gone by.  I do not consider that Rule 44(3) drives one to, or even points in the direction of, a different conclusion.  The use of the word “secure” in Rule 44(3) merely describes precisely that which a purchased annuity is designed to do, namely provide the purchased benefit.  But even insurance companies can have difficulties.  What if the provider goes bust?  Has the Trustee then failed to acquire a product which falls within Rule 44(3)?  Of course not.</span></p>

The exercise of the power of amendment is not, in my judgment, restricted so as to prevent the Trustee from amending the Scheme so as to impose a contribution obligation simply by virtue of the fact (if it be a fact) that the deficit is attributable, or partly attributable, to its own breach of duty.   [I say “simply by virtue” to emphasise that the amendment would have to be a proper one apart from the alleged breach by the Trustee.]   The power to amend the Scheme is there to enable the Scheme to operate effectively in changing circumstances, including unforeseen circumstances.  Its primary purpose, in the light of my analysis, must be to ensure that the benefits for which the Rules provide are delivered.  It makes no difference to that whether the reason for a deficit is a fall in markets, a change in actuarial assumptions or a failure (in breach of duty) by the Trustee to ensure that the contribution rate is adequate or some other breach of duty.  </p>

It refers to “a deficit arising in circumstances falling outside the scope of the reasonable expectations of the parties to the deeds of accession”.  I did not understand quite what that meant when I first read it and I am afraid that I am no nearer an understanding (although I am perhaps better informed) after submissions made to me.  It seems to me that if it is right, as some of the CHAs submit, that the contribution obligation is to be found in, and restricted by, the express covenants in the Deeds of Accession, then there is no need for any implied term such as is suggested in Issue 14.  In contrast, if the obligation is found by reference to the Rules alone whatever the Deed of Accession may say, it is not the reasonable expectations referred to which are relevant (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>the factual position of a huge deficit was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> expected) but rather the reasonable contemplation of the parties (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>might the amendment power be exercised to impose a further obligation in certain circumstances).

Bristol is joined to represent the interests of SCHAs (among others) on this issue.  Mr Furness accepts that the answer to Question 3A turns on the answer to Question 1.  In the light of my analysis in answering Question 1 and in the light of the answers to the Issues arising under Question 1, the answer to Question 3A is that it was within the scope of the power of amendment under Rule 9(1)(a) to introduce Rule 13(4).  However, although Bristol does not suggest that there is any positive reason to doubt that the power of amendment was properly exercised in introducing Rule 13(4), it contends that the evidence before the Court is not sufficient for the Court to be able to grant a declaration that it was validly exercised.   Mr Tennet quite reasonably says that the Trustee wants an answer to the question.  It is raised on the Claim Form, the question being asked on its face “in the events that have occurred”.  This gives rise to Issue 20A – was the power of amendment properly exercised in introducing Rule 13(4). </p>

Taken at face value with nothing more, and assuming that there is nothing more which could be said, the explanation would be enough to persuade me that the amendment was properly introduced.  Mr Furness does not raise any positive case to say that the power was not properly exercised.  He simply says that the evidence is not enough.  Mr Williamson explains that the Rule was introduced because of a fear on the part of the Trustee that SCHAs could seek to limit their exposure by ceasing to authorise self-employed pilots.  There is some evidence that Boston was in fact contemplating doing this.  The new provision was inserted as a stop-gap.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Furness does not challenge that.  But he says that the evidence is incomplete because it can be seen from what Mr Williamson does say that legal advice was taken; but this advice has not been disclosed to the Court.  It is only right, he says, that if the Trustee is seeking the protection of the Court by seeking a declaration – in effect asking for the imprimatur of the Court – that its actions are unimpeachable, it really ought to make full and frank disclosure of all the material on the basis of which it made its decision.  No-one except the Trustee has seen that advice.  Mr Furness suggests that it is possible that, if the advice were known, it might reveal an error of law or the taking into account of the wrong considerations.  </p>

I think that they are right in that submission.  It came into being in circumstances giving rise to litigation privilege.  Indeed, Mr Furness accepts that the Trustee does not have to reveal it.  It follows, as he accepts, that were an attack being made on the introduction of Rule 13(4) and a declaration sought that the Rule was invalid, the advice would not be revealed.  And there being no other ammunition save, I suppose, some smoking gun (to mix my metaphors) revealed on disclosure, there would not really be any case for the Trustee to answer.  I do not think that the SCHAs have been given anything other than the fullest opportunity to meet the evidence which Mr Williamson has produced.  They flagged the point at the PTR that the evidence might be inadequate.  Mr Tennet, giving evidence from the bar which was not disputed, said that the specific point about the legal advice was not made on that occasion but emerged for the first time in Mr Furness’ skeleton argument.  In any event, no application was made for disclosure of the legal advice which, in any case, Mr Furness accepts would not have had to be disclosed. </p>

Mr Williamson has given evidence about that which, on its face, provides a rational explanation for the introduction of the Rule.  The evidence is perhaps not as full as in relation to Rule 13(4) but there is not the point that legal advice has not been revealed.  I am quite sure from the evidence and from what Mr Tennet has submitted that the issue of propriety was always intended to be raised by the Trustee and that the words on the Claim Form are wide enough to do so. </p>

This Act contained, in Part III, provisions for contracting-out of the state earnings related pension scheme (which related to employed earners).  There are frequent references in that Part to “earner” and “service” but these are all references to an employed earner and the service of such an earner.  The SSPA 1975 also contained, in Part IV, provisions concerning occupational pension schemes relating to equal access, disclosure and priority in bankruptcy.  Part IV applied in respect of membership of the scheme and thus was of potential application both to employed and self-employed persons where the relevant scheme had members of either (or both) of those classes of member.  The SSPA 1975 contained, in its original form, no provisions imposing statutory debts on the insolvency of employers.</p>

An employed earner meant a person employed under a contract of service or in an office chargeable to income tax under Schedule E and a self-employed earner meant a person gainfully employed otherwise than in employed earner’s employment (whether or not he was also employed in such employment).  A person could thus be both an employed earner and a self-employed earner at the same time.

This provision is effectively repeated in section 181(2) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (“<span style="font-weight:bold">the PSA 1993</span>”) which I consider later.  Although “employment” included self-employment, the use of the phrases “employed earner” and “self-employed earner” suggests that the latter was not seen as having an “employer”.  The only references in the Act to “employer” were all clearly references to a person who was an employer of employed earners.  Accordingly, in that Act at least, there was no need for a self-employed person to have an “employer” at all.  I do not overlook that “employed” was to be construed in accordance with “employment”. But this meant only that a self-employed person was employed for the purposes of the Act, not that he necessarily had an employer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The definition of “employee” is used principally in relation to contracting-out.  That was concerned with employed earners and, in the context of contracting-out, an “employer” was clearly restricted to employers of employees within the definition.  It is used also in Part VI of the PSA 1993 in the context of protection for scheme members in section 111A (introduced by <span style="font-family:Times-Roman;color:#231F20">the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999).  There are references in Chapter II of Part VI to “employee” but this is given the same meaning as in the employment protection legislation: see section 123(3).  It is not, therefore, at all surprising to find that the definition of “employer” is linked to the definition of “employee”: in the provisions which I have referred to, it is only ever relevant to know who is the employer of an employee and the definition of “employer” tells us who that person is.   And as with the Social Security Act 1975, the extension of “employment” and “employed” to cover the self-employed person does not necessarily entail that there is an “employer”.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Each of sections 112 and 144 provided a special definition of “employer”.  It was sensible to do so, indeed it was probably necessary to do so.  This is because there is nothing in the sections, apart from the special definition, to identify who the employers are.  It is, of course, necessary to establish some linkage between the scheme and the employer: the employer has to be connected with the scheme in some way.  It could be said that the definition of “employer” in section 181(1) is to be applied so that the necessary connection is to be found in the employment by the employer of “employees” who themselves have a connection with the scheme.  But the question then arises about the extent of the connection between the scheme and the employees sufficient to make the employer subject to the sections.  A number of questions arise: Do the “employees” have to be currently employed?  And if so, do they need to be active members of the scheme?  Or is it enough that there are “employees” who have in the past been active members?  Or that there are current employees eligible to join?  There is another question: is it right, in any case, to restrict “employer” to employers of “employees” (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>employed earners) at all?  After all, the different policy considerations which led to the insertion of section 112 and section 144 might be seen as applying equally to protect the benefits of members who were not employed earners.  The special definition identifies the linkage which I have referred to in this way: for a person to be an “employer” he has to be “the employer of persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme [in question] relates”.  That gives rise to difficult questions of construction.  I do not propose to answer them in the context of the PSA 1993 but answer the same or similar questions in the context of subsequent legislation. </p>

She says that section 144(3) does not discard the definition of “employer” in section 181(1) but rather limits it.  Accordingly, where one sees the words “employer” in the phrases “means the employer of the persons….”, the definition in section 181(1) is to be applied.  It does not make grammatical sense to effect a straight substitution of the words in the definition for the words “the employer” but by a simple reordering of words, we arrive at this:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But this leaves open the question whether “the employer” is to be given any meaning at all where the category of employment concerned is self- employment.  If the definition in section 181(1) is to be seen as exclusive, then there is force in Miss Asplin’s point.  By exclusive, I mean that the definition means that there can be an employer for the purposes of the Act (“unless the context otherwise requires”) only where there is a relationship with an employed earner.  On this approach, “employer” has no more meaning in relation to a self-employed person than it has in relation to, for instance, the widow of a deceased pensioner entitled to benefits under the scheme.  But if it is not exclusive, Miss Asplin’s argument breaks down.  In that case, although the definition tells you who the employer is in the case of an employed earner, it says nothing about the case of other earners. </p>

Without a definition of “employer” it might be thought that the use of the word in relation to an employee under a contract of service would have an obvious meaning.  Indeed, it is precisely that obvious meaning that the definition adopts by identifying the “employer” as “his employer” where there is such a contract.  The definition can be seen as confirming, for the purposes of the Act, (i) that an employee does indeed have an employer and (ii) who that employer is.</p>

This is because an office with emoluments would as a matter of ordinary language be called an employment just as much as an ordinary contract of service.  It has nothing to do with the inclusionary words in the express definition of “employment”.  What is less clear is whether, as a matter of ordinary language, an office-holder has an employer; but that question is eliminated by the second limb which tells us for the purposes of the Act (whatever might be the position as a matter of ordinary language) that (i) there is a person who is an employer in relation to him and (ii) who that employer is.  </p>

It is worth remarking that the PA 1995 did not cover contracting-out which was left to be dealt with by the pre-existing legislation.

The “applicable time” was any time when the scheme was being wound up unless a relevant insolvency event had occurred in relation to the employer.  Otherwise, it was the time immediately before the relevant insolvency event.  As originally enacted, a relevant insolvency event meant, in the case of a company, the commencement of its liquidation or winding-up.

He says that the definitions are simply identifying, out of all the employers in the world, those who are employers in relation to a given pension scheme. He suggests that neither section defines “employer” itself but, rather, each defines the expression “employer in relation to an occupational pension scheme”.  I do not think that that is quite right.   There is no doubt, I think, that the definition is of the word “employer” but it is defined, not generally, but only in relation to an occupational pension scheme.  This reflects the position under the PSA 1993.  In section 144 “employer” was defined for the purposes of section 144.  The inclusion of the words “in relation to an occupational pension scheme” was unnecessary in section 144(3) because the words “category of employment to which the scheme relates” was a reference back to the scheme identified in sub-section (1).  In contrast, those earlier words did need to be included in section 124 otherwise the words “to which the scheme in question relates” would have had no reference. </p>

Indeed, that is the only way in which the definitions of earner and employment would find their way into the PA 1995 (although why one then finds definitions of “normal pension age” and “public service pension scheme” adopting those of the PSA 1993 I do not know).</p>

Or it might be said that “employer” has a meaning (applying the principles of construction which I have considered when answering Question 1) in the context of the  PA 1995 and the PA 2004 which goes beyond the case of employment under a contract of service or the case of an office-holder but does not go so far as including all self-employments.

Sub-section (3) allows the definition to be extended to include a person who had at one time employed, but no longer employs, a relevant person.

Miss Asplin submits, in effect, that this can only be because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, by the legislature (or as I would say, the Secretary of State) that, without it, the Scheme would no longer have been an occupational pension scheme.  This, in turn could only be on the basis that it was considered that the person establishing the Scheme, that is to say Trinity House, was not when the Scheme was established  (whether that was in 1971 or in 1983 does not matter) a person which then “employed” its pilots for the purposes of subsection (2)(a).    She may be right that this is what was thought to be the case by those making the Regulations.  If they did think so, they may have been wrong.  But if they were right, it is a powerful indicator that PSA 1993 does not include, in any of its provisions (and in particular section 144) as an “employer”, a person who employs the services of a self-employed person.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This section is not yet in force.  But clearly its presence in the PA 2004 can be taken account of.  It is manifest, I consider, that the draftsman of this provision was using “self-employed” as including that concept as ordinarily understood.  Self-employment is to be contrasted in this context with employment under a contract of service or in an office.  The use of the phrase, in subsection (3)(b), “not employed in it by someone else” is instructive.  Suppose I employ a self-employed solicitor to conduct a conveyancing transaction.  From his point of view he is, assuming I pay my bill, gainfully employed using employed in the sense of carrying out a function.  He is, both from his point of view and my point of view, engaged in an employment as defined in the legislation (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>as including a profession).  In one sense he is employed, as a matter of ordinary language, too: I have employed him to carry out my conveyancing transaction.  But in another sense, I have not employed him: he is certainly not my employee (whether in the sense defined in section 181 PSA 1993 or any other usual sense) and in that sense I am not his employer.  If it is said that all cases of what would normally be called self-employment nonetheless gives rise to a relationship where the person providing the service is to be regarded as employed, it is difficult to see how anyone could ever fall within the definition in subsection (3)(b).  But if some self-employed individuals (a shop-keeper for instance) are not employed by someone else, but others (self-employed pilots perhaps) are employed by someone else, difficult factual questions are bound to arise about where the line is to be drawn and the principles on which it is to be drawn.</p>

Miss Asplin says that the use of that word clearly shows that the legislature did not consider that such references would be effective: otherwise the words “purport to” could have been omitted.  She contrasts that with subsection (2) where there is a regulation-making power directed at excluding from a reference to employers persons who actually are employers.  </p>

She asks and answers the question “What if Port of Tyne [her client] is wrong in this?”.  The answer she says is that an impracticable and irrational result follows.  I shall postpone dealing with her answer until I have considered Mr Green’s submissions to the effect that the SCHAs can indeed properly be seen, in practical terms, as employers and therefore as employers for the purposes of Section 75 (albeit not for other purposes, such as employment law or for tax generally).</p>

However, the contexts of the two Acts are different, and in the PA 2004 the definition in relation to an occupational pension scheme is coupled with, and differs from, that in relation to a personal pension scheme.  Miss Asplin submits that the same construction should be placed on both definitions.  There is a great deal of force in that submission since (i) the two Acts are intended to operate together in the governance of pensions schemes and (ii) Part 3 of PA 2004 (Scheme Funding) is to be construed as one with Part 1 of the PA 1995 (see section 233 PA 2004).  It would be odd if the regime for recovery of deficiency contributions and the SSF regime applied to different bodies.  </p>

These arrangements relate to payment of contributions by or  in respect of an “employee”.  The definition of “employer” in relation to a personal pension scheme therefore clearly refers only to a person who employs another person under a contract of service or, in the case of an office-holder, to the person who is responsible for the office-holder’s remuneration.   The substantive provisions in PA 2004 concerning personal pension schemes relates only to scheme where direct payment arrangements are in place.  The question whether there can be an “employer” in respect of personal pension schemes where such arrangements are not in place does not, therefore arise.  I do not consider that the definition in relation to personal pension schemes gives any guidance about the meaning of the definition in relation to occupational pension schemes.</p>

If “employer” extended to persons engaging self-employed contractors Mr Furness says that one would have expected the section to be drafted so as to cover contributions deducted from the fees paid to the self-employed contractor. It is not possible to attribute a wider meaning to employee, so as to correspond to the wider meaning for employer, because employee is defined in the 2004 Act as having the same meaning as in the PSA 1993 in relation to which the meaning is clear.  The section is drafted, according to Mr Furness, on the assumption that where an employer deducts contributions from a member’s earnings and pays them to the trustees, he will be doing so only in respect of an employee.  The same assuming underlies sections 90(2)(g) and 150(6)(b) PA 2004.</p>

The restrictions are imposed in respect of contributions made on behalf of employees (which must mean “employees” as defined).  He submits that it did not occur to the draftsman that an employer might make contributions on behalf of someone who was not an employee, but in respect of whom he was an employer. Likewise section 238 of the 2004 Act (not yet in force) provides for an employer to give information and advice about pensions and saving for retirement to “employees”. It was clearly not regarded as a possibility that the employer might be sponsoring members who were not employees.</p>

The draftsman cannot have thought that only employees and their employers could participate in occupational pension schemes.  He must be taken to have known that schemes with self-employed members could fall within the scope of the definition of occupational pension scheme.  He must therefore be taken to have known that contributions could be made to a scheme by self-employed members themselves and perhaps by others in respect of them.  For instance, in the present case, the original rules might have (although in fact they did not) imposed contribution obligations on an SCHA.  In any case, a contribution which an SCHA is obliged to collect is one which, it seems to me, the SCHA will “cause” to be paid to the scheme.  Accordingly, the draftsman must have understood (unless he had simply overlooked) that contributions might be made by persons (even if they were not employers) in relation to members other than employees.  If he did not overlook this point, then his drafting must reflect a deliberate decision to give employees certain protections that were not to be afforded to the self-employed.  But this gets one nowhere in deciding the scope of the definition of “employer”.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Green appears for the PLA, a Formerly Active ECHA, which represents those persons who are interested in giving “employer” a wide meaning so as to  share the statutory debt as widely as possible.   He starts with a broad brush.  He identifies the thrust of the Section 75 regime as being that someone is to stand behind a deficit in a pension scheme; that “someone” is not any member but is the person for whom the members work or, to put that another way, those whom the members serve.   Consistently with that, he submits that the use of the word “employment” in the legislation was to distinguish between participating bodies which had adhered to relevant schemes and members who by reason of their service have accrued benefits.  In other words, the distinction is between “employers” and “members”, not between “employers” and “employees”.  No distinction is to be drawn between the different classes of member.  Both employed and self-employed members have pensionable service; both accrue benefits in respect of that service; and liabilities must be provided for in respect of both classes.  So, Mr Green says, the Section 75 regime imposes responsibility for those liabilities on the persons whom members have served.  Importantly as part of this broad argument he says that characterisation of the working arrangements between the Participating Body and its members as being pursuant to one form of contract rather than another is of no rational significance so far as concerns the application of Section 75.  In the particular case of the Scheme, he says that the working arrangements are so similar for employed and self-employed pilots that SCHAs are to be seen as “employers” for the purposes of Section 75.</p>

I have already raised the issue whether it is an exclusive definition. If it is an exclusive definition, then the use of that word in the definition in section 144 PSA 1993 of “employer” must mean that “employer” is restricted to cases where there is an “employee”.  There would, in my view, be no room for excluding the section 181 definition from section 144 pursuant to the “unless the context otherwise requires” rubric at the beginning of section 181. The scheme would relate to the description or category of the employment in which the employees were working (and when an employer is readily identified) even if it is related also to other employments (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>of self-employed members of the scheme where there was no employer at all); that is enough to give perfectly sensible meaning to the phrase “persons [<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>in this case, employees] of the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates”.</p>

I see no reason why the same should not apply in relation to “employer” where that word is found within the definition in Section 75.

Accordingly, when it comes to establishing the meaning of the phrase “employer of persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme in question relates” in section 124(1), the word “employer” has to be assigned a meaning which may be different from its definition in section 181.

I have to say that it would be curious, to say the least, if that was not so.  The draftsman has recognised, in the definition in section 181, the need to define who the employer actually is in a case where that might not be clear, that is in the case of an office-holder.  If he had intended to include within the definition of “employer” in section 124 a person (as an “employer”) who had some relevant relationship with a self-employed person, I would have expected him to provide a mechanism for the identification of that person just as he has done in relation to the office-holder.  </p>

Is the employer to be found in a group of one or more ship-owners who use the pilots and ultimately pay for their services?  Is it the SCHA who is responsible for ensuring the provision of pilotage services in its area and who contracts with a third party for the provision by the pilots of pilotage services?  Self-employed pilots provide their services in different ways – through companies, co-operatives or partnerships (I am not aware of any sole trader).  Where a corporate body is used, is the “employer” that body rather than the SCHA?  There is no obvious answer to those questions. </p>

But is that the person who pays the office-holder, or the person (if different) prescribed under the definition in section 181 or some other person?

He says that these provisions clearly support the conclusion that an “occupational pension scheme” includes a scheme where pensionable service accrued in respect of periods of self-employment and the word “employment” included self-employment.

Moreover, given the apparent belief as reflected in the note that this might have come about as the result of the introduction of a new definition of occupational pension scheme by section 239, that lack of safety is underlined.

That person is the “employer” and the circumstances are (i) when the scheme is being wound up or (ii) in the case of a corporate employer, when it goes into liquidation.   If a scheme does not have an “employer”, the Section 75 regime is inapplicable.  </p>

I have no material, apart from the legislation itself, which assists me one way or the other in deciding whether the policy was to make liable for a statutory debt a person who is not an employer as defined in section 181 PSA 1993.  </p>

The pension of an employee is part of his remuneration package (it is seen as “pay” for the purposes of EU law).  It is not difficult to ascribe to Parliament a policy which makes an employer of employees responsible for this aspect of their welfare and thus liable to guarantee to a limited extent the pension expectation of the members.  I say to a limited extent, because the regime as originally operating under Section 75 did not provide 100% cover for liabilities.  </p>

This would not be unique; employment protection legislation was, subject to the impact of Community law (now we call it European Union Law) restricted to protection of employees and not the self-employed.  In that context, self-employed pilots are not “employees”: <span style="font-style:italic">Bibby v Associated British Ports Ltd</span> (unreported, 25 March 2003) and the policy which had led to extensive protection for employees does not extend to them.</p>

There is no reason why a participating body which has entered into a Deed of Accession like an SCHA should be able to shelter behind the fact that its relations with its PNPF members happen to involve a contract for services rather than a contract of service.

What he does say, however, is that the relationship of self-employed pilots to an SCHA does have the result that the SCHAs are employers for the purpose of Section 75 in relation to the Scheme.  I will come to his submissions on the details of that relationship in a moment.  But unless he does go so far as to say that all pensionable self-employments have an employer, there must be legal and practical criteria by which one can judge whether or not a particular self-employment has an employer or does not.  And in any particular case, a judgment will have to be made by reference to those criteria about whether there is an employer in relation to the self-employment concerned.  I accept that in many cases of legal classification, there are border-line cases where different minds may take different views.  It is not necessarily a fatal objection to Mr Green’s approach that in some cases of self-employment, such an enquiry might have to be undertaken: he would say that wherever the line is to be drawn, the SCHAs fall on the employer side of it.  However, there are obvious concerns about bringing into the jurisprudence a category of self-employment which is of a special nature being so close (or, depending on your stance, close enough) to a contract of service that it is to be treated, for the purposes of the Section 75 regime, in the same way as service under such a contract.  This is especially so given that this relationship remains one under which the individual concerned is still a “self-employed earner” and does not become an “employed earner” and under which he remains, for employment protection purposes, outside the definition of “employee”.</p>

Many of these factors point up a similarity between ECHAs and SCHAs in the context of the Scheme.  That, it seems to me, is quite beside the point.  It is not their functions under the Scheme which determine whether they are “employers”; it is whether the relationship which they have with the pilots which they authorise is one where they can properly be described as “employers”.   Whether or not a person, in relation to a scheme, is the “employer” of a member cannot depend on the precise provisions of the scheme provided that the member is in pensionable service under the scheme.  </p>

Suppose that the existing liabilities were apportioned on some rational basis between the two schemes and assets were divided <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> to those liabilities.  Finally, suppose that each scheme introduced an early retirement scheme similar to that actually introduced into the Scheme.  The result would be that the SCHAs would have obtained the economic benefit of a share of the £15 million surplus actually used.  Would the consequence of that utilisation in the SCHA scheme make the SCHAs employers for the purposes of Section 75 if, absent that utilisation, they would not have been?  The clear answer, in my view, is that it would have made no difference at all.  Either the SCHAs are employers by virtue of their ongoing relationship with their pilots or they are not.  The introduction of particular benefits funded in a particular way can make no difference to that.  Mr Green’s forensic reliance on the early retirement scheme gets him, in my view, nowhere.</p>

But as to the other work which pilots do, the evidence does not disclose precisely what happens.  One might assume, for instance, that a self-employed pilot who provides his services through a co-operative and who receives his remuneration from the co-operative, might have administrative tasks to perform as part of his agreement with the co-operative; and similarly, a partner in a partnership providing pilotage services might have duties to perform outside his actual pilotage of ships.  Quite possibly, employed pilots also have duties outside actual pilotage, the performance of which is reflected in their pay.

However, “employer” was given an extended meaning; it was defined not by reference to an employee but by reference to a worker and meant a person “for whom one or more workers work, or have worked or normally work or seek to work”.  This is just the sort of extended definition which the draftsman of the PA 1995 could have adopted if he had intended “employer” to go beyond the employer of an employee or beyond the extension which he did include, namely the employer of an office holder.  Mr Green is right, no doubt, to say that this decision of the Court of Appeal shows that the concept of a person who is self-employed being treated as in a relationship with an “employer” for statutory purposes is not alien to English law.

No doubt, if Parliament had wanted to make persons in the position of SCHAs liable as employers, it could have done so.  But Parliament did not expressly do so.  For my part, I do not consider that the nexus which Mr Green identifies is sufficient to achieve that result in the absence of express language to that effect.  One serious difficulty I have with his approach is that he nowhere identifies the principles by which one is to assess whether the relationship does or does not amount to one under which the SCHA is an “employer”.  It cannot, I think, have been Parliament’s intention to introduce the need for factual enquiries about the detail of the relationship between the alleged employer and employee before knowing whether Section 75 was applicable; still less can it have intended to introduce what is, essentially, a matter of judgment.  There would be no “right” answer in many cases; different minds might quite reasonably take different views about whether a particular relationship results in an entity being an “employer”.  More importantly, different judges, if the matter were tested in court, could reasonably come to different views and would be open to appeal only if the decision fell outside the range of the reasonable.</p>

He also argues that the relationships between SCHAs and S Members, and between ECHAs and “E” Members are materially similar.  Drawing on those factors, he would say that the SCHA is the “employer”.  But I am far from clear that that would be correct.  There is a powerful case for saying that it is the ship-owners who are the employers (if there has to be an employer at all).  They could, as Miss Asplin submits, be said to be closer to an “employer” of the pilots than SCHAs ever are, especially in cases where they negotiate their fees and hire their services, although that is not the general position.   Where there might be a doubt about who is, or who is to be treated as if it is, an “employer”, the draftsman has provided the answer in some cases </span>
	      <span class="bold" style="font-style:italic">eg </span>
	      <span class="bold">in relation to office-holders.  That suggests that, where it is not expressly stated that there is an employer in relation to an employment or an employee, the conclusion is that there is no employer.  Mr Furness makes the same points.</span>

At what stage would the SCHA cease to be an “employer”, and the co-operative become one, and what test will the Court apply?

The SCHA is not an employer prior to the time when it first employs a pilot eligible to join the Scheme.  It might be thought that the employment of a pilot would not alter that position.  Later in this judgment, in the context of Question 4, I consider the question whether the employment of a person eligible to be a Member, or of a person who is a deferred Member or a pensioner Member, means that the employer ceases to be an “employer of persons in the description of employment to which the scheme relates”.

An asymmetry arising out of ECHA liabilities only being taken into account for the purposes of “L1” and “L(all)”, but SCHA liabilities being included in “D”, suggests, he says that something fundamental will have gone wrong with the interpretation of the application of the Section 75 regime in relation to the Scheme.   If SCHAs do not constitute “employers” for Section 75 purposes (as I have held in answer to Question 6), he submits that the logical conclusion is that Section 75 liabilities do not include liabilities attributable to Pensionable Service accrued by Members authorised by and working for such SCHAs. </p>

From the perspective of a current employer, what matters is that it has to pick up a liability in respect of benefits of Members for whom it has never been responsible; it should not make much, if any, difference to the disgruntled employer whether that liability arises in relation to individuals who were employed or self-employed.</p>

The question is whether an employment-cessation event (as to which see below) occurred in relation to any of them, the answer to which depends on when an employer ceases to be “an employer employing persons in the description of employment to which the scheme relates” within the meaning of Regulation 6(4) of the Employer Debt Regulations.</p>

But under section 118(1) PA 1995, regulations could modify any provisions of Part I (which include Section 75) in their application to a trust scheme (such as the Scheme):</p>

By relevant persons, I mean “persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme in question relates” within the definition in section 124(1), as to which there is a dispute which I will, in due course, come to.  In other words, if a person falls within the definition but then ceases to employ relevant persons, it ceases to be an employer.  This is not, perhaps, entirely clear looking at the definition in isolation, although it is, I consider, the natural reading.  However, section 125(3) is a pretty clear pointer to the conclusion that, to fall within the definition at any given time, a person must actually employ relevant persons at that time.  That is the conclusion which, in my judgment, is correct.  It is a conclusion which is consistent with the approach of the draftsman which can be seen in Regulation 5.  I proceed on that basis.</p>

Nonetheless, it clearly remains to be included as an employer for the purposes of Section 75 under one or both of Regulations 5(1) and (2).  Where the employer has ceased to employ any eligible employees, it has ceased both to employ any active members and to employ any persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates.  The case falls within both sub-Regulations.  Where the employer continues to employ eligible employees but in fact employs no active members, sub-Regulation (1) applies; but whether sub-Regulation (2) applies turns on whether “the persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates” includes only active members or can include eligible employees.</p>

Not only is there a question whether it is sufficient to bring a person within the definition of “employer” that he employs eligible employees but no active members, the question arises whether the employments of employees who are not eligible but who are deferred or pensioner members, might also be enough.  For instance, an employee may have been an active member and become a deferred member (for instance by opting-out of membership) or may have started to draw his pension at age 65 whilst remaining in (non-pensionable) employment.  The argument which I will address later is that the scheme “relates” to such persons (in that it relates to all beneficiaries) so that, if he remains in employment with the same employer, that employer does not lose its status as an “employer”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What is clear, however, is that in the case of a single employer scheme, no debt arises under Section 75 until the applicable time.  Accordingly, a debt cannot arise until the earlier of an insolvency event in relation to the employer and the commencement of the winding up of the scheme.  Whilst I cannot say that the majority of occupational pension schemes in the UK are single employer schemes, it cannot be suggested that there are not very many schemes which are single employer schemes.  As I have already remarked, the focus of Section 75 is on single employer schemes and it is only through Regulations that appropriate provision is made for multi-employer schemes and for the position of former employers.  In the light of the operation of the statutory scheme in relation to single employer schemes, it is not possible to detect any policy, as of 1996-7, that a debt should fall on such an employer as soon as it has ceased to have any real connection with the scheme by ceasing to have any employees who are active members or even eligible to be active members.</p>

This follows from the change in definition of “the applicable time” by the inclusion of the new Section 75(3)(b) set out above.  The relevant applicable time for present purposes is the occasion on which the employer “ceases to be a person employing persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates” provided that some other person does remain an employer of such persons.  </p>

As with the single employer scheme, a debt only arises when, subsequently, the scheme goes into winding up before all of the employers have suffered insolvency events or when each employer suffers an insolvency event triggering the applicable time in relation only to the relevant employer.  Again, the statutory scheme does not disclose a policy, as of 1996-7, that statutory debts must in all cases arise whenever the employers cease to have any real connection in the way I have mentioned in relation to single employer schemes.</p>

One way in which it is possible to approach the question of construction is to start with the provisions of the scheme and to ask what employments the scheme is capable of covering.  A scheme might, for instance, apply only to certain grades of employee or it might apply only to employees working in particular locations.  Once those descriptions or categories of employment have been identified, so that employees in those descriptions or categories are at least eligible to become active members, it can, on this approach, be said that the scheme “relates” to those descriptions or categories of employment.  Starting with the provisions of the scheme, it is not necessary to ask whether there is, in fact, any eligible employee or, if there is, whether he is an active member.  However, having identified the sorts of employment to which the scheme relates, it is only if there is a person who actually employs a person in one of those descriptions or categories of employment that there will be an “employer”.  If there is such a person, then it is an “employer” and it makes no difference whether the relevant employees are active members so long as they are eligible to be active members.</p>

It is not that the definition has to be construed in the light of those Regulations.  Rather, those Regulations illustrate one method by which the policy behind Section 75 can be given effect to in the context of multi-employer schemes and in relation to former employers.  If the approach which I have just discussed in relation to the interpretation of “the employer” is correct, then it shows that the focus of the definition is not on employers of active members.

As with the earlier Regulations, Regulation 9 says nothing about <span style="text-decoration:underline">when</span> a statutory debt arises nor about <span style="text-decoration:underline">the amount</span> of such debt attributable to any particular employer.

An employer under such a scheme does not become liable for any debt simply because it ceases to employ active members or, indeed, individuals eligible to become active members.  The statutory debt is triggered only when the employer goes into liquidation or the scheme commences to be wound up.  And again, as under the earlier Regulations, no immediate debt is triggered as the result of the simultaneous cessation by all employers of employment of the relevant persons.  Accordingly, it is no more possible under the new Section 75 and the Employer Debt Regulations than it was under the old Section 75 and the 1996 Deficiency Regulations, to detect a policy which requires a debt to be thrown on an employer as soon as it ceases to employ active members.</p>

The words which I have emphasised show that “service in…employment to which the scheme relates” is not enough and it is necessary to provide that such service also has to be such as to qualify the member for benefits.  However, Regulation 6(4) of the Employer Debt Regulations refers to an employer employing persons “in the description of employment to which the scheme relates”, the same phrase as appears in the definition of pensionable service.  It would be very surprising to my mind if the use of that phrase in the Regulations was intended to be a reference to active members. One is left wondering, as Peter Smith J clearly wondered, why those words would restrict the relevant  employees to active members in Regulation 6(4) when they clearly did not do so in the case of the definition of “pensionable service”.  </p>

But like all aids to construction, it must be used with care.  The note cannot be used, in my view, to create an ambiguity where none exists: if the meaning of the instrument is clear, a note which ascribes to the text a different meaning is not capable of overriding the clear meaning nor capable of creating an ambiguity where none exists.  Similarly, if any ordinary meaning of the words used leads to an absurd conclusion (as in the <span style="font-style:italic">Confederation of Passenger Transport UK</span> case), or if it is clear that the draftsman has simply omitted something, the note can be referred to in order to produce a construction which eliminates the absurdity or fills the gap.  But even in such a case, it must be possible to arrive at the end result by a process of construction (including the implication of terms).  The Court cannot simply re-write the legislation.</p>

If those phrases have in section 124(1) a wider scope than active members, it is a strong pointer that Regulation 6(4), too, goes beyond active members.</p>

The only “description of employment” to which any pension scheme “relates” is that which constitutes pensionable service (within the terms of the scheme’s rules) by which benefits are accrued.  He focuses on the use of the present tense of the word “relates”, indicating that the focus is on employment which relate<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">s</span> to the scheme at the present time (<span style="font-style:italic">ie </span>active pensionable service), not on historic employment which relate<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">d</span> to the scheme in the past.</p>

I accept that it is necessary to see whether the test (employing persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates) is fulfilled from time to time: after all, an ECE only takes place at time T1 if, immediately before T1, the test is fulfilled and immediately after T1 it is not fulfilled.  It is therefore necessary to ask to what description or categories of employment the scheme relates (present tense) immediately before and immediately after T1.  Suppose the scheme is one for works employees at a particular location.  Suppose that at T1 the employer ceases to employ any active members (for instance because the last active member retires at T1) but, before and after T1 employs an individual, X, who has the right to join the scheme in question (either immediately or after a waiting period) because X is a recently employed works employee working at the specified location.  It is at least (strongly) arguable that the scheme “relates” to the description of employment “works employee at specified location”; since X has the right to join the scheme, it can be said that the employer does employ a person in the category or description of employment to which the scheme relates.  The argument may be right, it may be wrong; but what is certainly the case, in my judgment, is that the use of the present tense (relates) does not support the argument that Regulation 6(4) is concerned only with active members.</p>

If the occurrence of an ECE or not turns on whether an employer employs persons eligible to join the scheme as of right (whether immediately or after a waiting period) the trustees’ course of action, in the absence of the necessary information, will surely be to communicate with the employer.  It would be pointed out that the employer no longer had active members and that, absent information about eligible employees, the trustees would seek payment of the statutory debt.

If an employer wants to crystallize a debt when it ceases to have active employees, it will often be possible for it to close the scheme to new members.  It will then cease to have employees in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates and thus crystalise the debt.  That conclusion is, however, subject to the possibility that, by employing a person who is already a deferred or pensioner member, an ECE is avoided.  For reasons which I will come to in due course, I do not consider that employment of such persons does avoid an ECE so that the possibility just mentioned can be ignored.  In any case, Mr Spink’s proposition contains an unjustified assertion, namely that when an employer ceases to employ active members its “active participation” in the scheme ends.  It depends, I suppose, on what he means by active participation.  Quite apart from any statutory liability to make further payments to a scheme, an employer, or rather a former employer, may continue to have a liability to contribute to the scheme pursuant to the rules of the scheme.  It hardly seems correct, in my view, to describe such an employer as other than active.  Similarly, if an employer or former employer remains liable for contributions as the result of statutory provisions, it does not cease to be active.  However, if what Mr Spink means by ceasing to be an active employer is that the employer has no further obligation in respect of the further accrual of benefits, it does not seem to me to assist his argument.</p>

One must always be very careful about using earlier legislation to interpret later legislation even in the case of consolidating legislation and yet more so where the same or similar phrases are used in related, but different, areas.  I propose, nonetheless, to go along with Mr Spink’s course and to look at the history.  He says that the key phrase was always concerned with employers employing active members.  However, the term “active member” first appeared in PA 1995, years after the key phrase first appeared in the legislation concerning statutory debts, for instance in section 144 PSA 1993.  He suggests that the reason the Employer Debt Regulations did not use wording referring to “active members” (or indeed, to “pensionable service”) is because the draftsman was carrying over a legislative provision with an established meaning in the context of statutory debts and did not wish to confuse matters by changing the wording.</p>

More recently, section 70(2) PSA 1993 contained a similar definition when one traces the wording through “relevant employment”: see further on this aspect, paragraph 332 above.  Even if one accepts that Mr Spink’s suggestion about the wording of the Employer Debt Regulations is correct, it remains the case that the draftsman of the earlier provisions used the words which he did and did not draft by reference to “pensionable service” which would, I would have thought, have been the obvious approach to take if the legislation was intended to mean what Mr Spink says it means.

Thus suppose that two employers, E1 and E2, each employs active members.  E1 ceases to do so but retains employees eligible to join the scheme.  E2 then ceases to employ any active members.  Under Regulation 5, E1 is included as an employer (and, moreover, remains an employer even if it subsequently ceases to employ relevant persons).

That the department may want, from their current policy perspectives, to reach the position for the past which they have now reached by new Regulations, I can understand.  Their expressed views are quite probably driven in part by the desire.

Further paragraph (b) appears to recognise that ceasing to employ active members did not necessarily give rise to an ECE.  Of course, it can be argued that this entire provision was inserted to meet the concern that there is a doubt about the pre-existing provision.

That is the principle stated by Bennion −, Statutory Interpretation−, 4th ed (2002), section 232. In the present case we are concerned with guidance published by the Home Office, which is the government department which had responsibility for the enactment and operation of the legislation in question. In any given case, it may be helpful for a court to refer to the guidance in the interpretation of the legislation. It may be of some persuasive authority. However, to my mind that is the limit of its influence. It does not differ in that regard from a statement by an academic author in a textbook or an article. It does not enjoy any particular legal status.

Mr Spink’s interpretation effectively requires one to ignore the word “description of” (or the words “category or description of”) and to read the key phrase as if it provided “persons in employment to which the scheme relates”.  If those words had been used, Mr Spink’s case would be stronger.  The focus would then be on the employment in which the persons are currently engaged.  If the employee is not an active member, then his current employment would not, it can be argued, be one to which the scheme (currently) relates.   But the focus is clearly not on the current employment of particular employees; rather, it is on employment of a particular “description” (or “description or category”).  The question is not whether a particular relationship between an actual employer and an actual employee is one to which the scheme relates; rather it is whether an employment of the type (“description” or “description or category”) in which an actual employee happens to be employed is one to which the scheme “relates”.  That is a question which is to be answered by identifying the description of employment (Pilots in the present case) and by looking at the provisions of the scheme to see if it provides or is capable of providing benefits for persons in that description of employment.  </p>

The active members are clearly in employment to which the scheme relates, whilst the eligible members are arguably not in such employment (because their actual employment has no consequences for the scheme at all which does not therefore relate to their employment).  In contrast, so it seems to me, all of them are in a “description” of employment to which the scheme relates.  Indeed, they are all in the same description of employment and it would be an odd use of language to say that the scheme did, or did not, relate (in the relevant sense as used in Regulation 6(4)) to the <span style="text-decoration:underline">description</span> of employment concerned (in the example, works employees) depending on whether the scheme related (in a different sense) to the actual employment of each employee.</p>

Another way of putting the point, but it comes to the same thing, is to say that a scheme cannot be said to relate to a description of employment where no employee with certain characteristics (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>being over 61) can accrue benefits under the scheme.  Some people might be resistant to viewing that aspect of an employment as part of the description or categorisation of the employment.  I consider that they would be wrong to be resistant.  Perhaps the point can be made clearer by considering schemes such as might have been found when there was no law against sex discrimination.  Suppose that an occupational pension scheme was provided for male works employees but not for female works employees notwithstanding that men and women were doing the same job. In relation to such a scheme women are not, I consider, employed in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates.

To take a clear example, suppose that an employee leaves service and become a deferred member.  He is re-employed 3 years later and re-joins the scheme as an active member but with his benefits in respect of his previous service remaining to be dealt with separately under the rules of the scheme.

I have analysed this above as part of the description of the employment – thus in the case of the MNOPF, no person over 61 was eligible to join the scheme so that it cannot be said the scheme relates to the employment of persons over that age, adopting the description of the employment of “Officer over age 61”.  The description (and the same goes for category) of an employment is not limited by the work undertaken: the description of the employment (in contrast with the work undertaken) can certainly include different hours and different rates of pay for persons of different ages and can I think properly subsume different conditions of service such as access to pension provision.  </p>

Quite clearly, such a CHA is not an “employer”. The reason for this is that employment by that employer is not employment of a description to which the Scheme relates. It is part of the description of the employment that it is one in which employees are employed as pilots by the particular CHA. It is not, therefore, one in respect of which employees in that employment can ever join the scheme or become entitled to benefits under it.  </p>

It is true that it did so because it authorised (rather than employed) self-employed pilots.  But the status of the SCHA as a Participating Body is enough, in my judgment, to make any pilot whom it subsequently employs eligible to become a Member under Rule 11(2) if the pilot satisfies the ordinary eligibility criteria and in particular is under the age of 55 as required by that Rule.  Although a CHA can declare a pilot or group of pilots ineligible for Membership, where this has not been done the relevant employee remains eligible.  The facts may need to be investigated further in relation to some CHAs (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>Tyne) so that I make no determination of the position of any particular CHA. <span class="ItalicText" style="font-style:normal"> If the employment of a pilot, eligible to become of Member of the scheme, by an ECHA means that it falls within the definition of “employer” in section 124(1) PA 1995 (as in my view it does) I see no reasons for reaching a different conclusion in relation to the employment of such a pilot by an SCHA.</span></p>

One ECHA which is not a party to the proceedings, Peterhead Port Services (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Peterhead</span>”), has suggested that there is a doubt whether the new definition is apt to cover a scheme with the characteristics of the Scheme.  Peterhead does not dispute that the Scheme fell within the previous definition.  The position was clarified by statutory instrument (the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2007, which specifically prescribed the PNPF as an occupational pension scheme) with effect from 6 April 2007, but this left (according to Peterhead) a hiatus period of possible doubt between 22 September 2005 and 6 April 2007.   </p>

His actual decision is, however, confined to the meaning of “employer” in paragraph 1 and, if it has that limited application, does not present a significant problem, at least at present, for the Trustee in relation to the Scheme which is neither a sectionalised scheme nor a paid-up scheme and which does not, therefore, fall within either paragraph 1 or paragraph 3.</p>

As Morgan J himself pointed out, it was inconceivable that in these circumstances the employees of a company that had withdrawn would be admitted to membership unless it re-committed itself to making contributions (paragraph [69]).  In this passage of his judgment, Morgan J does not reject the argument that eligibility to join a scheme is enough to make the employer of the eligible persons within the meaning of “employer”.  What he clearly does reject is that the employees of CECA were in fact eligible.  It follows that on the actual facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Hearn v Dobson</span> paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 had no application to the scheme as it was not a scheme with more than one employer at the relevant date.</p>

Sections 227 and 228 apply to each of E1 and E2 since each is included in “the employer” in those sections; schedules of contributions will be prepared accordingly.  Suppose then that E1 ceases to employ any active members.  Paragraph 3 then bites because the scheme has no active members.

Neither of those provisions, however, appears to modify the concept of “employer” (including, on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Cemex</span>, employers of persons eligible to be members) as that word is used within each paragraph, instead only identifying which employers within that concept are to be treated as employers in certain circumstances.  As Mr Nugee puts it, to modify Part 3 in particular circumstances is a different exercise from preventing Part 3 from applying to certain types of employer at all, especially where Parliament has specifically provided that the meaning of employer can be extended but not restricted.  </p>

In particular, I am troubled by Morgan J’s conclusion that paragraph 3 provided a “clear statement” that when an employer ceases to employ active members he ceases to be an employer (see paragraph [72]), the reason for that conclusion, in turn, appearing to be based on the proposition that the draftsman of the Scheme Funding Regulations “plainly thought that one ceased to be an employer when one ceased to have active members” (see paragraph [71]).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">First, a comparison with the 2005 Employer Debt Regulations (which had been in force since 6 April 2005) is instructive.  I have set out Regulation 9(1) of those Regulations as they stood on 30 December 2005 when the Scheme Funding Regulations come into force at paragraph 463 above.  The similarity is, as Mr Nugee argues, striking but whereas the draftsman of the Employer Debt Regulations has reproduced the phrase “every person who employed persons in the description or category of employment to which the scheme relates” in full, the draftsman of the Scheme Funding Regulations has shortened this by referring to “the person who was the employer”.  However, on one view, this has, by virtue of section 124(1) PA 1995, precisely the same meaning.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As to that argument, the similarity of wording is something which I can take into account.  But it is only an aid to construction and I must be careful, as I have said in the context of construing other provisions, not to read too much into the use of similar language.  Reference to the Employer Debt Regulations is, however, helpful to show that it was at least possible that the draftsman intended “the employer” to have its normal meaning; indeed, if one were to read the key phrase into paragraph 3, it would be difficult to say, I consider, that “the employer” did not have the meaning given to it by section 124 in that paragraph.  And yet it could not possibly be suggested, in my view, that paragraph 3 would not then make perfectly good sense.  Quite the reverse would be the case, in my view.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Secondly, the explanation for the wording may be (as Morgan J thought) that the draftsman equated ceasing to be an employer employing persons in the description of employment with ceasing to employ actives.  Even if the draftsman had considered that the wider, actual, meaning of “employer” was correct, he might well have made the provision which he did.  Clearly the occasion on which a scheme ceases to have any active members is an important occasion.  Typically, it may occur when the employer (in a single employer scheme) or all of the employers (in a multi-employer scheme) cease to participate in the scheme.  That would be the occasion on which the scheme ceased to have any active members.  The draftsman could reasonably focus on that as the paradigm case which he needed to cover, drafting the provision accordingly.  Further, he (or rather the Secretary of State)  might reasonably consider that all employers at the time when the scheme ceases to have active members should remain exposed to ongoing contribution obligations, considering, as a matter of policy, that it would be unsatisfactory to leave the future ongoing funding as the responsibility of an employer who happens to employ an eligible member.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Thirdly, even if Morgan J is right and the draftsman did think that ceasing to employ actives was synonymous with ceasing to be an employer, this cannot be determinative: in that case he was wrong in his understanding of what section 124 PA 1995 meant by “employer” and his error cannot require a different meaning to be given to the word in the Regulations alone (where to do so would mean they did not fit with the statutory provisions); nor can it require the meaning of the word in the Act itself to be changed where on this view the draftsman had no intention of doing so.</p>

Accordingly, it ceases to be an employer in the same circumstances as it ceases to be an employer for the purposes of Section 75 PA 1995 and the Employer Debt Regulations.

Rule 14(1) does not, in any case, contain a definition of “E” Member; when the actual definition in the Schedule comes to be applied (“the respective meanings given in [the Rules]”, it is necessary to refer back to Rule 11 to understand what “E” Member means. </p>

Where a former Pilot has retired and ceased to be a Pilot, contributions are not due under Rules 14(1) and (2); this is not because he is no longer an “E” Member (since in my view he is); rather it is because he is not a Pilot.  Likewise, if an active “E” Member elects to cease to pay contributions under Rule 11(5), he is no longer liable to pay contributions (because Rule 11(5) says as much) and, for the purposes of the Rules (and thus certainly for Rule 14(1))  he is treated as if he had ceased to be a Pilot.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Spink suggests that Rule 14(4) appears to have been inserted to make express provision for the payment of exit debts because of the debate within the pensions industry about whether an ECE occurred under Section 75 when an employer ceased to employ active members, resting that suggestion on the evidence of Mr Williamson.  He argues that the second condition within Rule 14(4) was included to clarify matters by providing expressly that an exit debt could be claimed when an ECHA ceased to employ active “E” Members.  I do not consider that the evidence, even if admissible, is enough to establish that intention.  In any case, the language is, I think, such as to lead inevitably to the different conclusion that ceasing to employ active “E” Members is not enough provided that the ECHA continues to employ a deferred or pensioner “E” Member.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">No doubt Mr Spink is correct when he says that ceasing to employ “E” Members was added as a second condition in order to achieve something additional to ceasing to “employ Pilots” (which is the first condition).  He says that if the employment of a deferred or pensioner Member prevented the second condition being fulfilled, it would seem to do little different from the first condition, unless the only purpose of the second condition was to permit Rule 14(4) to be engaged where the Participating Body continued to employ only “S” Members as Pilots.  While accepting that that is conceivable, it seems, he submits, more likely that the second condition was intended to permit Rule 14(4) to be engaged where a Participating Body ceased to employ <span style="text-decoration:underline">active</span> ““E” Members”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not agree that the second condition is of the limited effect which Mr Spink identifies.  It is not only the employment of Pilots who are already “S” Members which would otherwise prevent the first condition from applying; it would also be prevented from applying if the ECHA employed Pilots who had never been Members of the Scheme at all.  Rule 14(4) would therefore not be engaged so long as an ECHA employs an “E” Member who is a Pilot whether or not he is an active “E” Member.   It must be acknowledged that a literal reading of Rule 14(4) would prevent the second condition from being triggered even if the ECHA employed an “E” Member in some employment other than as a Pilot.  That might be seen to be anomalous.  But the point does not arise on the facts and, if it did, it might be right to address it by reading the second condition as applying where the ECHA ceases to employ “E” Members <span style="text-decoration:underline">as Pilots</span>.  That approach, it seems to me, does less damage to the language of Rule 14(4) and the structure of Rules 11 and 14 read together than to read Rule 14(4) as applying only to active “E” Members.</p>

In the light of my answer to Question 1, the primary argument raised by Mr Newman in support of the answer “No” to Question 9 can be eliminated.  Putting matters very shortly, the primary argument is that any schedule of contributions under the SSF regime must respect the structure of the existing rules and thus reflect the ratio under Rule 14 of employer/member contributions.  However, if the contribution rule is amended to remove that link between employer and member contributions, the basis for the primary argument disappears.  The parties nonetheless want to have an answer to Question 9.  Indeed, if I am wrong in my answer to Question 1, Question 9 raises real issues.  I proceed, therefore, on the basis that the current Rules are the operative rules and cannot be amended to change the structure of the contribution rule.</p>

There is nothing in the IORP Directive which prevents the technical provisions being calculated on a more generous basis than by reference to a “sufficiently prudent actuarial valuation” or which precludes a scheme holding more than “sufficient and appropriate assets” to cover the technical provisions on whatever basis those are established. There is nothing, therefore, which would have prevented the UK, when implementing the IORP Directive, from providing expressly that a scheme contribution rule, which resulted in higher technical provisions or greater asset cover than the  IORP Directive required, could continue to have effect.”</span>

If a person's contractual or other rights are to be overridden or somehow qualified by legislation, that requires the use of clear words which, either expressly or by necessary implication, produce that result.

An examination of section 306<span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:#000000"> </span>itself reinforces that conclusion.

In the case of an active member, the only source of that obligation is to be found in the rules.  However, in the case of an employer, that obligation has, potentially, two sources.  The first, as with active members, is to be found in the rules.  But if the rules do not impose, and cannot be modified to impose, an obligation on the employer to make the contributions (or some part of them) in question, there is a second source of obligation, namely section 228(3).</p>

Under section 226(3) PA 2004, a recovery plan “must be appropriate having regard to the nature and circumstances of the scheme”.   He says, quite correctly, that the shared cost structure of the Scheme is clearly part of its nature; it therefore must be taken into account in deciding whether a proposed recovery plan is appropriate.  He makes the point that there is, as yet, no proposed recovery plan at all; and that, when there is, it must be appropriate in fact, it being insufficient that the trustees considers it to be appropriate.  I do not propose to go into that question at all, remarking only that, an objective test of appropriateness ought to be applied, and that I would find it surprising if the Court were to hold a recovery plan to be inappropriate unless the trustees had reached a view as to appropriateness which no reasonable trustee could have reached.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Newman then says that it must be seriously doubtful whether in practice it could ever be appropriate, without the agreement of the employer, to prepare a recovery plan that does not reflect an underlying shared cost structure, given that such a structure is fundamental to the nature of any such scheme.   Other things being equal, I can see that that may be so.  But in the context of the Scheme, that is a submission divorced from reality.  Even if active members were willing to remain in the Scheme if there were imposed on them the maximum contribution permissible under Rule 14 (100% of Pensionable Earnings) and even if their employers were then to pay 150% of those earnings, the total contributions would be nowhere near solving the funding problems of the Scheme.  As the Actuary’s report explains, doubling Member contributions would barely scratch the surface of the deficit but would probably induce active Members to stop being active Members, because they would not receive ‘value for money’ if thereby making good a deficit which is almost entirely referable to deferred and pensioner members.  The further the number of active Members dwindled, the further any percentage of their aggregate Pensionable earnings would become progressively more and more inadequate to repair the deficit.  It seems highly improbable (to the point of disappearing), therefore, that a recovery plan which respected the shared cost nature of the scheme (in the sense of preserving the ratio of contributions) could be formulated.  I see no reason, at present, why it must be said, <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span>, that a recovery plan which recognises that reality is necessarily not appropriate.</p>

Mr Newman’s argument is that Part 3 and section 306 PA 2004, and the Scheme Funding Regulations, are to be construed in such a way that any recovery plan and schedule of contributions must, absent the agreement of the employer, reflect the shared cost nature of the Scheme. The argument rests on the SSF framework and its interaction with the rules of pension schemes, and not simply on an abstract application of the “appropriateness” constraint in section 226(3). </p>

As a matter of decision, I held that there was no conflict on the facts of that case, and no reason, therefore, to disapply the contribution rule.

A scheme does not exist in a vacuum.  A scheme is an institution (to use the Euro-concept) whose purpose is to provide real benefits to real people in the real world.  It may be possible, in relation to particular a provision of the legislation to assess whether the provision (and not just its effect) conflicts with a provision of the relevant scheme (again, not just its effect) in ignorance of the facts.  Consider, for instance, section 222 again.  The scheme is subject to the statutory funding objective.  The contribution rule under the scheme may be wholly inadequate, on the facts at a particular time, to provide sufficient contributions to meet that objective.  In those circumstances, can it be said that the provisions of section 222 conflict with the provisions of the scheme?   In my judgement they clearly do conflict; and it is no answer to say to that on different facts the rule would produce sufficient funding to meet the objective so that there would be no conflict.  </p>

And suppose that the scheme’s contribution rule may sometimes be adequate and sometimes be inadequate to ensure that the funding requirement is satisfied.  In my view, it is quite clear that, at a time when the contribution rule is inadequate to meet the funding requirement, the rule setting out the funding requirement conflicts with the contribution rule.  </p>

It might be said – and indeed it may well be correct to say – that when one rule (the contribution rule) obliges the employer to pay one amount £X and another rule (for instance the funding requirement in the last example) requires the funding requirement to be met,  that the imposition of a further obligation on the employer does not conflict with the contribution rule but is simply to be seen as an additional obligation.  By analogy, an express rule in a scheme requiring extra contributions to be paid in certain circumstances (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>to pay for the added cost of early retirement or to make a deficit contribution) would not be seen as conflicting with an ordinary contribution rule.  In contrast, if a contribution rule were drafted with an express cap on the amount recoverable from the employer, it might more easily be said that there is a potential for conflict.</p>

Such a plan “must be appropriate having regard to the nature and circumstances of the scheme”: see section 226(3) PA 2004.  And “In preparing or revising a recovery plan, the trustees … must take account of [the listed matters]”: see Regulation 8(2) of the Scheme Funding Regulations.  There can be no doubt that, in preparing a recovery plan, the trustees must take account of the factual circumstances of the scheme.  Indeed, if one were to have no regard to the factual circumstances of the scheme, the very object of the legislation, satisfaction of the statutory funding objective, would be defeated.  This is, I think, a pointer to the conclusion that section 306 is not restricted in the technical way for which Mr Newman contends.</p>

Under the legislation, the scheme must satisfy the statutory funding objective; but under the rules, that can be achieved only if the employer agrees to make the necessary contributions (which on the facts it is not willing to do).  I suppose that one could say that, even on the face of the provisions of the legislation and of the scheme rules, there is a conflict because there is always a potential for conflict (in that the employer might always refuse to agree a sufficient level of funding to meet the statutory funding objective).  But taking a less absolute view, there is, on the facts and in accordance with the analysis which I have just performed, a conflict as soon as the employer refuses to agree a suitable schedule of contributions.  </p>

Neither Part 3 PA 2004 nor the Scheme Funding Regulations prescribe precisely how this is to be achieved other than to require the preparation of a recovery plan.  However, in a case of conflict, section 306(1)(b) states that the scheme is to have effect with such modifications “as may be required in consequence” of the statutory provisions overriding the provisions of the scheme.  The word “required” is important: that means that only necessary modifications can take effect.  It would not be open to the trustees, for instance, to treat the scheme as having effect so as to impose a contribution obligation on active members which could not be imposed under the scheme provisions.  Indeed, a modification imposing an additional obligation on the employer under the rules would not be required either: this is because, in contrast with the position of an active member, an employer will be liable to make payment under section 228(3) if the relevant payment is required by the schedule of contributions, which does not require a modification to the scheme at all.  In this situation, I do not see why the trustees should not prepare, or tPR impose, a schedule of contributions specifying a greater contribution payable than could be imposed under the scheme provisions.  </p>

The alternative would then be that no recovery plan could be implemented with the possible (indeed probable) result that the scheme would be forced into winding-up with funding being dealt with under the Section 75 regime.  That would be an astonishing result.  It would mean that there was no mechanism for ensuring satisfaction of the statutory funding basis of an on-going scheme except in cases where the contribution rule already produces that result.  Whenever the contribution rule is inadequate – in particular where the employer’s consent to the requisite level of funding is needed but is refused – it would be impermissible for tPR to impose a schedule of contributions to achieve the statutory objective.  </p>

The trustees prepare a recovery plan which shows that the deficit will be eliminated by payment of the contributions within item (b).  A schedule of contributions is set accordingly for 2 years.  Regulation 10(4) requires the additional contributions to be shown separately from the rate of contributions otherwise payable, that is to say the contributions payable under item (a).  It is the contributions within item (b) which are the “additional contributions required to give effect to a recovery plan” (for the purpose of both Regulations).

Accordingly, the statute, by section 60, may result in the employer having to make a payment to the scheme.  There is nothing in section 60 which provides for the cost of that payment to be borne by any other person (although the amount of the payment will take account of contributions, including member contributions, to the scheme which fall within the closing words of section 60(2)).  </p>

If Regulation 24 was not used and a situation of serious underprovision occurred, it was the employer that was to be on the hook for the payments under section 60.  A number of difficulties of construction arise in relation to the precise meaning and effect of Regulation 24 which I do not need to go into.  The important point, for present purposes, is that, in a shared cost scheme, contributions are ordinarily made in the appropriate proportions; Regulation 24 provides, or at least appears to provide, that the burden of the debt which section 60 throws onto the employer can be re-allocated between the employer and the members in the appropriate proportions.  </p>

He may be right in identifying that as one of the purposes, although given the condition set out in Regulation 16(2)(c) for a scheme to be a shared cost scheme, the section would be of limited application.  This is because section 228(3) only bites where the payment due from the employer under the schedule of contributions is not already due as a contribution under the rules.   But if the trustees wish to reallocate the section 228(3) debt from the employer to the members, they might well be able do this under the scheme rules given the nature of the condition required by Regulation 16(2)(c).</p>

Regulation 16 is concerned with recovery plans where additional contributions are required.  For reasons already explained, additional contributions may be ones which the rules are adequate to impose or they may be ones which have to be collected through section 228(3).  Mr Newman’s argument does not allow for the ways in which Regulation 16 may operate apart from the purpose he identifies.  In any case, even his own argument could not, I consider, take him further than a rather more limited result.  Even if the schedule of contributions has to respect the shared cost structure in the case of a shared cost scheme in relation to additional contributions, that respect should not take one further than the operation of the shared cost structure in the context of the particular scheme under consideration.  The argument cannot lead to the conclusion that a schedule of contributions must go further than the rules require in reflecting the shared cost structure.  </p>

The Rule does not, in any case, impose an obligation on the Trustee to require payment of that percentage: it simply gives it power to set the contribution that high.  If it chooses to set a lower rate, that is the rate which the Scheme Rules provide for.  Nothing in Regulation 16, in my judgment, leads to the conclusion that the recovery plan or any schedule of contributions must reflect a shared cost preserving the ratio contained in Rule 14.</p>

It remains the responsibility of tPR to ensure that the statutory funding objective is met by the imposition of a schedule of contributions to achieve that result.  Mr Newman says “not so”: according to him, one would expect contributions imposed by tPR under section 231(2)(c) PA 2004 to address a deficit to be treated as contributions required “to give effect to a recovery plan” for the purposes of Regulation 16 so that, once the modification power had been exercised, and unless the employer agreed, it could not be liable for more than the proportion specified in the rules of the scheme.   I disagree.  There is no requirement for tPR to formulate a recovery plan and I see no reason to treat its imposition of a schedule of contributions as a recovery plan the preparation of which is the responsibility of the trustees.  In any case, his argument only begins once it is assumed that the modification power has been exercised, which it might not be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the answer to Issue 34 is that the trustees of a scheme are not restricted to proposing a schedule of contributions which (a) provides for no greater a level of contribution than can be recovered under the provisions of the scheme or (b) maintains, in the case of a shared cost scheme, the “appropriate proportions” as between the employer and the employee in respect of additional contributions required to give effect to a recovery plan; nor does a recovery plan have to reflect or maintain those appropriate proportions.  If the trustees are unable to impose a schedule of contributions (for instance because the consent of the employer is required under section 229 which is not forthcoming) it follows that the trustees cannot prepare a schedule of contributions.  In that case, tPR can impose a schedule of contributions.  Regulation 16 does not restrict the trustees or tPR from proposing, preparing or imposing (as the case may be) a schedule of contributions which does not maintain the appropriate proportion as between employer and member contributions.

These factors lead me to think that the Scheme is not a shared cost scheme.  Further, contributions are not made in respect of S Members by any “employer”.  Clearly the Scheme as a whole is not, therefore, a shared cost scheme.  It is very doubtful, I consider, that the Scheme can be severed, as it were, so as to treat each employer separately.  </p>

Paragraph 9(1) by itself could be interpreted either way. Unfortunately, it cannot be given a construction half way between the extremes. I have in mind a construction which would dispose of the need for employer consent to the extent that a recovery plan or a schedule of contributions can be implemented within the limit of the trustees’ powers to set contributions; but which would at the same time, maintain the need for consent if the recovery plan or the schedule of contributions steps outside those limits.</p>

Rules in this form are potentially favourable to the members of the scheme because funding rates can be set without regard to a veto from the employer.  When it came to making the 2005 Regulations, Parliament evidently felt that it was unacceptable that the statutory regime, as set out in the 2004 Act, should give the employer a greater say in the terms on which the scheme should be funded than the employer would have had under the scheme rules unmodified by statute.  Hence paragraph 9 of schedule 2 to the 2005 Regulations, headed ‘Schemes under which the rates of contributions are determined by the trustees or managers or by the actuary’.”</p>

In that context, it is necessary to consider what is meant when the provision refers to a power to determine the rate of contributions being “subject to conditions”.   Mr Spink says that a “condition” in this context is a condition precedent and is not referring to a limitation or constraint within the contribution rule restricting the amount of contribution which can be demanded or a requirement such as that imposed by the shared cost structure of Rule 14.  In contrast, Mr Newman says that a perfectly permissible interpretation of “condition” includes just such a limitation or constraint and that to adopt such an interpretation would give a practical effect to the provisions which would more accurately reflect the policy considerations which I have discussed than a meaning which restricts “condition” to condition precedent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of the two interpretations, I agree with Mr Newman that one which reads “condition” as  including “limitation” or “restraint” would produce a more rational and coherent result.  Under that interpretation, the trustees would be entitled to prepare a recovery plan and set a schedule of contributions without the employer’s consent in cases where the plan and the schedule reflect what they could do, without employer agreement, under the scheme provisions.  At the same time, it would not allow them to proceed without agreement where what they wish to do goes beyond their powers and where it might be expected − I would certainly expect it − that the employer’s agreement would be required.  The employer needs some protection against decisions of trustees to impose perhaps large additional obligations on it; that protection is found in its right to refuse to agree leaving it to an independent third party, tPR, to impose a fair and objective schedule of contributions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, the answer to Issue 35 is that the Trustee may prepare a recovery plan and set a schedule of contributions without the need for the consent of the employers but only where the plan or the schedule do not result in or provide for contributions in excess of those which the Trustee is able to set conformably with Rule 14.  The “condition” in the case of Rule 14 reflects both elements of the limitation on the Trustee’s powers, that is to say the shared cost structure (the employer/active member ratio) and the absolute limit (150% Pensionable Earnings).   If the Trustee wishes to set a contribution rate payable by the employer in excess of 150% Pensionable Earnings, it requires the employer’s agreement under section 229.  If the Trustee restricts itself to setting a contribution rate within that limit, it must, at the same time, ensure that the schedule of contributions reflects the ratio of contributions set out in Rule 14.  If it wishes to depart from that ratio, it must obtain the employer’s agreement, failing which, it will be for tPR to decide whether to impose such a schedule of contributions.</p>

I have discussed earlier in this judgment at some length the relationship between the SSF regime and the provisions of a scheme, reflecting what I said (in some respects <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>) in <span style="font-style:italic">British Vita</span>.  I have concluded that the only argument for saying that the scheme contribution provisions might be wholly displaced by a schedule of contributions is because that gives rise to a material inconsistency between what the schedule of contributions provides and what the rules provide.  However, the schedule of contributions is concerned only with contributions from employers and active members.  It has nothing to say about contributions from persons other than employers and active members.  In particular, if the Trustee were (following my answer to Question 1) to impose a contribution obligation on SCHAs, there is nothing in a schedule of contributions, relating only to employers and active members, which would be inconsistent with such an obligation continuing.  Nor is there anything, in my judgment, in an argument based on Regulation 10(4) Scheme Funding Regulations.  It is quite obvious, in my view, that that provision is dealing with contributions which fall within Regulation 10(1) that is to say contributions from employers and active members (as required by section 227 itself).  </p>

In practice, it must be unlikely that the Trustee will wish to seek contributions which go beyond those necessary to meet the statutory funding objective.  The schedule of contributions (whether agreed by the employer or set by tPR) itself will have to provide for contributions which do meet that objective.  The questions which I raised in paragraph 116 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">British Vita </span>are unlikely to arise.  If the schedule of contributions proved to be inadequate and its revision were necessary, the Trustee will attempt to obtain agreement to a revised schedule and, failing such an agreement, tPR can impose a revised schedule to ensure compliance with the statutory funding objective.  Although section 231(2) does not expressly confer power on tPR to revise a schedule which he has imposed, there must, in my view, be such a power.</p>

It will surely be the case that if such a power is introduced it will be one which is exercisable without the agreement of the employers.  Accordingly, the Trustee will be able to prepare a schedule of contributions without the agreement of the employers since paragraph 9 of Schedule 2 to the Scheme Funding Regulations will apply.  This will not be so if tPR has already imposed a schedule (see section 227(10)) but this is unlikely, I anticipate, to happen in the light of my answer to Question 1.</p>

I have no difficulty accepting that proposition.  But I wonder if Mr Ham goes rather too far in saying that “arguably the greatest problem facing occupational pension schemes in recent years has been the withdrawal of support by employers in the face of volatile funding obligations over which they have no control”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, as a separate, albeit related point, he says that it was also part of the purpose of the SSF to simplify.  I am not sure that that is correct, this aspect of purpose was not so much to simplify but to replace the “one size fits all” approach of the MFR regime with a regime that is scheme specific.  I would, in any case, question whether on any view the SSF regime could be said to be simpler than the MFR regime either in its design or operation.  </p>

There can be no sensible reason, in his submission, for that, bearing in mind the statutory funding objective – a sufficiency of appropriate assets to meet the liabilities.  There can be no justification for allowing a non-statutory regime parallel to the statutory one, the effect of which could only be to circumvent the carefully worked out procedure of the SSF regime or to permit the imposition of funding obligations intended to provide more than sufficient assets.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the statutory provision which imposes a payment obligation on an employer is section 228(3).  It is only if the unpaid amount is not already a debt that it is treated as a debt.  Where the payment liability is already a debt, it does not fall within section 228(3).  Typically this will be so where the payment obligation arises under the contribution rule; but it could also be the case if the employer has given a one-off covenant outside the rules to meet a specific funding deficit.  It would not be right, therefore, to suggest that the statutory funding regime replaces the scheme provisions; rather, the scheme provisions are typically to be reflected in the schedule of contributions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, as the answers to Issues 36 and 37 show, there can be contribution obligations which are not affected by the SSF regime.  It might be thought curious that the Trustee in the present case (following amendment of the Scheme in the light of my answer to Question 1) might wish to impose very similar contribution obligations on both SCHAs and ECHAs only to find itself unable to enforce a contractual right against the ECHAs because the SSF regime displaces the contratural provision, thus casting a greater burden on the SCHAs (which are not affected by that regime).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, even if it is right to take the Regulations into account in working out how the SSF regime impacts on contractual rights under scheme provisions, they will not be determinative of the meaning of the provisions of Part 3 itself.  Paragraph 9 was introduced, it appears, to reflect the policy that the powers of trustees to demand contributions should not be watered down, that their unilateral powers should not be diluted.  I have already discussed this aspect in answering Question 9.  Parliament considered, nonetheless, that there should be an obligation at least to consult, consistent no doubt with the consensual approach which Mr Ham says it was the policy of the legislation to encourage.  But Parliament might have decided that the unilateral power to fix contributions should be capable of exercise even without consultation.  Further, Parliament might have made Regulations which provided that the schedule need only show the contributions required to meet the statutory funding objective rather than providing, as they do, that all contributions should be shown.  I say “all” but even that is not quite correct because voluntary contributions do not have to be included.  It could not be maintained, I think, that such provisions would have been outside the enabling powers.  Accordingly, it is, I think, the effect of the Scheme Funding Regulations which is critical; and in that context it is to be remembered that the inconsistency with which section 306 is concerned is between the rules on the one hand and Part 3 <span style="text-decoration:underline">and any subordinate legislation</span> (see section 306(2)(h)) on the other.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The focus, it seems to me, of the SSF regime is on ensuring that the statutory funding objective is satisfied.  It is not part of those provisions (or indeed of the IORP Directive) to prevent a scheme being better funded than that.  I can detect no policy, either at an EU level or at a domestic level, to prevent trustees from enforcing payment obligations in excess of those required to meet the statutory funding objective.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ham, of course, points out that that is precisely what paragraph 9 allows the trustees to achieve but it does so through the schedule of contributions.  In my view that is not an answer.  The starting point must be, as I said in <span style="font-style:italic">British Vita</span>, the scheme rules and if they are to be overridden – by which I meant disapplied − there must be clear language having that effect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I acknowledge, as I must, that the position under paragraph 9 might then seem rather odd.  The trustees would be obliged to consult the employer about the contents of a schedule of contributions, but would be entitled to make recovery under the scheme rule notwithstanding that the rule provided for a different level of benefit from the schedule.  But a moment’s (or a few moments’ perhaps) reflection show that that is not as odd as it might seem.   The trustees may have the power to impose a particular level of contribution.  If they exercise that power before the schedule of contributions is revised, they must bring the schedule into line with the contractual obligation under section 227 and regulation 10(1).  Since the schedule can only be revised after consultation with the employer, the employer will in practice have the opportunity to make its view known – if the trustees are persuaded that the contribution which they have set is too large, they should then revise it (assuming they have power to do so).</p>

In other words, the schedule is not the source of the payment, the rule is the source.  The legislation requires the amount derived from that source to be shown in the schedule but the fact that it may not be (<span style="font-style:italic">eg </span>pending a revision of the schedule under section 227(1)) does not disapply or even suspend the operation of the scheme rule.</p>

Thus, consider a scheme within paragraph (1) where the trustees have set a contribution rate under the rules which has been adopted in a schedule of contributions.  Suppose that circumstances change and a further contribution is required to meet the statutory funding objective and suppose that such further contribution can be imposed under the rules without the employer’s consent.  I can see very little merit in an argument which restricts the amount recoverable to that shown in the original schedule of contributions.  Rather, the additional contribution is a liability of the employer but section 227 and Regulation 10(1) require the schedule to be revised to show the additional amount payable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first uncertainty relates to Regulation 10(1).  For reasons given in [118] of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">British Vita</span>, I consider it to be unclear whether Regulation 10 applies in the case of a schedule of contributions imposed by tPR.  Mr Ham suggests that the drafter has not realised that what he has provided does not fit where tPR imposes a schedule of contributions, and that the correct approach − rather than, in effect, ignoring the Regulation − must be to treat the imposition of the schedule as the equivalent of certification in that case.  It would therefore be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to permit the trustees to demand contributions in excess of those set out in the schedule – at any rate until it has been revised.  In making that last qualification, Mr Ham appears to accept that a schedule imposed by tPR can be revised by it, a proposition which I think must be correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Now, Mr Ham may be right.  But he is not clearly right and, indeed, I incline to the view that he is wrong.  If he is wrong, then the schedule of contributions which tPR imposes may well not have to show <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> contributions due from the employer, but only those necessary to ensure that the statutory funding objective is met: after all, it is with that objective that tPR is centrally concerned and,  tPR may be completely uninterested in examining and giving effect to scheme rules.  If this is the true interpretation of Regulation 10(1) and the correct approach to the contents of an imposed schedule of contributions, there is nothing to lead to the conclusion that the schedule is in any way inconsistent with the continuing existence of an obligation under the rules to pay an amount larger than that shown in the schedule.</p>

The question is what this means.  Does it mean that tPR must ascertain what contributions are payable under the rules and provide, in the schedule of contributions, that such contributions are payable?  Or does it mean that tPR decides what contributions should be payable and include only those in the schedule of contributions, in which case it can be argued that since (a) tPR decides what is to go into the schedule and (b) the schedule shows <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> amounts payable, therefore nothing more can be required from the employer?</p>

That could happen in the present case although it is unlikely given my answer to Question 1.  The rules are then amended to give the trustees power to impose different, and larger, contributions.  The question then arises whether tPR can, or must, revise the schedule of contributions to reflect any increase which the trustees seek to impose under the amended rule.  The question is similar to that raised by the first example.  It is not clear whether (i) the contributions are payable so that the schedule must be amended to comply with Regulation 10 or (ii) it is the schedule which defines what is due so that it is only if tPR chooses to revise the schedule that different contributions will be recoverable.</p>
