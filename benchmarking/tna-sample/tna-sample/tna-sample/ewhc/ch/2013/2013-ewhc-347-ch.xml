Longmint also leased the ‘hectare’ of development land in the middle of the Fairoaks Airport from AFL for £60,000 per annum <span style="font-style:italic">for 100 years </span>because, as Mrs Bellis put it, Longmint wanted a “<span style="font-style:italic">piece of the action</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mrs Bellis saw nothing untoward in all this. It was pressed on me after circulating an earlier draft of this judgment that she had no reason to do so, on the footing that each of the companies concerned was well aware of her various roles.  In the case of Erinaceous and Longmint, I am sure that is so; but I do not accept that AFL and the Investors were aware, still less gave their informed consent.  In any case, the point is not really whether or not Mrs Bellis’s multiple roles conflicted; it is the fact that she had them and the extent of her and her immediate family’s interests.  I have concluded that Mrs Bellis felt able to act in these multiple capacities as well as the SPV (AFL) and representing apparently conflicting interests because she considered Erinaceous and its subsidiaries and associated companies in effect to be one entity, and to a large extent, at least until November 2007 when her husband and her sister were removed, a family affair.</p>

As Counsel for the Defendant Firm put it in their closing submissions, words and acts are ordinarily to be interpreted objectively, and (in particular) words are taken as they would reasonably be understood by the person to whom they were spoken or written, not as they were subjectively understood by the person who spoke or wrote them. </p>

As indicated above, there is no positive evidence that Mrs Bellis saw the email teaser or knew that Mr Egan had sent it to the Claimants; and she firmly denied both.  The Defendant Firm submits that it follows that “these documents cannot be considered in determining whether there was an implied contract”. The Claimants contend that this is not so: both documents were plainly “reasonably available”, in that a reasonable observer would have expected Mrs Bellis as well as the Claimants to have had the documents, not least because under the terms of her engagement by AFL she had expressed the need to see “a copy of any documentation which goes out to investors”.</p>

Given the close involvement of, in particular, Ms Cummings, this is surprising: she and possibly the others might well have been relevantly examined on a number of potentially relevant issues.

Although it is right to record that Mrs Bellis was adamant that the findings made by Gloster J and Sales J respectively were wrong, and I should make clear that the findings as such have not materially coloured my view, they may explain a certain reluctance to participate in further proceedings.   </p>

He was prepared to “follow orders”: hence he did not warn the investors of the frailties in the Albermarle Fairoaks scheme caused by Erinaceous seeking to get too much profit and cash out of it. He was disingenuous in affecting surprise that the monies paid into the client account had been paid out.  However, I am in no real doubt that he always expected that investors would indeed get the combined loan and equity participation and control of AFL that they expected. In that regard, he assumed that Mr Cummings was a placeman for Erinaceous and that Erinaceous would in turn ensure equity participation and control for investors.</p>

The indications are that she and her husband were prepared to sign whatever Mr Egan put in front of them as necessary in the context of an Albermarle investment scheme they had in principle decided to invest in. But the document was headed a draft; it was not intended to be any more than that by the offeror; and as such its signature does not in my judgment bind either of the Challinors. I accept Mrs Challinor’s evidence that she only glanced at the draft and had no perception that it would substantially alter what she understood to be the fundamental character of her intended investment.

In the absence of evidence from Tenon and Maple, I have considered whether the fact of that approval must be taken to connote their acceptance of those terms; but I have concluded that it is so unlikely that either would have agreed to lend money on such terms without equity participation that the true explanation is that those Claimants, like all the Claimants who gave evidence, must have regarded the drafts as being in effect no more than a temporary receipt which did not affect the fundamental nature of their intended investment in a loan and equity mix in accordance with the Albemarle pattern.</p>

As far as we were concerned, the year --I would have looked at the year or I was aware of the year because there was an email between Mrs Bellis and myself -- the year was a long stop date.  It wasn't a year's loan.  It was a year's long stop date on the basis that this would have taken weeks or at most more than a few weeks to actually complete the investment       memorandum, which would have its own units, which would have its own additional loan notes which would replace these loan notes.

Mr Egan struck me as somewhat swashbuckling in his attitude to detail.  He looked to what he assumed would ultimately be the realities, rather than what he regarded as legal formalities.  From his point of view, the Albermarle investment scheme pattern was clear; it needed tweaking, but not substantively altering, to take into account the SDLT considerations, the consequent adoption of a ‘foreign’ SPV and fund structure, and the advice of PwC; appropriate documentation would follow in due course: all would turn out well in the end.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there was no evidence that any of the investors ever saw the Shoreham engagement letter or ever understood or agreed that the money they invested would be by way of unsecured loan which could and would be used to repay indebtedness before the structure and terms of equity participation had been agreed and full subscription achieved. Mr Wallis’s depiction of shock when he was much later shown the Shoreham engagement letter carried the ring of truth. Investors were (by e-mail to them all dated 20 March 2007) kept informed in this regard, and it appears that no monies were released prior to the full indeed over-subscription, and a renewed commitment to send out both loan notes and share certificates in respect of the coupled or matched lao/equity investment. Secondly, unlike the case in the Albermarle Fairoaks transaction, by the time of the payments the investment vehicle (an LLP) had in fact already been established. Thirdly, that investment vehicle was already controlled by Messrs Egan and Lawson for and on behalf of the prospective investors. Fourthly, so far as investors were concerned, all that remained to be done was the paperwork necessary to record their investment, which was presented as no more than a ministerial process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, therefore, the pattern apparent from the Albermarle Shoreham scheme was that even if the paperwork was “flimsy” and notwithstanding raising cash in two tranches, investors monies would not be deployed unless and until (a) a viable structure and defined terms had been established for their ultimate equity investment (b) in a suitable investment vehicle (c) the control of which on their behalf was unconditionally secure, and (d) full subscription to ensure the transaction could be completed had been achieved.</p>

	      <span style="font-size:9pt">A.  Yes, that's correct.  That was the understanding throughout: that this was an interim measure, particularly during the early fund-raising; that the loans would be made to Albermarle Fairoaks Limited; that the investors would, in acknowledgement of those loans, be issued with the loan note; and that once the unit trust or the infrastructure fund was set up, then they would receive units in those, in whatever fund was set up, and the later round of investors would go straight into the unit trust or the infrastructure fund.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:9pt">A.  My understanding was that these moneys were coming into Albermarle Fairoaks Limited as a straightforward loan. The loan notes in my mind were, therefore, there effectively to confirm receipt of those loans.  I was fully aware that there would be, at a later date, a unit trust or infrastructure fund set up and these loan notes or these moneys would be effectively credited to the  unit trust. As I said yesterday, my original idea was to draft these loan notes so that they had an element of convertibility and Mr Sutcliffe pressed me as to why that was changed. I can only say that I had had advice from PriceWaterhouse Cooper, and I regret that I cannot find a note of that, but my clear recollection is that I was advised that for fiscal reasons there should not be an element of conversion in the notes.</span>

It simply makes no commercial sense at all to be locked into a five-year unsecured, subordinated loan that could not be repaid before RBS was repaid in full, and with an interest rate of 1% over base rate.  </p>

The Albermarle Shoreham scheme had encouraged her to assume that what she later described as “flimsy paperwork” was the norm, but that all would be well in the end; and the growing imperative to get the money in discouraged any doubting reflection.</p>

Yes, because my understanding was that Mr Egan would have communicated with them that this was an interim measure and that in due course -- I think everybody, we are all in agreement on this -- in due course they would receive equity in the fund or trust that was set up; and that it was always agreed and intended that Albermarle Fairoaks Limited would then be subsumed within that trust.  So that, therefore, at that stage, there would have been a reorganisation and their loans would have been converted into, I imagine, a small amount of equity in the unit trust, with the remainder being outstanding, as was the case in Shoreham, as loans. If you are asking me would I personally have invested at the time, I would not, but I would not have invested in Shoreham between Christmas and New Year.  I would not have invested in the way in which, it seems to me, from this case and from disclosure, in which many of these people sent their money in on the basis of very flimsy paperwork.  That's my personal opinion.</span>

Really because on all the transactions which I've been involved in with Geoff previously, we would use a common set of solicitors, which was normally Helen Streeton at Fox Williams, and when I was involved with Legal and General we always had a common firm of solicitors involved who acted for top company and the investors.  So that was consistent all the way through and, indeed, for Shoreham when you look at the investment memorandum which raised the conversation which I had with Geoff, indeed Juliet Bellis and Co were the solicitors for the offer or memorandum, as I understood it.  It's for the top company and the investors which go together.  So it was indeed my understanding that by transferring my monies to Juliet Bellis' client account that, likewise, the intention was that Juliet Bellis would be acting for the investors and, indeed, when I spoke to Geoff about this we had that conversation because he described how the Erinaceous Group worked and the family and that she was an independent solicitor as well as being company secretary to Erinaceous but that she would be looking after our interests.</span>

To my mind it explains, or at the least helps to explain, what I have earlier described as Mrs Bellis’s abdication of her responsibilities. <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">These, in my judgment, plainly and obviously extended to (a) establishing precisely the intended relationship between each investor and the SPV, and what documentation and information had been given to investors in that regard (as indeed Mrs Bellis had stipulated in the Engagement Letter that she needed to see but never followed up);  (b) satisfying herself, if her firm could not advise, that appropriate advice from Ozannes and Legis was in place that the intended relationship could and would be established as a matter of legal mechanics, and that any regulatory requirements had been complied with (as again she had stipulated in the Engagement Letter, but again never followed up); (c) ensuring that the terms of that relationship had, at the least, finally been agreed and approved by Ozannes before AFL or the investors were irrevocably committed and any monies invested were released from her firm’s client account; (d) completing any KYC requirements. She did none of this; urged on by Mr Egan and the crumbling position of her family’s company, Mrs Bellis trusted that, as in Shoreham, everything would be all right in the end.  It was not.</span></p>

She may also have been comforted by her assumption that, in practical terms even if not legal formality, Mr Egan could be taken to speak for “his” band of investors (as indeed she asserted in her witness evidence she believed he had).  But that, in my judgment, does not alter the fact that what she was doing was taking a risk with other people’s money; and that blind faith could not excuse or justify such an abdication of responsibility and breach of basic principles, as well as of the SAR.</p>

A point in the case being whether the terms alleged are sufficiently clear to satisfy the requirement of certainty, I considered that I would unfairly and unnecessarily foreclose the matter if, during the sound and fury of the hearing, I were to refuse to permit the Claimants to put forward what they considered to be their best case. </p>

As already noted previously, she knew that loan notes had not been finalised or authorised, and that she could have no certainty as to the terms on which the investors had agreed to remit funds into her firm’s client account.

She went along with Mr Egan’s approach of “transaction first, legal niceties later.”  She knew that the approach had worked in the Albermarle Shoreham transaction; she presumably persuaded herself that it would work again; and payment in reduction of the RBS Equity Bridge (which Erinaceous had guaranteed) was in line with the commercial interests of Erinaceous and the group. She comforted herself that as a commercial matter, Mr Egan could be regarded as “Mr Albermarle” and a conduit to “his investors.” But in doing so, she must have known that she was allowing commercial exigencies and assumptions to displace legal uncertainties.</p>

That was what she was accustomed and paid to do. Her family controlled Erinaceous and the Erinaceous Group: in default of any evidence to the contrary from Ms Cummings and Mr Bellis, I have no reason or evidence to doubt that the company and the group, including ECS, were (in the words of Mr Egan) <span style="font-style:italic">“run almost like a family company with one family in absolute control…”</span></p>

She later sought to re-write this: for example, in her 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and main trial witness statement, she tried to explain away the reference and stated categorically that <span style="font-style:italic">“at no time did Lucy give me instructions to remit funds to RBS; all instructions came from Mr Egan.” </span>I prefer her contemporaneous, less careful, account.</p>

If Mrs Bellis at least by then had any uncertainty, as I consider she must have had, it was certainly not in the interests of Erinaceous, Longmint, or her family interests to raise them: the commercial imperative was to get in the investors’ money, keep the deal afloat, and keep the bank at bay.</p>

I also take into account that he had good reason to get money in whereby to discharge instalments due to RBS: the relationship with RBS was important, and he wanted “brownie points” to enhance the prospect of loans to meet later funding needs.

	      <span style="font-size:9pt">“MRS BELLIS: I am very sure in my own mind that this conversation did not take place, I do not recall it, but I fully accept that memories are not always 100 per cent accurate. However, I believe that if this conversation had taken place I would have recalled it because, although I am not 100 per cent certain of what Mr Wallis is saying that he told me, the substance of it seems to me that he was asking me effectively to give him an undertaking to hold the money to his order.  He's used variously the term "escrow", I think in his third witness statement he says that on reflection he may have used the word "escrow". But leaving aside whatever technical terms he may have used, the substance I think of what he is saying -- and I am sure your Lordship will correct me if I am wrong -- is that he was asking me for an  undertaking that I would not release his money without his express authority.  Now, it is drummed into solicitors from a very early age that all undertakings must be considered carefully and recorded on the file. There is no note on the file.  If I had given an undertaking, there would have been a note on the file.</span>

I appreciate that, although I do try to take file notes of conversations, invariably some do not get noted up. That is, I am afraid, the reality of it.

The third point is this.  If that conversation had taken place, it would have run counter to everything which had been discussed beforehand, which is fully reflected in the contemporaneous documents, that I had understood and still do understand: that the money which was going to come into my client account would be used to repay the RBS loan (in other words, it would be my client's money, Albermarle Fairoaks Limited's money). If this conversation had taken place, I would have immediately contacted Mr Egan, Michael Pearson, Ms Cummings, whoever was available, Mr Egan I would guess, to say, "Look, I have had this conversation.  What is going on?  I have obviously had to confirm to Mr Wallis that I will not release his moneys, but this directly runs counter to what I have understood throughout this transaction."    </span>

As I noted in my judgment at an earlier stage in these proceedings (in the context of an application by the Defendant Firm for their summary disposition), [2011] EWHC 3249 (Ch), the doctrine of escrow is strictly applicable only to deeds.  It is (to quote Lord Denning MR in <span style="font-style:italic">Alan Estates Ltd v W.G.

It was submitted on the Defendant Firm’s behalf that this was misconceived: first, the history of one previous transaction could not amount to a course of dealing; secondly, and in any event a “course of dealing” in a previous context might be invoked to supplement the terms of a subsequent contract but could not be invoked to establish the preliminary question as to whether a contract was ever intended at all. </p>

The variety of alternative formulations offered further support that conclusion: it is difficult enough to establish an implied contract of sufficient certainty even when the terms avowed are settled.</p>

I accept that this final iteration is neither itself intricate nor vague; and I do not doubt that such a term (simply to hold to the payer’s order) might in other circumstances found a contract. However, in this case, and perhaps ironically in view of my criticism of the earlier iterations, I do not think that the objective intention of the parties would be captured by that simple formulation. In my view, the parties’ objective intention was that the monies should be kept in the client account pending either an instruction or an event: but the event (“safety”) was not sufficiently defined to satisfy the requirements of certainty in the context of a contract. It may be that another way of looking at this, as urged by the Defendant Firm, is that the circumstances are not such that an intention to establish a contract can be inferred: but, as the result is the same, it is not necessary for me to determine which is the most accurate formulation; and, as indicated previously, it seems to me that the dividing line between the question of certainty of term and intention to create contractual relations is often an indefinite one. </p>

Although escrow arrangements of some sort were part of what Mr Egan called the Albermarle “pattern”, there were variations in their form.

I have had well in mind the point made on behalf of both Mr Egan and the Defendant Firm that in the Albermarle Shoreham scheme (on which the Claimants place so much reliance as a template) there were two stages, and at the first stage the first tranche investors (including Mr Wallis) do appear to have made payments to the investment vehicle, the proceeds of which (some £2 million) were applied to reduce that investment vehicle’s indebtedness to (amongst others) Erinaceous before any documentation had been finalised. There were no escrow arrangements at that first stage (though there were at the second stage, as set out in the Information Memorandum eventually issued). </p>

This prevents the borrower from obtaining any beneficial interest in the money, at least while the designated purpose is still capable of being carried out.

Absent any express trust imposed by the client at the time that the moneys are paid to the solicitor, it seems to me that the trust which attaches to clients' moneys (in cases within this second category) is an implied trust imposed in order to give effect to the Accounts Rules made under s 32 of the 1974 Act [</span>

I would add this in deference to their concerns. Of course, in the <span style="font-style:italic">May, May and Merrimans </span>case the various firms of solicitors whose client accounts were being utilised to hold the proceeds of loans made by the plaintiff building society were in each case acting on each side of the lending transaction. However, and as set out in paragraph 516 above, the SAR expressly require all money that does not belong to the solicitor to be held in a separate client account, and not all monies held in a solicitor’s client account are held for a client of that firm. The question is not who the firm’s client is, but on whose behalf or to whose order or instruction the money is being held. It is for the solicitor to establish that with certainty; and his or her duty is not to withdraw that money from the client account unless and until clearly authorised to do so by the person on whose behalf or to whose order or instruction the money is held.  That accords with a basic principle of the law of trust and trustees, that a trustee must ensure that he or she knows who the beneficiaries are and the terms of the trust in question.</p>

Unfortunately for him, the beneficial interests he was creating in the option were not stated with sufficient precision, and the trusts failed.

A third strand is that the Claimants (or at least some of them), having elected to pursue remedies as creditors by seeking an administration order in respect of AFL on that basis, must now be treated to have accepted that the loans are to be treated as valid, their alleged status as creditors being inconsistent with any claim under a trust.</p>

To succeed in an action to recover money on that ground, the plaintiff has to identify a payment by him to the defendant, a specific fact as to which the plaintiff was mistaken in making the payment, and a causal relationship between that mistake of fact and the payment of the money: see Barclays Bank Ltd. v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd.

It is the contention of Dextra that the money was paid under a mistake, in that Dextra had intended to make a loan. The difficulty with this proposition is that this does not appear to have been a mistake as to a specific fact, like for example a mistake as to the identity of the defendant, but rather a misprediction as to the nature of the transaction which would come into existence when the Dextra cheque was delivered to the BOJ, which is a very different matter: see Birks, Introduction to the Law of Restitution, pp. 147–8.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not myself persuaded that the true characterisation in this case of the causative reason for the payment by the Claimants into the Defendant Firm’s client account is a misprediction as to the true effect of that payment, rather than a mistake (the distinction drawn by Professor Birks, and to some extent reflected in <span style="font-style:italic">Dextra</span>, being between a mistake as to the present and a mistake as to the future (which was labelled a misprediction). In <span style="font-style:italic">Dextra</span>, the claimant (Dextra) drew a cheque on its bankers in favour of the defendant (Bank of Jamaica).  It did so on the assumption that a secured loan agreement would be concluded between them: but none ever was. As is apparent from the passage of its advice quoted above, the Privy Council held that the payment was not paid under a mistake of fact as to the present but on the basis of a misprediction as to the future (that a loan agreement would be entered into). In the present case, it is a nice point, as it seems to me, whether the operative mistake was as to the present effect of paying into the Defendant Firm’s client account or as to the future consummation of the transaction they all intended. As it seems to me both were operative; and that in such circumstances a claim for restitution on grounds of mistake should be available (subject of course, to the various defences, if available). But even if that is incorrect, and no claim lies for mistake, that does not address the alternative way the Claimants put their case (total failure of consideration).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also accepted the Claimants’ basic argument that the explicit requirement of all investors to pay into the Defendant Firm’s client account, rather than to AFL (which Mrs Bellis accepted she knew from at least 18 July 2007 had its own bank account at RBS with Guernsey administrators as the only authorised signatories), is realistically only explicable on the basis that such monies were to be segregated from AFL (by not being held in its account) and would not immediately belong to AFL but be held as client monies pending some further event or instruction. The fact that Mrs Bellis, who did her own book-keeping, chose to credit such monies to a client ledger with the rubric “Albemarle Fairoaks Limited – Fairoaks Airport” does not, in my judgment, indicate anything more than that the monies had been sent in relation to that transaction, and in any case cannot upset the objective intention, as I have found it to have been, that the monies should not immediately be available or belong to AFL itself.</p>

However, what is really important in this context is not what the investors’ expectations were as regards formal documentation but what they regarded as the substantive nature of the investment that such documentation was to record.  </p>

I appreciate that most of the monies had by then been paid out to RBS; but at least £230,000 came in after 28 September 2007 which Mrs Bellis cannot reasonably have thought she was entitled to receive for payment to AFL in the knowledge that no settled structure was in place and without establishing the true nature of the payment into her firm’s client account.</p>

But if speculation were appropriate, in my judgment, the likelihood is that if the formalities had properly been observed, the barrier expressly acknowledged by Mr Pearson would have prevented money being paid into the Defendant Firm’s client account being treated as belonging to AFL for so long as the structure and terms of payment in remained uncertain.</p>

I do not accept that the application for an administration order was what caused the loss. What caused the loss was the payment of their monies to RBS without authority and in breach of trust.</p>

But I do not see that later events have reduced, still less eradicated, the loss in this case.

Mr Bacon did see the force of this; and in any event, I consider that Mr Egan knew that it was being said that he was implicated if indeed a contract or trust was established. I consider it is not unfair to allow the allegation to be considered. It is, however, well established that dishonesty must be clearly demonstrated: and any rational explanation which is consistent with honesty will be likely to be sufficient to displace it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, however, important to bear in mind the basis of the principle. This is that the circumstances in which the request is made are such as to give rise to the inference of a promise by the person making the request to indemnify the requested person if actioning the request causes actionable injury or damage to a third party: see <span style="font-style:italic">Yeung Kai Yung </span>at 798G.  Such an inference will most easily be made when the requested party is undertaking a statutory duty or a common law duty of a ministerial character: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield Corp v Barclay </span>at 399 and <span style="font-style:italic">Welch v Bank of England </span>[1955] 1 Ch 508 at 509 and 548-549 (cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Yeung Kai Yung</span>).

The references in the email from Mr Grieve of Burness &amp; Co of 3 September to equity raising must have further added to the uncertainty. I do not accept that Mrs Bellis transferred monies because she felt she could rely on Mr Egan having authority; she was guided by unquestioning assumption, indifference to the risk for investors inherent in that assumption, and the growing imperative of ensuring RBS was paid.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty.  The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary. As Dr Finn pointed out in his classic work <span style="font-style:italic">Fiduciary Obligations </span>(1977), p.2, he is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary.”</p>

He acted for ECS, and accepted the direction of Ms Cummings and Erinaceous, both in identifying the investment opportunity to be made available to investors and in inviting expressions of interest in and participation in it through (as he envisaged) the usual mix of equity and loan. Mr Egan was not personally a party to any transaction with any of the investors: and there was not in law entrusted to him, nor did he have their authority to exercise, any power or discretion which might affect their interests.

Its purpose is to explain that after circulating an earlier version of this Judgment in draft and invited Counsel to identify any patent errors or omissions, or any matters that they considered lacked sufficient and required further explanation, I received a number of helpful suggestions. They were advanced succinctly but politely:  I am grateful to Counsel for them: I have sought to take all of these into account and indeed to address many, though not all, of these suggestions in this final version.</p>

In circumstances such as these, and especially if the solicitor is aware, or at least on notice, that (a) no other legal adviser is advising them as a body and (b) in preceding analogous transaction they have come to rely on the solicitor acting for the SPV to have regard to their interests, that does seem to me at least arguable. However, I am aware that these may be deep waters: and in default of detailed argument, I simply leave the argument open, and I base my judgment on the factors referred to earlier, and not that argument.</p>

However, in their written closing submissions, Counsel for the Defendant Firm contended that the application was made on a basis (that the applicants were creditors of AFL) which was inconsistent with the basis of the Claimants’ claims in these proceedings, and that such costs were unreasonable and should be irrecoverable. I do not think this was expressly addressed before me at the oral hearing: and I shall hear further argument in that regard after delivering this judgment.</p>
