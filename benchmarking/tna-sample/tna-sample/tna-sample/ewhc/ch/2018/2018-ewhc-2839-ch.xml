In particular, the legislation created a State Earnings Related Pension Scheme or “SERPS”. The detailed provisions relating to SERPS, in particular in relation to retirement age, resulted in inequalities in the treatment of men and women. These inequalities were not unlawful under EU law or domestic law nor did they infringe anyone’s human rights.  </p>

In particular, it was possible to make alternative arrangements to SERPS with the result that the liability to pay National Insurance contributions was reduced. It was possible to contract out of SERPS by making alternative arrangements which provided for guaranteed minimum pensions or “GMPs”. GMPs were calculated in broadly the same manner as SERPS benefits but they were not identical to those benefits. The legislative provisions as to GMPs were complicated but they created a number of inherent inequalities between men and women. It was possible to introduce provisions to remove these inequalities but, generally speaking, corrective action of that kind was not taken. </p>

If there is an obligation to equalise benefits by one or other of the methods contended for, there will be a substantial cost involved. The amount of that cost depends upon the method of equalisation which is adopted. In the present case, there are four basic methods which are put forward for consideration. These methods have been referred to as methods A, B, C and D and methods A, C and D have been further sub-divided into alternatives. There is a considerable difference in the costs of giving effect to these methods. Ignoring administration costs, the order of magnitude of the various costs is: method A costs £300 million, method B costs £135 million and method C costs £100 million. Method D involves a two-stage process and the first of those stages adopts one of methods A or B or C. The cost of method D depends on which method is adopted at the first stage. If method D adopts method C at the first stage, the cost involved will be the same as the cost of method C, £100 million. The court’s answers to the questions raised in this case are likely to apply widely in relation to other schemes so that the total costs involved for all such schemes will be many times these figures. </p>

They wish to have definitive rulings which will settle the long running debate on these issues. Certainly, the implications of the decision reach far beyond the immediate parties. The evidence in this case has been very detailed and thorough. The issues have been very extensively argued. In other circumstances, it might have been desirable to give a shorter judgment and to avoid recitation of matters on which there was no dispute between the immediate parties and which were therefore well known to them. However, in view of the wider interest in this judgment on the issues which arise, I have decided to set out the background and the facts and the submissions of the parties in greater detail even though that means the judgment is longer than it otherwise would have been. </p>

Of course, it would not be in the interests of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants themselves so to contend. When I raised this difficulty, it was accepted that the answer which the Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants would contend for would not be of benefit to those Defendants but it was said that in view of the funding levels of the Schemes, such an answer would not do any real harm to those Defendants. It was also said that it is often the case that representation orders are made where the representative defendant puts forward arguments which are not in that defendant’s own interests. As will be seen later in this judgment, it was agreed that I should not deal with Issue 13 at this stage. It was envisaged that the parties would give further thought to the appropriate way to deal with the many detailed points arising in relation to Issue 13. In those circumstances, the representation order which I will make at this stage will not include Issue 13 as one of the Issues which is the subject of that order.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.54in;text-indent:0.50in">The requirement that GMPs are calculated and paid on an unequal basis flows through to result in an inequality of the overall scheme pension in payment.  This is compounded by the requirements for preservation, revaluation and anti-franking legislation in PSA93 that benefits above GMP (“excess benefits”) be determined with reference to this unequal GMP and the fact that revaluation and indexation provided on the excess benefit can and usually differs to that on the GMP element (depending on the legislation and the rules of the scheme). </p>

It is also possible for the position to change over the course of a lifetime so that an individual who is advantaged on the basis of sex when the GMP is first paid becomes disadvantaged later. In other words, which sex is advantaged may fluctuate over the course of a lifetime.” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">As referred to in paragraph 3.13 of the above quotation, one of the key problems facing the Schemes is that the unequal GMPs can cause other non-GMP benefits to be unequal.  GMPs are generally only a part of the total pension payable to a member, so the member’s total pension can be viewed as having a GMP element and an excess above GMP (“the Excess”).  Even if the total pension accrued by a man and a woman is equal, if their GMPs are (as a result of the GMP legislation) unequal, the Excess will be correspondingly unequal.  This difference can result in the pensions payable becoming unequal for equivalent men and women, because (for example) the GMP element and the Excess element are increased at different rates during periods of deferment (i.e. between the member leaving the scheme and retiring) and when in payment.  There are in fact a number of complicated ways in which unequal GMPs can cause overall benefits to be unequal as between men and women. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">GMPs are a product of legislation.  The requirement to provide GMPs, the ages from which GMPs become payable, the revaluation and increases applicable to GMPs, are all determined by the Government and set out in legislation.  Therefore, to equalise GMPs themselves would require an amendment to the existing legislation.  As trustees cannot amend legislation, if trustees of pension schemes determine that GMPs create inequality between male and female members and they have an obligation to remedy that discrimination, they will need to amend other scheme benefits in order to equalise for the effect of unequal GMPs.  As such, reference to the “equalisation of GMPs” is actually a reference to the need to adjust other scheme benefits in order to compensate for the effect of unequal GMPs in order to remedy any inequalities arising out of GMP legislation in respect of contracted-out employment between 17 May 1990 and 5 April 1997.  </p>

Although the precise effect of unequal GMPs on men and women under the Schemes will be a function of the particular rules of the Schemes and characteristics of the membership, the essential questions raised by this claim are likely to be the same for the very many contracted-out defined benefit occupational pension schemes that provide GMPs.  These questions are financially significant ones for the industry and scheme members.  In a letter from the Occupational Pension Schemes Joint Working Group to the then Pensions Minister, Steve Webb MP, dated 12 April 2012, in response to the DWP’s consultation paper, Draft Occupational Pension Schemes and Pension Protection Fund (Equality) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, it was estimated by that working group that: </p>

At retirement age, the relevant earnings for each year are revalued in line with the growth of average earnings. The pension payable is calculated in two stages. The total revalued amount is first divided by the number of years in the individual's working life since 6 April 1978. The result is then multiplied by a percentage which for a person reaching state pension age before 6 April 1999 is 25 per cent, and for a person reaching that age after 5 April 2009 is twenty per cent, with a sliding scale for the intervening years. For those retiring before 1999, SERPS is effectively the equivalent of a scheme accruing at n/80 for the twenty-year period since 1978, (though of revalued average, rather than final earnings). When the transition is complete, the effective accrual rate will drop to as little as n/245 for a man with a 49-year working life.

Differential pensionable ages were first introduced for men and women in the United Kingdom in 1940, well before the Convention had come into existence, although the disparity persists to the present day (see paragraph 32 above). It would appear that the difference in treatment was adopted in order to mitigate financial inequality and hardship arising out of the woman’s traditional unpaid role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. At their origin, therefore, the differential pensionable ages were intended to correct “factual inequalities” between men and women and appear therefore to have been objectively justified under Article 14 (see paragraph 51 above).  </p>

This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the Government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986, it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 33 above).  </p>

It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 52 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 37 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 38 ...).  </p>

Having once begun the move towards equality, moreover, the Court does not consider it unreasonable of the Government to carry out a thorough process of consultation and review, nor can Parliament be condemned for deciding in 1995 to introduce the reform slowly and in stages. Given the extremely far-reaching and serious implications, for women and for the economy in general, these are matters which clearly fall within the State’s margin of appreciation.” </p>

The reduction in the rate of national insurance contributions given to employers and employees who were members of such schemes, known as the contracted-out rebate, was set at a level based on the cost to those schemes of providing GMPs. Schemes which contract out on this basis are known as contracted-out salary related schemes (COSRS). The effect of this was that money purchase schemes could contract out only if the employer was prepared to offer an earnings-related underpin which was at least as good as the GMP.  </p>

They were needed because scheme members in a contracted-out earnings related scheme effectively accrue rights to two benefits: the GMP, and the benefits accrued under the scheme rules, within which the GMP rights are subsumed. These two benefits are treated differently for the purposes of preservation and revaluation of accrued rights. The GMP element must be revalued in one of a number of ways laid down in legislation. The preservation requirements for the overall pension are less advantageous to the member than those for the GMP. Where the overall rights exceed the GMP rights, it would be possible for the increases to the GMP to be absorbed within the overall ceiling on the individual's scheme benefits. In effect, the individual would lose the advantage of the GMP revaluation requirements. Under the anti-franking requirements such practices are forbidden, and the full effect of the GMP revaluation must be given as an addition to the overall scheme benefits.”  </p>

This table (as edited by me for presentation purposes) is attached as Appendix A to this judgment.  The table summarises the earliest date pensions are payable unreduced together with the pension increases and rates of revaluation in deferment that are applied to GMPs and the Excess under each of those sections. Turning specifically to the rates of pension increases and revaluation, as is common in many schemes, the statutory rates of GMP revaluation in deferment and the rate of GMP increases differ from the rates applied to the Excess under the Schemes’ rules.  </p>

I was told that the Schemes’ benefit structures contains features which give rise to the kind of GMP equalisation problems that affect many defined benefit occupational pension schemes.  In particular, as is apparent from the table in Appendix A, different increase provisions are applied under the Schemes for increases to the GMP and the Excess both in deferment and whilst pensions are in payment.

Initially, the Trustee argued that the court should accept a surrender of its discretion. In response to this invitation from the Trustee, the Banks and the RBs stated that the court’s reaction was a matter for it and not for them. However, the parties did not agree on the principles and the practice which I should apply when considering an invitation from a trustee to accept a surrender of its discretion. As the case proceeded, it emerged that most (if not all) of the points being argued in relation to Issues 5 to 8 involved matters of legal principle on which the court should rule and in the light of those rulings, the extent of the Trustee’s discretion was comparatively limited. It was then agreed that I should rule on the matters of legal principle which had been argued and not (at any rate, not at this stage) accept a surrender by the Trustee of its discretion in relation to any such remaining discretionary matters. Issues 5 to 8 were not redrafted to reflect this position but they can be addressed on the basis that they essentially ask the court to answer questions of legal principle which arise in relation to the availability of Methods A to D. </p>

The arguments were very thorough and comprehensive and involved reference to a large number of legislative provisions and the citation and analysis of a considerable body of authority. As will be seen, the points which are ultimately decisive are in the final analysis quite short points, certainly as compared with the comprehensive nature of the argument. In other circumstances, I might have preferred to have proceeded straight to the essential reasoning which supports the answers I have arrived at in relation to Issues 1 and 2. However, I was repeatedly reminded during the hearing that there are many in the pensions industry who are watching this case and the Government has itself suspended its consultation processes into what should be done until this case has been decided. In these circumstances, I have decided to set out the relevant material at length and to refer in detail to the submissions of the parties although that course will result in a lengthier judgment than is strictly necessary to explain my reasoning.  </p>

Having identified the substance of the question, the ECJ dealt with the status of such pension schemes at [21]-[30]. The Court determined that such schemes fell within the scope of Article 157.

The case arose from the interaction between the general pension scheme (the “AOW”) and the ABPW. To obviate overlapping of the two schemes, a deduction was made from the ABPW to reflect rights under the AOW. As married women accrued limited rights under the AOW before 1986, the deduction made from their benefits under the ABPW was lower than that made from the benefits of married men. The claim was brought by Mr Beune (a married man) on the basis that his ABPW pension was lower than it would have been had he been a married woman.

Until Barber's decision given by the ECJ on 17 May 1990 British schemes usually mirrored the different ages at which state pensions were payable, namely 65 for males and 60 for females. Article 141 requires that male and female workers should receive equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. In Barber's case the ECJ held that pensions are pay and must be equal for both men and women.

This case was concerned with bridging pensions for those who had taken ill-health retirement. In particular, a rule in a pension scheme had the effect that the ill-health pensions for women between the ages of 60-65 were lower than the pensions for men at the same age, because women qualified for the state pension at age 60, whereas men only qualified for the state pension at age 65.  The amount of the state pension was deducted from the bridging pension.  This applied whether or not the individual actually qualified for the state pension.  Mrs Roberts did not qualify for the state pension, because she had chosen not to pay the full NIC contributions (although she did qualify for an equivalent state widow’s pension). </p>

In Case C-132/92, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Roberts v.

To my mind, this clearly establishes that integration with the State scheme can provide objective justification for even a discriminatory policy, but that does not, of course, mean it always will do so. By contrast, in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Beune</span>, the ECJ held that Article 141 was infringed, where different treatment between men and women under an occupational pension scheme was sought to be justified by reference to their respective differential treatment under the State scheme. Although, at first sight, these two decisions may appear hard to reconcile, I believe that they are consistent. The facts of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Beune</span> are complicated, but the infringement arose, in essence, because there was no equal treatment between married men and married women, whether one looked at their respective occupational pension rights alone, or at the combination of their respective occupational pension rights and their rights under the State scheme. In other words, unlike in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Birds Eye</span>, the discrimination policy in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Beune</span> was unlawful, because the occupational pension rights did not achieve, and did not seek to achieve, equality between married men and married women, either taking those rights on their own or taking them together with their State pension rights.” </p>

This was paid to employees who were 10 years (or les than 10 years) away from their state pension ages.  As the state pension age in Austria for men and women, respectively, was 65 and 60, this meant that women received the bridging allowance from the age of 50 and men from the age of 55.  Mr Hlozek was aged 54 when he was made redundant and he made an equal pay claim on the basis that if he had been a woman of the same age he would have received the bridging allowance. It was held that the bridging allowance was “pay” for the purposes of Article 141 (now Article 157). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Mr Cavanagh sought to analyse the many decisions of the ECJ dealing with the question of “pay” for the purposes of Article 157. In addition to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span> and the cases which came after it, he referred to two cases which were decided before <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span>. The first of these was <span style="text-decoration:underline">Liefting v. Academisch Ziekenhuis Bij de Universiteit Van Amsterdam</span> (Case C23/83)  [1984] 3 CMLR 702.   The facts in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Leifting</span> are somewhat complex.  In summary, the facts were that public sector employer in the Netherlands paid the employees’ contributions for the purposes of the state pension scheme to the state on behalf of its employees. One of the issues in that case was whether such a payment by an employer amounted to pay for the purposes of Article 119.  Both the Advocate General Sir Gordon Slynn and the Court answered that question in the affirmative. Although the court said that that would not normally be the legal position, the court explained that it reached that result in that case because the sums in question were included in the calculation of the employee’s gross salary and the amount of the gross salary directly determined the calculation of other salary related benefits: see the judgment of the court at [12]-[13]. It is difficult to see how anything in that decision is of assistance to Mr Cavanagh’s argument. However, he sought to analyse the case so that it supported one of his arguments which was that a payment by the employer could be pay for some purposes and not for other purposes. He said that a particular payment could have a chameleon character so that it changed its character depending on the purpose behind the question as to whether it constituted pay. This is a novel argument and it derives no support from the decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Leifting</span> (or any other authority, for that matter). In that case, as in all of the other cases, the question is whether the particular payment in the particular circumstances has the character of pay. That question is given a single answer. In any particular case, the payment is either pay or it is not.  </p>

Legislation may be used for different purposes. If it defines rights and obligations under a social security scheme for all workers, or for groups of workers who are not in any sense 'employed by' the State, it is no doubt based on 'considerations of social policy' rather than on an employment relationship. On the other hand, if by the same machinery, legislation, rules are adopted in respect of those 'employed by' the State, those rules may be an expression of social policy, or they may equally spring from and govern the employment relationship. It is true that the latter may indeed at the same time reflect a State's ideas of social policy, but that factor cannot in my view take away their essential characteristic as rules governing the employment relationship. If it were otherwise, civil servants could not rely upon the principle of equal pay for equal work contained in Article 119, and there seems to be nothing in that Article 119 or in the case law of the Court to justify such a result. The relevant question is thus whether what is done is done by the State essentially as an employer.” </p>

These contributions meant that men were left with lower net pay than women.  In his first opinion, Advocate General Darmon stated that the reason why men had to contribute towards a widow’s pension, but women did not have to contribute towards a widower’s pension, was because this was required by the legislative framework in order for the scheme to be contracted-out: see section 36 of the SSPA 1975.   </p>

He cited authorities as to the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Marleasing</span> principle, that is, the duty of the court to construe domestic legislation, which had been enacted to give effect to the United Kingdom’s obligations under European law, in a way which conformed to those obligations, so far as it was possible to do so: see for example <span style="text-decoration:underline">Alemo-Herron v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Parkwood Leisure Ltd</span> [2011] ICR 920 (SC) at [20].

The argument seemed to be that the degree of integration with SERPS, a statutory scheme providing social security benefits, meant that the benefits should be regarded as a substitute for social security benefits and should therefore be regarded as social security benefits within Article 156 rather than Article 157 and, further, the subject of Article 7(1)(a) of Directive 79/7/EEC. </p>

Such an approach has not been identified in any earlier case.

All of the cases, including <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lieifting</span>, approached the question by applying the established principles as to the character of pay and asking whether, on the particular facts of the particular case, the benefit in question was pay. The fact that the decision in one case was different from the decision in another case was because the court held that the facts of the cases were different not because any particular case involved a conclusion that the benefit was pay for some purposes and not for other purposes. </p>

There is no obligation which requires Schemes to pay unequal GMPs so as to prevent schemes paying equal benefits overall.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether paying unequal benefits in this case would separately be a breach of section 67 of EA 2010, even if I had held that the relevant benefits were not “pay” within Article 157. I have set out section 67 earlier in this judgment. The schemes in question are occupational pension schemes within that section. The terms of the Scheme which concern GMPs and/or which result in unequal benefits being payable are terms which are less favourable to one sex or the other. Section 67 does not use the word “pay” so that term does not have to be construed in the context of section 67. Accordingly, on the literal wording of section 67 it can be strongly argued that the payment of unequal benefits under the Schemes is unlawful under that section, whatever the position is in relation to Article 157. Although section 67 implements Article 157 and so must be construed, if possible, to give effect to Article 157 there is no reason why section 67 cannot be construed to be more extensive in its scope than the scope of Article 157. However, in view of my conclusion that the relevant benefits are pay within Article 157, I will not enter into any further discussion as to the scope of section 67 and that question is better considered in a case where it needs to be decided. </p>

Issue 2(b) refers to a possible objective difference between the position of males and females arising from the GMP legislation and Issue 2(c) refers to the defence of material factor under section 69 EA 2010. Section 69(6) states that a factor is not material unless it is a material difference between A’s case and B’s case. Accordingly, both issues involve an investigation into whether there is a material objective difference which is the reason for, and a justification for, the difference in treatment. Indeed, the parties relied on the same submissions in relation to both of these issues. </p>

If men and women are treated unequally under a lawful statutory scheme and then unequal benefits are paid to them under an occupational pension scheme which benefits are designed to produce, and have the effect of producing, an equal result overall, is the payment of unequal benefits under the occupational pension scheme lawful or unlawful? One can certainly see that, as a matter of policy, the taking of steps to correct pre-existing inequality and to produce overall equality should be regarded as welcome and not unlawful. This question potentially arises in the present case. In a case where the effect of the GMP legislation is to produce unequal treatment for men and women, if the schemes were then to make payments (which are themselves unequal as between men and women) in order to produce an overall equal result, would that attempt at equalisation be lawful or unlawful? To give an example, if in a particular year the effect of the GMP legislation and the rules of the scheme produce the result that a woman is £100 better off than a man and the scheme then pays £100 to the man to produce an overall equal result, could the woman complain that she is being treated unequally because she was not given £100 when the man was?  </p>

The answer given by the ECJ in that case was that if the unequal treatment was for the purpose of producing, and had the effect of producing, an overall equal result then the unequal treatment was lawful. The reason given by the ECJ was that before the unequal treatment which was the subject of the complaint, there was a pre-existing inequality and that represented an objective difference in treatment which meant it was lawful to treat men and women unequally where the purpose and effect of the unequal treatment was to produce an overall equal result. It is difficult to think that the ECJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Roberts</span> would have used the same reasoning to hold that it was lawful to treat men and women unequally in a way which continued the pre-existing unequal treatment or which otherwise produced an unequal result.

However, administration records for pensioners will typically include GMP data, from which the GMP applicable to an analogous member of the opposite sex can be estimated.  This enables an estimate to be made of the impact of pension increases being unequal due to the impact of GMPs, but no more than that.  This is only part of the total picture for pensioners who retired from deferred status as it will ignore the impact of anti-franking.  This omission could tilt the calculation either way, where a methodology offsets advantage and disadvantage depending on circumstances – i.e. a calculation based only on pension increase inequality could overstate or understate the actual total impact. </p>

This record keeping requirement would affect potentially all members with GMPs arising in the equalisation period of 17 May 1990 to 5 April 1997.  This is because one cannot predict in advance how the comparisons will be affected by experience (e.g. inflation and pension increases).

The greater of the two calculations would then form the basis of the payment to the member.  Unlike method A, no attempt is made to take each differing element of the respective male and female calculations and to give the more generous treatment on an element by element approach.  Instead, each element of difference is consolidated into a single calculation entirely on the male approach and a single calculation entirely on the female approach.  Hence, this method provides for some offsetting of the individual better-of-two-approaches elements within method A, so should result in an equal or lower cost than method A.  It also requires two member records to be kept (in addition to the actual record) for members affected by unequal GMPs, due to the possibility that the comparison may switch from one sex being treated more generously to the other.  </p>

It varies from method B in that, if the comparison changes from favouring one sex to the other, the less generous calculation starts to be paid until accumulated gains prior to the change are exceeded by the divergence in payments after the change. Method C is identical to method B if the pension received by incorporating the GMP requirements applicable to one sex is higher at all ages than that by incorporating the GMP requirements applicable to the other.  Method C therefore gives rise to the same or a lower cost than method B, and again requires the maintenance of two additional member records for each affected individual.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">As this illustration shows, there is an actuarial valuation of the benefits of the unequalised female; the figure is £42,829. Then there is an actuarial valuation of the benefits of the unequalised male; the figure is £45,603. The figure for the unequalised male is higher than the figure for the unequalised female. Method D1 then involves a step to produce equalisation in actuarial terms. That step is to give the female increased benefits which will have an actuarial value of £45,603. There is no need to alter the benefits for the male and so the unequalised male and the equalised male are the same; both therefore have the same actuarial value of £45,603. The way in which the female’s benefits are enhanced is shown in the above illustration. She gets an extra annual sum of £79; some of the figures for that annual sum are £80 but that is the result of rounding. A simple way to understand this illustration is to say that the female is given an extra capital sum of £2,774 (£45,603 - £42,829) with which she buys an annuity of £79. One could vary the illustration so that the notional annuity was not a fixed sum but was, for example, index linked. It can be seen from the above illustration of method D1 that although both male and female pensions are equalised to have the same actuarial value, the annual payments differ. </p>

Appendix B also contains an illustration of method D2. The actuarial value of the equalised benefits are the same for both male and female pensioners. Also, unlike method D1, both the male and female pensioner receive the same annual sums. However, the profile of the benefits payable under method D2 is quite different from the profile of the benefits payable under the Schemes on an unequalised basis. Indeed, as the illustration in Appendix B shows, in the early years of the illustration both male and female pensioners receive lower sums than before. </p>

The DWP consultation document linked their proposed approach to the related subject of GMP conversion.  This is the process for converting GMP benefits into non-GMP benefits of equal actuarial value, which has existed for several years, but seldom if ever utilised. I was told that this was because of uncertainties in relation to the equalisation question.  The DWP consultation recognised that GMPs represent a complex legacy arrangement with overhead costs of administration and communication, reflecting a state pension system that has long been superseded, and it recognised  the advantages of converting GMP benefits into a format that is easier to administer and communicate. This DWP consultation proposed a specific approach to setting the actuarial assumptions required to undertake an equalisation project using a version of method D. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The scheme actuary understood that equalisation projects have been completed using a version or versions of method D, mainly or exclusively in the context of pension schemes entering buy-out transactions.  These could be considered to be a special case, as in a buy-out the liability to pay benefits is transferred from the scheme to an insurer acting as a third party.  In those circumstances the commercial imperative to achieve risk transfer in the buy-out will outweigh the risks of the equalisation approach subsequently being deemed inadequate (and insurers can charge for this residual risk). A form of method D has been adopted in the context of preparing pension schemes for buy-out transactions as a comparison between the actuarial value of the benefits that would be applicable under the treatment relevant to either sex, with the impact of all advantages and disadvantages being netted off against each other.  At the hearing, this was referred to as method D with full consolidation.   </p>

For illustrative purposes, one (C1) did not consider interest in determining the extent to which gains to date should offset paying the higher of the two alternative pensions in the future.  The other (C2) allowed for interest on the gains, at a rate of 3% per annum.  The inputs and conclusions used were strictly illustrative and were to some extent artificial in order to draw out the impacts of the different methods.  In particular, to illustrate the potential for a male step up at age 65 the example used the statutory minimum treatment of the male pension at age 60, of not allowing for GMP revaluation at all to that date.  In practice, the significant sections of the Schemes which I am considering use a more generous treatment, and the impact of the anti-franking provisions for a male at age 65 (and the extent to which the female benefit exceeds that for the male at age 60) would be less for the Schemes than in the illustrative example. </p>

Her pension at date of exit was £5,000 per annum of which £4,000 pa was GMP and £1,000 pa was non-GMP.  If she were treated as a male, GMP would be £3,600 pa and non-GMP £1,400 pa.  Increases prior to retirement were taken to be 4% pa on non-GMP and 7% pa on GMP, subject to the points set out below.  The female’s pension at age 60 amounted to £8,834 per annum (as a result of £5,000 increased by 4% pa on the non-GMP element and at 7% on the GMP element).  From that age her GMP increased at 3% pa and the non-GMP at 5% pa. The male’s pension at 60 amounted to £5,672 per annum, as in this example only the £1,400 non-GMP was subject to revaluation to age 60 for a male.  From that age, the entire pension increased at 5% pa until age 65 as it remained all non-GMP.  At that age, the 7% pa increased on the GMP need to be recognised, and the pension increased to £11,355 pa.  From that age onwards, the GMP increased at 3% pa and the non-GMP at 5% pa. In each case, the projected increase above the female’s current entitlement was shown at each future age.  For comparison purposes, the projected increase against the notional male comparator was also shown.  </p>

Each year, the higher pension increase awarded under each approach was awarded.  This was the female approach until age 64.  At age 65, the pension was increased by £4,460 pa, equal to the step up at that age that would be applicable to a male (£11,355 pa - £6,895 pa).  From that age onwards the greater of the increase awarded on the male and female approaches was awarded. From age 65, method A gave rise to a substantially higher pension for the female and the notional male than either’s original entitlement.  This was a consequence of recognising the anti-franking step up applicable to males for the female as well.

From age 65 payments continued in line with the (now lower) female calculation until such time as the accumulated "shortfall" compared to the male calculation after age 65 exceeds the accumulated "overpayments" of £15,379 prior to age 65. Method C1 gave rise to the (lower) female calculation being put into payment until age 78.  This would result in no action being taken in respect of the female member until that age, and a higher pension being put into payment for the notional male member between ages 60 and 65 (offset by a lower pension from age 65 onwards, until the male level of pension starts again from age 79).

The female’s pension was increased to that applicable to the analogous male after age 78, recognising that the advantage she has received up to age 65 has by age 78 been cancelled by subsequent payments at a lower level than the male would have received. Method C2 gave rise to the (higher) female calculation being put into payment between ages 60 and 65 and the (lower) female calculation being put into payment from age 65 until age 82.  This would result in no action being taken in respect of the female member until that age, and a higher pension being put into payment for the notional male member between ages 60 and 65 (offset by a lower pension from age 65 onwards, until the male level of pension starts again from age 82).  Method C2 could also be said to reduce the male pension between ages 65 and 82 albeit by no more than the accumulated gain the male has enjoyed as a result of being treated as a female between ages 60 and 65.  The female’s pension is increased to that applicable to the analogous male after age 82.  The age at which the benefit switched back to the (higher) male pension being paid is later under method C2, recognising that advantages and disadvantages in earlier years have more value when interest is allowed for to reflect the time value of money.  In other words under method C2 the advantage of the position between ages 60 and 65 was deemed to support a longer period during which the lower pension is paid after that age. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">I have explained how a number of matters, operating in tandem, produce the result that benefits for men and women are not equal. The RBs contend that in order to equalise benefits it is necessary to adopt a “term by term” approach. They say that this is legally required by European law for the purposes of Article 157 and by English law for the purposes of section 67 of the EA 2010. What is required, the RBs say, is that one identifies the separate terms of the occupational pension scheme which, operating together, produce an inequality in benefits. Once one has identified the separate terms, it is necessary to make an adjustment so that each term, as adjusted, produces equality. When one has made that adjustment to each term separately, one will produce an equal result overall. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The RBs say that the only method which adopts a term by term approach in an appropriate way is method A3. In Appendix B, there is an illustration of how method A3 works in a particular case. In the first line of the illustration, men and women receive the same benefits which are the higher of the benefits to which one of them is entitled. This means that the man’s benefits are increased and the woman’s benefits are not increased but her total benefits are the same as the man’s. However, on later lines of the illustration, both the man and the woman receive increases. Thus, the use of method A3 does not produce the result that the total benefits of the disadvantaged sex are levelled up to that of the advantaged sex but instead both the advantaged sex and the disadvantaged sex receive increases in their benefits. The RBs say that the court should not be concerned about that consequence of the use of method A3 and submit that it is a recognised consequence of adopting a term by term approach and the authorities have expressly required a term by term approach even in the knowledge that such an approach goes beyond levelling up the position if considered overall. </p>

Method A3 does result in men and women receiving equal benefits and it is accepted that it does produce equalisation. However, they submit that the law does not require the adoption of Method A3 and the other methods B, C1, C2, D1 and D2 also in their different ways produce equal benefits.  Because the other methods also produce equalisation, the Trustee is not able to adopt Method A3 because that would infringe the principle of minimum interference, which I describe later in this judgment.  </p>

The technicians, who worked normal working hours from Monday to Friday, had a 40-hour working week and no pay supplement. In proceedings in which it was claimed that two female midwives were discriminated against by their receiving lower basic pay than a male clinical technician for work of equal value, one of the issues was whether, for the purposes of the equal pay provisions in article 119 and the Equal Pay Directive,  there were to be taken into account, in comparing the pay of different groups of persons, an inconvenient hours supplement received by one group only and the value of a relatively reduced working week worked by that group.<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller;font-family:Verdana"> </span>The ECJ held that, although it had pecuniary consequences, the midwives' reduced working time was in the nature of working conditions rather than pay, and accordingly did not fall within article 119 of the EC Treaty and the Equal Pay Directive; but that such a reduction might constitute an objective reason unrelated to discrimination on the ground of sex justifying any difference in pay found by the national court prima facie to constitute indirect discrimination. The court further held that the midwives' inconvenient hours supplement, constituting as it did compensation to the worker for the disruption and inconvenience caused by working unsocial hours, was a form of pay to which the worker was entitled in respect of his employment, and therefore came within article 119 of the EC Treaty and Directive 75/117; but that, as the supplement varied from month to month, it was difficult to make a meaningful comparison between a midwife's salary and supplementary allowance, taken together, and the basic salary of the comparator group; and that, accordingly, in order to ensure greater transparency and guarantee compliance with the requirement of effectiveness underlying Directive 75/117, the comparison for the purposes of article 119 and the Directive should be made between the midwives' basic salary, leaving out of account the inconvenient hours supplement, and the like salary of clinical technicians. </p>

In my view, the correct approach to this and similar cases is to accept that the group receiving lower basic pay, in the present case the midwives, is paid less, so that the second question set out above, namely whether the pay of the two groups is unequal, is regarded as receiving an affirmative answer. I would add that that approach would in this and similar cases ensure greater transparency: the fact that the supplement varies from month to month depending on the time and the day the relevant shifts were worked would make it difficult to make a sensible comparison of, on the one hand, a midwife's aggregate salary and supplement and, on the other hand, the comparator's basic salary. </p>

The expression "term" was to be given its natural meaning as a distinct provision or part of the contract which had sufficient content for it to be compared with a similar provision or part in other contracts; and that, accordingly, the applicant's contract contained a term as to her basic pay in respect of which she was entitled to relief under the section and the case would be remitted to the industrial tribunal for determination. It was also said that Article 1 of the Equal Pay Directive was to be construed as being consistent with the effect of section 1(2) of the EPA 1970 and that the case would have been decided similarly under European law. </p>

This was a concern that had weighed heavily with the lower courts or tribunals in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hayward</span>. Lord Goff offered two answers to this concern. First, it might be open to the employer to justify the different treatment in a particular respect by saying that the difference in treatment was genuinely due to a material factor namely the existence of another term in the contract which also provided for different treatment. It was suggested that such a defence might have been available under section 1(3) of the EPA 1970 which operated in a similar way to section 69 of the EA 2010. The second answer to the concern was that if the House of Lords’ decision did not accord with the true intention of Parliament, then the appropriate course was for Parliament to amend the legislation.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The facts in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Degnan</span> were complex and called for an evaluation as to whether certain provisions should be considered separately or whether their effect should be aggregated to some extent. The claimants were women employed as a cleaner, a supervisory cleaner, a supervisory assistant in schools, and a home help in the local authority's social services department. They brought equal pay claims comparing their work to that of gardeners, refuse workers and drivers, and road workers. All the male comparators were employed on work rated as equivalent and received the same basic hourly rate as the applicants. However, gardeners also received a fixed bonus of 40%, refuse workers and drivers received a 36% bonus and an attendance allowance of between £33.81 and £34.88 per week, and road workers received a fixed bonus of 33% and an attendance allowance of between £13.91 and £14.61 per week. The employment tribunal held that the terms relating to basic pay and to the bonus payments related to the same subject matter, but that the terms of the attendance allowance were separate. As a result, each of the claimants was entitled to compare herself with the relevant male worker most advantageous to her for the purpose of the bonus element of his pay, and with the most advantageous comparator for the purpose of the attendance allowance. Thus, one particular claimant was entitled to the gardeners' term as to bonus, which resulted in a 40% increase, and she was also entitled to the refuse workers' attendance allowance, at the rate of £33.81 per week. As a result, she would receive more total remuneration than any of the male comparators. The decision as to as to bonus payments was not challenged on appeal to the EAT but the decision on attendance allowances was challenged. The EAT held that that the employment tribunal was wrong to hold that the provision as to attendance allowances related to a different subject matter. Instead the correct view was that the provision as to attendance allowances formed part of the same subject matter as the hourly rate and the bonus. The EAT defined the relevant term of the contract, for the purpose of an equal pay comparison, as the monetary payment an employee receives for the performance of the contract during normal working hours. All monetary payments received by male comparators for normal working hours should be aggregated and divided by the number of hours in the working week, to give an hourly rate. That hourly rate should be compared with the woman's hourly rate; if it was greater, the woman's hourly rate should be increased to eliminate the difference. On that basis, the attendance allowance related to the same subject matter as basic hourly pay and a fixed bonus and was “an element of a distinct part of the contract and not itself a distinct part”. It was part of the monetary payment for performance of the contract, by attending at work and working during normal working hours. The Court of Appeal </p>

In his judgement, Maurice Kay LJ (with whom the two the other members of the court agreed) said that section 1 of the EPA 1970 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hayward</span> required classification in relation to the provisions of the contract and that the EAT’s classification was realistic based on careful analysis. He also said that the decision would have the desirable result of equalisation rather than the upward movement of the women’s rate of monetary pay to a level higher than that of any single male comparator. </p>

Health service employees of the appellant trust who were employed on shift work received enhanced payments when they worked nights, weekends and bank holidays as part of their normal contracted hours.

The emphasis must be on the reality of the contractual provisions in the circumstances of the particular case, and it will be a question of fact in each case whether a discrete term exists for these purposes. It is not permissible to seek to offset one more favourable term against another less favourable one.

		</a>EA 2010 dictates that just as an employer cannot lump together or engage in an overall comparison of different terms, a claimant in an equal pay claim cannot subdivide a single term into two or more parts in order to complain about one part only. A term by term analysis is required in equal pay cases. There is no distinct provision or part of the claimants' contracts providing for 'variable pay' above the minimum point in each relevant grade and none is relied on by (counsel for the employee). The reality of the contractual pay provisions in this case is that they are indivisible into sub-terms and to the extent that average pay is considered, average total pay is the only relevant consideration.” </p>

Put another way, the question is whether the term by term approach is satisfied by holding that the relevant term is to be classified as the amount of pension payable or whether that approach requires the court to treat the various features of the GMP legislation, operating together with the provisions of the schemes, as being separate terms which must be equalised separately. The particular matters which the RBs say are separate terms are the terms as to revaluation of the pensions, the terms as to indexing of the pensions and the terms as to anti-franking. </p>

It is also important to remember that the question is being asked for a particular purpose in a practical context and does not involve a wholly theoretical exercise. The purpose is to produce the result of equal treatment in a way which is transparent and will ensure effective judicial review. In some cases, it will be straightforward to identify what should be done to produce equal treatment. If a man and a woman receive different hourly rates for the same work, then the disadvantaged sex must receive the same hourly rate as the advantaged sex. But other cases will not be so straightforward. The pay structure or the benefits structure may be complex so that a separate comparison of different factors which contribute to the overall result as to pay or benefits is difficult or is unrealistic or unprofitable. </p>

I therefore need to consider the effect of section 68 of the EA 2010. Section 68(1) applies if the trustee of an occupational pension scheme does not have power to make sex equality alterations to the scheme or where such alterations are liable to be unduly complex or protracted or would involve delay or difficulty in obtaining consents. Where section 68 applies, the trustee has power to make sex equality alterations. These are defined to be “such alterations to the scheme as may be <span style="font-weight:bold">required</span> to secure conformity with a sex equality rule” (emphasis added): see section 68(3) and (5). Thus, where the trustee is under an obligation to comply with a sex equality rule, it is able to alter the scheme to the extent that the alteration is “required” for that purpose. Thus, it is necessary to ask what the trustee is “required” to do. It can make an alteration which is required but it is not entitled to alter the scheme to do something which it wishes to do but which it is not required to do. </p>

I will consider the obligation to equalise benefits from the point of view of both the Banks as employers and the Trustee. If the obligation to equalise is on the Banks, then they must be able to choose how to perform their obligations (providing they do not in some other way infringe the rights of others). They can choose to go beyond the minimum which is required but if they instead provide only the minimum which is required, then they will have performed their obligation and no more is required of them.</p>

However, the entitlement would not go beyond what is required to perform the obligation. Just because the Trustee must equalise benefits, it does not follow that the Trustee has an entirely free hand as to how to exercise that entitlement. It must be the case that the Trustee’s power to equalise benefits is limited by the extent of the obligation and it is not entitled to choose to provide more than the members are entitled to by way of equalisation of benefits. </p>

The scheme initially provided for unequal benefits as it provided for a normal retirement date of 60 for women and 65 for men. Following the decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span>, the rules were changed from 16 August 1993 to level down so that the normal retirement date for both men and women was 65. At that point, there were rules providing for a member to take early retirement. The early retirement rules were changed, so as to become more restrictive, with effect from 30 April 2003. A question arose as to the position of a member who wished to take early retirement between 60 and 65. The parties identified three possible responses to that question. All three answers, or options, produced a result whereby men and women were treated equally. The judge selected option 1 which was the most expensive of the three options. The employers appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal and selected option 2. </p>

Accordingly, the court should, where possible, give effect to Barber rights by adhering to the provisions of the relevant scheme where it is possible to do so in preference to some other approach. If some departure is required, it should in general, so far as practicable, represent the minimum interference with the scheme provisions. This approach is not limited to the situation where members have been led to believe that a provision will be used in a certain way or a stated aim of a provision has been only imperfectly achieved (as in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bestrustees</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">v Stuart</span> itself).

Accordingly the court should consider not just the extent of any textual amendment required to the rules of the scheme to enable effect to be given to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span> rights, but also the substantive effect of the amendment so adopted. In this case, the implementation of the rights of members with mixed NRDs on the judge's approach involved taking away the company's right to give or withhold its consent to early retirement, or to give its consent on terms. Likewise his solution ended up giving those entitled to Barber rights far more than they were entitled to under European law: they acquired the right to non-reduced benefits on early retirement in respect of pension entitlement accrued outside the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span> window. Those factors cannot be ignored. The only effect of European law on benefits is to impose a NRD of 60 for pension entitlements accrued during the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span> window. The scheme should in general only be treated as amended to the extent necessary to make those rights effective. This principle of minimum interference with the scheme's provisions should be applied on the basis that minimum interference takes account of the substance and not simply the form of any notional amendment to the rules.  </p>

Minimum change might require extensive amendments to the drafting of the rules, whereas fewer textual changes might result in a greater substantive alteration. I agree with Arden LJ that the minimum alteration required should start with the modifications made already by way of equalisation for the future, in 1993, and should proceed from there but making no greater additional alteration to the scheme than is necessary to achieve full conformity with Community law as declared in article 141 EC, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Coloroll</span> cases.” </p>

In that case, the trustee had a power of amendment permitting amendments to be made retrospectively to the date of any prior announcement of the intended amendment. Following the decision in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Barber</span>, the trustee had made an announcement in 1991 that it would level down benefits by adopting a normal retirement date of 65 for all members with effect from 1 December 1991. That announcement was acted upon save that the trustee did not immediately thereafter take the formal steps needed to alter the rules of the scheme to give effect to the announcement. The judge held that the rules required any amendment to be by deed so that the announcement in 1991 did not itself make an effective amendment to the rules. The trustee eventually amended the rules by deed on 2 May 1996. The deed purported to amend the rules by levelling down the normal retirement date from the date stated in the announcement, 1 December 1991. The judge at first instance held that the power could not be exercised to level down benefits retrospectively. The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision that the 1991 announcement did not itself effect an amendment to the rules and it referred to the ECJ the question whether it was consistent with the case law of the ECJ, in particular <span style="text-decoration:underline">Smith v Avdel Systems Ltd</span> (Case C-408/92) [1995] ICR 596, for a retrospective power of amendment to be used to amend the rules to provide for retrospective levelling down.  </p>

The High Court’s conclusion that levelling up was required under art.119 between 1 December 1991 and 2 May 1996 appeared to produce a result which gave both the advantaged and disadvantaged classes better pension rights than those of the advantaged class during the relevant period: women’s rights were improved from a defeasible to an indefeasible right to a normal pension age of 60; and men’s rights were improved both by reducing their normal pension age from 65 to 60 and making those rights indefeasible.

She also stressed that any decision to the effect that there were deficiencies in the statutory provisions would have implications for other cases and might prove to be unfortunate. Notwithstanding this stance on behalf of the Crown, Mr Simmonds invited me to rule on the points which had been argued. He stressed that these points had been fully argued.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Mr Simmonds put forward two points which he said could be considered to be helpful to the Crown’s argument. His first point was that the power to amend a scheme is conferred by section 24G; he submitted that the references to amendments in section 13(1A) (dealing with earners) and in section 17(1A) (dealing with survivors) did not create independent powers to amend but were cross references to the statutory provisions in sections 24A to 24H. Section 24G states that the power to amend a scheme may be used to effect GMP conversion “whether in relation to present earners, pensioners or survivors”. That suggests that the power can be used where the beneficiaries under the scheme include persons who are survivors at the time of conversion. It was submitted that the wording of section 24G(1) counteracted the impression which might have been given by the definition of “GMP conversion” in section 24A(1)(b), referring to “earner” alone without a reference to survivors. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The second point which might be said to support the Crown’s argument was that section 24G(5) provides that for the purposes of section 24E (dealing with procedural requirements) a reference to “an earner” includes a reference to a pensioner or survivor whose pension is subjected to GMP conversion. Section 24E refers to “earner” in two places, i.e. in section 24E(3)(a) where it requires consultation with the earner in advance of conversion and in section 24E(4) which requires notice to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs that conversion will affect the earner. In the light of section 24G(5), it would seem that both of these references to “the earner” are to be taken to include survivors. Accordingly, section 24E(3)(a) requires consultation with survivors in advance of conversion. However, the language of the two sub-paragraphs of section 24E(3) deals with survivors in different ways; section 24E(3)(b) expressly refers to survivors whereas section 24(3)(a) only refers to earners (but subject to the operation of section 24G(5)).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Mr Simmonds then made two points which he said were unhelpful to the argument for the Crown. The first of these was based on section 24B(3) which laid down Condition 2. Condition 2 as there expressed was a safeguard for an earner but there was no equivalent or similar safeguard for a person who was a survivor at the time of the conversion. Further, the extended definition of “earner” in section 24G(5) did not apply to section 24B. Whilst on section 24B, Mr Simmonds suggested that section 24B(7) appeared to focus on the position of earners and survivors were not mentioned. </p>

I have already described what is involved in these methods and there is a further description of that in the agreed document at Appendix B to this judgment. To recap, method B is based on year-by-year calculations of the pension the member would receive under existing provisions and the pension they would receive had they been of the opposite sex (all else being equal).  The greater of the two calculations would then form the basis of the payment to the member.  Method C1 is a variant of method B.  It differs from method B in that, if the comparison changes from favouring one sex to the other, the less generous calculation starts to be paid until accumulated gains prior to the change are exceeded by the divergence in payments after the change. Method C1 is identical to method B if the pension received by incorporating the GMP requirements applicable to one sex is higher at all ages than that by incorporating the GMP requirements applicable to the other.  Method C1 therefore gives rise to the same or, potentially, a lower cost than method B.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The difference between method B and method C1 is revealed by comparing the illustrations of these two methods in Appendix B. Up to age 75, the woman receives the pension she is entitled to under the relevant scheme and the man’s pension is levelled up to that of the woman. At age 76, the woman is entitled to £6,500 under the terms of the scheme but the man is entitled to £6,504 under the terms of the scheme. Ignoring what had happened in earlier years, it might be said that the man should receive £6,504 and the woman’s pension of £6,500 should be levelled up to £6,504 to provide for equality of benefits. That is indeed what happens with method B. However, method C1 does not ignore what happened in earlier years. Instead, method C1 notes that up to age 75, the man has received an accumulated amount of £285 over what he was otherwise entitled to under the terms of the scheme (ignoring the term which required equalisation). This £285 is treated as an advance payment on account of the sums due to be paid to the man from age 75 onwards. As the woman is due to receive £6,500 at age 76, part of the £285 is set against the £6,504 to reduce the man’s pension but not so that it is reduced below £6,500. Thus, the man receives £6,500 and because the man does not receive £6,504, the woman’s pension is not increased from £6,500 to £6,504 either. Both receive £6,500. The accumulated £285, or what remains of it, is set off in the same way in later years so that all the way up to age 86, the man and the woman receive the same amount, which happens to be the sum to which the woman is entitled under the scheme. If the total sums received by the man are accumulated at any point in time, the result of equalisation is that the man will at all such times have received an accumulated amount which is at least as much as his entitlement under the scheme </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Accordingly, method C1 provides for equal treatment of men and women. The next question therefore is whether there is a reason why it is not a permissible method to adopt in this case. Could it be argued that method C1 offends the principle of minimum interference, applying the principle from the standpoint of the beneficiary? Taking the illustration in Appendix B, could it be said that method C1 interferes impermissibly with the rights of the male beneficiary when, at age 76, his annual pension is reduced from £6,504 to £6,500? The same question applies to the annual pension received by the male beneficiary in each year thereafter up to age 86. I consider that what matters is that if the matter is assessed at any point during the time that a pension is in payment and if one has regard to all of the payments made to the man up to that point, the position is that the man has not only received equal treatment to a woman but he has also received not less than he would have been otherwise entitled under the scheme. Accordingly, I conclude that method C1 does not infringe the principle of minimum interference considered from the standpoint of the beneficiary and is a permissible method to give effect to the requirement for equal treatment. </p>

To recap, the difference between method C1 and C2 is that method C2 allows for interest from the date of payment to the date of calculation when comparing the values of accumulated gain prior to the advantage switching from one sex to the other and the values of the loss since that switch. Put shortly, C2 seeks to quantify the value of having a sum of money at an earlier point in time as compared with having the same sum of money at a later point in time.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">If I am right in my conclusion in relation to method C1, I consider that the logic of the position is that when assessing the accumulated amount to be available to be set off against later payments, it is appropriate to factor in the time-value of money. The receipt of a sum of £X in year 1 is more valuable than the receipt of a sum of £X in year 25. The difference in value can properly be expressed by adding an appropriate rate of interest to the £X received at the earlier point of time. However, for the purposes of the calculation, the rate of interest which is used should be conservative. It should reflect the benefit to the pensioner of having a sum of money earlier than otherwise. I see no basis for adopting the rate of investment return actually earned or expected to be earned on the trust assets. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The parties made detailed submissions to me as to the rate of interest which was appropriate to be paid by the Trustee to a beneficiary in relation to payments which had been wrongly withheld in the past. I will deal with that topic in detail later in this judgment. As I later explain, the appropriate rate of interest on back payments should be 1% over base rate from time to time. That rate is the rate which I consider to be appropriate in this case to compensate the beneficiary for being kept out of money to which he was entitled. It is not inevitable that the rate of interest to be used for the purpose of method C2 should be the same as this rate. However, the purpose of adding interest into the calculation used for method C2 is to require the pensioner to give credit for the benefit to him of having had a sum of money earlier than otherwise. This suggests to me that the rate of interest to be used to identify the value to the pensioner of having </p>

In the end, I do not see a good reason for choosing a different rate of interest for the purposes of method C2 from that chosen in relation to the obligation to make good previous underpayments. Accordingly, the rate of interest to be used for the purpose of method C2 will be 1% over base rate (simpe interest). It is accepted that the rate of interest should be fixed each year by reference to base rate from time to time. </p>

They say that their rights under the scheme are to receive the pension payments to which they are entitled under the scheme together with any further payment needed to ensure that they are treated no less favourably than a pensioner of the other sex. The scheme provides for pension payments to be made during the life of the pensioner and of any survivor. The scheme provides for the payments to respond to inflation from time to time. This means that if a pensioner or a survivor live longer than some actuarial prediction, they will be entitled to receive a pension in accordance with the scheme levelled up, if appropriate, to ensure equal treatment between men and women. Further, the pension payable will respond to the actual level of inflation. The RBs submit that method D1 substitutes for the pensioner’s and the survivor’s actual entitlement an entitlement based on actuarial assumptions. Only in the case of a coincidence will those assumptions be the same as the actual circumstances which come about. If method D1 is adopted, the pensioner and the survivor will receive pension payments based on assumptions rather than pension payments by reference to the actual circumstances.  </p>

These choices can have a significant impact on the actuarial calculation. The RBs say that members should not have an actuarial equivalence imposed on them on the basis of assumptions as to their choices which might be different from their actual wishes. I can see that it might be possible to avoid making assumptions about member’s choices by waiting until the member makes his actual choices and then carrying out an actuarial calculation which reflects those choices but that approach to method D1 will involve greater complication as compared with adopting a single date and making common assumptions for all members. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">I will next consider method D2. This method involves the use of the power in sections 24A to 24H of PSA 1993 to modify the Schemes to effect GMP conversion. I have considered the operation of those sections earlier in this judgment. I have held that these provisions are workable to permit GMP conversion not only in relation to earners but also in relation to persons who are survivors at the time of the conversion. However, section 24E(2) provides that the Trustee may only exercise this power if the employer under the scheme consents to the GMP conversion in advance. In the present case, the Banks do not at present consent. The result at present therefore is that the Trustee is not able to modify the Schemes to effect GMP conversion under the statutory provisions. This means that method D2 cannot be used in this case at the present time. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Although the above conclusion disposes of the possibility that method D2 can be used in this case at present, I will comment on a further submission made by the RBs. They drew attention to the illustration of method D2 in Appendix B and submitted that the result of method D2 was that there was a substantial departure, adverse or potentially adverse to pensioners, from their rights under the Schemes. It was then submitted that the result was that method D2 did not provide equality of treatment. That submission confuses two different concepts. First, there is the concept of equality of treatment. Then there is the concept of minimum interference with rights. The requirement of equality is imposed by Article 157 and by section 67 of EA 2010. If there is equal treatment, then those requirements are met. There is a separate question as to the method of achieving equality which might be chosen by the Trustee and imposed on the employers and the members. In the absence of sections 24A to 24H of PSA 1993, that question would be determined by applying the principle of minimum interference with rights. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">However, in a case which comes within those sections, those sections confer the power to adopt method D2, whether or not the method interferes with the rights of others. In other words, the interference is authorised by statute. This point can be illustrated by an example. If the Trustee first amended the Schemes by using method C2 and thereby provided equal benefits in a way which I have held is permissible, the Trustee could thereafter use the power to convert given by sections 24A to 24H of PSA 1993 (providing the consent of the employers was obtained). That would produce a result similar to method D2, whereby all members are treated equally on the basis of actuarial equivalence. That result would be permitted by the statutory provisions and would not infringe Article 157 or section 67 EA 2010. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The result of the above is that method A3, promoted by the RBs, infringes the principle of minimum interference, judged from the standpoint of the Banks and method D1, promoted by the Banks, infringes the principle of minimum interference, judged from the standpoint of the beneficiaries. If one rules out method A3 and method D1 on those grounds, that leaves methods B and C for consideration. Method C is somewhat less costly than method B and method C2 is somewhat less costly than method C1. In those circumstances, applying the principle of minimum interference again, the Banks are entitled to say that the Trustee must adopt method C2 and may not adopt method C1 or method B. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">In addition to the considerations to which I have referred which have led me to the above conclusions, there was discussion as to the administrative burdens, and the resulting cost, involved in the various methods. Consideration was also given to the need to explain matters to beneficiaries and it was pointed out that some of the methods would be easier to explain and would be more readily understandable by beneficiaries than other methods. Those considerations do not lead me to change the conclusions I have reached in relation to methods A3 and D1 and it is not said that I should reject method C2 and prefer method C1 or method B for these reasons. Accordingly, my conclusion remains that the Banks are entitled to say that the Trustee must adopt method C2. </p>

The RBs contended that the Trustee was obliged to make good any underpayments of pension during the period that a member had been entitled to receive a pension and there was no limitation as to time in relation to a claim for back-payments. The Banks contended that there were limitations as to time on a claim for back payments and that those limitations were provided for in various rules of the various schemes and, in any event, there was a statutory limitation period imposed by section 134 of EA 2010. The parties began their submissions by referring to section 134 of EA 2010 but, in the course of submissions, it emerged that the right way to approach the matter was first to consider the rules of the Schemes, then to consider section 92(5) of PSA 1993 and then to consider section 134 of EA 2010. </p>

Rule 1 is not confined to a case where the pension has not been claimed and nothing has been paid. Rule 1 specifically refers to any instalment of pension. Accordingly, Rule 1 applies in a case like the present where the trustees have made payments in relation to pension entitlement but have underpaid the beneficiary. In such a case, Rule 1 provides that the beneficiary is not entitled to claim the amount of the arrears more than six years after those arrears accrued and ought to have been paid. As the beneficiary is not entitled to claim those arrears, the trustees are not bound to pay the beneficiary those arrears and any payment of those arrears would be a voluntary payment by the trustees. I was not specifically addressed on whether other rules of this Scheme allow the trustees to make ex gratia payments but Rule 1 does not allow an ex gratia payment in a case which comes within Rule 1. </p>

Accordingly, Rule 2 applies in a case like the present where the trustees have made payments in relation to pension entitlement but have underpaid the beneficiary. In such a case, Rule 2 provides that the unpaid sum shall be forfeited if it is not claimed within six years after it accrued and ought to have been paid. As the unpaid sum is forfeited in such a case, the beneficiary is not entitled to claim that sum, the trustees are not bound to pay the beneficiary that sum and any payment of that sum would be a voluntary payment by the trustees.

Rule 1 does not refer to “forfeiture” of the right to the unpaid arrears. However, section 92(7) defines “forfeiture” for the purposes of section 92 to extend to “any manner of deprivation” of a pension and I will assume for present purposes (the contrary was not argued) that Rule 1 provides for a “forfeiture” within the meaning of section 92 after six-years. Rules 2 and 4 do refer to forfeiting the arrears and those Rules are subject to section 92. Rule 3 refers to the entitlement to pension being “extinguished” and that would seem to come within the definition of “forfeiture” for the purposes of section 92.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">As to section 92(5), the RBs submitted that the references to making a claim dealt only with making a claim to a pension and did not extend to a case of making a claim to be paid arrears of payments where the pension was in payment but the payments had been wrongly calculated and underpayments were made. Section 92(5) refers to “a claim for pension” but “pension” is defined by section 94(2) to include any part of a pension or any payment by way of pension. Thus, where a beneficiary’s payments are wrongly calculated and he is underpaid, and the beneficiary does not make a claim in relation to the underpayments, that would be a case where the beneficiary had not made a claim for a payment by way of pension within section 92(5) and a rule which provided for forfeiture after six-years would be a valid rule for the purposes of section 92. As indicated above, I consider that Rules 1 to 4 do provide for a forfeiture of the right to the arrears if they are not claimed for six years after becoming due and, accordingly, Rules 1 to 4 are valid for the purposes of section 92. </p>

However, in a case governed by Rule 5, the Trustee does have a discretion. I will mention later in this judgment submissions as to what a trustee should do where it is able to assert a limitation defence under the general law against a claim by a beneficiary but, at this point, I will consider how the Trustee should go about the exercise of the Rule 5 discretion leaving out of account any question of a limitation defence under the general law. In the case now being considered, where the Trustee is given a discretion to pay or to withhold a back payment in relation to a period which is more than six years before the back payment was claimed, the general rules as to the exercise of a trustee’s discretion apply. A trustee must have regard to all relevant considerations and no irrelevant considerations and must make a decision which is rational and not perverse. </p>

The second proposition is that the provision in section 134 of the EA 2010, which imposes a six-year limitation period on such a claim, where the claim is based on a breach of an equality rule, infringes the European law principle of equivalence which requires a claim to a remedy for breach of a right conferred by European law to be treated in no less favourable a way than a similar domestic claim would be treated. </p>

Secondly, even if such a claim was not subject to a limitation period under the 1980 Act, the six-year limitation period imposed in this case by section 134 of the EA 2010 did not infringe the European law principle of equivalence.  </p>

He further submits that if a beneficiary has not been paid the full amount of the benefits due to him or her under the Scheme (which incorporated a sex equality rule) and the Trustee is in possession of sufficient trust assets to make good the previous under payments, then a claim by a beneficiary for an order that the Trustee pay the amount previously withheld is a claim to recover trust property in the possession of the Trustee. Accordingly, he submits that the case is governed by section 21(1)(b) of the 1980 Act. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The background to section 21 of the 1980 Act and the legislative history of the provision, involving section 8 of the Trustee Act 1888 and section 19 of the Limitation Act 1939, were explained in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Williams v Central Bank of Nigeria</span> [2014] AC 1189 at [12]-[14], [20]-[22] and [24]-[25]. Before the Trustee Act 1888, a trustee did not have a limitation defence to a claim by a beneficiary for breach of trust. The possession of trust assets by the trustee was considered to be the possession of the beneficiary. If a trustee was in possession of trust assets and did not execute the terms of the trust in relation to those assets, he had no defence based on limitation to a claim by the beneficiary requiring him to perform his trust: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hovenden v Lord Annesley</span> (1806) 2 Sch &amp; Lef 607 at 633-634. Although in some cases a trustee could defend a claim by a beneficiary for breach of trust by relying on the equitable doctrine of laches, no such defence was available where the trustee remained in possession of the trust fund and was called upon by a beneficiary to perform the trust in relation to that fund: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mills</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">v Drewitt</span> (1855) 20 Beavan 632. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The legal position of a trustee was altered by section 8 of the Trustee Act 1888 which provided the trustee with a limitation defence in relation to some claims. That position was largely re-enacted in section 19 of the Limitation Act 1939 and then in section 21 of the 1980 Act with some changes of language. Under these provisions, a trustee can in some circumstances plead a defence of limitation to a claim by a beneficiary for a breach of trust. However, a defence of limitation is not available in relation to all claims by a beneficiary against a trustee. One case where such a defence is not available is where the trustee was a party or a privy to a fraud. Another case is where the trustee had converted trust property to his use. Mr Rowley cited <span style="text-decoration:underline">Thorne v Heard</span> [1894] 1 Ch 599 and [1895] AC 495 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re Timmis, Nixon v Smith</span> [1902] 1 Ch 176 which discuss cases like these. At times, the submission seemed to be that because the trustees in the present case were not guilty of any fraud and had not converted trust property to their use, section 21(1)(b) did not apply. But that submission ignores the language of section 21(1)(b) which includes the simple case where a beneficiary seeks to recover from the trustee property in the possession of the trustee. The reason why there is no limitation period in relation to such a case is that the trustee is in possession of the trust property on behalf of the beneficiaries: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">First Subsea Ltd v Balltec Ltd</span> [2018] Ch 25 at [57].  </p>

The cause of action which is said to be relevant in this case is an action “to recover from the trustee trust property … in the possession of the trustee”. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">How v Earl Winterton</span> [1896] 2 Ch 626, the claimant complained that a trustee had underpaid her the amount of an annuity under a will trust and she claimed an account. At 632, Kekewich J said that the claim was an action “to recover trust property”. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Burnden Holdings (UK) Ltd v Fielding</span> [2017] 1 WLR 39 (Court of Appeal) and [2018] 2 WLR 885 (Supreme Court), the claim was by a company against a director for breach of fiduciary duty in converting the property of the company to the use of the director. It was explained that, for the purposes of section 21 of the 1980 Act, the position was to be analysed as if the director was a trustee holding trust property for the benefit of the company. The company claimed equitable compensation for the breach of fiduciary duty. In the Court of Appeal, at [38], David Richards LJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) held that the claim to equitable compensation was a claim to recover trust property. That conclusion was not challenged in the Supreme Court: see per Lord Briggs at [13]. </p>

The authorities to which I have referred as to the nature of the cause of action which is a claim “to recover trust property” support the conclusion that a claim by a beneficiary in the present case to receive late payment of arrears of sums to be paid by the trustee out of trust property is a claim within section 21(1)(b). </p>

That is not an assessment which is required by section 21(1)(b) of the 1980 Act. What section 21(1)(b) requires is that the trustee is in possession of trust property when the claim is issued.

What Eve J said about the duty of a trustee to execute the trusts of a fund is entirely in accordance with the position, as I have held, in relation to section 21(1)(b), where the trustee does not have a limitation defence where the beneficiary seeks to recover assets in the possession of the trustee. The second comment is that if statute expressly gives to a trustee a limitation defence to a claim by a beneficiary, it is a little strange to think that the trustee is acting in breach of trust by relying on the statutory defence. </p>

It was not suggested that the underpayment should only bear interest for part of that period because, for example, there had been delay on the part of a beneficiary in claiming the arrears of payment. I agree with the trustee that it is right to acknowledge that it ought to pay interest on the arrears. The rules of equity provide for such interest to be paid in an ordinary case. The beneficiary would not need to rely on the statutory jurisdiction under section 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 or section 69 of the County Courts Act 1984.

I was therefore not given evidence as to what such typical beneficiaries would have done if they had been paid the full amount of the pension when it was due. So far as I can tell from the illustrations which were provided to me, the amount of the underpayments were relatively modest and would not have made a major difference to the lives of the pensioners over the years. There was no evidence which would enable me to find that the underpayments led to a typical pensioner borrowing money at overdraft rates of interest. It is possible that a typical pensioner might have saved more money (at very modest rates of interest) if the full payments had been made but it is more likely still that a typical pensioner would have spent the further sums which he ought to have received. </p>

That is the section which provided, inter alia, that an award of arrears was restricted to the period of six years before the proceedings were commenced. I have held that the limitation to six years infringes the principle of equivalence in a case where the trustee is in possession of trust property out of which to pay the arrears. I am not clear whether Mr Short’s case was that if I reached that conclusion then he could not rely on section 134 in any way. I do not take that view. Although the part of section 134 which provides for a limitation on recovery to a period of six years is not effective, the remainder of section 134 would seem to me to continue to apply. Accordingly, if there were an application to an employment tribunal under section 134 and the tribunal made an award in relation to arrears of payment, then the tribunal could award interest under the Regulations (made under section 139 of the EA 2010) which apply for the purposes of a claim before an employment tribunal. Those Regulations are the Employment Tribunals (Interest on Awards in Discrimination Cases) Regulations 1996 which although they were made before the enactment of EA 2010 continue to apply, pursuant to the Equality Act 2010 (Commencement No 4, savings, Consequential, Transitional, Transitory and Incidental Provisions and Revocation) Order 2010. The 1996 Regulations were amended by the Employment Tribunals (Interest on Awards in Discrimination Cases) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. In summary, the relevant Regulations provide for interest at 8% (the rate under the Judgments Act 1838) and also provide that where the arrears accrue evenly over a period, one can simplify the calculation by taking the whole of the arrears as accruing due at the mid-point of the period. It was not argued that these Regulations give the employment tribunal a discretion to award interest at a lower rate although the employment tribunal would appear to have power to decline to award any interest. It was not suggested that the Trustee could invite the tribunal to decline to make a formal award of interest at 8% in a case where the Trustee undertook to pay interest at a lower rate. The Regulations do not apply to proceedings under section 134 of EA 2010 brought before a court, rather than the employment tribunal. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The rate of 8% which can be awarded by an employment tribunal under sections 134 and 139 of EA 2010 is obviously much higher than the rate which would be awarded by a court in a case like the present. Similarly, the rate of 8% is much higher than would be awarded under the equitable rules as to interest. It may be that Mr Short’s provisional reliance on section 134 is to be taken as saying that if a pensioner is entitled to more than six years arrears of payment, then the arrears should bear compound interest at 2% above base rate but if the pensioner was restricted to six years arrears of payment by reason of section 134, then the interest would be simple interest at 8%. I agree with Mr Short to the extent that it would seem to be unfair to disregard the limitation in section 134 to the period of six years but yet adopt the rate of 8% which was only envisaged as applying if the period of interest involved arrears of up to six years before the proceedings were commenced. But more generally, it has been recognised that a rate of interest of 8% in recent years and at the present time is quite inappropriate when a court is asked to fix a rate to compensate a claimant for being kept out of his money: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Novoship (UK) Ltd v Mikhaulyuk</span> [2015] QB 499. Whatever might be said as to the policy of awarding interest at 8% following judgment, it seems to me to be wholly inappropriate to use a rate of 8% in this case for a period of six years before the commencement of proceedings and from the commencement of proceedings until payment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">I can now express my conclusions. I consider that the equitable result is that interest should be paid at 1% above base rate. If base rate had been a significantly higher rate, then I would not have gone above base rate. However, since base rate has been historically low in recent years, I reach the conclusion that such a low rate of interest is inadequate to compensate the pensioners for being kept out of their money. Conversely because the amounts of the arrears are likely to be modest in an individual case, I am not persuaded to award more than 1% above base rate. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">It is still the normal practice of the court to award simple rather than compound interest. An award of interest by an employment tribunal in accordance with section 139 of EA 2010 and the Regulations is also simple interest. The rules of equity would also lead to an award of simple interest in a case like the present: see Lewin on Trusts at para. 39062. I recognise that in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sempra Metals Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [2008] 1 AC 561, the House of Lords stated that awards of simple interest did not do full justice to a person who ought to be compensated but the normal practice remains as I have described.

I had no difficulty with that proposal as it was in the Banks’ interests to contend for those answers. As to the RBs, it was proposed that they would contend for the opposite answers and they would submit that there was an obligation on the schemes to contact the transferee schemes and to make good any deficiency in the payment which had been made in the past on the occasion of earlier transfers. These arguments on behalf of the RBs were not in their interests as they are current members of the Schemes. At the outset, because those arguments were not in the interests of the RBs, I was concerned about the suggestion that the RBs should represent all persons in whose interest it might be to put forward such submissions. Counsel for all parties sought to reassure me on this head by pointing out that it is often appropriate in relation to pension disputes to identify representative parties who will argue the opposing cases even if, on various points of detail, it is not in the interest of the representative to put forward a particular case. </p>

Indeed, Mr Rowley’s skeleton argument on Issue 13(b) dealt with that issue in less than half a page and Mr Short’s skeleton argument on Issue 13(b) was also brief. However, in the course of Mr Short’s argument, it emerged that he wished to contend that the alleged obligations on the part of a transferring scheme were not just based on European law principles and he wished to rely for that purpose on domestic statutory provisions and regulations. Further, the arguments as to Issue 13(c) would require a detailed consideration of domestic statutory provisions and regulations and general principles of English law.

	    <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">This Appendix highlights the provisions of the Schemes that could give rise to unequal payments arising from GMPs.  These provisions relate to benefits accrued after 17 May 1990 and prior to 6 April 1997 and where reference is made to a total pension in the table below, this refers only to benefits accrued during this period.  For ease of reference, this Appendix only looks at the provisions of the Schemes contained in the most recent Trust Deeds and Rules, and any subsequent amendments.  It is possible that the benefits for certain members are governed by previous Trust Deeds and Rules which contain different provisions. </span>

For this purpose the Appendix uses a materiality limit of 1% of scheme liabilities.  In order to identify the relative importance of the different sections and subsections, the percentage of the total scheme liability (as at 30 June 2014, the date of the most recent actuarial valuations of the schemes) represented by each category is stated.  This gives a realistic indication of the relative size and importance of each section, and the percentages are not expected to be noticeably different at a more recent date.  </p>

This is an issue for the HBOS Scheme, where for some sections (in particular BOS, Capital Bank and Birmingham Midshires) there is a longstanding practice of discretionary increases being awarded by the sponsor.  With the agreement of the sponsor, allowance for these to continue has been included in funding valuations and transfer values.  This can only be done by taking a view on the future level of those increases – in practice awards by the sponsor are not bound by this allowance. The position in relation to the No. 1 Scheme and the No. 2 Schemes is different, in that some administrative practices are in place which provide benefits which are generally in excess of those set out in scheme rules.  There are some relatively minor aspects of the HBOS scheme where this is also the case.  Except where stated costs in this report reflect the assumption that these discretions and practices will continue.   </p>

In other words, where an increase in payment is subject to a maximum of 5%, no single increase will exceed this level.  In deferment, a single revaluation in excess of 5% </p>

Scheme-specific minimum revaluation provisions will depend on wording of the rules, and these are capped on an annual basis in the case of the No. 1 Scheme and the No. 2 Schemes.  References to CPI in statutory increases reflects the forward-looking position.  In the past, RPI was used as the relevant inflation measure until 2011, and this is reflected in the entitlements considered in this report.   </p>

In the Halifax section this is likely to be offset by the (relatively generous) treatment of GMPs for females, to the extent that members retire at that section’s NRA of 62 from deferred pensioner status.  This arises because of the statutory requirements that surround GMPs coming into payment after GMP payment age (60 for a female) – essentially providing a late retirement uplift for a woman retiring after her GMP age that would not apply to a male retiring at age 62 (ie before his GMP payment age of 65). </p>

The impact of this will be to favour males, as the current practice limits the increase on the non-GMP to 5%, whereas the increase on the GMP is limited to 3% (both being based on CPI).  If no discretionary increases were made, females would benefit, as increases would only be awarded on the GMP (which is higher for females and recognised from age 60 rather than age 65), although a stepup for males would be more likely from age 65.  The discretionary practice of paying increases on the GMP equal to those on the non-GMP in the Birmingham Midshires section will result in no inequality arising from pension increases in that section. </p>

For example, in a section where females who have been deferred pensioners are expected to have higher pensions from NRA, having no differentiation on pension increases will leave males disadvantaged.  If the usual position of pension increases favouring males was present, this would in a sense compensate for the advantage to females at the point of retirement.

The widely differing provisions between the schemes (and between sections within each scheme) is expected to give rise to differing issues on a scheme-by-scheme (and section-by-section) basis. </p>

In payment, compare the amount of the total increase each year payable to the male and female and pay the higher. Once the pension is put into payment and immediately after each subsequent increase, view any uplift that is added as a consequence of equalisation as an increase in the non-GMP element. This means that at the following pension increase exercise, the pension increase is calculated by applying the increase percentage applicable to the GMP and non-GMP respectively, recognising that the previous year’s equalisation uplift is non-GMP, and then, if necessary, adding another equalisation uplift.  At age 65, (1) recognise the male GMP at age 65 and deduct it from the male non-GMP; and (2) recognise and award (regardless of the member’s sex) any increase payable under the male’s calculation at age 65 due to the antifranking provisions.  Continue to calculate increases as before, including any previous equalisation uplifts as non-GMP.   </p>

In the following examples this is referred to as the antifranking minimum, reflecting the statutory (anti-franking) tests that apply at GMP payment ages. An increase of this amount would be applied only if (i) the scheme put the minimum required by the preservation legislation into payment at age 62 and (ii) there were no increases in payment after age 62.  The HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme provides more generous treatment than the statutory minima in both of these areas. </p>

The number of increases on the non-GMP and GMP over a specific period may not equate, and may not be the same as the difference between age at leaving service and retirement age.  In this example, 18 increases are taken to apply over the period between leaving service and age 60, with a further 5 to age 65.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">In the examples, the individual in question was born on 12 February.  Pension increases are typically granted with effect from the April payment each year, meaning that increases apply shortly after the individual’s birthday.  This is reflected in the projections which show the pension applying from a certain age generally being that which would come into payment in the April following attainment of that age.  The “At retirement” row shows the position at retirement on the member’s 62<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> birthday in February; the next row “62” shows the position at the first April increase after the 62<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> birthday and so on for each annual April increase thereafter.

	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">Actual pension increases are awarded on a pro-rata basis on non-GMP at the first such increase, but for illustration purposes in these projections this nuance has been set aside and it has been assumed that the non-GMP will receive a full increase from the April after the February in which retirement occurs at age 62.  This is the same approach as followed for the generalised methodology adapted for the WTW Report dated 25 April 2017.  The practical effect of recognising a partial first increase on the non-GMP would be to defer the age at which the projected advantage switches from the female member to the male analogue and this would obscure some of the detail around the impact of the different Methods. </p>

At that age the (unequalised) benefit payable to the male is the total pension at 62 of £3,855 increased by three increases of 3.85% or £4,318 pa.  This exceeds the minimum pension under anti-franking of £3,930 so the unequalised male calculation is not subject to any adjustment for anti-franking.  The unequalised male pension remains at £4,318 pa, and is now split into a GMP of £979 pa and a non-GMP of £3,339 pa. </p>

The first is between the non-GMPs at age 62 (for this purpose treating the entire male pension as non-GMP).  The respective comparators are £2,866 pa (female) and £3,855 pa (male), so £3,855 pa is recorded as the non-GMP entitlement.  The second compares the GMP elements at age 62 of zero (male) and £1,067 pa (female), so £1,067 pa is recorded as the GMP element, giving a total pension of £4,923 pa. </p>

Because the male non-GMP will always exceed that of the female, and male GMP is zero up to age 65, this means that the calculation is taken as the female GMP plus the male non-GMP (equal to the entire male pension).  For example the pension payable from the April after attaining age 64 is the male non-GMP (i.e. the entire pension) at age 62 increased by three increases of 3.85% (£4,318 pa) plus the female’s GMP at 62 increased by three increases of 2.06% (£1,134 pa*) giving a total pension payable from that April of £5,452 pa*. </p>

The male entitlement remains at £4,318 pa, split £979 pa GMP and £3,339 pa non-GMP.   At this point the higher GMP is that payable to the female (£1,135 pa compared to £979 pa payable to the male) and the higher non-GMP is that payable to the male (£3,339 compared to £3,210 payable to the female) so the total pension reduces to £1,135 pa plus £3,339 pa, giving a total pension of £4,474 pa*.

The second is between the female GMP (£1,135 pa) increased by 2.06% (£1,158) and the male GMP (£979 pa) increased by 2.06% (£999) giving £1,158.

The switch of advantage from female to male occurs at the April increase after age 76, and the lower female calculation continues to be applied to both sexes until the accumulated excess (in the female’s favour) prior to the switch equals the accumulated loss (for the female) after the switch.  By the April pension increase awarded soon after attainment of age 87, the advantage received by the female member up to the April after age 75 has been extinguished by receipt of payments on the female calculation approach from that point that are lower than those that would have been received by the analogous male member.  From the pension increase after age 87, the (higher) payments that the male would have received are paid. </p>

The estimated value of the female’s benefits is lower than the comparator male, and hence an additional benefit would (in theory) be payable to the member.

The estimated value of the female’s benefits is lower than the comparator male, and hence a pension which ignores GMP structures, but is of equal value to the male comparator member’s unequalised benefits would be put into payment.  The illustrated pension assumes non-GMP rates of increase in payment from retirement applicable to the whole pension.  The new pension is lower than the current entitlement at younger ages, but exceeds it at higher ages.  This arises due to the conversion of the scheme pension into one of equivalent value but with higher pension increases, with the post-conversion pension being higher than the original entitlement at older ages. </p>

The new pension could be structured in a different way (e.g. higher starting amount with lower increases) so long as its actuarial value is the same as the actuarial value of the higher of the unequalised male and female benefits. </p>
