There is a dispute as to whether the capital repayment dates were also rescheduled. The Claimants contend that specific and different repayment dates were left to be determined in individual agreements, and that in the case of two loans (known as the First and Second PetroLes Loans), for example, the extension provided for was only until March 2009.  </p>

According to him, it was only on that basis that he was prepared to agree somewhat unusual arrangements, known as “repo agreements”. These repo agreements provided for the transfer of shares in the principal OMG companies to what Dr Arkhangelsky understood to be Special Purpose Vehicles (“SPVs”) controlled by the Bank, subject to an obligation on the part of the Bank to transfer the shares back “[a]fter the complete fulfilment of the Group’s obligations to the Bank”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">According to the Claimants, however, Dr Arkhangelsky had nothing else to offer: the repo arrangements were his own suggestion and bought him some time in respect of some loans, to be memorialised in due course, but did not buy him the general moratorium alleged, which the Claimants insist was never agreed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">By early 2009, it was clear that the OMG companies were unable to pay interest and then principal due under the loans. In particular, by February 2009, it was clear that the PetroLes loans could not be repaid on time, if at all.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">It is the Bank’s case that the PetroLes loans became due for repayment at the end of March 2009, that all of the OMG companies went into default in the first half of 2009; and that it was then entitled to and did serve demands for repayment both in respect of the principal indebtedness (including the Personal Loan) and under the guarantees (including the Personal Guarantees, as well as certain other intra-group company guarantees), and then to enforce against and realise the assets pledged to it to secure the loans.  </p>

Considering that most of people working in Moscow were above 50 or 60, not speaking any language, still trying to live in the Soviet conditions and didn't want to implement anything modern and European, which was quite strange for me while I spent about 10 or 15 years abroad, so I decided why not come back to St Petersburg and establish a company called, at that time, Scan Marine Consulting. I think it was a really successful venture, so in a short while I managed to obtain the most important, most famous Russian international clients, like all the major oil and gas companies, for whom I've been doing reinsurance generally in markets in London, in Norway, in other Scandinavian countries and in Bermuda. So, as I have written in the witness statement, it has been really one of the first Russian insurance, reinsurance broking companies.  And then I decided, why not to go forward, while at that time it was a time of restructuring of the international insurance markets of 9/11 and so on.  So I've been rather deep in that subject and I decided, why not to build up something special, local.  And later on, when the market would be a better market, not depressed after 9/11, then I would be able to sell this to international players, to international insurance companies with whom I've been working and whom I've been knowing personally. So I've been knowing personally directors of major energy syndicates at Lloyd's and so on, so we've been well regarded, so we've been knowing each other quite well and I believe that in case they wanted to touch Russian market, my business would be the best business for them to buy, or, if not whole, at least a share. Then at some stage, we understood that -- I employed quite a number of good, young people, so most of the people in my office have been between 20 and 35, all of them speaking languages, having experience international experience, got some, at least, partial international education, and I thought that I built up quite a good and modern team and we could easily expand, and definitely one of the areas of expansion was that time I thought the assets of the ex-Baltic Shipping Company.  You know, in St Petersburg, in the Soviet Union, one of the major shipping companies was the Baltic Shipping Company, trading worldwide and so on, and as long as my mother has been, let's say, one of the top executives of that community, and she's been known by everybody, so all the exdirectors and captains and so on, they've been personal friends with our family and so on, so I decided -- and this company had been bankrupted, so it has been a number of big scandals and beginning of the 1990s, so it has been divided to many, many different parts and pieces, and so they called it -- some of them, they called it privatisation; some of them called it bankruptcy, but it was a big collapse of criminal things all around there. So I found out that -- then I was the age of less than 30, and I had a good family reputation and I found out that the ex-assets of Baltic Shipping Company had been distributed and divided among hundreds of people who had been considering each other as enemies, so one had been owning a piece of land, another had been owning water at this piece of land, a third one was owning electricity at this piece of land, and they were considering that each of them were stealing assets from each of them.  So it has been quite a complicated story. I found myself that I am able to come in discussions, negotiations with these people, and even considering that they are enemies between each other, I consider that I can come and make an agreement with them because they were not considering me as the criminals, as they were considering each other as criminals, so they could have a confidence, especially because of the family connections and my mother's great reputation there. I went around the market while knowing all these people from my childhood, and made a preliminary agreement that I buy each and every piece.  So initially it was an Onega Terminal, then it came to Western and Vyborg Port and so on.  And so then I've been doing a lot of interviews to Russian media at that time, and they said: what is the secret of your success story? And I said -- I was telling at that time that if you watched a movie, Pretty Woman, so it's absolutely the same what I have done.  So I was just collecting assets which were considered not to be interested, each and every, and then by different M&amp;A transactions, I was changing their status, changing documents, changing the purpose of use, obtaining clients and so on.” </p>

It looked from the outside that OMG was receiving large amounts of money from a reputable bank and that Mr Arkhangelsky's business venture was supported by the government. His acquisition of Vyborg Port and the government support for the redevelopment projects he was seeking to undertake gave him credibility so far as I was concerned and suggested that maybe his business plan might after all be feasible. I can recall further meetings with Mr Arkhangelsky in which he reassured me that on top of everything, the federal and regional governments were supporting his plans. He mentioned certain names of federal and regional government officials who were supporting his business plans, but I cannot now recall them. This was relevant because any large infrastructure project requires federal and regional government support to be feasible. In the light of these matters, when Mr Arkhangelsky subsequently requested larger loans for OMG, the Bank was prepared to consider and grant those requests.” </p>

I cannot accept that evidence; and, though I do not think that it is established that Dr Arkhangelsky pocketed the money himself, I find that the moneys have never been accounted for.  </p>

I would be disposed to accept that the 7,000 TEU figure is an aberration, or perhaps a monthly rather than a yearly figure. But the wild differences at least cast further doubt on the final draft IM figure of 500,000 TEU per annum. That figure is almost impossible, to my mind, to justify.  </p>

He was adamant, not only that the other figures were ‘typos’, but more importantly that, based on information he said he had been given by others (the one with experience in Gdansk, the other with experience in Singapore) the 500,000 TEU figure in the final draft IM was correctly stated and entirely justified:  </p>

The first draft of the IM itself recorded a figure for capacity per hectare at “30k TEUs per hectare”. On a site of 8 hectares, Western Terminal’s capacity would therefore have been 240,000 TEUs per annum. There was only a finite land space at Western Terminal, and it was not physically possible to have greater capacity given the constraints of the site. The figure of 30,000 TEUs per hectare is consistent with the expert analysis of Mr Popov of Deloitte, who was instructed on behalf of the Claimants, and who analysed the capacity at other container terminals and found an average of 27,000 TEUs per hectare per annum. It is also consistent with the analysis contained in Mr Steadman’s supplementary report.  </p>

The terms were essentially agreed, but BNP required the Group to pay a monthly retainer fee of €25,000 for their services in addition to all the other fees and expenses related to other professional advisers and consultants. October 2008 was a time of enormous uncertainty in the markets and I did not think that the Group could commit to this expenditure at that time. I expected that the cash flow position would improve over the coming months and intended to take the project forward as soon as we were able to do so.”  </p>

The second is Dr Arkhangelsky’s reliance on a couple of documents which he described as constituting “written expressions of interest”, but which on inspection constituted no more than acknowledgments of Dr Arkhangelsky’s overtures and requests for more detailed information for “preliminary due diligence”.

As to that, Note 6.19 shows that for 2007, OMGP acquired Western Terminal LLC for US$ 40.289 million, but the business’s total fair value was put down as US$ 85.813 million, giving a figure for negative goodwill of US$ 44.524 million. Other acquisitions associated with Western Terminal were also re-valued, to give a total negative goodwill figure of US$ 50.857 million. ‘Negative goodwill’ arises when a business is purchased below what is said to be its fair market value, such that the buyer makes a resulting gain and it can be accounted as income.

The five categories of loans are as follows: quality I category (standard loans) – no credit risk; quality II category (nonstandard loans) – moderate credit risk; quality III category (doubtful loans) – considerable credit risk; quality IV category (problem loans) – high credit risk; quality V category (bad loans) – no probability that the loan will be repaid. The allocation of the loan into a particular category is based on the “professional judgement”, which is a special procedure set out in Regulation No. 254-P. Regulation No. 254-P established that credit organisations do not need to make provisions for category I loans (standard loans). Category II through V loans entail the following provisions, respectively: (i) 1 to 20 per cent.; (ii) 21 to 50 per cent.; (iii) 51 to 100 per cent.; and (iv) 100 per cent. Additionally, credit organisations will be required to classify their loan security into two groups on the basis of its quality. Finally, Regulation No. 254-P provides for a simplified procedure in respect of writing off bad debts, especially minor debts, as compared to former procedures. </p>

Except in the case of the overdraft and the Personal Loan, no capital repayment was due under any of the relevant loans until 2009: for the purposes of any concern about reserves for the year-end capital repayment was, according to the Bank, therefore irrelevant.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.98in;text-indent:0.00in">“However, the Bank was not prepared in general to extend the time for capital repayments on loans beyond the maturity dates. As at December 2008, it would have been possible for the Bank to extend the existing maturity dates, but I was very much against this. This was not a prudent or sensible course for the Bank to take. Insofar as any loan maturity dates had not been reached, it was not necessary in late December to extend those capital repayment dates because there was no risk of imminent default. More particularly, my view was that the Bank needed to make sure that OMG still had milestones in place over the coming months. This was because I wanted to keep some earlier obligations to act as indicators to signal whether OMG’s financial position was improving. If OMG’s finances started to improve, and the companies started to perform any of their obligations then the position could be reconsidered in early 2009. If the causes of OMG’s financial difficulties had been the short term cash flows which Mr Arkhangelsky represented to us, then OMG would have been expected to have been able to discharge those obligations by March 2009. However, my view in December 2008 was that we had already afforded Mr Arkhangelsky and OMG various allowances in the hope that time would allow the group to recover its financial state, and I did not trust by that time that Mr Arkhangelsky would be able to improve OMG’s condition. I therefore considered that any extension of the loans beyond their existing maturity dates was not sensible from the Bank’s perspective. </p>

The Bank prefers the “staging” of loans (where they are advanced for one year plus one year terms) for two main reasons. The applicable banking regulations provide that the Bank is not required to create reserves for loans of less than one year. It also allows the Bank to monitor on a shorter time frame the borrower’s financial performance and ability to discharge their indebtedness.” </p>

But for them, it was immediate trouble with the Central Bank and their accountancy. So for them, it was much more stronger problem than with me. And the most important, that by that time the Bank of St Petersburg faced that bank had problems with all the clients, and my share in their portfolio was about 4 per cent of their whole loan portfolio.  So for them, default on 4 per cent of their loans was nearly -- they could lose their licence, so they can cease their operations. So for me it was just technical non-payment, and its arbitration and so on. But for them it could cause immediate cease of the operation for them as a bank.

I explained that the Group was having severe cash flow issues because the clients of the group had stopped making payments, then the freight market had totally crashed and that port dues were not being paid. I also explained that, anticipating the annual extreme weather conditions, I did not envisage the Group’s situation improving until, at the earliest, spring 2009. It was for this reason that I explained that the Group needed to restructure its loans and have a moratorium on further monthly interest payments for a period of at least six months. </p>

As the borrower companies were unable even to make periodic interest payments at that time, they obviously had little prospect of repaying these loans on their due dates. It was therefore necessary to extend the repayment dates. I did not expect this to be a problem, because it was very common in Russia for banks to grant short-term loans even when the purpose of the loans was clearly a long-term one. The banks would then repeatedly extend the loans as necessary, typically for six months at a time. This is what happened with Vozrozhdenie Bank [V-Bank]… </p>

On the other hand, I felt that a suspension of payments for six months would enable the businesses either to recover sufficiently to resume paying interest to the Bank or, if that did not prove possible, to explore what refinancing options were available with other financial institutions. I remember at the time of the liquidity crisis President Putin had made a statement that the Russian Central Bank had to support strategic industries, so I was confident, given the strategic importance of the Group, that a refinancing package would be achieved either with the Bank or elsewhere. </p>

His primary concern was to avoid the Bank encountering difficulties with the regulator, the Central Bank of Russia. He explained that if the loans were in default, the Bank would have to transfer a sum equivalent to the outstanding indebtedness to the Central Bank which would result in a reduction of the Bank’s capital base and worsen its own financial position. It was therefore in the Bank’s interest, as well as the Group’s, for the loans not to go into default. Accordingly, Mr Savelyev indicated that he was in principle prepared to agree to a moratorium for six months to allow the Group companies’ cash flow to improve to the point at which they could resume making interest payments. At the end of the meeting he indicated that he would discuss the matter internally within the Bank and come back to me.” </p>

If there had been an agreement in principle in early December, that might have added credence to Dr Arkhangelsky’s version of events, which is that the meeting later in December 2008 was one at which a full agreement was made for a moratorium; whereas if there had not been, the Claimants’ version, to the effect that no definitive agreement was achieved in December 2008 beyond one for some indefinite extension to be clarified later in formal documentation which the Bank agreed to prepare, is more plausible.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Possibly building on Dr Arkhangelsky’s own suggestion in his letter of 28 November 2008 of a transfer of shares in Vyborg Shipping, it seems (especially from the evidence of Ms Mironova and Mr Belykh) that the Bank began to focus particularly on some form of “repo” transaction under which the Bank would acquire (for a nominal consideration) the shares in the relevant companies, subject to a provision for the shares to be repurchased (likewise for a nominal consideration) upon timely repayment of the debt. That would secure for the Bank control over the debtor companies (or the means of achieving it) so that it could more easily enforce its security without obstruction from the defaulting borrower or shareholders trying to block or impede the realisation of security. (It also, of course, gave the Bank potential access to the business value of the entire group; and a central issue between the parties is whether that was in truth its objective from inception.) </p>

Normally, before you start this, I mean before the first court sitting, it would take minimum three months, minimum three months for the first sitting, and then the proceedings before any enforcement, I think would have taken between 6 and 12 months minimum. So theoretically speaking, for me it was much more interesting that I don't pay these loans at the end of the year, they go to the court, start the proceedings, and then I have one and a half years for the first stage of the court, and then I have a Court of Appeal, which is one more year. So theoretically for them, absolutely minimum is two years to get the court decision which would allow them for enforcement proceedings, and that would really help me, and I could get refinancing by that time, or find any other player. But I, instead of going in any litigations, I agreed that I open all my business, give them all my business, just to save their licence and save the Bank.  Actually what I should say, that I saved the Bank of St Petersburg from ceasing their operation, because they have not had the resources to pay for their reserving.  So that's what I am telling. So I've been open to the Bank not to create problems for them because the Bank was rather weak compared to -- whole portfolio was defaulting, and I thought that this, my behaviour, would only help to improve relations. And absolutely the same was the case with V-Bank, because everybody understood that it's -- the default at that time, it's not a problem for the client.  It's major the problem for the Bank, because Russian banks are weak banks and they were not able to -- in case most of the loans are defaulting, they were not able to have all these reserves in place by the end of the year.” </p>

It was Dr Arkhangelsky’s evidence and apparent conviction that the introduction of Mrs Malysheva, for no logical reason since she was at the time overseeing the Corporate Finance Department and would not ordinarily have been involved, marked and evidenced the commencement of the ‘raid’ on OMG assets which he alleges was orchestrated by Mr Savelyev and Mrs Malysheva and is the substance of the Counterclaim.  </p>

The complaints were based on the proposition that Dr Arkhangelsky had no right or authority to borrow on Scan’s behalf since Sevzapalians, as 99% shareholder (further to its repo purchase), had not authorised the loan. I elaborate on this in paragraphs [592] to [596] below. </p>

The notices of demand which the Bank claims to have sent went (if they were sent at all) to an address in Ulitsa Dobrolyubova (Dobrolyubov Street), as opposed to my actual address which was on Prospekt Dobrolyubova (Dobrolyubova Avenue). Ulitsa Dobrolyubova is a real street and it is therefore unlikely that I would have received anything sent to that address. Moreover, at the time when it commenced proceedings the Bank was aware that I had left Russia, and it knew my address and contact details, but it did not make any use of them and merely served the documents at my former Russian address instead.

I have considered carefully Dr Gladyshev’s opinion as recorded in the Joint Memorandum of Experts on Russian Law that the Bank “was under an obligation to send a proper notice” and that failure to serve a notice of demand in accordance with “established practices…can be considered an abuse of right.” However, I prefer the evidence of Professor Maggs that even if the Bank failed to effect notice as specified in the relevant guarantee agreement, that would not be a “substantial breach of contract”, such as to dissolve Dr Arkhangelsky’s obligations. There can be no doubt that Dr Arkhangelsky became aware that he had been called upon to meet those obligations years ago; and the notion that one (or more) incorrectly served, addressed or completed demand(s) forever preclude(s) recovery strikes me as most unlikely.     </p>

It would appear that the Russian courts, in finding for the Defendants, did not take that into account. Each side blamed the other as to the reasons for this. The Bank claimed that the Defendants simply did not tell the Russian courts about it. On behalf of the Defendants, Mr Stroilov was at pains (especially in his oral closing) to emphasise that one of the Bank’s own witnesses, Mr Sklyarevsky, had accepted the fact that the draft repurchase agreements had been mentioned to the court, but that the court had refused to recognise their validity under the Russian law. Further, of course, there had been nothing to stop the Bank’s representatives from referring the court to them.  </p>

First, as previously mentioned, both Dr Arkhangelsky and Mr Vinarsky had filed criminal complaints with the Kirovsky police department alleging that their removal as Directors-General of Scan and Western Terminal were illegal, leading to the issue in May 2009 of orders initiating criminal proceedings and confirming their “victim status”. During the pendency of such criminal proceedings it would have looked even stranger for Sevzapalians to seize Western Terminal. The way in which, without notice or explanation save that Sevzapalians had made representations, the criminal proceedings were suddenly closed days before the seizure by order of the Chief Investigator for St Petersburg and the St Petersburg region has added to the suspicion of coordination between the Bank, Sevzapalians/SKIF and the authorities. And secondly, that also chimes with the admittedly hearsay evidence given by Dr Arkhangelsky that he was told by the person with line responsibility for the proceedings that Gen. Piotrovsky had personally intervened to order to “kick the case into the long grass.”  </p>

No proceedings had yet been brought: but a potential claim by Morskoy Bank against Western Terminal could cause further risk to the Bank’s security.

To obtain the loan, Western Terminal had to show that it had shareholder approval. I signed this document giving this approval when I was not the sole or the majority shareholder at that time.  </p>

The ‘Pechora’ was the subject of a finance lease between Scandinavia Leasing and Baltdraga, pursuant to which Scandinavia Leasing agreed to sell the vessel to Baltdraga in exchange for the provision of sums to the former. The Bank has not been able to realise any security under the ‘Pechora’ because of Baltdraga’s interest in the vessel.   </p>

They relied in particular on the fact that sometime in November/December 2008, Ms Mironova caused to be prepared a word document setting out calculations for the reserves and the security for the OMG debts, and an Excel spreadsheet listing the OMG debts, including the terms of the loans and the subject and value of various assets available as security. The spreadsheet does not list some of the Personal Guarantees. Ms Mironova said that this was a mistake: she was not cross-examined on this. </p>

So what is the value to give a personal guarantee for billions if I don't have any assets -- personal assets, let's put it this way. So they said, okay, that I need to sign some strange documents like three-party agreements with the other banks, but as long as it's not having any consequences, any -- as long as it doesn't result in anything, so then it couldn't create a problem for anybody. </p>

Dr Arkhangelsky never came up with a convincing explanation why that was not the initial reaction expressed by him or by his representatives on his behalf. In broad terms, he pleaded his absence from Russia and consequent loss of reliable contacts, faithless lawyers deaf to his instructions, pressure from “the Bank’s policemen” and ultimately that the proceedings in Russia were “unimportant”; but, in my view, none of these explanations carried conviction. </p>

We are both aware, having had forty years of experience in the forensic examination of signatures, that it is not uncommon for comparators to be manipulated in an attempt to mislead the expert either into reaching an incorrect conclusion or from being able to reach any conclusion at all. We emphasise that it is essential to this examination that a complete range of undisputed signatures of Mr Arkhangelsky covering all the forms of his signature from the relevant period should be available to both of us for comparison and these documents would have to be acceptable to both parties. In the absence of such an agreed set of undisputed comparators it will be impossible for us to try to reach any sensible conclusion regarding the questioned documents. Even with further known writings, a meaningful opinion on this type of very basic signature (which must be regarded as susceptible to simulation) cannot be guaranteed.

The first reason is that the consequence of the failure to bring finality to an approved list of comparators has inevitably reduced the reliability and value of the expert analyses and evidence. The second reason is to provide the context for the Claimants’ allegation that Dr Arkhangelsky’s prevarication in agreeing comparators has been deliberate and intended to frustrate the expert analysis, and the Defendants’ counter-allegation that it was the Claimants who sought to tie the exercise to an inappropriate selection of comparators and then refused to engage in an effort to obtain more reliable comparators from independent third parties, and insisted on using documents held by the Bank. That second issue could be of material relevance both in the assessment of credibility, and in assessing the Counterclaimants’ allegation that the Claimants fabricated the guarantees as part of the conspiracy against them: and see paragraphs [903] to [908] below. </p>

Further, he is not a man for painstaking detail or care: it would be quite in character for him to have either signed the relevant documents without regard to their effect if the worst transpired, since he would have regarded that as remote, or even without regard to their content, so long as the immediate objective of bank lending was secured. </p>

The lack of proper or comprehensive records, and the lack of direct evidence of actual signature, left it open to the hackneyed but reckless defence to which Dr Arkhangelsky resorted.

Dr Arkhangelsky ascribes to undue pressure of time (and indeed coercion), alternatively, oversight or the stupidity of his staff, that the Memorandum itself did not incorporate this crucial term, but he maintains that the unrecorded promise should be treated as nonetheless binding. </p>

However, though that appeared telling at first blush, the point assumed that the vessels were operating into and out of St Petersburg. This does not appear to have been the case.

The lack of any reference in the Memorandum to such an important element of the overall deal, and the fact that Dr Arkhangelsky made no objection either to that omission or to subsequent written agreements inconsistent with an overall 6-month moratorium are, in my judgment, fatal to the allegation.  </p>

But in my judgment, the truth is that Dr Arkhangelsky, by December 2008, was desperate. Unlike the Bank, he knew how serious the position had become (illustrated by the arrest of the ‘Tosno’, the deficits across the companies’ accounts, and his inability to fund the retainer proposed by BNP); and the repo was all he had left to offer to keep the Bank at bay.  </p>

In the context of an allegation of sham (unlike Section 423) it is the collusive and dishonest intention of the parties to enter into documents which are not intended to be given their stated effect which is the gist. There is no proper or sufficient plea that Dr and Mrs Arkhangelsky shared the requisite collusive and dishonest intention to create a ‘mock’ or sham transaction; and the particular proof required of such intention was not established (and see Snook v London &amp; West Riding Investments Ltd [1967] 2 QB 786 and ISIS Investments Ltd v Oscatello Ltd [2012] EWHC 745 as to the plea and proof required in English law).

On this third iteration of a conspiracy claim, the inference is said to arise from the fact that the events of June 2009 (and especially the transactions between connected persons) cannot be explained except by reference to some form of dishonest agreement allegedly between the Bank (acting principally by Mrs Malysheva and/or by Mr Savelyev as the Chairman of its Management Board) and Renord-Invest (acting by Mr Smirnov) resulting in collusive sales at undervalues inconsistent with honesty.  </p>

That is so especially in any context where his word is essentially the only evidence (such as in the context of his claims of coercion) or where his reliability and credibility is crucial (such as in the context of the claim that he was promised a general 6-month moratorium at the December meeting).

Neither demonstrates that the Bank’s purposes were to try “to assist their client in difficult times” (as its Counsel submitted in closing), or negates the Counterclaimants’ case that the Claimants intended to and did deploy the repo arrangements and the likelihood of default as the means of taking his companies and their enterprise value for nothing and pocketing as proceeds all but the (allegedly) derisory sums achieved on the sale of assets and applied in diminution of the loans. </p>

In such cases, a repo sale of the real estate may be used as security in addition to the pledge of shares. In the present case, the usual arrangement was turned ‘upside down’: in addition to the registered pledges of real estate (which are considered the most reliable form of loan security), the Bank required a repo of the shareholding of the companies which held that real estate.

To quote the Claimants’ Closing Submissions: </p>

So it is a very good negative protection. However, with respect to positive protection, ability for the Bank to take over that asset, my conclusion and that of my colleagues was not as robust, because in the end the Bank would probably be able to enforce, to foreclose, but there would be so many hurdles along the way, and the legislation, which dates back to the early 1990s and is somewhat inconsistent, is such that you really rely in many instances on cooperation from the borrower, so that the law says that in certain instances the borrower has to agree valuation, the borrower has to agree certain types of enforcement, and if you are in court then the borrower may raise all sorts of objections in court some of them may even be frivolous and they could still defer the time when enforcement comes. So it wouldn’t be an unrealistic estimate that the Bank may spend two or three years trying to enforce. Probably they would enforce at the end, but they would lose so much time, and value may have been reduced over time, and certainly they need money now as opposed to money in three years…” </p>

The Bank enrolled the Original Purchasers for legitimate and not nefarious reasons: whereas much larger banks, such as Sberbank or VTB, had their own investment houses, such as Sberbank Capital or VTB Capital, that was not the case for the Bank, which did not have the capital resources to establish subsidiaries to acquire toxic assets onto its balance sheet but could not in regulatory capital terms take them onto its own books. Mr Turetsky did not consider the arrangements to be particularly unusual, and to be a practical necessity in the context of the shares not being listed securities. As to the latter, he explained that under Russian Central Bank rules, the bank could not take unlisted shares onto its books as being held under a repo, since there was no market for them and no ability to ‘mark to market’. The Bank would have had to take in the shares as its own absolute property: but would have then to make provision accordingly.

Mr Turetsky admitted that he had no personal involvement in such a case; but he instanced at least one other case in which it had been done, and another three where it probably was done, and commended the “logic” of having both forms of security, especially in the crisis conditions at the end of 2008. Professor Guriev considered that “a further registered pledge of real estate would be a more reliable form of additional security”; but he did not contradict the logic of ensuring the means of securing control of the company providing that security.

What they have in reality come up with is an elaborate document which contains three parts, which is the original sale agreement, then the preliminary agreement to agree on a reverse sale, and then they attach to it the actual instrument of transfer for the eventual sale back.  </p>

Even if (and the evidence was scant) the Bank had little or no expectation of surplus, notwithstanding the considerable margin of pledged assets over indebtedness according to the Lair valuations, I find it difficult to accept that the Bank simply gave no thought as to where any surplus would go: there is no suggestion in the evidence that as at December 2008 or until mid-2009 it had serious doubts about the Lair valuations, although it is fair to suppose that the general economic conditions would have justified the supposition of material erosion. I suppose it is possible (as Mr Birt seemed to me to be suggesting) that its focus on stymieing manoeuvring by the borrower blinded it to the true effect of the arrangements: but that seems to me as a general matter unlikely, and the more so on my particular view of the Bank and its personnel. </p>

This suggestion was not supported by any evidence of usual practice; and it was contrary to the Bank’s own witness Mr Turetsky’s evidence, who was quoted in paragraph 412(4) of the Claimants’ written Closing Submissions as stating that “in any repo transaction if a borrower were to default on payment when due, then he lost the rights to buy back the shares.”  </p>

I have also borne in mind the use ultimately made of the curiosities. But I do not consider any of these justify a finding that the repo arrangements were contrived ab initio to implement a ‘raid’. In my judgment, none of that is enough, of itself or in combination, to warrant an inference that when the Bank initially agreed the repo arrangements with Dr Arkhangelsky and put them in place it did so with the intention of later stealing the Group’s assets. The arrangements were harsh; and they did confer the keys to Dr Arkhangelsky’s companies on default. But the Bank was entitled to drive a hard bargain; and the arrangements are consistent with the Bank wanting to avoid facing the delaying tactics of a recalcitrant borrower. The Counterclaimants’ expert, Professor Guriev, acknowledged that the value of collateral is in substantial part a function of the ability to control its disposition, and that upon default a creditor bank’s main job is to “assure the control over the collateral” (as he put it in his report). Indeed, although he avoided giving a direct answer, when it was put to him that it was plainly a legitimate aim and advantage for a creditor bank to seek ways of vesting control of collateral in the event of default in friendly hands, Professor Guriev offered no cogent basis for denying it.  </p>

In any enforcement process, it wanted to face a friendly counterparty rather than a borrower who had declared war on the bank.” </p>

That, they contend, was a breach of the moratorium, and part of a pre-calculated scheme intended to enable the Bank to use almost inevitable default on the PetroLes and Vyborg loans to undo all its other commitments to extend the other loans by working a cross-default.</p>

According to all of them, the decision of the BKK at least was only (a) to extend the First PetroLes Loan from 5 March to 26 March to coincide with the repayment date of the Second PetroLes Loan, and (b) to enable the request to extend both loans to be referred to the Management Board and for it to have time to consider the position. They all ascribed the inconsistency between the wording and their evidence as to the true decisions as being down to “typos”, a “sort of misunderstanding” (according to Mr Belykh) or (according to both Mr Guz and Ms Volodina) a “technical mistake, most likely”.

Put another way, they question why at a time of financial crisis post-2008 and severely reduced asset values, a bank would, if truly acting as a lender seeking full recovery and with no other perspective or ulterior objective, press so hard and move so quickly to cross-default and the negation of arrangements justified as being to enhance further its security made a mere few months before.</p>

Indeed, I suspect that all the Bank had by then set its sights on was realization of its security in an auction process beyond challenge by Dr Arkhangelsky, abiding by the letter of the process required by law, but not taking any steps to seek to further the interests of OMG and the Arkhangelskys.

That was the main logic behind it. We never had an issue about how we're going to manage Western Terminal or how we're going to manage an insurance company. We didn't even discuss that.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Although Dr Arkhangelsky’s determination to protect what he saw as his assets and his companies from the effect of what, in retrospect, he recognised had been a disastrous deal is understandable, the basis on which proceedings were brought on his behalf, and indeed were initially successful in the Russian courts, was thoroughly curious. Mr Sklyarevsky described them as having been an “elegant solution” designed by Dr Arkhangelsky’s lawyers to “trick” the Russian courts. But even more extraordinarily, it was a trick in which Mrs Malysheva played along: see below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.71in;margin-right:0.03in">First, Mrs Arkhangelskaya’s claims relied on the proposition that Dr Arkhangelsky had acted without her knowledge and in bad faith against the interests of OMGP and herself in executing the sale and purchase agreement (being in fact just one side of the repo arrangements) at a price (RUB 9,900) “knowingly” lower than the purchase price of the shares (stated in the proceedings to be RUB 1.069 million) in order to conceal a ‘gift’.  The artificiality is obvious, and brought home by the fact that Dr and Mrs Arkhangelsky had the same lawyer (Mr Erokhin) and OMGP was represented by a Mrs Abarina, also one of Dr Arkhangelsky’s lawyers. Dr Arkhangelsky, in the course of his cross-examination, told me that this had given rise to rumours of their impending divorce, which he affected to find “quite a funny development”; but this struck a rather discordant note. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.71in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, and just as extraordinarily, neither side appears (at any point, including appeals) to have relied on the repurchase side of the arrangements, and none of the court decisions appear to have considered the repurchase obligation to be relevant or perhaps even admissible. Although Mr Sklyarevsky told me in the course of his cross-examination that Mr Erokhin did in fact refer the judge to the repurchase documents, his understanding was that they “are not legal documents under Russian law, and they were not accepted by the court.” This apparent exclusion of the repurchase side of the repo arrangements to some extent suited Mrs Arkhangelskaya, whose case on ‘gift’ was assisted if there was no right of repurchase; but it is remarkable that the Bank based its defence, not on the fact of the repurchase agreement and the alleged fairness of the arrangements when viewed as a whole, but on the contention (apparently dictated by Mrs Malysheva) that the transaction was purely one of absolute sale and that the price of just under RUB 10,000 was itself fair.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.71in;margin-right:0.03in">Having lost at first instance and on appeal, the Claimants did eventually succeed on final appeal; but the grounds are notable: being (a) that as there was no clause in the repo arrangements which conveyed the “obvious intention to give property as a gift” it could not be construed as a gift of a “fictitious deal” even if the price was hopelessly inadequate; and further (b) that “underestimation of the price” “was wrongly judged by the courts as abuse of right”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.71in;margin-right:0.03in">By contrast, the determination of the Bank to demonstrate that the nominal purchase price that had been ascribed to the shares on the basis of the repurchase side was in fact the full market price in an absolute sale which Dr Arkhangelsky had decided upon is open to various interpretations. It might be explicable most straightforwardly on the basis that the apparent ruling of the Russian courts that the repurchase side of the arrangements was excluded from consideration left the Bank with no choice but to uphold the sale side. A more Machiavellian explanation would be that (a) the Bank was uneasy about the repo arrangements as a whole; and/or (b) the Bank had other objectives in seeking to establish the nominal price as the real price and the sale as an absolute one (with there being nothing equivalent or analogous to an equity of redemption or right of repurchase). </p>

This would have provided Renord-lnvest with an income stream to cover the expenses of maintaining Western Terminal, such as utilities, salaries and other sundry items. Renord-lnvest was otherwise covering these expenses from its own account and making a loss. The Bank's approval would have been required for any lease that Western Terminal gave of the pledged property, which was anticipated might be a lengthy process. As a result, in order to put Western Terminal in a position where it could enter into such a short-term lease at short notice, it put in place a mechanism effectively to get a general approval from the Bank in advance - that mechanism was the granting of a long-term head-lease by Western Terminal to Gunard (to which the Bank would give its approval), with the intention being that Gunard could then sublet on short notice and for short periods if any sub-lessee could be found (without having to go back to the bank for further approvals). If any purchaser was found for the assets, the Gunard lease would have been immediately terminated by consent (as Renord-lnvest was effectively the party on both sides of the lease) and under Russian law this would also have automatically led to the termination of the sub-lease, so the term of the lease was not important.” </p>

For her, the conditions for the lease were not important in the contract.  The main task of Malysheva, as I said before, was the control.  To her, it was important to control this plot of land, and at the start of June, we lost the first instance to Mr Arkhangelsky in the courts in relation to the Julia Arkhangelskaya claim, and the Bank was very sceptical about our chances of winning, you see. </p>

Therefore, the lease agreement was discussed as an additional -- some form of an additional insurance mechanism in case we were to lose in courts in interest. </p>

The presentation of Sevzapalians as having obtained its interest by absolute purchase and that its status as a shareholder was permanent and absolute was plainly intended to contradict Dr Arkhangelsky’s position that the repo sale was always subject to the repurchase rights and to good faith commitments not to interfere in the underlying business in the meantime, and to support the allegation that Dr Arkhangelsky cannot have thought that OMGP had any interest such as he maintained. </p>

His suggestion that because the legal entities concerned were “of no interest” he considered that he could be careless to the point of giving a version of events in a sworn statement in support of a criminal prosecution that either he did not believe to be true, or had no basis for thinking it was true, is unacceptable, and the more so given that in fact he knew all about the entities concerned. His apology for his “confusion” suggested to me that he had still not faced up to the seriousness of giving false evidence on the basis of which another person might be convicted of a crime. </p>

When it was put to her that her evidence was concocted on the say-so of her superiors, she cried. Although the experience was no doubt distressing for her, and the later mockery of it (and her) by Dr Arkhangelsky in habitually and sarcastically referring to Ms Stalevskaya as the “funny crying witness” was inappropriate and regrettable, I formed the clear impression that Ms Stalevskaya knew that she had towed a party line which she knew at the time to be false, and was remorseful.  </p>

Mrs Yatvetsky’s description of the position in relation to the 50% shareholding (held until 2011) of Mr Kalinin (Renord-Invest’s financial director) in SKIF provides an example. The following extract from her cross-examination illustrates this: </p>

Linair was a shareholder of Nevskaya Management Company. Mrs Yatvetsky insisted that through her work as a lawyer for Nevskaya Management Company, she knew “for sure that they held these shares personally in their own interests as individuals, this was their own separate business, which had nothing to do with the Bank”; but this did not, in my view, carry conviction. Mrs Yatvetsky’s evidence was that Linair was “simply a participant in Nevskaya Management Company” and “most likely” had no business other than holding shares in that company. Both that and the identity of its shareholders and Director-General suggest to me strongly that Linair was another of the ‘floating’ companies, and probably subject to the ultimate control of the Bank. </p>

As Ms Stalevskaya stressed, the “Belonging” column is no longer filled starting from page 3. She said that was because all companies were the Bank’s clients and therefore receive finance from the Bank. Mr Stroilov submitted that the truth probably is that the purpose of the table was to record information on companies controlled by the Bank via nominees, and those which do not belong to the Bank would not be there. Where the “Belonging” column is filled, each company is either owned or co-owned by the Bank, signifying either the entity or, in accordance with Mr Savelyev’s use of that term, Mr Savelyev and “top management”.  </p>

But I do accept the Counterclaimants’ description of the Renord Group as “a store of SPVs at the Bank’s disposal”. The question now is more limited: that is, whether in relation to the arrangements, their implementation, and the subsequent steps taken to obtain control of Dr Arkhangelsky’s companies and sell their assets, the Bank and/or Mr Savelyev called the shots. </p>

The multiplicity of their connections, without any other substantive explanation, seems to me to demonstrate that they did, as the Counterclaimants contended, serve as nominees for the Bank and/or Mr Savelyev and his close associates and were accustomed to act subject to the instructions of the management of the Bank, and ultimately of Mr Savelyev, when their interests were concerned and they or he thought it appropriate to give them. That is not irrelevant, as the Claimants would have it. On the contrary, it is of interest and relevance because it seems to me to chime with the conclusion that the true relationships of importance in the context of the Bank, Renord Group and SKIF were personal rather than structural.  </p>

In my view, the likelihood is that the shareholdings were spread about various entities to avoid having to disclose holdings of more than 20%.  </p>

Ms Mironova was only required to pay €2 million for a 9.4% interest in the Bank in 2014 (implicitly valuing the entire Bank at between €20 and 25 million). She was, moreover, permitted to pay by way of a promissory note issued for a period of 15 years and thus given 15 years to pay, with a dividend entitlement in the meantime likely to exceed the purchase price. Ms Mironova could not suggest that these were commercial terms; she simply said “Nevertheless, those were the payment terms”.

Difficult, because (as is also apparent from the inconclusive nature of the draft FTI Report) the Counterclaimants rather rested their case on establishing that Baltic Fuel was part of the Renord Group and the supposition that therefore it was owned by the Claimants; but that supposition is not necessarily justified. As elaborated below, the Counterclaimants though insistent, could provide so little by way of evidence to contradict the Claimants’ contention that the Baltic Fuel Group is nothing to do with them and is ultimately owned by Mr Smirnov and Mr Korneev, even though Mr Smirnov’s witness statement acknowledged that in 2008, 51% of its shares were held by Renord-Invest “both directly and indirectly” and “as of today, Renord-Invest holds a 74.5% share in Baltic Fuel”.   </p>

In particular, Professor Maggs noted that whereas in some areas of Russian law there are formal rules restricting ‘affiliated persons’ (in the context of antimonopoly laws), there is no such rule affecting auction bidders. He referred to a decision of the High Arbitrazh court in NIK-TRAST in which it was held that participants in an auction may be affiliated, and that the law on protection of competition: </p>

However, it may not matter: the NIK-TRAST case seems to me to confirm that whilst the affiliation of two parties may not itself provide grounds to invalidate an auction, it could do so if the relationship is such as in fact to prevent, limit or eliminate competition. I acknowledge Counsel for the Claimants’ complaint that Professor Maggs’s view was not expressly challenged in cross-examination: but the difference between the experts in this regard was clear and crystallised, and in any event I should not adopt an opinion which I consider wrong. </p>

He referred to various cases on “pretence of corporate form”, including what he called the Keystone case, where a construction company, Keystone, defaulted on a loan to Sberbank and in order to avoid recovery, transferred its assets to a creature called K-Stone owned by the same shareholders. He noted that the court had refused to respect the corporate form as being an “abuse of right” and set aside the transfer.

I do not reject their evidence entirely: it is plausible, and seems to me to be likely, that at least some approach would have been made to North Shipbuilding Company, which owned the site adjacent to Western Terminal and for whom the site is likely to have had some synergistic value. But both the vagueness of the oral evidence and the lack of documentary support (in circumstances where the Bank might be expected to be careful to keep a record) leads me to conclude that any approaches to third party purchasers were at most preliminary, designed to test the waters, and never pursued with any sustained effort directed towards a private sale or encouraging a bid.  </p>

In paragraph [1066] above I left for consideration until this section of this judgment whether a further objective and effect was to reduce the utility and attractiveness of the Western Terminal assets to anyone outside the Renord Group so as to dampen or even destroy any third-party interest at the auctions for their sale (which of course the Claimants deny).  </p>

This, at its foot in a note which is handwritten, expressly draws attention to the need to take into account “the risks…that are associated with reducing the auction sale price due to the encumbrance in the form of long-term lease”.

According to her (as appears from my summary of her evidence above), and though it is now confusingly denied by the Claimants, the purpose was indeed to subject the Western Terminal assets to an encumbrance calculated to prevent Dr Arkhangelsky re-establishing control if he should succeed in the Russian courts in setting aside the repo arrangements, and to impede and deter third party creditors from looking to Western Terminal assets for enforcement in competition with the Bank and/or RenordInvest.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">The gist of the Counterclaimants’ case was that, in permitting the auctions to proceed as they did without apparently raising any objections, the relevant auction organisers can only have either abdicated or accepted dictation. The Counterclaimants relied on inferences to be drawn, so they submitted, from the antecedents to the auction (for example, in the case of the Western Terminal assets, the ‘sham’ and collusive proceedings and settlement agreement) resulting in (amongst other consequences) low initial and reserve prices in comparison to the stated pledge valuations; from the absence of third parties and competitive bidding and the low values achieved; and (perhaps most importantly) from the absence of any evidence that any of the auction organisers ever queried or tested any of these oddities or curiosities.  </p>

The prices were established by or by reference to apparently reputable valuers; and in the case, for example, of the Western Terminal assets, which are the prime focus in this context, it has been seen above that they were blessed by the Russian court. It was not for the auction organisers to gainsay the values thus established: their role was to run an auction on the basis of the valuations, not query whether they were correct. </p>

The Onega Terminal assets undoubtedly had special synergy value for it. Indeed, ROK No. 1 Prichaly was probably the only realistic buyer of the land at Onega Terminal.  </p>

The value also included leasing rights for the land plot. Over a year he privatised the land plot on which the workshop building was standing. Given the prices for privatisation at that point in time, I think his expenditure was no more than a million roubles. Therefore, the purchase price for Mr Arkhangelsky was 3 million roubles altogether. He acquired this for the books of his -- for the balance of his company called SKIF. Later when he privatised the land plot, he sold these very same assets to another one of his companies for 43 million roubles.

Although the Counterclaimants assert that this was a “gross undervalue”, the Claimants make the point that the contract for Scan’s purchase of the Onega Terminal land in 2005 gave a purchase price of RUB 102.556 million. There was some investment made between 2005 and 2009, as Mrs Yatvetsky acknowledged (“tarmac or asphalt was laid down or something like that”); but not of such extent or value as to destroy the comparison.

In order to infer fraud, what the defendants would have to show is that there is no explanation for the sale price other than the sale was a dishonest one. It is no good showing that there is a range of honest valuations but that Ms Simonova is obviously right and Mr Millard is obviously wrong. That’s not good enough for fraud.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, my earlier conclusions make the valuation exercise largely, if not completely, superfluous. The Counterclaimants’ resort to the expert evidence of value to establish a factual conclusion of impropriety and conspiracy involves a circularity and the assumption of a functioning market in, and demand for, the auctioned assets which the auction process otherwise appears to have demonstrated not to exist. In the real world, market value is the product of demand: no demand, no market value. The fact that not a single third party attended any of the auctions appears to demonstrate that there was no demand; and to argue (as the Counterclaimants argue) that the true market value of the assets demonstrates that the absence of third parties is evidence of fraud is to argue in a circle. I cannot accept the Counterclaimants’ approach or their argument: having held that the auctions were not improperly conducted, and that ultimately the factual evidence provides no basis for any other conclusion than that the reason for there being no third parties bidders was because there was no real and sustained demand for the relevant assets, I cannot think it right, and I do not propose, to reverse engineer a different conclusion on the basis of a necessarily theoretical value analysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, the conclusion that there was no properly functioning market for assets of the relevant nature, which defeats the theoretical exercise based on the assumption that there was, is not as surprising in the particular circumstances in Russia in the wake of the credit crunch and collapse in asset (and especially real estate) values from and after September 2008 as usually it would be. Ms Simonova tended, in my perception, to dismiss the notion of such a serious collapse in market values as Mr Millard considered had occurred as inherently too unlikely to be given credence. It is this which in large part explains the extreme variations between them. But the result is that Ms Simonova’s valuations do not to my mind engage sufficiently or at all with the market reality; her reports have been devalued accordingly, and I have been left with a chasm too deep and broad to reach any secure conclusion. </p>

Both were dogged to the point of obstinacy in adhering to their chosen valuation approach and seemed unwilling to explore alternatives even for the purpose of elucidation: Mr Millard’s refusal to contemplate valuing Western Terminal by reference to the profit earning potential which ownership of the land might unlock being an example in his case; and Ms Simonova’s insistence, when confronted with the fact that land she had valued at some US$ 2.848 million as at May 2015 had been on the market for almost a year at a suggested sale price of approximately US$ 36,000 without attracting a buyer, that “No way I will alter my appraisal…” being an example in hers.  </p>

As a technique, the DCF method should not be judged on the basis of whether or not the specific DCF expectation was ultimately realized but rather on the degree of market support for the DCF expectation at the time it was undertaken. When the purpose of the valuation requires market value it is therefore important that the inputs into the DCF model are based on market evidence or reflect common market sentiment. If criteria specified by a particular owner or prospective owner is to used it should be compared with market evidence and expectations. If it differs then it can only be used for giving an indication of investment value, not market value.” </p>

Furthermore, the final draft IM’s 500,000 TEU figure was based on the development of Western Terminal in three stages, involving capital expenditure of US$220 million and including critically the construction of a third berth: but Ms Simonova assumed full capacity with only two stages of development, capital expenditure of US$ 104.5 million, and no construction of a third berth.

That would be equivalent to 15% of the total activity in the Big Port of St Petersburg, generated from a land site that was only 1.5% of the total area of the Big Port of St Petersburg. By way of comparison, the largest operator in the Big Port, CSJC First Container Terminal, occupied a 74 hectare space and produced a turnover of 1,000,000 TEUs per annum. As a reality check, in 2014 Global Ports, the largest operator of berths and porting facilities in Russia, had throughput at its First Container Terminal in St Petersburg of 1.25 million TEUs per annum.

She acknowledged that tariffs at Ust-Luga were 30% to 40% lower than at the Big Port of St Petersburg, but suggested “UstLuga has a significant drawback in that it requires an additional 150 kilometres of road transportation”. But Ust-Luga would have been a significant competitor to any developed Western Terminal. Ust-Luga’s location provided it with direct access to the transportation network which gave it a distinct advantage over a port located by the city centre. There is force in the Claimants’ submission that given its significantly lower tariffs, Ust-Luga would have exerted downward pressure on the charges at Western Terminal.  </p>

More generally, she asserted that a sensitivity analysis would not be required in 95% of cases. I cannot accept this.

Particularly in a volatile and uncertain market, where the potentiality and value of land may be greatly affected by changing market perceptions and assumptions, I agree with the Claimants that it is difficult to consider a DCF model robust and reliable if a sensitivity analysis has not been conducted. An immediately obvious example is that Ms Simonova performed no sensitivity analysis on the effect of a reduction in tariffs, nor on the effect of increased storage times leading to lower throughput. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">The Claimants’ expert offered a further telling example of how relatively small changes in assumptions can entirely alter the DCF modelling, based on a comparison of EBITDA figures for Global Ports (the operator of the First Container Terminal at Big Port of St Petersburg, and the Port of Brisbane). He explained that if the EBITDA of Global Ports is compared with Ms Simonova’s projected EBITDA of Western Terminal, then (without making any other adjustments to Ms Simonova’s model) the terminal value of Western Terminal would be just over US$ 100 million (a value less than the capital expenditure needed to create it), and its net present value would be US$ 40.58 million. This sense-check (and it did not purport to be anything more than a sensecheck) shows just how sensitive is Ms Simonova’s DCF valuation.  </p>

There is, in my view, some substance in the Claimants’ further criticism of Ms Simonova that she tended to blur the two, and her valuation failed to make a sufficiently clear apportionment between the value of the land and the value of the business. A confusion in her mind between the two was revealed in the following exchange in the course of her cross-examination: </p>

Yes there is.  I've used a premium of 100 per cent.  Is that right?  It's not easy, it's not a science, and I can't say: yes, that's exactly the right number, but experience suggests that that's probably broadly right where you are using as a baseline something which is for the same use and very close by, albeit that it is 500 metres or 300 metres from the berth rather than 10 metres.  Clearly it is better to be close, and hence the application of the uplift.

But this did not appear to me to address the point that existing competitors offer more for the same amount. It was (in her words) “taken from the other Ro-Ro terminals in the Big Port of St Petersburg” but it took no account of the uncontradicted evidence of Mr Popov that the charge ordinarily includes transhipment, in-port movement and storage charges amounting to 30% of the total. Onega Terminal’s infrastructure constraints would mean it was unable to provide that full service within the single charge.

Cross-examination in detail of both experts did not really assist in the determination of these basic, ultimately factual, issues. Mr Millard was insistent but his certainty was not convincing; Ms Simonova was apt to descend to unsubstantiated and sometimes shrill assertion, and her complete lack of experience in sales made acceptance of her somewhat idiosyncratically expressed views all the more difficult.  </p>

Mrs Yatvetsky believed that Dr Arkhangelsky had bought the land for RUB 700,000. However, in Scan’s accounts, as at 31 December 2007, at the peak of the market, the land was given a ‘fair value’ of US$ 414,000. </p>

The way that the assets at Western Terminal and at Onega Terminal were packaged for sale and the sequence in which they were sold does not seem likely to encourage third party interest nor to maximise the amounts applicable in reduction of indebtedness. The Counterclaimants’ fundamental allegation that this was a stratagem designed to reduce the amounts realised for payment down of indebtedness whilst maximising the benefit for the Claimants and their associates has throughout the case struck me as plausible. However, in the end I have concluded that the Bank being entitled to sell assets separately pledged separately, the justifications advanced by the Claimants for the packaging and process of sale are not so implausible that they must be rejected, bearing in mind the heavy onus of proof in the context of an assertion of dishonesty.</p>

Indeed, as Mr Milner pointed out, they clearly considered that the reliance test in Tinsley was capable of operating too harshly by barring deserving claims without justification (see Lord Toulson’s judgment at [24]).

Where there is no or no substantial connection between the illegality and the claim, and when the illegal conduct cannot be said to have caused or given rise to the loss, recovery should not be denied by reason of the illegality. Here, the bribery at issue in this case is not clearly or closely linked to the Counterclaim, nor is it in any sense a legally effective cause of the Counterclaimants’ loss. On the contrary, it plays no part in the Counterclaim at all and only emerged as a fact adventitiously in the course of Mr Arkhangelsky’s evidence. It would be a misuse of language to describe the Counterclaim as being somehow “founded” on bribery: the antecedent illegality is merely collateral to the claim and thus irrelevant. </p>

The possible illegality involved in the apportionment of the price in the contract is wholly unconnected with their cause of action. The plaintiffs' loss caused by the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentation would have been the same, even if the contract had not contained this illegal element. Their claim for damages is in no way seeking to enforce the contract or any relief in connection with it. The moral culpability of the defendant greatly outweighs any on the part of the plaintiffs. He cannot be allowed to keep the fruits of his fraud. I therefore hold that the ex turpi causa defence fails.” </p>

To apply the ex turpi defence in this situation would also give inappropriate encouragement to defendants to trawl through the detailed background to any given transaction in the hope of uncovering some historic illegality which might conceivably give rise to a defence. That would significantly increase the cost and complexity of a great deal of commercial litigation and generate significant uncertainty. It is important to keep the defence within proper limits, and apply it only in those cases where the illegality is intimately bound up with the claimant’s cause of action, such that to grant the claimant a remedy would render the law incoherent (cf Patel at [99]). That, they submit, is not the case here. </p>

The fact that, as Millett LJ (as he then was) noted in Tribe v Tribe [1996] Ch 107, 135 the ex turpi causa rule is “not a principle of justice but a principle of policy” adds to the anxiety, since the exercise of discretion as to policy is not a customary role for a judge; and in this predicament, I find resonance, but not solace, in Lord Sumption’s observation at [262] that: </p>

To warrant the Court “drawing up its skirts and refusing all assistance” (in the words of Bingham LJ (as he then was) in Saunders v Edwards [supra]) the illegal conduct would, to my mind, have to be not only serious but also central: the springboard for the claim sought to be pursued. </p>

First, whereas making good the company will restore the shareholder, the converse is not true. Secondly, the protection of the interests of creditors requires that it be the company which is permitted to recover to the exclusion of the shareholder. Thirdly, it is an incident of the bundle of rights which a share represents that damage to the adventure in which the shareholder has subscribed should be recovered not personally but by the corporate entity undertaking the adventure, subject only to the exception of a derivative action. </p>

I took Mr Birt to accept this in his closing submissions in reply, though he understandably (and in my view, correctly) made the point that whether there was a claim for dispossession depended on whether the repo arrangements are wrongful. Other aspects of the Counterclaim relating to Western Terminal depend, by contrast, on demonstrating impropriety in respect of the sale of Western Terminal assets: those aspects may fall within the rule (and the second part of my assessment below). </p>

In my view, a strict application of the rule in the circumstances of this case would be unlikely for two main reasons. First, in all the circumstances there is no practical risk of double recovery: there is no realistic prospect of any of the relevant companies seeking recovery on the basis that their assets were undersold; and since the Counterclaimants no longer have shares any derivative process would not assist them. Secondly, I consider it likely that policy would favour not foreclosing a claim, since (it was common ground) the right to compensation for demonstrated loss suffered in consequence of harm done is a fundamental one under Russian civil law, including Article 1064. </p>

Even if I am wrong in my assessment under part 2 above, I consider that it would be wrong for the rule against reflective loss to be applied to prevent such set-off if the claims can be established. For in that context, the loss is not reflective: it is a defence in respect of a separate contractual engagement. Furthermore, up to the amount of their guarantee liability, and on their case, the Counterclaimants simply seek to prevent the Claimants obtaining a double benefit: procuring sales of assets for less than their true value to entities they control whilst thereby decreasing the amounts to be treated as reducing the guarantee liability and increasing the nominal value of claims under the guarantees. </p>

At the relevant times, there were annual instructions issued by the insurance regulator, Rosstrakhnadzor, as to the size of insurance companies’ (a) charter capital and (b) insurance reserves; and in what form that capital had to be kept. It is likely, and consistent with my recollection, that under the rules then in force (a) real estate was the most sensible asset to form the charter capital (this is why Scan had to own part of the Onega Terminal) and (b) insurance reserves had to be in liquid assets, and invested through some kind of investment broker or placement broker. I therefore conjecture that City Centre may have been an investment broker or placement broker, engaged by Scan to invest its insurance reserves. It is also possible that Petroles and LPK Scandinavia also used the services of City Centre as an investment/placement broker.

Moreover, if City-Centre was a “professional player in the financial markets” and/or somehow used by Scan as part of its compliance with insurance requirements, then both Mr Popov and Mr Steadman would have been able to track down City-Centre.

Dr Arkhangelsky denied that it was he who stamped the documents, and his case was that he had no access to the seal after he fled to France in June 2009. I have decided not to seek to resolve that issue; but the question arises as to how, if he had no access to the seal, he was able to provide to this Court, as evidence of OMGP’s authorisation of its participation in these proceedings, two letters apparently bearing OMGP seals – one dated 12 September 2013 and the other dated 31 December 2015.  </p>

They stress the enormous expense to the Bank and Mr Savelyev, both of time and money, in being forced to defend themselves against a barrage of untruths (in and out of Court).  They suggest that Mr Savelyev has been the target of particular and personal opprobrium, and should be entitled to public exoneration by way of declaration to dispel any lingering suspicion or doubts as to his honesty and reliability. </p>

As indicated above, the starting point of these submissions is that the Counterclaim has not only not been established (as I have found) but has been pursued dishonestly, knowing there to be no evidential basis for them, to distract and delay the Claimants and to assist in a political campaign and generate public sympathy against them.  </p>

That is so even though I have found Dr Arkhangelsky to have been, in several instances, dishonest. For one of the features of this unusual case is that whilst the main claims are founded and have eventually been established on the basis of Dr Arkhangelsky’s dishonesty, that finding has not of itself much assisted or been relevant in the determination of the Counterclaim, which has been barely concerned with his conduct and has focused almost entirely on the alleged dishonesty of the Claimants and their associates. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Indeed, in considering whether to grant the declarations sought, I think it is relevant that I have, throughout the case, before, during and after the hearing, harboured a nagging and discomfiting feeling that the evidence by which alone the case is to be decided may not have revealed the whole truth; and that the very different conditions in Russia may mean that what seems improbable, or at least not probable, looked at through the lens of a different jurisdiction accustomed to different conditions, may yet have occurred. The Counterclaim always faced the difficulty that it relied on proof of the inherently improbable, and a burden of proof that could only be discharged by showing the facts to be incapable of innocent explanation such as to give rise to the inference of the conspiracy or conspiracies pleaded. The Court can only see through a glass darkly: it can only proceed on the basis of the evidence available to be put before it and determine, either on the basis of findings of fact which it is satisfied are justified by reference to such evidence on the balance of probabilities or, to the extent that it is not satisfied, by reference to where the burden of proof lies. As Lord Hoffmann explained in In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) [2008] UKHL 35; [2009] AC 11 at para. 2, the Court’s approach on the evidence is binary:  </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened.  The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.” </p>
