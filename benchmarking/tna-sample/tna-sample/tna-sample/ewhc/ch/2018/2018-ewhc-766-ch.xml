	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first claim is brought by Ms. Julie Anne Davey (“Ms. Davey”) who is the sole shareholder, and was, at the relevant times, the sole director of AHDL.  She was also the guarantor of its indebtedness to Dunbar Assets plc (“Dunbar”) to the extent of £1.6 million, plus interest and costs.  Ms. Davey brings the claim pursuant to paragraph 75 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 which empowers the court to inquire into potential misfeasance by an administrator at the behest of a creditor or contributory.  Ms. Davey seeks the award of compensation to AHDL against Mr. James Money (“Mr. Money”) and Mr. Jim Stewart-Koster, who were at the relevant time the joint administrators of the Company (“the Administrators”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In essence, Ms Davey alleges that the Administrators breached their duties as administrators of AHDL by conducting a “light touch” administration in which they failed to exercise independent judgment and instead paid excessive regard to the interests and wishes of Dunbar which had appointed them; that they failed to take steps to involve Ms. Davey in the administration that would have led to the rescue and survival of AHDL; and that they sold the main asset of AHDL, a commercial office property known as Angel House, 225 Marsh Wall, Docklands, London E14 (“Angel House”) at a significant undervalue in reliance on unsuitable agents, Alliance Property Asset Management Limited (“APAM”), whom Dunbar had in effect chosen for them to use.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second claim is a claim by Dunbar against Ms. Davey to recover enforcement costs allegedly incurred by it under Ms. Davey’s personal guarantee. That claim is the subject of a defence and counterclaim by Ms. Davey, who took an assignment from the liquidator of AHDL’s claims against Dunbar in relation to the sale of Angel House.  The counterclaim alleges (i) that Dunbar so directed or interfered in the conduct of the administration as to make the Administrators its agents, and that it was therefore liable for their breaches of duty, (ii) that Dunbar procured the breaches of duty by the Administrators, and/or (iii) that Dunbar conspired with APAM to cause AHDL and/or Ms. Davey loss by unlawful means, namely by deliberately causing the Administrators to carry out a limited sale process for Angel House so as to realise insufficient monies to enable the secured indebtedness to Dunbar to be repaid, leaving AHDL liable for the balance and Ms. Davey liable on her personal guarantee. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms. Davey is generally known as Julia Davey.  She was born in 1959 and grew up in Leeds as one of a family of 15 children.  She became involved in the property industry in the London Docklands in the early 1990s and in about 1997 she negotiated a contract with Kent County Council to house asylum seekers.  In the late 1990s Ms. Davey moved back to Leeds and in October 2000 she incorporated Angel Group Limited (“AGL”).  That company began to let properties to the Home Office to house asylum seekers, and it obtained a substantial contract to provide such accommodation to the UK Border Agency in about 2005-6.  The group headed by AGL grew into a substantial business.  By 2007 it employed several hundred staff and owned a wide range of properties.  Ms. Davey remained its owner and controller.  The headquarters of the group was at Angel House, a four storey office block that had been built in the early 1990s.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms. Davey’s witness statements served prior to the trial were very lengthy and contained a substantial amount of inadmissible and irrelevant opinion, submission, speculation and innuendo.  I required them to be edited before Ms. Davey gave evidence, but they retained some of their earlier character, alleging a conspiracy between Dunbar and APAM and exhibiting a sense of indignation that Ms. Davey had lost control of her companies and had been pursued by Dunbar on her personal guarantee.  Compared to the forthright tone of her witness statements, I thought that Ms. Davey deliberately kept herself in check and exercised restraint giving evidence and being cross-examined in the witness box.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There were aspects of Ms. Davey’s evidence that did not ring true.  One example was her evidence in relation to her understanding of the basis for the value placed upon Angel House in the accounts of AHDL at the time she acquired the Company from AGL in 2011.  Another related to her knowledge and involvement in the business of AHDL, and in particular the assertion that she was wholly unaware of the actions of AHDL’s general manager, Mr. Jack French in making a proposal for a joint venture to Dunbar in the period prior to the Company going into administration.  I also consider that she was rather evasive and vague about her sources of funding during the administration, and inconsistent in her evidence as to the merits of the 2012 planning application for Angel House.  Ms. Davey’s perspective of events was also (and perhaps inevitably) suffused with her view of the merits of her own case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Subject to those qualifications, I consider that Ms. Davey generally tried to give accurate evidence.  In the end, however, largely because she was not directly involved in the administration for much of 2013, much of Ms. Davey’s evidence turned out to be of little relevance to the issues that I had to decide concerning the conduct of Dunbar and the Administrators.   </p>

I thought, in particular, that he was deliberately evasive and vague about the exact nature of his role and working relationship with Mr. French and about Ms. Davey’s involvement and knowledge of events at Angel House.  In the end, very little of Mr. Kurash’s evidence was relevant or of assistance.</p>

However, it contained very little detail.  A much longer witness statement from Mr. Eastwood was served after opening submissions had been exchanged and shortly before the start of the trial.  I adjourned an application by Ms. Davey to adduce that second witness statement to give Mr. Eastwood the opportunity to produce some of the relevant documents to which he referred in the statement.  However, no such documents were produced, and in spite of the trial timetable being adjusted to accommodate Mr. Eastwood, shortly before he was due to give evidence I was informed that he had decided to travel to the US.

Mr. Wolfenden was also rather inaccurate and at times (for example in relation to his use of comparables) his evidence as to his method and sources was very vague.  Moreover, as I shall explain later in this judgment, some of his critical opinions, for example as to the price per square foot (psf) that might be achieved for sale of completed residential flats after redevelopment of Angel House, seemed to be entirely subjective and not supported by adequate objective evidence or explanation.  As I shall explain, he also made a significant error in his report in this regard which he then sought to justify on other grounds.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After acquiring Angel House, AHDL worked to develop a planning application to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (“the Council”) for the redevelopment of Angel House from its existing use as an office building into a residential tower with hotel, office and retail space.  The first planning application made by AHDL in respect of Angel House was submitted on 12 September 2008 and sought permission for a 43 storey tower with 11 storey podium comprising 265 residential units, a 56 bedroom hotel, office and retail space and associated parking at basement level.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to any such proposal in Tower Hamlets, a key issue for the Council’s planning committee was the extent to which the plan included a proposal to provide affordable housing.  For developers, this presented a problem, because the greater the proportion of affordable housing, the less financially attractive the development would be.  In the case of Angel House, after the 2008 application had been submitted, AHDL learnt from discussions with the Council’s planning officers that unless the application included the provision of 35% affordable housing, it stood very little prospect of success in the planning committee.  Ms. Davey then took the view that whilst the application should be reconfigured to provide for 35% affordable housing, if a decision on the application could be delayed, the Council’s committee might see from experience of other applications that this was an unrealistic figure and be prepared to approve an application with a lower affordable housing figure.  Accordingly, she gave instructions that after the proposal had received approval from the Council’s planning officers at 35%, it should be withdrawn before being considered at the planning committee’s meeting in April 2009.  The intention was that it could be resubmitted later in the year as a “free-go” application.</p>

Angel House was shown as an asset in the accounts of AHDL to 30 April 2011 (which were signed by Ms. Davey on 19 April 2012) with a value of £8.5 million.  The result was that the accounts showed that the Company had negative net assets.  The account contained a note to the effect that the directors had used the existing use valuation by Bishop Beamish “as they believe this to equate to market value as at 30 April 2011”.  In cross-examination, Ms. Davey accepted that the market value shown in the 2011 accounts had not included any “hope value”.  Ms. Davey initially said that the decision as to the value shown in the accounts had been taken by the Company’s accountants.  When pressed, however, she accepted that the value had actually come from her own “in-house” accountant, but she then denied having been involved in the decision as to what value to use in the accounts and said this had been a matter for her accountant.  I regret I do not believe that Ms. Davey was being candid at this point.  As an experienced businesswoman, she would have been keenly interested in the price she paid for AHDL and how it could be justified.  In my judgment she must have been well aware of the connection between the value of Angel House shown on the balance sheet of the Company and the fact that she had acquired the shares in the Company for a nominal price.  </p>

This prompted Ms. Davey to agree to execute the promised personal guarantee on the basis that it would be held to her order by Dunbar’s solicitor pending execution of a side letter from Dunbar confirming that if and as long as all interest and other payments due under the facility were paid, and that no event of insolvency had occurred in relation to AHDL or any guarantor, no demand would be made by Dunbar under the personal guarantee.

Various problems were encountered including the approval by the Council of a “Marsh Wall East Masterplan” in early November 2011 and news that another Skylines planning application was to be submitted which would have light and space implications for any proposal to redevelop Angel House.  There were a number of meetings with the Council planning officers, including in particular a pre-application meeting on 17 February 2012 which was followed by a long letter from the Council setting out its expectations of the parameters of any revised application.  The proposal then floated with the Council was for a new mixed use building consisting of ground plus 42 floors with a podium, ground floor retail units, offices, a 120 bedroom hotel and a mix of private and affordable residential units.  In that latter respect, the Council’s letter indicated that at least 35% affordable housing should be included in the residential part of the development.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 22 November 2012, Mr. Stenson produced a memo for Dunbar’s Property Provisioning Panel which referred to the Blenheim Bishop 2010 valuation of £15.375 million and gave the estimated realisable value of Dunbar’s security (i.e. the charge over Angel House and Ms. Davey’s personal guarantee) as £19.8 million net of costs.  The memo stated that Dunbar’s exit strategy was to obtain planning permission and to dispose of the property with the benefit of that permission.  The memo indicated that Ms. Davey’s preference was to bring in a third party to take Dunbar out, but that Dunbar’s preferred exit was by way of a disposal of the property and share of the uplift.  The memo gave a “with planning permission” value for Angel House of £20 million “so as to allow an expedited exit”; and recorded that Ms. Davey thought that the value of the property was £24 million with planning.  The memo also commented,</p>

Mr. Money’s evidence was that he did not recall being told any of the information in the Property Provisioning Panel memo by Mr. Stenson on 22 November 2012, but that he believed that Mr. Stenson told him that Angel House was worth about £8 million without planning permission and in the region of £11 million with planning permission.  Mr. Stenson’s evidence was that he would have given Mr. Money a range of values to base a fee quote upon, but that he could not recall what values he had given and he could not recall conveying any of the information in the provisioning memo to Mr. Money.  In his evidence to me, Mr. Stenson volunteered that he thought that the value ascribed to the property for the purposes of provisioning was a very different exercise from that associated with normal market valuation: he described provisioning as an “accountancy” exercise in which “strong assumptions” could be made (e.g. in relation to an improvement in the market) that would not be reflected in a market valuation.</p>

That prompted Mr. Stenson to seek an urgent meeting with Ms. Davey, which took place at Dunbar’s offices that Friday evening.  At that meeting, which was also attended by Mr. Daniel, Ms. Davey denied that Mr. French had been operating on her instructions when he had suggested a profit share to Dunbar.  The following Monday morning, Mr. Daniel emailed Mr. Stenson to deal with a number of points arising out of the meeting.  In particular he stated that the proposals made by Mr. French had come as a “complete shock” to him and Ms. Davey and he expressed surprise that Mr. Stenson had not sought to check such a proposal with Ms. Davey personally.</p>

Julia is in the process of looking back at the interest paid since inception of the loan and other costs so we can have a more meaningful discussion and also with proper information agree a sensible way forward while planning is delivered. As part of the arrangement, Julia also intends to pursue during the planning period the opportunity for a sale subject to planning whereby the bank's exit can be established. </p>

The draft expressed the opinion that the then outstanding 2012 planning application did not represent the best redevelopment solution because the level of affordable housing (35%) detrimentally affected the estimated development value.

That valuation report concluded that the market value of the property on the basis of the existing leases and use and with no development potential was £6 million; and that if planning permission was obtained in accordance with the existing application, the value would be £8 million.  That higher value was based upon a gross development value of £147 million, a sale price of £846 psf for the private residential units, and an assumption that a developer would look for a profit on cost of 22.5% to reflect the risks attaching to a tower scheme.  </p>

Should the property be marketed with the benefit of the planning permission for the Proposed Scheme then there is a possibility that our opinion of value of £8.0 million could be improved on. In a competitive bidding situation, interested parties could sharpen their assumptions, reducing their profit on cost required and increasing the target sales values. For example, if the profit on cost is reduced to 20% and the private sales valued increased to £887 per sq ft (£9,547 per sq m) then the site value increases to £13.1 million. </p>

Ms. Davey stated that she could not speak to Mr. Sandall but promised to call back.  She did not do so.  Mr. Sandall then called and emailed Mr. Lea requesting the bank account details of the Company, which he said were urgently required because the rents for Angel House were due at the end of December 2012 and the Administrators needed to secure the rental income for the benefit of the administration.  Mr. Lea replied by email, advising that the requests had been passed to Ms. Davey.</p>

She later explained this on the basis that the funds belonged to Angelic Interiors Limited (“AIL”) but had been paid into AHDL’s bank account because AIL’s account had been frozen.  The Administrators were not given the details of AHDL’s bank accounts until 16.35 hrs on Friday 4 January 2013. </p>

However, I do not think that the note supports a conclusion that Ms. Davey was, at that stage, being generally uncooperative with the Administrators, and I reject Mr. Money’s interpretation of it.  The background to the note is that Ms. Davey had not kept her promise to call Mr. Sandall back on 27 December 2012, and she had been unwilling to see the details of AHDL’s bank accounts given to the Administrators before she could arrange for the removal of some funds from the accounts.  But I think that Mr. Sandall was recording a view expressed by Mr. Stenson to him that Ms. Davey would “no<span style="text-decoration:underline">w</span>” cooperate with the Administrators.

Ms. Davey suggested that the planning application would need reviewing in light of this, and asked for some assurance that the Administrators would pay the arrears of fees due to the planning team of some £265,000.  Mr. Sandall made clear that he could not give any such assurance but indicated that a discussion over fees would take place with the planning team.

Mr. Money’s evidence was that neither he, nor any of his colleagues at PKF, had worked with APAM before, and so the meeting was intended to be an initial “get to know you” meeting.  Mr. Money’s evidence in cross-examination was that at this stage he had not seen any of Dunbar’s proposed terms of engagement of APAM, and he only envisaged that APAM would be the property and asset managers for Angel House rather than acting as selling agents.  He therefore did not discuss APAM’s views on the value of Angel House at the meeting.  The meeting lasted for about an hour, and Mr. Money’s evidence was that at the end of the meeting he was satisfied that APAM understood what was required and had the necessary skill, expertise and resources to manage Angel House.  </p>

Further, on 17 January 2013 Mr. Money was sent a copy of APAM’s draft revised fee proposal which followed a similar structure to the earlier proposal – i.e. it contained a suggestion for an Exit Management/Value Enhancement Incentive Fee payable by reference to the sale price of Angel House as well as an Asset Management Fee and a Property Management Fee.</p>

The “with planning” value was given a range of between £8 million and £18.4 million depending on the assumptions made as to sales values per square foot and profits on development costs, but all reflecting what was described as the “punitive” requirement for 35% affordable housing.  Mr. Stenson’s memo acknowledged that these “Red Book” values were lower than those that he had previously indicated within Dunbar of approximately £12 million “as is” and £20 million with planning.  He indicated, however, that the Savills Report had stated that a prospective purchaser might take the view that the level of affordable housing provision could be reduced with the result that a higher offer might be obtained. </p>

The letter also stated that it was envisaged that the Administrators and Dunbar would consider agreeing an alternative fee structure under which APAM would be paid an exit management fee on the sale of Angel House of 2% up to AHDL’s current debt level of £16.7 million and a further “value enhancement incentive fee” of 17.5% of the excess obtained over £16.7 million.  The letter made it clear on a number of occasions that the fees of any third party selling agents would be payable out of APAM’s fees.  </p>

These did not materialise, and so on 22 January 2013 the Administrators repeated the request and set a deadline of 31 January 2013 for compliance.  On 31 January 2013 Ms. Davey signed and sent to the Administrators her statement of affairs for AHDL. This included Angel House at a book value, and an “estimated to realise” value, of £8.5 million.</p>

However, a couple of hours before the scheduled meeting on 1 February 2013 Ms. Davey emailed Mr. Sandall to cancel, saying that she had an earlier meeting that was overrunning and that a “better option” would be for them to meet in the following week.  Ms. Davey then called Mr. Sandall to suggest that she would in fact not be available the following week, and they agreed a date of 12 February 2013 for a face-to-face meeting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Sandall was clearly irritated by being put off by Ms. Davey, and this prompted him to send an email to Ms. Davey (a draft of which had been amended by Mr. Money) expressing disappointment and asking for the provision of further information including details of Ms. Davey’s claim to be a creditor of AHDL in the sum of about £400,000.  Mr. Sandall also stated that on a number of occasions he had asked for information or assistance from staff members at Angel House and had been informed that Ms. Davey had told them not to comply until they had been authorised to do so by her.  His email warned Ms. Davey of the consequences of non-cooperation with the Administrators.</p>

Mr. Sandall then went to Angel House and first met Mr. Daniel, who indicated that Ms. Davey would see him.  When Mr. Sandall was taken to meet Ms. Davey some minutes later, however, she indicated that she was in fact leaving, and a terse exchange ensued which was continued by Mr. Sandall and Mr. Daniel after Ms. Davey had left.  I am not in a position to resolve the dispute over precisely what was said, but it was clearly not an amicable encounter and it led to a forthright exchange of emails between Mr. Daniel on the one hand and Mr. Money and Mr. Sandall on the other.  A number of allegations and insinuations were made by Mr. Daniel against Mr. Sandall and it is very clear that any prospect of a harmonious working relationship between Mr. Daniel and Mr. Sandall thereafter was remote.</p>

However, on 8 February 2013, Dunbar drafted and signed a formal letter to Ms. Davey demanding payment of £1.6 million.  Dunbar also made arrangements with Mr. Money that it should be able to serve the demand on Ms. Davey in person if she attended the meeting with the Administrators on 12 February 2013.  Mr. Money sent a draft agenda to Ms. Davey and sought to verify that she was indeed intending to attend on 12 February 2013, but in response, about two hours before the meeting was due to start, Mr. Daniel emailed to say that Ms. Davey would not be coming and that he would be attending the meeting alone.  </p>

Contact had also been established early in the administration between APAM, the Administrators and the existing team of consultants headed by McBains Cooper.  It was generally understood between those involved that the outstanding fees were in the region of £250,000 and that a further £150,000 or more would be required to take the application through to the planning committee stage.  The initial indications from the Administrators and APAM were that, subject to resolving the issue over fees and funding, they were minded to continue with the existing planning application.  A meeting was then arranged between the Administrators and the Council on 19 February 2013 to provide information and reassurance to the planning authority as to the Administrators’ plans.</p>

On 18 February 2013 Mr. Sandall wrote to McBains Cooper confirming the Administrators’ intention to retain the existing design and planning team so as to have the best chance of obtaining planning consent.  Mr. Sandall also told McBains Cooper that the Administrators would pay any fees which had been incurred at their request since their appointment as administration expenses, and that they had asked Dunbar to agree to fund the payment of a proportion of the historic fees.  The meeting with the Council then took place as planned, attended by representatives of McBains Cooper, and the Administrators confirmed their intention to progress the extant planning application with the assistance of APAM and the existing planning team.</p>

Unlike the first planning in 2009 it is economically driven. The 2009 application was design led and was a statement building. The new design is considerably more efficient and market friendly. The residential net to gross of the current design is 89% which is very efficient for such a property. </p>

Upon grant it needs to be ascertained if further negotiations should be entered into with the Local Authority regarding the Affordable content or whether a potential purchaser will price their bid on the basis that they are the best placed party to achieve a reduction in this allocation. This option would see us expending in the region of £250,000 to £275,000 of design/planning fees. The realisable value with this strategy would be in the region of £8m to £18m depending on the view the market takes on developers profit and gross development value of the finished residential. This is a wide variance but has the potential for most upside if planning achieved so this leads us to believe that this is the option we should proceed with. This is also the opinion of APAM and [the Administrators]. If planning is not forthcoming for a redevelopment then we will need to consider the options again.”</p>

The downside of this approach is the timeline that it will take to interact with interested parties however this could be run in parallel with starting up the planning application again.”</p>

To assist in that decision, on 10 October 2013 APAM sent to Dunbar a draft sales process/timeline showing that all interested parties could be advised of a formal sales process in the latter part of October or the first week in November (depending on school half-term holidays and ensuring that this was “convenient and timely for all key bidders”), that a deadline for best bids could be set shortly thereafter, with a sales pack to be issued by solicitors on 22 November 2013, leading to an exchange of contracts before Christmas 2013 and completion by 10 January 2014.  APAM also produced a schedule of the parties with whom they had liaised, indicating that they had approached 20 possible purchasers, of whom 10 were described as interested.

It certainly suggested that there were a number of people, I believe, who might be interested in making bids, and there would have been various discussions about: okay, well, do you think this is serious?  And we then agreed to move ahead.  And the fact that APAM did move ahead, if not minuted on the files, I am not sure if there are emails in there confirming, "Well, keep looking, keep pushing", but I suppose you would say that it sort of morphed, if that is the right expression, from the soft marketing into the more detailed marketing, going out to -- I mean, we had the discussions about moving out, looking at the more detailed lists that they had pulled together …”</p>

The email followed a meeting between Mr. Money and Mr. Connaughton on 15 October 2013 and Mr. Money was responding to a question from Mr. Connaughton to explain who would have the ultimate decision on which offer to accept in a sales process and the criteria that would be applied.

When we set a date for offers, it will probably be after confirming with serious bidders that the timing is realistic. The bottom line is that price will be the key factor. After the initial offers are in, we will be ensuring that we have evaluated the different bases used by interested parties, and there may be further opportunities for the highest bidders to clarify their offers.</p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">I am surprised by this question from Mr Clarke who is, or was, an insolvency practitioner. Administrators always like to see proof of funds - it is all too easy for potential purchasers to make an attractive offer and then find that they cannot raise the required funds. This leads to delay and additional administration costs - and in a lot of cases - a reduction in the purchaser’s offer. Additionally, going back to the market after an aborted sale will incur additional cost and usually results in lower offers. So proof of funding is important in the context of it adds credibility to the purchaser’s offer and gives the administrators comfort that the purchaser can complete the deal quickly and with a minimum of additional cost. </span>

Whilst I acknowledge how that would operate in relation to an asset sale, my client’s offer is different. The effect of my client’s offer being accepted would be for funds to be provided to the Company to enable the Joint Administrators to discharge the Company’s debts and the administration expenses. A payment of 10% by my client in these circumstances would effectively be on account of the Bank’s debt and therefore, in the event that she withdrew from the process, my client would have a subrogated claim in relation to the value of her cash injection. Perhaps a more appropriate solution could be for an amount to be paid into an escrow account upon the Joint Administrators’ agreement to proceed with her proposal and we can these discuss the finer detail as to how the creditors can be paid and the Company exit administration. </p>

The meeting discussed Ms Davey's proposal to provide the funds to pay off Dunbar and the other creditors and costs (including the costs of the Administrators and APAM) and thereby to rescue AHDL as a going concern and avoid the sale of Angel House.  The Administrators agreed that if Ms. Davey could provide the money to achieve this result, this would represent the best outcome, but indicated that there would need to be some certainty that Ms. Davey could fulfil her side of any such deal.  The Administrators reiterated their requirement for a 10% non-refundable deposit on exchange of an agreement.  Rosenblatt repeated their suggestion that this should be by way of an escrow payment.  The Administrators responded that they had had a number of offers for Angel House from purchasers who indicated that they could move quickly to an exchange and pay a non-refundable deposit.  They resisted requests for a 14-day suspension of the sales process to enable Ms. Davey to conduct due diligence, indicating that if Ms. Davey told them what information she needed as regards other creditors and costs, they would provide that information speedily.</p>

The Administrators defended the decision to involve APAM and pointed out that the administration had no free money and that they were dependent upon Dunbar to fund continued trading.  They indicated that the planning application had been allowed to lapse because its only potential funder, Dunbar, was unwilling to provide the further funding necessary to take it to a stage where it would result in an increase in value of the building.  And they stated that a decision had been taken to “test the water” in relation to the sale of Angel House because of an increase in interest in the market and because of Dunbar’s attitude on continued funding.</p>

We cannot see what good reason your clients can have for rushing the sale of the Property: that the market is buoyant is evidenced by the fact that with the Joint Administrators' inadequate marketing your clients have in the space of only one month or so been able to obtain a number of serious offers, albeit offers which are insufficient to pay off the debt due to the bank, let alone anything for unsecured creditors. Meanwhile your clients have not given our client a statement of the amount required from her if the sale is to be rendered unnecessary.”</p>

Mr. Slatter, who had previously attended the meeting with the Administrators on 18 November together with Ms. Davey, sent an offer on behalf of Olympian Homes of £19.12 million for Angel House.  The email indicated that the offer was made in conjunction with London &amp; Regional Properties Limited (“L&amp;R”), and that it was made “without any involvement of Ms. Julia Davey who we understand is acting with other parties”.  It was explained to me at the hearing that L&amp;R is a company headed by the Livingstone brothers who are generally regarded as serious participants in the UK property industry.  The receipt of the bid prompted Mr. Money to circulate it immediately to Mr. Stenson and APAM.  Mr. Stenson forwarded the email to Mr. Connolly under cover of an email saying, “I hope you are sitting down ...”.    </p>

He indicated that at this level he would be, “happy to upset LBS … but only if we can be sure that we will do better.”  Mr. Money asked APAM to contact Mr. Richard Livingstone of L&amp;R to verify that the offer was a genuine one, and in the meantime replied to Mr. Slatter to reiterate that given the stage of the process that had been reached, proof of funding would be “absolutely fundamental”.  This prompted an email from Mr. Livingstone to the Administrators confirming that L&amp;R would be funding the project and promising a formal letter at the beginning of the following week.  The promised letter confirming that L&amp;R was prepared to provide up to £20 million to finance the purchase of Angel House was duly provided to APAM on Monday, 25 November 2013. </p>

They were worried that they had been too prudent, and that 3 or 5 days might have been better given that the funds for the deposit were available. As this was not a negotiation and I did not want to suggest in any way that the offer was acceptable, I merely stated the obvious that 3 or 5 days would generally be better than 15. Although there is a longer completion timeframe, at 17.5m I assume that the extra 450k would exceed accruing interest. Is that correct, or are there other costs to take into account? </p>

These included questions about obtaining a valuation of Angel House, Ms. Davey’s experience and ability to deliver a development scheme, and the likelihood of obtaining the necessary planning permission.  </p>

He indicated that although Affinity had been trying to speak to APAM, that conversation had not taken place and that Affinity were unclear what more was required of them.  The emails passing between Mr. Powell of APAM and Mr. Whitton of Affinity showed that they had each attempted to contact the other but were playing “phone tennis”.  Mr. Connaughton also indicated that his lawyers were “experienced” and “keen to move quickly”, and therefore asked for a draft contract to be sent.  </p>

Mr. Money stated that at the very least he would require a solicitor’s undertaking from Mr. Davidson that the initial £2 million had been transferred to Pinsent Masons to be held to Mr. Davidson’s order pending finalisation of the terms relating to that money.  Mr. Eastwood replied that “£2m to Pinsents held to our solicitor’s order will be fine by tomorrow”.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Eastwood responded, confessing that Mr. Davidson was not in fact acting for Blackcube, but had “simply been providing internal council [sic]”.  Mr. Eastwood also revealed that he had not transferred funds to Blackcube’s English solicitors so that no undertaking could be given by them.

Mr. Connaughton expressed some frustration at having been led to believe by APAM that he was a top bidder but that the deal was now being given to a third party.  Mr. Money replied by email, apologising that potential purchasers of Angel House had not been kept fully in the loop and explaining that the Administrators had been seeking to work on the refinancing proposal from Ms. Davey, which “would have priority over a sale of the property” and that APAM had been instructed not to tell the unsuccessful bidders.  Mr. Money indicated that although it was still possible that the refinancing route might succeed, the previous evening the Administrators had decided to proceed with a sale of the property, and that he was now notifying Mr. Connaughton that Capital &amp; Oriental’s bid had not been successful.

Pinsent Masons observed that the letter provided by Mr. Eastwood from BSI SA referred to an individual unknown to Mr. Money, to a purchase of Angel House rather than a refinancing, and contained no reference to the non-refundable deposit.  The letter also highlighted the lack of progress towards implementing the Heads of Terms and the inconsistent messages from Mr. Eastwood as to the status of the proposal, the instruction of lawyers and the transfer of monies.  Pinsent Masons concluded that Blackcube and Mr. Eastwood had not persuaded the Administrators that they were capable of delivering on their proposal and that in the circumstances, the Administrators considered that they had no alternative but to continue with the sale process and to exchange contracts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The structure of this provision makes it clear that an administrator who is pursuing the objective under paragraph 3(1)(c) (“Objective 3”) is focussing on achieving a return to the secured creditor (albeit whilst not unnecessarily harming the interests of the creditors as a whole); an administrator who is pursuing the objective under paragraph 3(1)(b) (“Objective 2”) is focussing on achieving a better return to unsecured creditors as well as repaying the secured creditor; and an administrator pursuing the objective under paragraph 3(1)(a) (“Objective 1”) is focussing on achieving a result in which all creditors are paid in full and the company is restored to financial health for the benefit of its shareholders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Understood in this way, there is a significant difference between the role of the office-holder in an administration on the one hand and in a receivership or administrative receivership on the other.  A receiver or administrative receiver owes his primary duties to his appointor and is generally free to determine when and how to realise assets to repay the secured debt without consideration for the interests of the unsecured creditors or the company itself.  In contrast, in deciding how to run the administration, an administrator is required to have regard to the interests of all of the company’s creditors, and he can only limit his ambition to seeking to realise assets to repay the secured creditor if he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve anything else.  Even then, he must not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors as a whole.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Given the range of interests to be addressed under paragraph 3 of Schedule B1, the use of the expression that the administrator “thinks” rather than, for example, “reasonably believes” is a clear indication that Parliament intended a degree of latitude to be given to an administrator in deciding upon the objective to be pursued, and that he is not lightly to be second-guessed by the court with the benefit of hindsight.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Lightman &amp; Moss, The Law of Administrators and Receivers of Companies</span> (6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed.) at paragraph 12-022 it is suggested, by reference to case-law and the legislative debate upon this provision, that the appropriate standard of review by the court should be one of good faith and rationality.  This would mean, for example, that an administrator’s decision not to pursue the first objective will only be open to challenge if it was made in bad faith or was clearly perverse in the sense that no reasonable administrator could have thought that it was not reasonably practicable to rescue the company as a going concern.  I agree with that approach.  Though obviously important for creditors and shareholders, the assessment of the practicality of following one or other objective (e.g. whether a company which is insolvent or on the brink of insolvency can be rescued) will most likely require the exercise of a substantial amount of commercial judgment, often under significant time pressures.  I see no good reason to adopt any more interventionist standard of review of an administrator’s opinion in this regard than is applied more generally by the courts to the question of whether to interfere with specific business decisions taken by administrators: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Re Edennote Ltd</span> [1996] BCC 718.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That said, I would also endorse the point made in paragraph 12-023 of <span style="font-style:italic">Lightman &amp; Moss</span> that the more deferential standard of review of the decision of the administrator as to which objective to pursue does not also extend to the methods adopted by the administrator to pursue his chosen course.  In particular, the administrator can only follow Objective 3 if he does not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole.  That statutory requirement in paragraph 3(4)(b) is not couched in terms of what the administrator thinks, but appears to invite a more objective standard of review.  That is relevant for my consideration of Issue 3. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards Objective 2, Ms. Davey contends that the Administrators were engaged by Dunbar for what was envisaged to be a “light touch” administration, that they committed themselves at the outset to a very low fee structure, and that they failed to obtain adequate or reliable evidence as to the value of Angel House upon which to base their assessment of whether it would be reasonably practicable to make a return to unsecured creditors.  She contends that they therefore wrongly boxed themselves into an assumption that the only objective to be served by the administration was to sell Angel House simply to make a distribution to Dunbar as the secured creditor in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(c) of Schedule B1 (i.e. Objective 3). This Issue, as I understand it, is one that goes to the purpose of the Administrators from the start of the administration.  This is a wider point than the separate question of whether the Administrators breached a duty of care by failing to obtain a proper price for Angel House, thereby depriving unsecured creditors of the possibility of some return from the administration.  That is Issue 3. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards Objective 1, Ms. Davey asserts that by reason of personal hostility towards her and/or a desire to assist Dunbar to pursue a guarantee claim against her, from the outset the Administrators failed to consider, and failed to consult with her as the director and shareholder of AHDL, as to how they might achieve the objective of rescuing AHDL as a going concern in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(a) of Schedule B1.  Again, I understand this to raise a wider point than the particular question of whether, at a much later stage in the administration in November 2013, the Administrators failed appropriately to pursue the possibility that Ms. Davey could have provided a funded rescue for AHDL which would not have required the sale of Angel House.

However, when considered in context, I am satisfied that this referred, as Mr. Money explained in his oral evidence, to an administration in which he would not be heavily involved in the day-to-day running of the business of the company, but would rely upon employing agents to manage the operational aspects of the continuation of that business.  </p>

Mr. Money was unable to recall that when giving evidence, but it would seem from the contemporaneous documents that although he had originally given an estimate of £61,000, he was persuaded to reduce that estimate to £42,000 to match a rival quotation from Rollings Oliver.  Mr. Money recorded that lower amount as his estimate of fees in a handwritten comment on the Administrators’ internal strategy document on 3 January 2013 and it is also the figure referred to as a “fee quote” by Mr. Sandall in his progress report of 14 March 2013.  </p>

The Administrators claimed significantly more than £42,000 on the basis that the matters with which they had had to contend had taken the case outside the scope of the “light-touch” administration that had been envisaged.  In a lengthy email to Mr. Stenson and Mr. Connolly, the Administrators referred in particular to the lack of proper information, systems and staff support at Angel House; the fact that it had taken several months of work before receipts from Angel House could even meet trading costs; the fact that (contrary to their understanding at the outset) the planning application was far from complete; and that substantial time had been spent dealing with the sales process and with Ms. Davey’s funded rescue proposal.  Although Dunbar challenged the Administrators’ fees, it did not seek to enforce any ‘cap’ of £42,000.  Dunbar’s approach was to take issue with the Administrators’ assessment of the matters that should be regarded as part and parcel or outside the scope of a normal administration, but it eventually agreed a significantly increased fee. </p>

The Strategy Notes also record the possibility of achieving a better result for unsecured creditors than in a liquidation in that event.  That suggests that the Administrators initially thought that the value of the property with planning was likely to equal or exceed the Dunbar debt which was then thought to be about £17 million.  That conclusion is also consistent with the views expressed by Mr. Sandall to Ms. Davey on the telephone the next day, 4 January 2013, where he repeated that the main objective of the administration was to obtain planning permission and thereby to be able to sell Angel House for a price that would settle the Dunbar debt.

As indicated above, in that draft report, Savills expressed the view formally that Angel House was worth between £6 million (without planning) and £8 million (with planning on the basis of the existing application), but informally indicated that the value (with such planning) might be up to £10 million.</p>

The Administrators decided to manage the property and collect the income from it efficiently, whilst attempting to obtain planning permission that would likely serve to increase its value.  Those steps would have been the same under Objective 2 or Objective 3.  At that stage, whether it was likely that a return to unsecured creditors could be achieved rather than merely a return to Dunbar on its secured debt would have been thought simply to depend upon the ultimate sale price that could be obtained.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">AHDL was essentially a one-asset company, whose business entirely depended upon owning and managing Angel House.  The concept of rescuing AHDL <span style="font-style:italic">as a going concern</span> would necessarily preclude selling Angel House.  As a practical matter there was, moreover, simply no question of achieving Objective 1 by improving trading performance to such an extent that AHDL could generate sufficient cash internally to pay off all its creditors (including Dunbar) or by persuading the creditors (including Dunbar) to agree to waive a substantial proportion of their debts so as to restore the company to solvency.  The only way in which Objective 1 could have been achieved was by finding a person or persons willing to recapitalise or refinance AHDL with new money so as to enable the existing debt owed to Dunbar, administration expenses and the unsecured creditors to be paid without selling Angel House.  </p>

Seeking information and the views of the directors and shareholders as to the prospects for the company may well be a sensible step in most cases.  However, there can be no “fundamental” rule requiring the administrator in every case to go through a process of consultation with the directors and shareholders, still less that he should seek their “confirmation” that rescue of the company as a going concern is not feasible.  In many cases the administrator will have been appointed to bring independent judgment to the case precisely because the directors of the company, appointed by the shareholders, have presided over the decline of the company into insolvency.  Such directors and shareholders may often have an entirely unrealistic and over-optimistic view of the company’s business and prospects for rescue. </p>

The case concerned an application by administrators for directions as to whether, and if so how, they should exit administration after three years on the basis that the purposes of the administration had been sufficiently achieved.  The directors had made a proposal to secure sufficient new funding to allow the company to repay its creditors in full and exit administration as a going concern, but doubts still existed over the claim of one significant creditor.  Lord Hodge indicated that before a company could be treated as having been rescued as a going concern, the administrators had to look into the foreseeable future, assess the prospects of the company trading successfully in the hands of the directors to whom it was to be returned, and decide whether it was probable that the company would be able to pay its debts as they fell due.</p>

It is quite clear that Ms. Davey was not herself in any position to mount a funded rescue and knew of no such prospects at the time.  Her view as to whether there might be any prospect for a funded rescue in the future was pure speculation, and depended entirely upon there being sufficient rental income available to the Administrators to fund, or upon Dunbar being willing to fund, continuing trading operations of the Company and the progression of the planning application in the meantime.</p>

I consider that the events at the start of the administration show that Ms. Davey harboured a real reluctance to accept that she had lost control of her companies.  As someone who was used to being in charge, I think Ms. Davey was determined to continue to work to her own agenda, priorities and timescales rather than to comply with the requirements of the Administrators.  This gave rise to the justifiable perception on the part of the Administrators that Ms. Davey was, at best, lacking any real sense of urgency or commitment to assist them, and at worst that she was being positively obstructive in circumstances where there were unfulfilled requests for information and unanswered questions over her dealings with the Company’s funds.  </p>

It is quite clear on the chronology of events, however, that this email at 2.25 p.m. preceded rather than followed Mr. Sandall’s visit to Angel House later that afternoon.  The draft to Ms. Davey was firm in tone, and indeed Mr. Money added a number of more explicit instructions and warnings to Mr. Sandall’s draft.  Although the covering email to Mr. Money indicated that Mr. Sandall was feeling “a little venomous”, I think Mr. Sandall was entitled to feel frustrated by the very late cancellation of the meeting and the lack of co-operation from Ms. Davey in relation to the provision of information and documents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to those actions was that Dunbar served the proceedings at Ms. Davey’s residential address in Whitefriars on about 8 February 2013, but it was uncertain whether she might have received them, and Dunbar’s solicitors, DLA, wished to effect personal service.  Arrangements were made for this to occur on 12 February 2013 if Ms. Davey had attended the meeting with the Administrators at their premises.  After Ms. Davey did not show, Mr. Sandall subsequently contacted DLA on 7 March 2013 to inform them that Ms. Davey was expected in London and offering to notify them if she appeared at Angel House.  In fact, Ms. Davey was served personally on 9 March 2013 without the assistance of the Administrators: when this was reported to Mr. Sandall, his reaction was, “Good news”.</p>

At the time the assistance was given to Dunbar, for the reasons that I have explained, Ms. Davey was (reasonably) not seen as a source of a funded rescue for AHDL.  Moreover, although she had at the start of the administration voiced concern over the structure of the extant planning application and espoused a desire to be involved in the planning process so as to ensure that what was being proposed was viable (see e.g. the remarks made during the calls with Mr. Sandall on 4 January 2013 and 27 February 2013), the reality was that she had shown no inclination to follow that up in practice or to provide any tangible assistance to the Administrators.</p>

As I have explained, I do not think that the Administrators were initially motivated by any animosity towards Ms. Davey.  Mr. Sandall’s attitude towards Ms. Davey might well have soured as a consequence of the events of 1 February 2013 and the hostility and personal criticism directed at him by Mr. Daniel.  His impression of Ms. Davey would also not have been improved by her lack of co-operation with and rather dismissive attitude towards the Administrators.  This might explain why he subsequently gave his assistance to Dunbar in relation to the Guarantee proceedings against Ms. Davey.  However, I do not think that there is any evidence to suggest that if this was Mr. Sandall’s attitude, it persisted or infected any other aspects of his day-to-day conduct of the administration in the middle of 2013 when Ms. Davey was not on the scene.</p>

I shall return to consider the specific steps taken by the Administrators in relation to those matters later in this judgment under Issues 3 and 4.  Suffice to say for present purposes that the evidence does not indicate that Ms. Davey’s position played any part in the Administrators’ approach to the planning issues in mid-2013; and after Ms. Davey resurfaced in the Autumn of 2013, I believe that the Administrators genuinely acknowledged the desirability of her rescue proposal and went out of their way to facilitate Mr. Eastwood to make the necessary financial commitment and provide the necessary proof of funding.</p>

That article makes a number of suggestions, including that a tender process should be used when employing solicitors and counsel in insolvency cases.

On the same day the directors of the companies appointed the defendant, who was a sole practitioner, as voluntary administrator (a role which I take to be similar to an administrator in the UK).

He then turned to the question of appointing replacements.  The judge acknowledged at the outset that the role of administrator gave rise to fiduciary duties and that it required an administrator to act impartially as between interested groups.  He also acknowledged that in the case, questions of conflict between the banks and the unsecured creditors might well arise, since it was possible that the assets subject to the banks’ security would not be adequate to satisfy the debt owing to the banks and that actions might therefore be taken by the receivers for the banks that might be contrary to the interests of the unsecured creditors and the shareholders of the companies.</p>

Finkelstein J concluded that in all the circumstances he could appoint the banks’ nominees, and he rejected a submission that, looking at matters objectively, they could not be relied upon to look after the interests of the unsecured creditors.  He did, however, require the administrators to appoint solicitors to act for them who were independent of the banks, which he considered would strengthen the appearance of the administrators’ independence. </p>

He said that such a course was undesirable. I would go one step further than did Byrne J. Not only should an administrator not appoint solicitors retained by the secured creditor, they should not appoint solicitors who are on the secured creditor’s panel of solicitors.  I think that solicitors on a secured creditor’s panel are just as likely to be perceived as loyal to the secured creditor as is the solicitor who happens to be retained by the secured creditor.</p>

No doubt panel solicitors will, if asked, say they will just as faithfully act against the interests of the client to whose panel they have been appointed as would any other solicitor. For my own part, I do not accept this to be so clearly the case. Just ask the managing partner of the firm that is about to bring proceedings against one of its large clients. Even if the action is allowed to go ahead (which in most instances would be problematic because permission would normally be required from the client) one would expect the liaison partner to speak to the client to smooth over any cracks in the relationship. </p>

The creditors will quite properly want their administrator’s lawyers to be truly independent of any party with whom the administrator has a legal dispute. Test the matter this way: Assume a poll is conducted and creditors are asked whether their administrator should appoint as his/her lawyer in an action against a bank (e.g. to challenge the validity of the bank’s security) a firm that regularly acts for the bank. I would be surprised if even a small number would vote in favour of the proposal.”</p>

The first is that Finkelstein J obviously did not think that there was any absolute requirement for a competitive selection process to be carried out prior to appointment of administrators.  I agree, and for my part I think that the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Fernandez </span>illustrate why there cannot be such a hard and fast rule in relation to the appointment of other agents of the company either.  There may, in general terms, be good reasons for an administrator to consider holding such a selection process (including the issue of costs control and obtaining value for creditors to which both Lightman J and Finkelstein J referred).  However, at the end of the day the facts of each case will vary widely and there may be practical reasons - including the limited scope of duties to be performed by the agent and the pressures of time in an administration - why a “beauty parade” is neither needed nor desirable.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point to be derived from <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Fernandez </span>is that the judge did not think that there was any absolute bar upon the appointment of administrators who had had a prior business relationship with the secured creditors and had been nominated by them.  Instead he plainly thought that the question of whether the insolvency practitioners could be relied upon to act impartially and in accordance with their duties required an assessment of all the circumstances.  Further, although expressed in forthright terms, I do not think that Finkelstein J’s views concerning the appointment of solicitors on the bank’s panel can be taken to have been intended as prescribing some hard and fast legal rule as regards the appointment of agents by administrators. If, as the judge acknowledged, there is no prohibition on the appointment of administrators who have previously been engaged by the secured creditors, I fail to understand how he could have thought that such a rule could exist as regards the appointment of other professional agents.  Rather, I think that the judge’s comments were made in the particular factual context of the desirability of supporting the appearance of independence of the administrators whom he had decided to appoint.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, I consider that there can be no hard and fast legal rule requiring a selection process to be held, or prohibiting the appointment by administrators of agents who have been recommended by the secured creditor(s).  The essential question in all cases will be whether the agents to be appointed are competent and able to discharge their fiduciary duties to the company.  That will obviously depend upon the precise nature of the duties in question and all the circumstances of the individual case.</p>

At the start of the administration, it was clear that there were a number of immediate priorities for the Administrators.  After securing AHDL’s bank accounts, the immediate tasks facing the Administrators were to find out about the Company’s business of letting and managing Angel House, and to take steps to ensure the efficient collection of income from tenants.  Thereafter, and if possible, it was obvious that the Administrators should seek to enhance that revenue stream by resolving any issues with tenants and granting suitable new tenancies on advantageous terms.  </p>

Ms. Davey was also well aware at the start of the administration that Angel House had been allowed to get into a very poor state and that there were numerous problems with leases, tenants and the fabric and facilities of the building which required immediate attention.  Addressing those practical issues would not, as it seems to me, have raised any concerns as to the independence of APAM from Dunbar.  I think it is also significant that Ms. Davey did not express any disquiet when the intended appointment of APAM as “property/asset manager” was reported to her by Mr. Stenson of Dunbar on 4 January 2013.</p>

She contends that it was critical that the Administrators should have held a beauty parade and insisted upon instructing one of the established selling agents with experience of selling commercial property in the Docklands.  I shall consider that complaint in the context of the allegations of sale at an undervalue in Issue 3, but I shall deal here with the two specific issues raised by Mr. Davies concerning the particular terms upon which APAM had been engaged and which he contended were relevant to that issue.</p>

Mr. Money said that he understood the terms of the agreement which had been negotiated between Dunbar and APAM allowed for APAM to seek the advice or assistance of another firm as sales agent, and that the fees of such a party would be paid from APAM’s fees (see the clause beginning, “APAM will appoint or seek the advice of agents…” above).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I think Mr. Shierson’s oral evidence more accurately summarised the 2010 OFT report than his written evidence.  The OFT report did not in fact consider the specific type of incentive arrangement in issue in this case.  What the OFT concentrated upon was evidence and economic data as to the workings of the insolvency market generally, and one of its main findings was that secured creditors were much more effective at controlling fees in an administration than were unsecured creditors, who were less able or willing to become involved in the process.  Accordingly, the OFT found that in a typical administration, like-for-like fees were 9% higher when secured creditors recovered their debts in full and the unsecured creditors paid the administrator’s fees out of their own claims, than if the fees simply came out of secured recoveries.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, that evidence does not support the submission that incentive arrangements of the type in issue in this case are inherently inappropriate.  Providing a financial incentive to office-holders and/or agents for an asset to be realised for more than just the amount owing to a secured creditor may very well be in the interests of the unsecured creditors.  Indeed, such contractual arrangements would directly address one of the points made by the OFT at paragraph 4.113 of its report, namely that in pre-pack administrations there was a lack of a systemic incentive for insolvency practitioners to realise assets for more than is owed to the secured creditor,</p>

On the facts of the case, however, the example which Mr. Davies gave was not a good one.  At the time of the agreement with APAM, Angel House did not have any planning permission, and APAM were engaged in part to oversee the process by which such planning would be obtained to enhance the value of the property.  Hence a sale for £20 million <span style="text-decoration:underline">with planning</span> might well have been seen as an enhancement over the value “as is”.  Moreover, on the information available to Dunbar and, I have found, to the Administrators, the “Red Book” valuation by Savills was an  indication upon which reliance could properly have been placed in January 2013 that Angel House was worth materially less than the amount of Dunbar’s debt, either without planning or with planning on the basis of the then extant scheme (£6 million - £8 million formally and up to £10 million informally compared with a debt of £16.7 million).</p>

I also do not accept Mr. Davies’ submission that there was anything wrong in the incentive fee only operating above the level of Dunbar’s debt.  Once it is accepted that the Administrators thought that the likely value of Angel House was significantly less than the amount of Dunbar’s debt, agreeing that the incentive would only kick in at the level of Dunbar’s debt was entirely logical.  Fixing it to operate at any lower amount would have been open to the criticism that APAM would have had a material incentive to achieve a sub-optimal result which gave <span style="text-decoration:underline">no</span> benefit to unsecured creditors (and indeed the payment of the incentive fee would have ranked ahead of the unsecured claims as an expense of the administration).  Agreeing that APAM were only paid an incentive fee if they actually achieved a price that exceeded the amount thought to be owed to the secured creditor gave them the best incentive to achieve a return for those creditors.</p>

The question of whether such a fee would have been payable to APAM in the event of a funded rescue is somewhat unclear from the terms of the engagement letter of January 2013.  That letter refers rather vaguely to an incentive fee being payable on an “exit” (which is not defined) and on one view the reference to APAM providing, “strategy formulation and exit execution with a view to maximising sales proceeds to the Administrator and Dunbar” might suggest that it would only be on a sale of Angel House that an incentive fee would be payable.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Money’s evidence was that when this point was discussed with Mr. Sandall in November 2013, they did not think that APAM would be entitled to be paid a fee in the event that AHDL was rescued as a going concern.  Accordingly, when a breakdown of APAM’s fees was provided to Ms. Davey’s advisers on 29 November 2013, it did not include a figure in respect of any incentive fee.  In cross-examination, Mr. Davies put to Mr. Money that this would have been a “massive disincentive” for APAM to favour a funded rescue rather than a sale of Angel House.  Mr. Money’s answer was that this would have made no difference, because it was the Administrators’ decision, and not APAM’s decision, as to which route to take.  In his written closing, however, Mr. Davies adopted the opposite view, asserting that the incentive fee <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> payable to APAM on the terms of the agreement (though he did not elaborate upon that) but alleging that this would not have been justified.  </p>

If, as appears to have been the view taken by the Administrators, the fee would not be payable to APAM on a funded rescue, the real issue is whether this had any bearing upon the decision of the Administrators to accept the offer from LBS/Cubitt for Angel House, rather than to pursue Ms. Davey’s offer to refinance AHDL further.  That issue is relevant to Issue 4 (below).  If the fee would have been payable to APAM in the event of a funded rescue, then the point goes nowhere, because there would have been no reason for APAM to favour either alternative.</p>

The administrator is thereby primarily responsible for the management of the company’s affairs, business and property, and the directors are confined to a residual role.  It is inherent in the nature of the role that the administrator may come to the appointment with very limited knowledge of the affairs of the company, and he will have to take commercial and business decisions, often under considerable time pressure caused by the insolvency or threatened insolvency of the company.  Given that the directors whose powers are restricted by the appointment of the administrator are not regarded as trustees in the strict sense, or subject to the heightened duties of such trustees when selling the property of the company, I see no obvious reason why the administrator should have any higher duties imposed upon him by equity or the common law.</p>

A complaint that he has failed to take reasonable care in the sale of the company's assets is, therefore, a complaint of professional negligence and in my judgment the established principles applicable to cases of professional negligence are equally applicable in such a case. It follows that the administrator is to be judged, not by the standards of the most meticulous and conscientious member of his profession, but by those of an ordinary, skilled practitioner. In order to succeed the claimant must establish that the administrator has made an error which a reasonably skilled and careful insolvency practitioner would not have made.”</p>

By proceeding with the sales immediately, the receivers decided to forgo any potential increase in price that might have been obtained if the sales were delayed until after the result of the planning applications, but obtained the advantage to the bank of saving the costs of that exercise and obtaining an immediate realisation and partial repayment of its secured indebtedness.  </p>

This accords with the statement of principle to this effect of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</span> [1995] 2 AC 145, 205E-H relied on by the claimants. The appointment of the receivers as agents of the claimants having regard to the special character of the agency does not affect the scope or the content of the fiduciary duty. The scope or content of the duty must depend on and reflect the special nature of the relationship between the bank, the claimants and the receivers arising under the terms of the mortgages and the appointments of the receivers, and in particular the role of the receivers in securing repayment of the secured debt and the primacy of their obligations in this regard to the bank. These circumstances preclude the assumption by, or imposition on, the receivers of the obligation to take the pre-marketing steps for which the claimants contend in this action. Further no such obligation could arise in their case (any more than in the case of the bank) from the steps which they took to investigate and (for a period) to proceed with applications for planning permission. The receivers were at all times free (as was the bank) to halt those steps and exercise their right to proceed with an immediate sale of the mortgaged properties as they were.”</p>

Now he has to avoid unnecessary harm to the general body of creditors. "Harm" is considered to be the equivalent of "prejudice". He is still entitled to subordinate the interests of the general body of creditors to those of secured and preferential creditors, since para.3(2) of Sch.Bl makes it clear that his duty to the general creditors is subject to the pursuit of the third objective.  But he must avoid causing harm which is not necessary for the protection of the creditors for whom his realisations are intended. This imposes on him the duty to consider all aspects of the administration, including the timing of realisations. It is also a signal that the existence of security substantially in excess of the debt owed to the secured creditor or creditors does not entitle him to be lax in managing the business and realising the assets.”</p>

Those changes limited the use of administrative receivership and, by introducing the hierarchy of objectives in paragraph 3 of Schedule B1, require administrators to have regard to the interests of a wider group of stakeholders rather than simply the holder of the qualifying floating charge who appointed them.  In particular, as Professor Goode puts it, the administrator cannot simply decide to sell the company’s assets at a time to suit the interests of the secured creditor, if by doing so he causes harm to the unsecured creditors which is not necessary for the protection of the interests of the secured creditor.  The interests of the unsecured creditors therefore receive enhanced protection in an administration compared with a receivership.</p>

Ms. Davey’s case is that the Administrators unreasonably concluded that Dunbar was the only source of funds to pursue the existing planning application, and that after Dunbar declined to fund the continuation of the 2012 planning application, the Administrators should have pursued alternative sources of funding such as the income stream from Angel House or Ms. Davey herself.</p>

Those issues largely concerned the requirement of the Council, as a matter of policy, for the residential component of the proposed development to include 35% of affordable housing.  It was common ground that adherence to this requirement in the redevelopment of Angel House would have had the effect of significantly reducing the sale price of the private residential units which lay at the heart of the profitability of the project for a developer, and hence the price that a developer might be prepared to pay for the site. </p>

The basic point made by Mr. Lea was that the level of affordable housing significantly and detrimentally affected the gross development value, so that even with the benefit of a planning consent based upon the 2012 planning application, the value of Angel House was likely to fall far short of the amount owed to Dunbar.  Moreover, in their first substantive telephone call at the outset of the administration on 4 January 2013, Ms. Davey told Mr. Sandall that she agreed with Mr. Lea’s advice that 35% affordable housing rendered the project uneconomic, and expressed the view that it would be necessary for a review of the existing application to take place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this background there were different opinions expressed in the evidence as to why it might have made sense to continue with the existing planning application.  One was that it would provide a framework within which to seek to negotiate with the Council a reduction in the basic requirement for 35% affordable housing.  Although Ms. Davey suggested in her evidence that if she had been asked, it might have been possible for her simply to persuade the Council to accept such a reduction, I do not accept that was a realistic possibility.  The clear evidence of those involved in the planning process, such as Ms. Wheldon, Ms. Wilson and Mr. Leeson was that in the first part of 2013, the only way in which it might reasonably have been anticipated that AHDL could obtain a reduction in the Council’s requirement for 35% affordable housing was to obtain a credible viability assessment to show that a development with that proportion of affordable housing would not be commercially viable because it would not increase the existing use value of the site by more than about 20%.  There is no evidence that any such assessment had been commissioned by AHDL or that one would have been available.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A second potential reason to continue with the planning application would have been if AHDL could have offered a <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo</span> to the Council for the 35% affordable housing requirement, either by the provision of an alternative site for the provision of the required affordable housing, or simply offering to pay a substantial sum of money in lieu, with which the Council could itself build affordable housing elsewhere.  However, in the instant case AHDL did not own an alternative site or have any substantial monies available to it.  Although Ms. Davey gave evidence suggesting that she had a suitable plot of land available off-site (referred to as The Triangle) which could have been offered for this purpose, the extent to which that land was unencumbered or subject to charges to secure debt to Ms. Davey or other group companies was wholly unclear.

This option was summarised in Mr. Stenson’s recommendation in his internal report of 18 April 2013 and his email to Mr. Money the next day after his report had been sent back from the RMRC.</p>

The first was that the various members of the planning team were owed substantial arrears of unpaid fees (understood to be about £265,000) at the commencement of the administration, and were unwilling to continue to provide the further work that would have been required to progress the existing planning application (over £150,000) unless offered some assurance that they would be paid for that further work, as well as some deal in relation to their outstanding fees.  Some of the existing team were also threatening to assert ownership over the design documentation to prevent others being brought in from outside to finish the job.</p>

The only source of cash flow in the administration was the rental and service charge receipts from Angel House.  Although ostensibly caught by Dunbar’s fixed charge, in practice these monies were treated as floating charge realisations and made available to the Administrators to pay administration expenses.  The simple fact, however, is that they were not enough to pay the agreed arrears of professional fees or the further professional fees for the planning team together with all the other expenses of the administration.  Quite apart from the very fact that AHDL had been unable to pay the substantial arrears of the planning team’s fees that had accumulated long before the start of the administration, Ms. Davey conceded in cross-examination that there was probably not enough income from Angel House coming into the administration to pay for the planning application.

That evidence is consistent with the events that followed Dunbar’s decision.  The Administrators, APAM and Dunbar met on 16 July 2013 to agree an action plan which was set out in APAM’s email of 23 July 2013.  In relation to planning, the email stated,</p>

This was followed up the next day by CgMS with a fee proposal and a programme for a revised planning scheme, together with a draft brief for the interviews with new architects.  That draft brief indicated that the revised planning application would be for a mixed-use scheme, focussing on maximising the number of residential units, with some office and retail space plus on site car parking spaces.

In those circumstances it is somewhat unrealistic to suggest that a reasonably skilled and careful administrator would have insisted upon attempting to pursue the existing 2012 planning application against the advice of APAM and the wishes of Dunbar.

The reality in that regard, however, was that having had judgment entered against her in July 2013, Ms. Davey was not able to come up with any money to pay the judgment debt.  Her response to Dunbar in early August 2013 was that she would have to liquidate some of her properties to find the money and needed 12 months to pay; and at the meeting on 25 September 2013 Ms. Davey told Dunbar that she had no cash to pay her debt.  In the circumstances I do not think that the fact that Ms. Davey’s brother subsequently assisted her to pay her judgment debt in 2014 provides any evidence that her brother would also have made funding available to her for a very different purpose in mid-2013, and no further evidence was adduced to support any such conclusion.</p>

However, the Hanover House property was already subject to a first charge and Ms. Davey accepted in cross-examination that it would have been “tight” to raise £300,000 on it; and although the house in La Jolla had a significant amount of equity, Ms. Davey encountered significant difficulties when she tried to sell it to pay off the Guarantee debt due to Dunbar in the third quarter of 2013.  </p>

She claims that instead, the Administrators simply relied upon advice from APAM, which had been instructed as managing agents for Angel House, but which did not have the requisite specialist knowledge and experience to act as selling agents.  It is, I think, also implicit in Ms. Davey’s case, that APAM’s alleged lack of independence from Dunbar should have led the Administrators to insist on the engagement of a more recognised sales agent at this stage.  </p>

With the pooled knowledge of such an exercise and the ability to interrogate during and as a necessary part of the process, the Beauty Parade was, in my view, the only way to proceed in this case.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">13.1<marker name="tab"/>Angel House presented a significant development opportunity in an increasingly marketable location and was always going to involve sale proceeds of multi-millions of pounds. As I have said, in the usual course of events, administrators would be expected to instruct 'one of the big boys' to ensure the price secured represented the top end of what it could be expected to achieve. Instructing an Investment Agent would have allowed the Administrators to take for granted that the Property would be fully marketed and sold for the best price.  In the unlikely event that this was not the case, these larger firms would have extensive professional indemnity cover. </p>

The skills required of a competent Investment Agent differ significantly from those of a property management agent and while some professionals and companies are able to carry out both roles satisfactorily, they are very different functions. Many asset managers would not have the up-to-date knowledge of the buyers in the market (including the international market) or the appetite of the market. As I have described above, an Investment Agent, with knowledge of the local market and contacts in the industry is very well placed to put a value on a property to which the market will respond. I do not believe that it would have occurred to anyone with specialist experience of selling a property like Angel House in 2013 to have invited APAM to a Beauty Parade of Investment Agents.”</p>

If an asset manager has been appointed they might join the selection panel. In that way the selection panel will receive alternative views on the property and will get indications whether different investment agents have different views on the merits, in this particular case, of selling pre or post planning. Each prospective agent would present on their view on the market, the timing of the sale, the sale process to be adopted and their recent experience of selling similar assets. In such Beauty Parades, the selection panel is effectively getting free advice from the prospective agents and an insight into the market….”</p>

A similar sentiment is also apparent in the remarks of Mr. Wolfenden in paragraph 13.1 of his written evidence (above) that instructing “one of the big boys” would allow an administrator to “take for granted that the Property would be fully marketed and sold for the best price”, and would have given the Administrator access to the potentially higher professional indemnity cover of the larger firm.</p>

The question is whether, in relying upon APAM in relation to the sale of Angel House rather than selecting “one of the big boys” after a beauty parade, the Administrators made an error which a reasonably skilled and careful insolvency practitioner would not have made.  In that respect, it seems to me that as a matter of principle, it cannot be the case that the established “big boys” have a monopoly on competence or relevant local knowledge so that it is necessarily negligent not to instruct them.  That is why Mr. Shierson readily (and in my view correctly) accepted two propositions: first, that just because APAM were not the same size as (say) CBRE, it did not mean that they were incapable of selling well a property with which they had become very familiar into a market which they had had to study; and secondly, that selection of a large firm was not the only reasonable decision that an administrator could take (“No, of course not.”).    </p>

And I suppose to the extent that I might have been concerned that if APAM had been doing this without any reference to some of the larger organisations, that was allayed by our discussions when we decided that they would include Savills and CBRE within the lists of parties contacted.

Such advice cannot protect trustees from potential liability for a loss to the trust fund resulting from a decision that is, judged objectively, beyond the trustees' powers and detrimental to the trust (though professional advice may lead to their obtaining relief under section 6 of the Trustee Act 1925).  An example mentioned in argument is <span style="font-style:italic">Dunn v Flood</span> (1885) 28 ChD 586, in which trustees had sold by auction 73 plots of freehold land at Reading, subject to special conditions which the court held to be severely depreciatory (as Fry LJ put it at p 594, "eminently calculated to frighten away purchasers"). The Court of Appeal, upholding North J, refused to force a doubtful title on a reluctant purchaser. The fact that the trustees had consulted respectable solicitors was no excuse. It was not a reasonable exercise of discretion: Baggallay and Bowen LJJ at p 592; Fry LJ at pp 593-594. But the trustee's breach of duty was not in the manner of their decision-making (as to which we know nothing other than that they consulted respectable solicitors) but the loss to the trust property that their unreasonable decision appeared to have caused. </p>

These cases, discussed by Lloyd LJ at para 124 of his judgment, were both examples of action taken by trustees on professional advice which was unequivocally incorrect: one a sale of leaseholds when the trustees had no power of sale; the other a distribution (resulting from "some extraordinary slip" by solicitors of high standing) of a deceased beneficiary's vested share to persons who were not entitled to it under the intestacy law of Victoria in force at the beneficiary's death.

That can be seen as a form of strict liability in that it is imposed regardless of personal fault. Trustees may also be in breach of duty in failing to give proper consideration to the exercise of their discretionary powers, and a failure to take professional advice may amount to, or contribute to, a flawed decision-making process. But it would be contrary to principle and authority to impose a form of strict liability on trustees who conscientiously obtain and follow, in making a decision which is within the scope of their powers, apparently competent professional advice which turns out to be wrong.”</p>

In considering the question of whether the valuer instructed by the receiver owed a duty of care to the mortgagor, the Court of Appeal considered (<span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>) the question of whether, if the receiver were sued by the mortgagor, he would be able to say in his defence, “We entrusted the sale to apparently competent professionals, and if they were negligent it is not our fault”.  The Court of Appeal was of the view that a mortgagee could not run such a defence; and it was implicit in the assimilation of the duties of a mortgagee and a receiver in <span style="font-style:italic">Medforth v Blake</span> [2000] Ch 86 that the same analysis would apply to a receiver: see per Clarke LJ at [29]-[32].  </p>

But the position of a mortgagee is quite different from that of a trustee.  A trustee has not, qua trustee, any interest in the trust property, and if an agent employed by him is negligent his right of action against the agent is an asset of the trust.

The precautions that Mr. Shierson identified of getting the agent to commit its advice to writing in order to address “risk management issues” and provide protection for the office-holder against subsequent criticism, are clearly sensible commercial practice, but I do not think that such matters can affect the underlying question of what is required.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The underlying reasons why public advertisement of a property such as Angel House might not be the best way of maximising the sale price were explained by other witnesses.  One such reason is that public advertisement naturally attracts a large number of expressions of interest from what were referred to by several witnesses as “time wasters” and “tyre kickers”.  Such persons are not serious bidders and would not actually have the ability to finance and consummate a transaction to buy a development property of the size and complexity of Angel House.  Mr. Connaughton suggested that public advertisement might attract several hundred expressions of interest, of which about 80% would have to be weeded out for this reason.  Although both Mr. Connaughton and Mr. Shierson thought that this weeding out would be the job of the selling agent and not a concern for an administrator, it was explained to me by other witnesses that this is not the full extent of the problem.  </p>

For them, assessing the property, arranging finance and making a genuine bid requires the expenditure of significant resources.  The evidence was that such bidders are generally not willing to participate in a process which will attract large numbers of time wasters, or persons who might put in artificially high bids and then engage in underhand tactics such as chipping or withdrawing their bids late so as to try to obtain the property for themselves or for associates at a lower price.

It is -- in the agency world it is well-known that a lot of parties don't like, and won't bid, when things are widely advertised.  They want to be in a situation -- they can't always be, and they're not -- where there is a more limited marketing and they will commit time and resource to their bids, which they otherwise wouldn't if it was widely marketed.”</p>

The only alternative, given that Dunbar could not be required to provide the significant funding required for a revised planning process, was for the Administrators to apply to the court for an extension to the administration, in effect gambling that there would be a sufficient rise in the property market to offset the potential blight on Angel House caused by withdrawing it from the market, the increasing interest on Dunbar’s loan, the additional costs of extending the administration, and any further losses from continuing to trade the Company.  Although the market was rising, there could be no assurance that that would continue, or as to what difference it might make to the eventual sale price.  In these circumstances, if Dunbar preferred that the Administrators should seek firm offers without delay, I do not believe that it could be said that the Administrators acted irrationally or unreasonably in agreeing to do so.  </p>

I shall return to consider the issue of whether there was a conspiracy between Dunbar and APAM later in the judgment, but at least from the perspective of the Administrators, I do not think that APAM’s advice in this respect would have seemed questionable or that it would have appeared to have been unduly influenced by Dunbar.  </p>

That was the opinion of Mr. Forgham and Ms. Seal as set out in the joint experts’ report.  In particular Ms. Seal’s evidence was that it was usual for a development site to be launched four weeks before best bids are due and she gave by way of example the fact that Savills had launched the comparable property at Meridian Gate (without planning permission) four weeks before best bids were due.  Both experts also drew attention to the fact that most potential bidders had already been alerted to the property during the soft marketing in September 2013 so that they would in fact have had much longer to familiarise themselves with the property and to gear up to make an offer if they were seriously interested. </p>

Mr. Shierson also accepted in his cross-examination that it was a matter of judgment in a particular case whether to put planning information in the data room or leave it to a prospective purchaser to look at the planning portal of the relevant council’s website.

We wouldn't take a deal to a funder, my Lord, and just dump a pile of paperwork on the desk.  That's not what an equity partner or a funder, a JV, whatever you want to call it, would expect from us.  They would have expected us to have done 90% of the work, just leaving them and their legal department, and they would obviously have their own internal people who would check over the due diligence that we had done, but we would generate quite a substantial pack on everything for an acquisition: bill costs, sales, legals, planning, etc.  We would pull all that together ourselves.</p>

Moreover, given the fact that a number of bidders plainly were able to instruct lawyers to do the necessary legal due diligence, there is no clear basis upon which I can conclude that the timescale was too short to permit that to occur.</p>

My clear impression from the evidence was that any serious bidder for Angel House would have understood that it was in a competitive process against others, and would have simply formed its own commercial view, based largely upon appraisals, of what it was prepared to offer for the property as a development opportunity.  Serious bidders would not have been limited or swayed in that exercise by informal indications from APAM.  </p>

In that regard, Ms. Davey also suggests that if the Administrators had delayed the exchange of contracts and pursued other expressions of interest further, they could have obtained higher bids in excess of £20 million from Bowmer &amp; Kirkland and Mr. Jonathan Fenwick.</p>

Moreover, not all parties who make an offer to acquire properties have immediately available and committed funding when they do so.  Some may make offers with a view to finding a funder and completing due diligence only after the (subject to contract) offer has been accepted but before exchange of contracts.  Even some confirmations of funding are not immutable.  So, for example, in the instant case, the initially promising highest offer of £19.2 million made by Olympian Homes was withdrawn when the team at the funder, L&amp;R, conducted their due diligence into Olympian Homes’ financial computations.</p>

But what you will do is you will put in a larger bid.  So you will, say, set up a company, … put in a bid and then you would sit as an underbidder of that and you know you are the underbidder and then what you will do is, as that process goes through, that company, or that shell or that form will fall away and you are then sat in the position of second position, therefore going to the top, therefore moving yourself up but not paying too much for the actual deal.”</p>

With no resolution to that conundrum, on 21 November 2013 Mr. Willans notified APAM that “Voltaire have failed to produce proof of funds so my clients have dropped them”, and that Capital &amp; Oriental were reverting to an earlier offer of finance from Affinity.  Mr. Willans indicated that the offer would be for £17.5 million with exchange 5 days from receipt of papers: as it was, the offer when it came was for £17.5 million, but required 15 days from receipt of a draft contract to exchange, and was accompanied by very much less than proof that Affinity had committed to fund the transaction for the reasons that I have already explained.</p>

So in my discussion with APAM I said, "Look, can we get them up at least as far as the Guildmore offer?" to which the response was, "We will try".  Not, "Yes, you are going to get there", but, "We will try".  Now, if they had felt that they could go further than that, they're not going to say, "Oh, James has said go up to the matching bid, and we won't try to go any higher".  They clearly had a view as to what was or wasn't possible, and were satisfied with that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, as was apparent from Mr. Money’s email to Mr. Stenson of 21 November 2013 reporting on the process, Mr. Money asked APAM to go back to LBS to match the Guildmore offer in terms of price because he did not want Ms. Davey to be able to complain that the Administrators had not accepted the highest offer.  In circumstances in which threats of litigation had already been made by Ms. Davey through her lawyers, I think that was an entirely understandable reaction.  I also reject the suggestion that Mr. Money was simply doing what Dunbar asked to arrange a sale to its “preferred bidder”.  There was simply no evidence to support that allegation at all.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I also accept Mr. Money’s evidence that he thought that there was a real question of how much further LBS could be pushed.  There had been a competitive process, LBS had already increased its offer once, and as APAM advised Mr. Money, there was no guarantee that it would be willing to do so again.  If asked to increase its offer, LBS might well have guessed that it was offering the best terms in relation to speed of exchange and certainty of completion, and simply decided to call the Administrators’ bluff.  There must also come a point at which even a special purchaser will reach the limit of what it thinks is a commercially viable investment, or simply resent its special status being exploited and pull out. </p>

From Mr. Money’s perspective, APAM had a direct financial incentive to maximise the sale price given their potential entitlement to a 17.5% share of any price in excess of £16.7 million, and although LBS had been identified as a special purchaser from the outset, on 24/25 November 2013 APAM had expressed some concern that if there was a delay in the process, LBS might withdraw its offer (“If we now delay LBS, will they be there in a week’s time?”).  The same point had also been reinforced by Mr. Money’s solicitors, Pinsent Masons, at the end of their letter to Rosenblatt on 19 November 2013. </p>

Mr. Davies’ allegations amount to a criticism that Mr. Money should have been more ambitious than he was, but I do not think that the evidence comes anywhere near demonstrating that any reasonably competent insolvency practitioner would have insisted on pushing for more.</p>

There is also no basis for any suggestion that the Administrators should have done so as a matter of best practice.  As I have pointed out, Ms. Davey did not see it as part of her own game-plan to pursue a funded rescue at the outset of the administration, and after the initial contacts with Mr. Sandall, Ms. Davey was uncooperative with the Administrators for much of the administration.  She also strenuously resisted the claims by Dunbar under her personal Guarantee, which gave no indication that she had any readily available financial resources to mount a rescue of AHDL.</p>

Thereafter, commencing with the approach from Mr. Clarke on 18 October 2013 and the meeting between him and the Administrators on 23 October 2013, Ms. Davey’s interest was that of a potential bidder for Angel House.</p>

Having reviewed them, Ms. Davey accepted in the course of her evidence that Mr. Money expressed the view at the meeting that if Ms. Davey could come up with the money to pay off the Dunbar debt and the costs of the administration so as to rescue the Company as a going concern, there would be no need to sell Angel House and that would be the best solution.   </p>

That belief was well illustrated, for example, by Mr. Money’s subsequent email to Mr. Stenson on 22 November 2013 that, “Clearly the proposals from Julia Davey are attractive, not just for Dunbar, but for all stakeholders”, together with his email to APAM on 25 November 2013, expressing the view that he would like either Olympian’s offer of £19.12 million for Angel House or Ms. Davey’s proposal to take the company out of administration to succeed because of “the prospect of getting the bank out in full plus either a proportion of or all of the unsecured creditors.”</p>

Both attendance notes of the meeting record that the requirement was discussed in terms of the payment of a 10% non-refundable deposit for the equivalent of exchange of contracts on a property sale.  </p>

That was also Mr. Money’s evidence of what he thought he had offered – namely that payment of the deposit would mean that for a period whilst Ms. Davey was given the opportunity to come up with the remainder of the money to take AHDL out of administration, the Administrators would not be able to sell Angel House.  </p>

In her evidence (above) Ms. Davey suggested that no-one in their right mind would pay £2 million without a guarantee that it would be “safe”.

However, for the Administrators, having regard to the interests of the Company and its creditors (including Dunbar), this was unacceptable.  The Administrators would have halted the sale process of Angel House and risked losing the purchasers for the property without any compensating payment which they could keep if the refinancing did not happen and they could not obtain bids for Angel House at the same level again.  Moreover, the fact that Ms. Davey’s money would be “safe” would have meant that she would have no incentive to complete the refinancing in any particular timescale.  These points were well expressed in Pinsent Masons’ letter of 19 November 2013 to which I have referred above. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After Ms. Davey was unsuccessful in her attempts to interest various other financiers and people in the property industry to fund or enter into a joint venture with her, as indicated in the letters from Rosenblatt of 13 November 2013, and from Inland Homes on 15 November 2013, Ms. Davey had obtained the support of Mr. Wicks of Inland Homes for provision of about £18 million for her rescue proposal.  That support appeared to have been obtained through Mr. Slatter of Olympian Homes who had acted as a liaison between Ms. Davey and Mr. Wicks and who attended the meeting with the Administrators on 18 November 2013.  </p>

Mr. Slatter indicated that the monies were available, but all of Ms. Davey’s advisers protested (I think justifiably) that two days for the equivalent of exchange of contracts was too short.  Mr. Slatter also indicated that the money was coming from a listed company which needed 14 days for its internal procedures and board meetings to approve the transaction.  Mr. Clarke and the other advisers sought a similar period for due diligence.  </p>

By return, Pinsent Masons responded, refusing to give an undertaking not to exchange contracts for sale of Angel House, but indicating that such exchange would not in reality take place before Wednesday 27 November 2013, and was more likely to be later that week. </p>

What appears to have occurred is that after the meeting, Inland Homes withdrew its support for Ms. Davey.  Mr. Slatter then approached Mr. Livingstone of L&amp;R to take Inland Homes’ place, but Ms. Davey decided to take her own course and to seek finance from Mr. Eastwood to whom she had been introduced in the meantime.  Ms. Davey and Mr. Slatter then parted company.  Mr. Slatter obtained the initial support of L&amp;R for Olympian Homes’ own bid for Angel House, whereas Ms. Davey tried to arrange matters with Mr. Eastwood.  </p>

That picture, which is set out in some detail in the chronology above, tells a very different story from Mr. Eastwood’s witness statement.  In my view it shows that far from being uncommunicative or unreasonable in setting “impossible” timetables, the Administrators were in regular contact with Mr. Eastwood and went out of their way to assist him to perform his due diligence and commit the necessary funds to Ms. Davey’s proposal.</p>

In return, as the chronology shows, Mr. Eastwood lied on a number of occasions to the Administrators about his instruction of solicitors and the transfer of the deposit to them, he showed no signs of having finalised his due diligence, and no solicitors had been properly instructed to produce the necessary legal documentation for his loan to AHDL.  </p>

He must not simply allow another person to dictate to him how he should exercise his powers as administrator.  Nor should he unquestioningly act in accordance with the wishes of another.  These propositions are an obvious consequence of the fact that the office of administrator is a personal office under the Insolvency Act 1986 and the relevant authority and statutory powers are given to the administrator and not anyone else.  They are also consistent with the general principles that govern the exercise of discretionary powers by fiduciaries: see e.g<span style="font-style:italic">.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Additionally, where an administrator seeks to sell an asset which is subject to a charge, further statutory considerations intervene. An administrator is generally authorised to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge as if the assets were not subject to that charge: see paragraph 70(1) of Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act.  He is not, however, generally authorised to dispose of assets subject to a fixed charge unless the charge-holder gives its consent to such a disposal.  The rights of the fixed chargeholder can be overridden by the court granting an order under paragraph 71(1) enabling the administrator to dispose of the property as if it were not subject to the fixed charge, but only if the conditions set out in paragraph 71(2) of Schedule B1 are satisfied, and then only on terms providing for payment of the proceeds to the fixed chargeholder together with any additional amounts necessary to produce the amount determined by the court to be full market value: see paragraph 71(3).  As such, a sale by an administrator of a property subject to a fixed charge will necessarily require the administrator to seek the consent of the holder of the fixed charge to that disposal or to make an application to court if consent is not forthcoming.</p>

However, I have also indicated that I do not think that there is any evidence that any antipathy that Mr. Sandall might have felt towards Ms. Davey (or Mr. Daniel) from about 1 February 2013 had any, or any material, effect upon the decisions taken later in the administration.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also dealt with the issue regarding the selection of APAM to act as asset managers for Angel House and advisers in relation to the marketing and sale of the property.   I have concluded that although the selection of APAM as asset managers was at the instigation of Dunbar, that was not, of itself, inappropriate in circumstances in which it was believed that APAM were suitable for the job and that the value of the property was likely to be materially less than the amount owing to Dunbar.  I have also concluded that the reliance placed by the Administrators upon APAM in relation to the marketing and sales process was a decision that could have been reached by a reasonable administrator.  There is, moreover, no indication that Mr. Money’s decision to continue to use APAM for these tasks was the result of any instruction from Dunbar.  Mr. Money’s favourable views of APAM were, I believe, genuinely his own and not influenced by Dunbar.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also considered the reasons why the 2012 planning application was allowed to lapse.  It will be recalled that although the initial proposal had been to continue with the 2012 application, and indeed that was the view of the Administrators, APAM and Mr. Stenson for some time, concern was expressed within Dunbar in April 2013 as to whether continued pursuit of the 2012 planning application was cost-effective.  Those concerns prompted APAM to review its advice and led to it changing its recommendation to Dunbar and the Administrators in its memo of 17 May 2013.  That in turn led eventually to Mr. Stenson changing his recommendation to Dunbar’s RMRC in his memo of 3 July 2013. The RMRC eventually decided at its meeting on 10 July 2013 to abandon funding support for the 2012 application in favour of a twin-track approach of soft marketing and beginning to plan and engage professionals for a new revised detailed planning application.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, I think, true that the Administrators seem not to have questioned this decision of Dunbar.  Although the Administrators were pushing Dunbar for a decision on the future of the 2012 application during May and June 2013, there is no evidence of separate consideration of what to do by the Administrators, and it was not until 16 July 2013 that the Administrators met Dunbar and APAM to consider a revised course of action.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I do not think that this shows that the Administrators had wrongly abandoned their discretion to Dunbar.  As I have already found in relation to the allegation of failing to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances, in my view the approach of the Administrators simply reflected the reality that the Administrators had no separate source of funding with which to finance the continued pursuit of the 2012 application, and Dunbar’s decision as to what it was prepared to fund was not one over which the Administrators had any control.  After Dunbar’s decision had been made, however, the Administrators were then involved in the decision to commence soft marketing whilst seeking indications of interest from professionals to work on a new planning application, as discussed at the meeting on 16 July 2013.</p>

After the initial offers are in, we will be ensuring that we have evaluated the different bases used by interested parties, and there may be further opportunities for the highest bidders to clarify their offers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that Mr. Davies’ criticism of Mr. Money’s evidence in these respects was misplaced, and I think that Mr. Money’s emails and evidence were essentially accurate.  Angel House was subject to a fixed charge in favour of Dunbar, and for the reasons that I have explained, any decision by the Administrators to sell the property necessarily required Dunbar’s consent or a court order to be obtained under paragraph 71 of Schedule B1.   Given the level of offers which were being made, it was inevitable that the Administrators would have to consult Dunbar and seek its consent to the sale.  The Administrators could only have felt able to proceed regardless of whether Dunbar consented if the price offered would have enabled Dunbar to be repaid in full from the proceeds so that a court order could be obtained.  On the basis of the offers received, that was not the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the process of seeking offers itself was concerned, I consider that the Administrators were acting with sufficient independence of mind and were not unthinkingly doing what Dunbar wanted.  That is illustrated, for example, by the answers given by Mr. Powell to Mr. Clarke on 5 November 2013 as regards the nature of the sales process.  These were the result of guidance given by the Administrators and not Dunbar.  Although Mr. Stenson was copied into the original questions and the final response from APAM, there is no evidence that the Administrators took their lead from Dunbar or even discussed their answers with Dunbar in the interim.</p>

That conclusion can be illustrated, for example, by the way in which Mr. Sandall wrote his memo to Mr. Money on 14 November 2013 after the receipt of Rosenblatt’s letter indicating that Ms. Davey was going to make an offer for a funded rescue of AHDL and seeking a suspension of the sale process for Angel House.  Mr. Sandall’s memo indicated that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Field of Rosenblatt and with Mr. Stenson of Dunbar, but the analysis in the memo seems clearly to have been Mr. Sandall’s own work, and he did not in any way suggest that he thought that the decision as to how to proceed was for anyone other than the Administrators.</p>

Mr. Sandall also informed Mr. Field (among other things) of the requirement for a 10% non-refundable deposit on acceptance of Ms. Davey’s offer.  Although Mr. Sandall had spoken to Mr. Stenson before writing his memo, I consider that it is clear from the tenor of the documents that this was Mr. Sandall’s idea and (contrary to Ms. Davey’s case) this had not been suggested to him by Mr. Stenson.</p>

Whilst the email ended by seeking Mr. Stenson’s immediate thoughts, it is clear from the penultimate paragraph of the email that Mr. Money’s view was that it was still very much an open question as to whether the winner of the process would be Ms. Davey, LBS or Capital &amp; Oriental.  Moreover, in response, far from indicating that LBS was Dunbar’s “Preferred Bidder”, or even giving Mr. Money a clear direction that he should be deciding to sell to LBS, Mr. Stenson acknowledged that the decision as to how to engage with Ms. Davey was Mr. Money’s decision as Administrator, and he sought to expand the group of potential purchasers of Angel House to which Mr. Money had referred, by expressing the hope that, “the other offeror, Guildmore, are also in the loop in some way”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, I would refer to the events on and after 2 December 2013.  On that date, Mr. Money received the final update of APAM’s marketing report and gave instructions that a draft contract should be issued to Cubitt.  However, he also instructed APAM to inform Ms. Davey that this had taken place and that in effect she had 2-3 days to trump the sale to Cubitt.  Mr. Money then went out of his way to engage with Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Clarke notwithstanding the very mixed messages which he received from Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Davidson and the absence of any proof of funding.  To my mind the evidence and the tenor of the contemporaneous documents demonstrate quite clearly that Mr. Money was acting independently in genuine pursuit of Ms. Davey’s restructuring proposal.  Mr. Money was certainly not simply acting at the direction of Dunbar, and Dunbar made no attempt to discourage him from so acting even though (according to Ms. Davey’s pleaded case) a funded rescue of AHDL would have frustrated a sale of Angel House to Dunbar’s “Preferred Bidder”.</p>

The solicitors instructed the defendant firm of solicitors to act for it, and paid the loan monies to the solicitors to be held on an express trust pending payment to discharge the pre-existing mortgage in favour of another bank (B) at completion.  In error, the solicitors paid an inadequate sum of money to B to discharge the first mortgage, and paid too much to the borrowers.  The borrowers did not use the extra monies to pay off the first mortgage, and the solicitors did not immediately tell A that it had not obtained a first charge.  The borrowers later defaulted and the property was sold, whereupon A found itself postponed to B and received a lesser amount of the proceeds of sale than it expected.  A sued the solicitors for compensation, claiming to be entitled to the full amount of its loan less the amount recovered.  The solicitors contended that A should only be entitled to recover what it would have received if the solicitors had done what they ought to have done and paid the full amount needed to redeem the first mortgage to B.</p>

The more important question in the appeal is whether Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Target Holdings</span> of the fundamental principles which guided him in that case should be affirmed, qualified or (as the bank would put it) reinterpreted.

The range of duties owed by a trustee include: (1) a custodial stewardship duty, that is, a duty to preserve the assets of the trust except in so far as the terms of the trust permit the trustee to do otherwise; (2) a management stewardship duty, that is, a duty to manage the trust property with proper care; (3) a duty of undivided loyalty, which prohibits the trustee from taking any advantage from his position without the fully informed consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries.”</p>

As such, I do not think that Lord Toulson was directing his attention to the question of whether the three types of obligations which he identified as being owed by a trustee were all properly to be regarded as fiduciary in nature, and I do not think that he intended to restate the law on the essential nature of fiduciary duties.</p>

He referred in particular to the dictum of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Merrett Syndicates</span> [1995] 2 AC 145 at 205 to the effect that although equitable remedies are available for a failure by a fiduciary to perform his duties with due skill and care, it does not mean that the duty to take skill and care is to be regarded as a fiduciary duty.

The only basis upon which AHDL might have suffered loss in that regard was if and to the extent that the Administrators were paid fees from AHDL in respect of the time spent by Mr. Sandall assisting Dunbar.  However, that loss was not pleaded or quantified and I received no submissions and heard no evidence as to it.

Moreover, although favourably received by the Council’s planners, the question of whether the McBains Cooper scheme would ultimately have obtained planning permission is uncertain.

If there had been any breaches of duty by the Administrators in relation to the sale, the measure of compensation for AHDL would be the difference (if any) between the open market value and the price of £17.05 million for which it was actually sold.</p>

I have already explained why, in my view, the evidence of Mr. Fenwick in cross-examination clearly exposed the fact that his expressions of interest in Angel House were without any financial substance to back them up.  He was, as I have indicated, simply chancing his arm and trying to get into a position from which he could then try to arrange a deal with funders.  I have also explained why, although Mr. Eastwood was apparently prepared to enter into a co-operation arrangement with Ms. Davey under which he was to provide up to £20 million by way of loan towards a funded rescue and in return would acquire 50% of AHDL, that was done at a time at which he had not conducted any due diligence into the present value of Angel House and had not secured funding.  In my judgment the deal done between Mr. Eastwood and Ms. Davey says little about the then current value of Angel House as opposed to the anticipated amount needed to pay off AHDL’s creditors and the costs of the administration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against such evidence, I would note that the leading bidders in the final round of the competitive process all ended up making offers that were closely grouped together at between £17 million and £17.5 million, which tends to suggest that this was the correct range of values which bidders in the market were prepared to pay.  Moreover, and significantly to my mind, although Olympian Homes made a higher bid at £19.2 million, that bid was withdrawn when its funder, L&amp;R, examined the financial calculations for itself and concluded that Olympian’s plan was “madness” and that the highest figure that could be supported was £15 million.  I was repeatedly told that L&amp;R were a serious and established participant in the commercial property market, and in my judgment their reported views provide a weighty counterbalance to any suggestion based upon the evidence of Mr. Connaughton that the true value of Angel House was significantly in excess of the price at which it was sold.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts also agreed that the appropriate way to value a property like Angel House is by way of the residual valuation method.  In essence, the residual valuation method involves working out the gross development value (“GDV”) for the most profitable development that the prospective purchaser thinks would receive planning permission, and then deducting from that the costs that would be incurred in financing and carrying out the construction, together with the developer’s profit, in order to arrive at a current net value for the land.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts did not agree on the particular scheme that a developer might have envisaged when performing a residual valuation.  Ms. Seal considered a number of proposals, but her optimum scheme involved a 55 storey tower without any hotel element; Mr. Forgham produced his valuation on the basis of a scheme including a hotel along the lines of the McBains Cooper scheme that was the subject of the 2012 planning application; and Mr. Wolfenden also based his valuation upon the McBains Cooper scheme, but increased his valuation to take account of the possibility that a developer would envisage getting permission for an improved scheme (which he called “McBains Cooper plus”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to their valuations, the experts identified the following possible components/inputs, although they were unable to agree upon the detail of any of them.  The GDV would be made up of the value of (i) the private residential flats, (ii) the affordable residential flats, and (iii) any hotel to be included in the development.  From the GDV would be deducted (iv) the construction costs, (v) any developer’s contingency for unexpected costs, (vi) any Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy, (vii) professional fees, (viii) marketing costs for the completed units and (ix) the developer’s profits. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of these inputs, plainly the most significant in computing the GDV of the development would be the value attributed to the sale of the private residential flats.  The experts differed significantly over this input.   Mr Forgham used a rate of £950 psf for flats in the McBains Cooper scheme; Ms Seal used a figure of £997 psf for the sale of private residential flats in her optimum 55-storey scheme; and Mr. Wolfenden used a figure of £1,055 psf as at November 2013 for the private residential flats in his “McBains Cooper plus” development.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To arrive at those values, Ms Seal used actual sales data for agreed and completed sales of apartments in Baltimore Tower which she considered (and no-one seriously disputed) was the closest comparable property to Angel House.  Ms. Seal had the advantage that she had actually been engaged to perform a valuation of Baltimore Tower and had access to extensive sales data from November 2013.  However, she gave evidence, which I accept, that a serious bidder in the market at the time would have also been able to obtain access to much of the same data through contacts at agents and developers at the time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms. Seal extrapolated her data across all the units in the scheme and made appropriate adjustments in order to take account of the relative values of the different apartments due to height, arrangement, size and date of sale.  She then chose a floor at random (floor 24) which produced an average value for the flats of £954 psf.   Since Ms. Seal considered Baltimore Tower to be a materially better proposition to Angel House in terms of location, accommodation and amenities, she applied a discount to that price psf to derive values for Angel House.  She considered Angel House to be 10 to 15% poorer, but reduced the discount to 7.5% to take account of the fact that such differences tend to narrow in a rising market.  Ms. Seal then applied her resultant value psf for her sample floor 24 throughout the proposed development at Angel House, taking account of the fact that values tend to increase 1% per floor with height.  This produced an average value of £997 psf for her optimum 55 storey scheme for Angel House.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Davies criticised Ms. Seal for not showing all of her data or her calculations in her report.  She did produce her underlying data during her cross-examination and also fairly accepted that to check all of her workings one would also have to have access to a detailed floor-plan of Baltimore Tower.  The specific criticism made of her computation of the average value of £954 psf for floor 24 of Baltimore Tower was that it was too low.  Mr. Davies contended that the market was “hotting up” towards the end of 2013 and the sales that had completed nearer in time to December 2013 had been for more than that value, so the use of earlier comparables effectively depressed the average.  Ms. Seal readily accepted that the market was rising and that it was a good time to sell flats, and dealt with these points in this way,</p>

I also reject the criticism of her resultant average value based upon the selection of the two later sales of flats from her sample floor 24.

It seemed, however, that at least one source for his work had been the comparables included in the Savills Report from late 2012, and that the key assumption that he had made was that comparable flats to those in the proposed Angel House development would have had an average “base” value of £900 psf in March 2013.  </p>

The value as at November was looking at what the hypothetical purchaser would have paid, because that is broadly the date upon which offers were received and accepted, and in that case they would have been looking at the site without planning, but forming a view as to what they could build on the site. I formed the view that you would get the McBains Cooper scheme plus.  That was my professional judgment, and that was my view.

Indeed, everywhere else in his report Mr. Wolfenden had expressly assumed a minimum requirement of 35% affordable housing would apply.  Likewise Mr. Wolfenden had also not attempted to evaluate how adding an additional eight floors to the building would also increase the construction costs, which represent the most significant deduction from the GDV in the computation of residual land value.  Ms. Seal’s report, for example, put the costs of building a 55 storey tower at over £101 million, compared with Mr. Wolfenden’s estimated costs of £87 million for a 47 storey tower.</p>

I do not accept that Mr. Wolfenden’s resort to “valuer’s judgment” provides any meaningful explanation for what he was doing.  He accepted that he had no idea whether the appropriate uplift would be 5%, 10% or 15%, and he provided no justification for his choice of 8% other than the meaningless observation that it “seemed correct at the time”.  Specifically, Mr. Wolfenden did not explain why a 3% uplift for the factors he had identified in the “McBains Cooper plus” scheme presumably “seemed correct” at the time he wrote his original report, but that by the time he actually came to give evidence, it was an 8% uplift that “seemed correct” to account for precisely the same factors.</p>

He explained this on the basis of forecast capital growth and the added benefit of the expected launch of Crossrail in 2018.  That gave him a gross development value of some £243 million.

So, for example, as well as making the broad  assumption that there would be a very significant (42%) increase in the sale value of the residential flats, Mr. Wolfenden also assumed that all of the residential flats would be sold at the end of the development.  He acknowledged in his report that the reality would be that a significant number would be pre-sold off plan at an earlier date (when sales values would be lower) but he was forced to accept in cross-examination that he had not allowed for holding costs associated with those that were not pre-sold and could only be sold after completion.</p>

Moreover, the developer’s profit on cost projected by Mr. Wolfenden in his computation appeared, for reasons that were not explained, to be over 60%, compared with the more normal 20% for his appraisal in November 2013 and the 20% which was identified in the body of his report.</p>

He owes a duty to use reasonable care to obtain the best possible price which the circumstances of the case permit. He owes this duty not only to the company, of which he is the agent, to clear off as much of its indebtedness to the bank as possible, but he also owes a duty to the guarantor, because the guarantor is liable only to the same extent as the company. The more the overdraft is reduced, the better for the guarantor. It may be that the receiver can choose the time of sale within a considerable margin, but he should, I think, exercise a reasonable degree of care about it. The debenture holder, the bank, is not responsible for what the receiver does except in so far as it gives him directions or interferes with his conduct of the realisation. If it does so, then it too is under a duty to use reasonable care towards the company and the guarantor.”</p>

In contrast to his powers in relation to property subject to a floating charge (paragraph 70), Schedule B1 gives no power to an administrator to dispose of or take action in relation to property which is subject to a fixed charge.  The administrator can only do so with consent of the holder of the fixed charge or if he obtains a court order under paragraph 71 of Schedule B1, which contains its own provisions for ensuring that a proper price is obtained and that the interests of the chargeholder are protected.  That structure accords with the fact that the appointment of an administrator does not prevent the holder of a fixed charge from seeking to appoint a receiver to deal with the charged assets independently of the administrator, albeit that such power is restricted by paragraph 43 of Schedule B1, and can only be exercised with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the court.</p>

In that regard, I accept Mr. Davies’ submission that it is difficult to see any, or any convincing, policy reason why there should be any difference between the position that applies if the sale of the property were to be conducted by a receiver or an administrator.  Whether Mr. Smith’s submission that the statutory agency is not capable of being displaced in respect of other steps taken in the administration, or in relation to sales of property governed only by a floating charge, are not matters upon which I need to express any view in the instant case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question then arises, what level of involvement by the secured creditor is required in order to justify a finding that an agency relationship has been created between the administrator and the secured creditor or otherwise to justify the imposition of liability on the secured creditor?  The formulation in the receivership cases, that the mortgagee might be liable if he “directed or interfered” in the conduct of the receivership, seems to be the appropriate standard.  However, this must require something going beyond the legitimate involvement that a secured creditor could expect to have in the administration process by reason of his legal status and rights.  The formulation seems to indicate that the administrator should either have been compliant with directions given by the secured creditor, or to have been unable to prevent some interference with his intended conduct of the administration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So, for example, I do not think that an agency relationship would be established merely because the secured creditor gave its consent to a sale of charged property which had been organised by the administrator.  Nor would that be the case simply because an administrator had consulted the secured creditor and taken account of its wishes, even on a regular basis.  Nor would such a relationship be established merely because the secured creditor took a commercial decision in the exercise of its own rights which necessarily constrained the administrator’s freedom of action.  But if, in contrast, the secured creditor gave directions which the administrator unquestioningly followed, or if (to adapt the example in <span style="font-style:italic">Morgan v Lloyds Bank plc</span>) the secured creditor misled the administrators or exerted sufficient pressure on them so as to defeat their free will, then I see no reason why the courts should not be able to hold the secured creditor liable if the property in question was sold negligently for a price that diminished or eliminated the value of the company’s equity of redemption.</p>

I have also found that the complaint in respect of Dunbar’s decision to cease funding the 2012 planning application was unfounded, because that was a decision that Dunbar was entitled to take in its own interest.

The issue therefore boils down to the same factual allegations that underpin the allegation of an unlawful means conspiracy between Dunbar and APAM.   For reasons that I shall explain, it is also relevant to consider whether the alleged intention of Mr. Connolly and Mr. Stenson could in any event be attributed to Dunbar.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In this way, it is alleged that Dunbar and APAM acted in furtherance of a common design, namely, that the administration should be controlled by Dunbar via APAM to ensure that it was ultimately Dunbar and not the Administrators which decided when, how and in what circumstances Angel House should be realised as part of Dunbar’s co-ordinated strategy also to recover in full under the Guarantee.  Dunbar needed APAM to keep up the false appearance that the Administrators had their own agents from whom they were taking appropriate independent advice.  APAM needed Dunbar because it was with Dunbar that they had the on-going business relationship and from which APAM hoped for more lucrative assignments.  Together, they were able to interfere with the administration and to combine to achieve a sale of Angel House at a level which left an outstanding liability of the Company and Ms. Davey as guarantor.”</p>

There was, moreover, no evidence or even suggestion of when or how such an arrangement might have been entered into.  Nor was it put to either witness that their motivation for such a conspiracy was that they stood to make a personal gain as a result of the incentive scheme in operation at Dunbar if they could artificially suppress the sale price of Angel House so as to ensure that Ms. Davey remained liable on her personal Guarantee.</p>

The second broad point put was that a quick sale of Angel House enabled Mr. Stenson and Mr. Connolly to achieve their target for realisations before the year-end and hence to qualify for their incentive payments.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept the evidence of Mr. Stenson that recovering monies from individuals under personal guarantees is often far less efficient than maximising the value of sales of secured assets.  I also accept his evidence that this means that it would have made no business sense whatever for Dunbar to have had a target price of anything less than open market value for the sale of Angel House.  There was simply no sensible business reason why, at the start of the administration, anyone at Dunbar should have thought it desirable to concoct a plan with APAM to take steps to suppress the sale price of Angel House simply so as to retain the possibility of recovering from Ms. Davey on her Guarantee.  Moreover, by the time of the move to a formal sale process in November 2013 it had become very clear that in spite of the intense and costly litigation against Ms. Davey, Dunbar had not made any recovery on her personal Guarantee and although Ms. Davey seemed to have assets in other jurisdictions, there was no prospect of any recovery in the short term.  In those circumstances there was absolutely no sensible reason why Dunbar should have thought it in its interests to obtain any less for Angel House than its full market value.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point to make in that regard is that the timing simply does not work.  At the start of 2013, by which time, according to Ms. Davey, the conspiracy with APAM must have been hatched so that the sham Value Enhancement Incentive Fee had been agreed, Angel House was not included in either Mr. Stenson or Mr. Connolly’s redemption targets for 2013.  At the start of the year, Angel House was included as an objective under the “asset management” heading for both men for 2013.  I therefore simply do not understand why either man might have been motivated in early 2013 by the thought of meeting his targets for the year ahead to enter into a conspiracy with APAM in relation to the sale of Angel House.</p>

Mr. Connolly’s year-end assessment mentioned Angel House primarily in terms of asset management, and the documentary evidence confirmed Mr. Connolly’s oral evidence that his redemptions target of US$203 million had been achieved by October 2013, so he had no need to rely upon the sale of Angel House for that purpose.  There was, moreover, no indication from the report that Mr. Connolly’s line manager, Mr. Gilmartin, had placed any reliance upon the sale of Angel House in giving Mr. Connolly the highest grade assessment (5) for bonus purposes.

However, I accept Mr. Stenson’s evidence that this was not something that would have made any significant difference to his bonus prospects.

Within Dunbar, it was the RMRC that had the final word on matters such as the appointment of APAM and its fees, the decision not to fund the 2012 planning application but to go to a soft marketing process in parallel with formulating a revised planning scheme, and in relation to the ultimate decision to sell Angel House to LBS/Cubitt.</p>

It is also obvious that they had no personal motivation artificially to limit the price obtained for Angel House.

APAM considers the market would amongst other things now appraise the scheme without the hotel element replacing this with residential and this would be reflected in a bid ‘as is’ in the region of £9 to £10m, however there may be a surprise bid in excess of £10m in their opinion. The downside of this approach is the timeline that it will take to interact with interested parties however this could be run in parallel with starting up the planning application again.</p>

Moreover, in my judgment there was no evidence to suggest that LBS were “preferred” as the buyer for Angel House for any reason other than the legitimate commercial considerations that APAM identified in its advice to the Administrators relating to LBS’s proven track record and its readiness and ability to exchange and complete a purchase.  </p>

Dunbar consented to the sale at that level.  However -- and nobody asked us to do this -- we said it is not to be accepted if the funded rescue comes off.  So Ms Davey and the funded rescue was provided with an opportunity to buy the company back,  and if Ms Davey didn't buy the company back, it was to the best offer, the most credible offer, which could be funded, was to be accepted.  That was Dunbar's view. And it is documented.”</p>

Whatever Ms. Davey might have thought at the time about whether Dunbar should have waited until after the sale of Angel House before seeking to enforce the Guarantee, it is perfectly plain as a matter of law that it was not obliged to wait, and Ms. Davey ultimately accepted as much in her cross-examination.  There was also nothing irregular in the judgment that Dunbar obtained and certainly nothing remotely resembling fraud that would be required to have the judgment set aside.
